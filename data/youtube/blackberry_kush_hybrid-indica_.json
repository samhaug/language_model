{"tEiB7EikRws": "I've smoked how you doing so is Wednesday is that time of the week again for another strain review and today we're going to be taking a look at that freakish this kind of restraint is amazing so I've had this now for a few days to sitting there waiting to be reviews it's like a quick little join out of it just so I can see what it tasted like it looks beautiful so I will show you what that looks like and we will smoke some of it as well and let you know how the effects of it it is a powerful indica known for its pain relieving the facts excited to review this for you guys and abut that I've got is almost soft wrapped around itself which is orange hairs I looked out from Leafly and that's in the genetics and it is pretty much purple really strong purple colors running through the whole but there's so much so but when you grind this up in the grinder it seems more purple than green which is fantastic and it just shows you the diversity of the wonderful cannabis strains though blackberry Kirsch is one to look out for if you want something different I have recently read that you can force canvas to change color when there's flowering when it's growing by subjecting it to different conditions this is one of the strains where it's actually in the genetics to be purple so worth noting that it is really different to most of the stuff that I have tried Wow so you get the earthy cushy smell coming through but you also get really fruity notes which obviously is partially the reason they're called it black berry coach almost the aftertaste of a ripe [ __ ] that sort of smell will get to me is what it smells like let's talk about the true job on this bit of but there are bits of popcorn leaf still dying around in this but however when you see a close-up of this and you see just how covered in crystals they are you can see why I mean this little bit Salif here to pick off that will go into the I smoke jar which will be turned into cannabutter but that's a lot of time to build up and these little strands and lift weight nets and nothing so you're not really losing out when you pick up a bit of bundle it's got its leaves on like that obviously it's not the sort of level you see with dispensaries are in America but for somebody is sort of grown this themselves as a project that is a great bit but and the development of the crystals and the formation of the button attest to that as well we're going to do a separate video at some point where we talk about the different colors of cannabis ranging from purple to green to black to red hues as well there's all different colors everything in between all the different shades within the cannabis plant and it's a lot rarer than the green so it's great to see genetics where that is shining and you can tell that it's not your everyday beer but according to Leafly blackberry Kirsch is a mostly indica strain mix of Afghani and battery strains it's got dark purple buds as we know with orange hairs a plants flower at between seven and eight weeks and on particularly high Yildiz which probably explains why you don't see more blackberry here it's not gonna be commercially viable to grow them unless you're doing it for yourself blueberry Kush tends to have a hashey jet-fuel smell definitely smell that and a taste that is balanced by the sweet berries and is often recommended the treatment of plain that thanks to the strong indica body effects so the things that this is gonna make you feel called into literally are relaxed sleepy happy euphoric and hungry do check out your Bible to see you can see on leafy that's always a good brief what we can do now is we are going to cover the taste and we're gonna roll a joint of the blackberry cush and show you how it smoked is the art smoke probably box probably pure as we do six days strong smoking no tobacco and absolutely loving it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm sure that that's gonna make me feel ready kids a nice indica wake up in the morning just got in from having a blackberry cush and wow it is a fantastic tasting bit but really really sweet that indica higher is starting to kick it now because I smoked it pure I find that there's a little bit of a lag and I start to feel the effects probably about 10 minutes later which is a little bit slower than when I used to smoke it in this blue with tobacco but for being healthier it's a much better option I am feeling good and relaxed and nice and chilled out it was my first one of the day so I'm not mashed although I'd normally stick to sativas in the morning I can definitely see the medicinal benefits of a string like this when you wake up especially if you're in any kind of pain or if you feel in sort of like you need to relax it's blackberry Kosh strain is a great option under night I forgot my hat in it and it went hi great London big up guys and gives gives to me rock in kinda friendly businesses here in the UK so I've been Tyler green check back next Wednesday for another straight review we release videos three times a week Monday Wednesday and Friday make sure you subscribe to I smoke on YouTube and check us out on the web at by slim Magnum code at UK we'll be back soon with another video keep Sookie [Music]", "TeOrdKzvVXo": "[Music] what's up guys it's time for another cannabis critique and this is a good one so welcome today we're talking about blackberry kush this one was grown by revolution and i was super excited to finally get my hands on some revolution flower they've got a very very good reputation in here in illinois and they definitely definitely lived up to it with this one this strain comes in at 23.2 percent thc it is a cross of afghan and blackberry excuse me just ate some donuts let's get into it the look of this one was very very good the cure was just it was right on they were super frosty buds super super dense buds i mean these these buds were ultra dense they were almost like like rocks whatever you breaking them up almost too hard but it yielded a whole whole lot of smoke uh from each and every bud so i gave it a 9.4 on the look i mean it was just dialed in perfectly the pictures of it i have really don't do it justice i mean this is a very very pretty stuff the smell of this one it smelled like an orange peel to me i didn't get a whole lot of smell from the actual buds but then when i broke them up you got a lot of smell it was a super citrusy smell it just smelled like i was like scratching an orange peel super citrusy it was very pleasant smell i gave it a 9 out of 10 for the smell the break up of this one was exceptional like i said earlier ultra dense buds very little stem very little leaf i mean these buds were great i gave it a 9.3 out of 10 for the breakup now the taste of this one was the only letdown on this bud for me blackberry kush is supposed to be a very very flavorful strain but to me this one just tasted very faintly like a sweet and sour taste very very faint though i gave it a seven point eight out of five out of ten for flavor but that just that might just be me you know flavor is very very subjective so definitely recommend still trying this one on the high of this one was awesome it was the best part it was kind of like your stereotypical uh stoner type of high but it was a very good social high like i found myself not being irritated by stuff that would irritate me normally when i was smoking this butt very very relaxing a very big stress reliever and it gave you a nice boost of energy i think but it also relaxed you so if you wanted to sleep you could on this bud but if you don't want to sleep you can still be active i think this is a great any time of the day type of bud i gave the high a 9.2 out of 10. it was very good so overall this is a great great bud uh really nice high the flavor was a little bit lacking for me personally but it might not be for you so i definitely definitely check this one out blackberry kush from revolution i give it an 8.9 out of 10 uh overall so that'll be the highest score ever here on the channel at least so far so congratulations to revolution based out of chicago illinois if you guys enjoyed this cannabis critique be sure to like comment and subscribe for more", "jW0t_0l4WEo": "yeah wow oh yeah oh yeah good day daycare huh good day daycare huh now time to jump on me oh yeah yeah look who's getting so grown all right come on let's smoke weed well me smoke weed you watch me from afar how about that how damn humid it is man it's like 7 00 a.m time for some hot [ __ ] coffee anybody tells you not to drink folgers punch them in the face blackberry kush revolution cannabis afghani crossed with huckleberry now the kentucky bluegrass that we reviewed previously had half huckleberry so there's probably going to be like a similar nug structure but honestly a strain being named one word just afghani not even with my past it sounds ominous sounds mysterious what's gonna happen no but seriously the effects out of this one i'm i'm really most interested in but if it has a cool smell to it too come down wow so at first i thought it was floral [Music] not floral or herbal i want to say there's absolutely some berry terps off of that very nice pleasant but like true terpene content uh not really searching through a whole lot of nothing trying to get you something uh let's uh let's take a look at this huh we're gonna have like three to four knocks and they're they're beautiful man they have that same kind of how do i say it man i always say spiderweb but maybe i'm maybe there's a better come on yo come on drop down there oh [ __ ] dude i i didn't expect it to be that frosty i don't i don't know i'd it'd be difficult for me to describe the color when they're just so peppered with trichomes also i'm so [ __ ] colorblind [ __ ] [ __ ] son i'm addicted to this bean water no really i'm [ __ ] addicted man been sitting here literally just looking at these nuggets of blackberry kush from from the whole nug shape to really really looking down to it and seeing i don't know the leaves it's hard to describe man there's all these hairs there's all this keef um i i can tell you this it's been a long time since been this excited to like truly get that first feel of effects because [ __ ] man stream properties talking about fatigue relief one of the reasons i was like okay i can grab this and it'll make a decent wake and bake strain review for you guys i'm not exactly trying to grab freaking face off og crossed with a xanax bar you know what i'm saying and and head in head into work i'm not um however this this is gonna be a treat i'm glad you guys are here for it i just had to point out the grinder absolutely exploded it's not dry at all you can even see some of the plant material still tucked stuck to the teeth there and on the edges a lot of medicine in these nugs man i'm gonna do a first toke of the blackberry kush and of course the first rip for a thousand subscribers so you know i put way too [ __ ] much no no no no no no no no no no no hold on hold on please do not walk into the shot please oh [ __ ] oh the flavor is awesome it's literally moments after taking that rip a couple of things i didn't mention that the terpene profile exploded off of this thing once i ground it down a real lemon pushed through and we didn't have that on the first sniff however initial effects man okay all righty i had some coffee but i'm nowhere but i'm no i i had some coffee earlier however compared to how i feel off this first rib i'm so much more awake i'm really understanding that strain property fatigue relief it's there for the first hit of the day and especially a larger one outrageously smooth outrageously smooth um i was kind of worried about the old lungs it's the 1k hit man i don't want to like didn't even have to front anything it's it's it's super smooth a great flavor and i'm just i don't know dude i'm just [ __ ] exploding with energy but i'm i'm so [ __ ] stoned right now okay i think i finally have the shot to show you guys the textures you see how each nug is almost a little like razored like the keef isn't really like bulbous it's more i don't know man look at that son of a gun dude if i can capture some of the details in one second i've never really zoomed in this far because the distortion effect but you guys just gotta see this dude dude stop please she's like but the terps father the terps are exploding about five minutes post rip of the blackberry kush marvelous dude marvelous i don't use that [ __ ] word but it's here look at how i'm standing dude do you think i normally can do this or do do this started running more oh my god i'm sore but like already upon consumption this strain had me ready to stretch ready for maybe some self-care massage um [ __ ] man i'm um there's no like i'm not intoxicated but i'm so [ __ ] high can you understand what i mean whereas like you guys saw me after i hit super glue i'm like literally like i'm not able to like sense what's around me and [ __ ] not the case here he's got back home right getting back into that jar of the blackberry kush i have to point out this little little creaminess a little almost vanilla in there it's just huckleberry crossed with afghani you'll just be doing some voodoo magic up in here what's up literally the point of this shot especially on this top note a blackberry kush these [ __ ] are radio active in the light i mean there is so much there's so much keith on these bad boys look at that look at that man i just got the new eighth open look at the size of that guy on there is that not ridiculous in that previous batch y'all saw they were about five to six smaller ones so i mean just what yeah josh look at it i mean not only has this been just a such a pleasant smoke i mean was that just a [ __ ] wasp what the [ __ ] [Music] hmm what what no way that fits in there this is amazing okay well i didn't expect this i like just took the phone and like into the [ __ ] window on the ledge it didn't look like it was wow okay well [ __ ] man cool cool cool um i could maybe give a final thought on the blackberry kush considering i smoke so damn much of it um all-star smoke man all-star smoke smoothness off like off the chain i just ripping full bowls beaker not eight not a little bit of discomfort seriously um and i'm not the candidate for someone who can just blow the biggest bomb rips and not you know respiratory wise die right after um that in combination with this that afghani that half afghani in it voodoo magic voodoo magic going on there an effects palette that's so i don't know man there's very few effects that i've had that are just like this very workable non-sedating and not really like crazy cerebral either i think one of the main takeaways is that rev is really proving a a consistency here on the cultivators we've sampled i think we get a little bit of good a little bit of bad and some great sprinkled on top of that rev it's been a long time since rev has given me a product that i truly say like uh uh my money was wasted here i don't feel like it was spent well to uh rip this beaker hello moose my dog's name is not moose but i think midnight reminds me of a little mini moose so i've been calling her mini moose mini moo can you let me rip this here you go on that side whoa and you're here too cool guys hey hey family photo it's first rip first rip almost coughed dude is there any more [Music] dude like go get blackberry kush seriously first rip of the day beaker come on", "pRUcYVvUkBY": "hello stoners and stoners welcome back to stone alone today we're going to be talking about some [ __ ] today we're doing a strain review on a blackberry kush so i picked up some of those humboldt farms this still wasn't cheap but in california i would say this is on the more affordable end of things before you know there was top shelf but now there's exotic shell [ __ ] it's just getting crazier and more and more expensive with delivery and everything came out to be about 60 dollars this is in indica i gotta say the nose on this the smell was amazing in the bag it lingering out you know i would say this is a blackberry smell but i don't think blackberries smell very much you know like i've seen them in the wild and this is a very kiefy flower like i said i only have crumbs left but it's a [ __ ] on a keefe so i'm gonna blaze that up real quick [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] very much this uh this tasty taste maybe i should search up this strain so lethally says herbal peppery and citrus pain management thanks to its body high effects it's a combination combination of afghani and blackberry nice it says it has a hashy jet fuel taste and aroma that is balanced by sweet berries nice nice nice relaxed happy sleepy euphoric and hungry i will agree that uh i got this hungry feeling from it i'm still feeling a little cerebral high i'm feeling a little goodness up there but it's not making my mind a race i'd say very good balance definitely been getting very high off it it's crazy seeing this level of weed again seeing just the [ __ ] ton of trichomes that is on here it's completely keefed up so many little pestles all right listen we gotta pay the bud tender so we got a sponsored segment the ganja berries wait a sec seriously thank you to ganja berry because otherwise i would not have been able to afford this weed these right here are actually made out of real goji berries from goji berries you can pack up to a gram and a half in here it's tasty and it'll have that slow burn best part these are actually pretty cheap i'm gonna open one right and you can use code stoned alone for another 15 off devlin check him out show him some love because that is how we acquired the cannabis for today's room jumping back into the blackberry strain cannabis infused dark chocolate bar with a hundred milligrams of blackberry and i'm gonna pull up the effects on that because it is a different strain blackberry is a mother strain of the blackberry kush so this is cool because i don't even realize ah it is raspberry cough crossed with the strain black domina and it's a buzzy and relaxing my tolerance has been pretty low and when i ate this hundred milligrams of course it started off a bit by bit like you know i'm really i'm just gonna eat one piece it's like i'll eat a few more pieces i'll eat the five pieces and then i you know eat the whole [ __ ] thing so before corova a different company used to sell thousand milligram [ __ ] bars and it would be like this giant scotch-a-roo thing i guess that's what you would call it and uh the whole thing was super strong so that [ __ ] was definitely the bang for the buck but i do understand why they cap it at 100 milligrams because i ate the whole [ __ ] thing you know and with munchies it's like you know it's a chocolate bar like obviously i want to eat the whole [ __ ] chocolate bar it's like really hard to just stop at one that [ __ ] is strong and there's so many memes about it that's the classic [ __ ] like oh these edibles and these edibles ain't gonna do nothing and then you know getting laid out by it it kind of tripped me out because again this is described as a relaxing high as a euphoric high but at just the highest dose like this it feels so strong in the head is like it doesn't really matter what strain it is it feels like this kind of sativa meltdown what's funny to me is every time this happens it's like getting too high or like you know even tripping or something it's in the moment i almost don't realize what's even happening because i was hitting my delta eight cartridge and i was just like damn i'm so [ __ ] hot i'm like this is crazy and then i was getting so high that i wasn't even thinking that i wasn't even realizing i'm just like what is happening like am i dreaming right now and like i just completely forgot that i even ate edibles i just wasn't even thinking about that i'm just like what happens like am i in between days am i in yesterday am i like about to go into tomorrow it was just uh it was really funny like being on that level so i just took a nap and kind of waking up during the nap and being like oh [ __ ] right i'm [ __ ] on edibles and i feel like psychedelics are almost easier to ride because in a psychedelic it's like it's crazy but you kind of ride with it and it'll change into something else it'll kind of like you know turn back around it'll loop but with an edible it's just like oh [ __ ] cause you know of course it's still just weed but it's just like a lot of input in the brain it's just like i wasn't able to just ride with it you know i was trying to go with the flow which is kind of like super powerful like trying to just sleep through it but then you know it's like halfway between the dream world it's a good time but it's just uh it's strong waves it's harder to just kind of like you know dissipate into it it's more just like definitely the blackberry edibles are very good smacked i was chapped i was very [ __ ] high and then i picked up some weight afterwards my uncle and i are convinced they're like is that edible you ate that weed and that's why you know like you got fat tasty stuff when i didn't know what weed i was getting and you know it still happens for sure that is one annoying thing is when it becomes super racy and you don't even know you just hit it it's like oh [ __ ] i like the strain because it is not that i find that sometimes with sativas it'll kind of like burn me out and then i'll actually kind of crash from the sativa and be very tired later later on so i'll pick a sativa because i'm like oh it's very energetic but then it kind of has a crash to it i like this indica i'm not feeling you know the gear is turning super fast i'm just feeling a good body high i'm feeling you know baked i'm feeling warm and generally that's what i'm looking for what i want to smoke you know as close to that as i can get that body and kind of hot great one i feel like for just chilling watching movies and [ __ ] for me like doing the editing not going too wild with it blackberry crossed with afghani kush well again shout outs to ganja berry they're the sponsors show them some love it's cool seeing these new companies pop up and this is definitely a fresh thing let me know if you want to see more strain reviews it is fun to delve into it because otherwise you know maybe i wouldn't have specifically looked out and tried some blackberry so i'm glad i did and this was a fun little experience especially having both the herb and the chocolate also yes this is the herb that has appeared in the stoned alone movies the upcoming detective trip as well as back in usa and this is a strain that i would recommend and come back to because it's very chill i'm feeling fantastic and i just finished it all so i would definitely love some more i enjoyed smoking this weed eating this uh chocolate i'll be seeing you around in the next time ciao and uh you know maybe hit that subscribe

medicine costs medical marijuana is a safe effective medicine that is never covered by insurance our goal is to help those with serious medical conditions afford the medicine they need today i'm discussing three medical marijuana cush strains that are all fruity indica dominant hybrid strains grape kush blackberry kush and raspberry kush indica dominant hybrids like these sweet cush strains are perfect if you need relaxation without the intense sedative effects of pure indica strains so let's talk about the typical effects and conditions commonly treated with these fruity cush strains to find the most effective medical strain that relieves symptoms without any unwanted side effects all medical marijuana patients should be knowledgeable about thc and cbd ratios strain types and the medical uses of all cannabinoids and terpenes in cannabis use the links in the description for resources and free downloads on all these topics to aid you in choosing the perfect medicine for you these strains described today can demonstrate effects of indica dominant hybrid strains the effects of any strain could vary per individual due to our unique bodies endocannabinoid systems and medical needs these strains can also treat more symptoms and conditions than those described these are just what patients have found them effective in treating the first indica dominant hybrid strain is grape kush grave kush is a 60 40 indica dominant hybrid 60 indica 40 sativa like many indica dominant hybrids it is relaxing and only mildly sedative grape cush is best used in the evening or before bed and is associated with couch lock the feeling of not wanting to get off the couch grape cush provides deep body and muscle relaxation and can relieve symptoms during times of rest and relaxation grape kush has a blueberry taste and musky smells it has 18 thc and less than 1 cbd making this an 18 to 1 thc to cbd ratio that will produce euphuria patients have successfully used grape kush to treat stress muscle cramps muscle spasms spasticity anxiety depression migraines headaches pain and inflammation but it is not limited to treating only these conditions grape cush would benefit anyone who needs relaxing effects body and muscle relaxation or improved mood appetite and sleep as well as nighttime relief of symptoms the next fruity indica dominant hybrid strain is pictured here it is blackberry kush blackberry kush is a cross of the strains afghani kush and blackberry this combination of its parents are where it gets the name blackberry kush blackberry kush has a hashy jet fuel smell and tastes like berries like many indica dominant hybrid strains it is very relaxing and best used in the evening as it is mildly sedative many people find blackberry kush will induce sleep it promotes body and muscle relaxation and overall calming effects that improve moods and appetite blackberry kush has 20 thc and 2 cbd this would be a 20 to 2 or 10 to 1 thc to cbd ratio that will produce euphuria it may be slightly less intense with more cbd than most high thc strains but blackberry kush is a euphoric strain patients have reported using blackberry kush to treat decreased appetite nausea pain inflammation sore muscles and joints depression anxiety bipolar disorder sleep disorders and sleep apnea however it could definitely benefit other conditions blackberry kush would benefit anyone who needs deep body and muscle relaxation nighttime relief improved pain sleep appetite or moods the final sweet indica dominant hybrid is raspberry kush raspberry kush has sweet fruity taste that contribute to its name it may be the least sedative and intense strains out of these three fruity cush strains raspberry cush promotes relaxed calm feelings that improve moods and appetite and may induce sleep but it is not an overly sedative strain raspberry kush is still best utilized to relieve symptoms during the evening before bed or during other times of rest and relaxation raspberry cush has 15 thc and less than one percent cbd with this 15 to 1 thc to cbd ratio it will produce euphuria that is less intense than strains with upwards of 20 percent thc 15 is a moderate amount of thc for flower strains generally the higher the thc percentage the more intense euphuria a strain will produce even so raspberry kush is still euphoric strain patients have effectively used raspberry kush to treat spinal cord injuries stress pain depression insomnia spasticity muscle spasms and multiple sclerosis but it is not limited to only treating these conditions raspberry cush would benefit anyone who needs nighttime medical relief improved mood appetite or sleep and deep body and muscle relaxation with calming effects these strains demonstrate the typical effects of indica dominant hybrid strains but it is always important to consider the complete cannabinoid and terpene profile and individuality of each strain choose a medical strain that has cannabinoids and terpenes

got my hands on some blackberry kush from revolution a cross of an afghani land race and huckleberry let's check this stuff out stuff looks pretty damn good as always from revolution it's frosty good nug structure a really good grind down consistency and a lot of fluffy and smokeable medicine in there with minimal stem i'd give it a nine out of ten i would probably be more enthusiastic about this strain if i had never tried revolution flower before it doesn't quite reach the elite level of looks that some of those strains they have just seem to to do but this one is no slouch this stuff is another member of a pretty decent slew of revolution strains i've tried recently where the aroma is just really subtle and ultimately faint and disappointing for me you get a little bit of tartness a very very faint citrus pine on the breakdown and an overall dull floral aroma i'd give it a 7 out of 10 for smell it doesn't smell like hay or like it's overly dry it just smells like it has low terp volatility for sure the crescendo from nature's grace that i tried not too long ago and did a review on was a similar smell to this one but that one was way stronger and more nuanced to that one not much to write home about taste either i did get a little bit of hay and soil like flavor initially so i did some home curing and that did improve the flavor to have a little bit of a smoother smoke and a little more floral and citrus nuance to it the smell never got much stronger for me just to to go back to that category for a second but ultimately flavor-wise it was a pretty harsh smoke still very faint and not memorable at all flavor-wise i'd give it a 7 out of 10 for taste it honestly feels like i'm repeating myself in a lot of these revolution reviews but like many of the other low aroma and low flavor strains from them this one still packs a really potent punch i felt a heaviness of both my eyes and limbs upon smoking some of this stuff which later would consistently develop into like a mood boosting sedation and also inflammation relief was something i noticed as a side effect of this stuff a positive side effect let me re-emphasize though that gradual mood boost if you have depression or really any mental or emotional affliction or mental illness this gives you that boost to make life feel okay and puts a pep in your step i'm someone who often wakes up with high levels of anxiety not to get too personal here but using this in the morning was a really good way for me to ease into a day and feel medicated as i start my day it didn't interfere with my productivity and i was able to stay active and feel physically good when i was medicating with this stuff i'd give this stuff a 9 out of 10 for effects really a good high i can definitely recommend for physical and mental and emotional relief that's going to give this revolution blackberry cushion even 8 out of 10 overall this bud probably won't meet serious cannabis connoisseur's taste or smell desires because it's really faint in both of those categories but like i said the buzz is definitely worthwhile because it's got this simultaneous uplifting boost and bodily relaxation that uh really works for me medicine wise the buds are pretty they're sticky and they're dense um so there's not too much to complain about here other than i would love to see more aroma and more flavor i know that's sometimes a genetic specific trait and sometimes a a strain specific trait but i feel like maybe other cuts of blackberry kush out there and maybe even other you know past harvests from revolution of this very cut of blackberry kush i feel like based on other reviews i've seen this stuff historically has a little bit more smell and flavor to it um i'm talking about revolution specifically their cut of blackberry kush so maybe i just got a low aroma batch maybe it was less than optimal grow i don't really know let me know if you had the same experience with this stuff or if you had super terpy super super tasty black bear kush from revolution thanks as always for all the love and support to this channel and i look forward to chatting with everyone as always in the comments stay safe everybody", "qrSDFZNt-to": "there is no denying the growing popularity of vaping pot in fact it's so popular the sales of marijuana oil cartridges used for vaping they've soared 400 percent between 2015-2016 so in one year quadrupled vaping has made marijuana use more discreet it's more convenient and it's free from the STONER stigma attached to smoking weed but and this is why we're talking about the jury's still out when it comes to the safety of vaping marijuana some studies suggest doing so may be toxic dr. sue Sisley the president of Scottsdale research institute they do conduct clinical trials on marijuana she joins us now on these findings and I'm glad we're talking about this because I will openly may I don't know about the three of you but the whole concept of vaping with cigarettes we understand but I am oblivious to the health consequences benefit whatever it may be when it comes to this so people think it's healthier but maybe not so fast you're right we don't have any data about the safety of using or vaping these marijuana oils and those cartridges up there are great exact Emma Colette when exposed to heat these chemicals can turn into formaldehyde so you talk about propylene glycol yes so you're more concerned about the additives then the marijuana oil itself exactly right yeah these chemical additives have never really been tested for safety the FDA has confirmed that they're safe for consumption but just because it's safe to eat doesn't mean that it's safe to heat up and inhale it's a different story and the fact is if there's all these flavoring chemicals in there as well you know these they try to add flavors to the cartridges to make them more palatable but what happens is that those flavoring chemicals have also never been tested and for heating this is part of the concern as well is that they look more glamorous so again it really reduces that stigma it makes it seem like it's a really fun kind of upscale thing to do right safe um and it popularizes it which i think is part of the problem right until we get more data I mean what's the take-home here for for people that are that are vaping on a regular basis the good thing is you have all kinds of other options now in these regulated markets we have the opportunity to vape natural flower so if you can find you know the the actual plant material that's not been grown with pesticides which is a common now because we have the the newly legalized states I'll have you know required lab testing so they don't allow products to the shelf with with pesticides or other chemicals but the problem we have is these older states you know the states like California Arizona Michigan that legalized marijuana years ago they did not require lab testing that's why it's so important that you're notifying your viewers about this issue because they can still find these vape cartridges so I just so I understand this if you're in say Colorado and you are a recreational marijuana user where you can go into a store in virtually any city and purchase it vaping there is in your opinion probably safer because they've actually tested the chemical additives that's right yeah and that's what we're trying to do with all these legal medical cannabis states is force them to lab test all of their products so that we can make sure to protect patient safety because you know the issue is that they could be picking up a product that does have these chemicals and and so I'm grateful that you're alerting your your viewers to this because they can avoid this they can pick up a vape cartridge that contains nothing but the what nature put in the plant now that would be the ideal situation pick up current and eventually these cartridges will not be bought by people when consumers get smart about this they'll bypass those products and eventually they'll go away I want to ask you this off the cuff because marijuana legalization is so new people who are naive to it maybe they go to one of these states where it's legal and like you know what I want to try it and they have the option between smoking marijuana the old-fashioned way they have edibles of a whole host of different types of edibles they now have vaping as an option in your opinion what would be the safest method well you touch on you know two big public health problems right are the overuse of edibles and the excessive vaping of these oils I mean the truth is these oils are hyper potent some of them contain 70 to 90 percent THC so people can easily get intoxicated on them so the key is always start low and go slow yeah - and that is buyer beware", "2ohfmsuemMM": "all right so today we got the greenbox christmas grinch review cookies hybrid it's just gas as i heard so i'm gonna try this see if it tastes good or not uh that already tastes like the cards way back in the day when they were just like super good this just reminds me of that now i'm excited to smoke this 10 out of 10 i recommend find this from your local plug", "ksKy1_Km69g": "hey guys what's up my name is Manny tree and this is recreational 420 or we give you the most in-depth reviews as efficiently as possible and today we're gonna be checking out this blackberry Kush by Cola bear hop right into the numbers so THC a comes into 20.2% with the total THC coming in at eighteen point five total CBD is that one point one percent and that's about it let's go ahead let's see what else I got so yeah that's it so I'm gonna go ahead and open this up actually this is the first bud review that I do for a Cola bear product so we should talk about the packaging a little bit I do like the way it looks I wish the green was maybe a little bit like brighter but it looks really good I like the fact that like it's branded all the way around it's not just a sticker on a mylar bag it just shows the attention to detail so with that let's go ahead and dump this thing out on the table for you guys I should have made this a little bit easy so let me go ahead and zoom in right away so first off you're gonna notice that this stuff does have some crystals in there you can really tell it's full of resin though it has lots and lots of like gooeyness the density wise this is really dense it sticks to my finger when I squeeze it it doesn't just turn into a bunch of dust let's see what this smells like as far as the smell you do get a tiny little bit of like actually I take that back you get quite a bit of like fruitiness a little bit of like a berry full of not flavor but a berry kind of scent to it and a tiny underlying kind of muskiness also in there so this does smell pretty complex for being you know an outdoor grown plant with that I am really excited to go try it and I'll be back again with you guys in a couple of days to let you know [Music] so I wanted and tried that blackberry cushion as far as the flavor is concerned it really just has this really nice kind of sweetness on the way in on the exhale you don't get a whole lot of flavor but it is a really smooth hit all the way through the sweetness really only lasts through about the the first three to four hits out of the bowl something else that is noticeable about this is that it does kind of burn for a while sometimes when you get bud if it's too dry it's gonna have this thing where you just kind of burn through the bowls really really fast this thing you get quite a bit you get a good you know a amount of miles I'll say it out of a bowl on this one just because it's not that dry it has a nice it's really full of resin as you guys saw in the beginning of the video as far as the highest concern this thing is a knockout I was really really surprised especially at the price point to get something that actually kind of puts you on your ass to the point that as you guys know I don't typically smoke during the day but when I do I try to have something that isn't gonna throw me for a loop this was something that you know I was like you know it's it's just outdoor wasn't gonna do to me so I sat there I smoked a bowl and then by the time I was done my eyes were nice and like tired I was like oh man this is a pretty heavy indica and it kind of took a lot of my motivation for the day so just something to take note if you are a newbie to cannabis I'm not telling you to stay away from it but I am saying make sure that you're done doing whatever it is you have to do for the day before you do end up smoking it so with all that if you guys enjoy what I'm doing go ahead and hit that sub button if you're watching this on Facebook make sure you follow the page this has been recreational 420 and I'll be back again with you guys soon [Music]", "gIbQkF4NaZw": "hey Mick dank cannabis review when I got another great

is so but it smells great it's super crystally it's got nice on chairs however it's not really purple it's got no purple in it like I usually I'm used to seeing blackberry kush investment it does smell like some sweet berries but so this is a mostly indica and this is going to be a blackberry cross with Afghani Kush that's the blackberry kush now a blackberry itself is a black domina and a belief strawberry cough so that's that's blackberry itself and they mix it with the Afghani Kush to get the blackberry kush and it comes out tasting pretty sweet pretty very pretty you know just pungent mmm smells great i love it so i'm going to pick this one pick this one we go in there so you go all right blackberry push the barest of the berries or one of them at least uh-huh so here we go first round huh it's definitely got like a sweet it's like this sweet taste with uh with a little bit of a berry hint as the you exhale which is really good taste great and terpenes are definitely on point with the string that's good that's really good definitely an indica yep so within because you're going to get more of the sleep more of that if you're having appetite problems more of the it's more of the PM type I always tell people sativa is more your am your hybrids are kind of you know in between the day more towards the night time than your indicas like before you're going to bend p.m. so that's kind of how I always tell people how the indica versity Oh words I am vers p.m. but I'm loving this blackberry kush and twenty-eight percent it's probably going to be a creeper because I mean it's slowly the highest slowly sinking and it's not really it's not one that's going to hit you right away it's one of those ones that slowly sink in its creeper I don't think I'm going to kill this now it's got a little bit more of the berry undertone on that hit did that taste good as blackberry cuz usually does so that's why it's a lot of people's favorite and it grows great to grow scrape really does if I run brights got seven to eight week flowering time which isn't bad at all but anyway so this is blackberry kush twenty-eight percent THC that we picked up from mind right in

you take the wake-and-bake and do account which is the original name of the show so this week we went back to one of my personal favorite clubs basa also known as Bay Area safe alternatives it is you guessed it located in the San Francisco Bay Area but no it's a it's it's in the city of San Francisco and today we have some blackberry Kush it was at the very very top of the menu oh and by the way that address is one three to six Grove Street in San Francisco if you want to go to basa and buy some trees we got the top of the menu the indica of all indicas the black very cush my personal number one favorite strain [ __ ] remember that black very good is my babe whose face look at that face [ __ ] anyway six bong hits like I said blackberry cush is my personal favorite straining this this was done right if you do it wrong it's not it can be it can be hazardous when done right it smells [ __ ] it's not like a blue there's not like blueberry this or strawberry that or mango that it's got a completely different kind of berry smell to it it's unique earthy in a way and this particular batch started out as - back a snugs so they've now been broken down I can't I don't know if you can tell it's super frosty I've seen some blackberry cush this has a lot of purple to it this is a bit lighter but the smell is right on point the trichomes do Oh tons of trichomes is frostys [ __ ] even when you break it just falls right out of there you know smells great I mean it makes sense that it would be at the very top of the menu this is the only way I bought today unfortunately this is not a three strain episode attack from here on out we will be shortening the format we had gotten to the point we were reviewing to three strains per club per episode nobody wants to watch me talk for 15 minutes nobody wants to watch me smoke for 15 minutes at least in my opinion but so this blackberry Kush like I said it smells on point it's not super dark purple or not a soup a lot of color to this Frosty's [ __ ] get you high as [ __ ] it's at the top of the menu it is some top-shelf straight-up indica [Music] [Music] and this club usually gets good black very good if you see it on their menu

organization that helps medical cannabis patients with medicine costs medical cannabis is a safe effective medicine that patients need affordable access to all patients who need medical cannabis should have affordable access to it today i'm discussing three medical marijuana strains that are all cush varieties although there are exceptions to the rule cush varieties are usually relaxing as is true of these strains and indica blueberry cush and two indica dominant hybrids master kush and cbd kush i'll discuss these strains their effects and some conditions they treat so let's begin these strains can give you an idea of the effects strains with similar thc and cbd ratios and typical indica and indica dominant hybrid strains will produce all medical marijuana patients should be familiar with cannabinoids and terpenes and their medical uses thc and cbd ratios and strain types to choose a medical strain with or without intoxication that relieves their medical symptoms you can find links in the description and some free downloads that will help you in choosing the best medical strain to meet your needs this is the most important part of successful medical marijuana treatment the effects of these strains are what is felt by most users and could vary for any individual based on their medical symptoms and unique endocannabinoid system use these as a guide to find similar strains and always be familiar with how to choose the most effective medical strain for you the cannabinoid and terpene levels discussed today are approximate and could vary between individual cannabis plants so always read medical marijuana labeling carefully the first strain is cbd kush this strain is popular among medical users because it produces little to no intoxicating effects cbd cush has an equal level of cbd to thc with a 1 to 1 ratio it contains about seven percent of each cannabinoid one-to-one ratios are good for people who need thc to treat medical symptoms but don't prefer the high of thc patients report little to no intoxicating effects with cbd kush as is common with one-to-one thc to cbd ratios one-to-one strains may produce very mild euphuria for some people but many report no intoxicating effects especially with strains like cbd cush that have fairly low levels of both thc and cbd seven percent thc and cbd is much less than strains that contain 15 to 20 percent or more of cannabinoids in general a 10 to 1 ratio of cbd to thc or higher will definitely eliminate all intoxicating effects of thc but some report a one-to-one ratio is sufficient to eliminate these high effects cbd kush is an indica dominant hybrid and like other indica dominant hybrid strains it is relaxing but still uplifting cbd kush is said to improve moods promote focus and creativity with body relaxation cbd kush has been noted as effective in treating stress inflammation gastrointestinal disorders anxiety and depression however it could treat other conditions as well these are just what patients report using it for high cbd strains are good choices for beginners young and elderly patients and as a non-intoxicating way to use medical marijuana the next two strains are high in thc and will produce euphoric effects the first strain is master kush it is an indica dominant hybrid that leans very heavy on the indica side at about 90 percent indica and 10 sativa this 90 10 indica dominant hybrid is almost like a typical pure indica it is said to produce relaxing and sedative effects but with a clear head master kush is slightly less sedative than a pure indica but still best used at night or when you are relaxing it may induce sleep like a typical indica strain master kush has 24 thc and 1 cbd making this a 24 to 1 thc to cbd ratio that will produce a high or intoxicating effects master kush was the winner of two cannabis cups it tastes and smells earthy and fruity patients have reported success in treating decreased appetite nausea pain inflammation asthma insomnia and anxiety with master kush but it could treat other conditions as well master kush is best for patients who need deep body relaxation improved sleep or mood and increased appetite the last strain blueberry cush is similar to master kush however it is a pure indica strain like a typical indica blueberry cush promotes deep body relaxation may induce sleep and is best used at night blueberry cush is related to blueberry and og kush to other popular strains blueberry kush has 22 percent thc and less than one percent cbd with this 22 to 1 thc to cbd ratio it will produce euphoric high effects blueberry kush has a berry herb taste blueberry cush can treat many conditions including nausea decreased appetite pain stress anxiety insomnia migraines and headaches and attention deficit disorder these are based on patient reports and it could treat other conditions as well blueberry cush could benefit people who need improved sleep appetite and mood as well as relaxing body effects these strains can point you in the direction of choosing similar strains and demonstrate the typical effects that indica dominant hybrids and indicas produce every patient will need to find what works best

stuff um it's a nice hybrid into the dominant I don't know how the genetics but definitely some bomb stuff these bugs are real dense no give whatsoever has a real nice pleasant sweet smell to it kind of like it's kind of has like a weird purple smell to it barry lake has a real nice light green look to it um that leaves or whatever the excess leakage is a little darker a little darker green or whatever so it gives it kind of a dark look to it and the hairs are pretty nice the kind of a light orange I definitely wouldn't say they're dark orange just definitely some high quality [ __ ] you guys can definitely see it to try it out it's intense stuff i'd give it probably a nine and a half out of ten it tastes definitely resembles the smell kind of has like an Isis it like not a citrusy ah sweet berry like smell drop my canon like that got a nice fast nap cheers guys definitely some potent stuff gives you a nice expansion", "NkiO6Fdtnxw": "hey guys what is going on today we're looking at another cartridge this time APO extracts or applo extracts this is a pretty new company black market company I guess you could say along the lines of glow or TKO or something like that but I think these are definitely a bit higher quality than at least TKO me I'd say they're tired of glow but this is the BlackBerry cush indica I really love the designs like the just the packaging is really nice and if you can see the kind of rainbow surface on there oh no I just like the I just like the design a lot on the back connect with this and see their Instagram written sideways right there I believe this QR code does not bring you to lab results it brings you to their instagrams so no lab results yet but I would love to see some because I have high hopes for these but if they don't ever do that results then the packaging is just it's very charming I'll show you what I mean when I can lift this get lifted and three two one blast off I'm presuming but I just think it's just very charming the way the packaging is set up even on the insides and this inner lip get lifted it's just a nice cut you know they didn't have to kind of just been a basic box with an empty inside but added a nice touch if you take a look at the cart itself can I have been hitting this quite a bit because it is honestly the best tasting cart I've had in a good while like this blackberry cush very lovely is it blackberry yeah pretty cush but some very it kind it kind of reminds me of a glow the in the flavouring perspec from that perspective it's just got a nice clean flavor not you don't get there like plasticy taste you know what I mean it's just straight blackberry cush and you can see that the oil moving is not like suspiciously slow like it's good going at a good pace not too fast not too slow the inner coil seems to be kinda thick oh it's looking a little thick don't know what that's about I don't know if these are like a point-7 like 700 milligram or something like that if you've ever seen Kali plug carts you have probably seen this little screw thing at the bottom here before but this one says APO yeah I would definitely recommend at least trying one of these carts and they have this I've never seen I've never seen this specific bottom thing like normally they're full fully encapsulated seems tiny but it's a nice touch they could have just put you know they could have just put this middle piece and called it a day but they added that extra tiny piece of rubber but I'm a definitely a big fan of these so far I'd like to see what they do I'm hoping they have you know plans to expand or something but they've got I believe they have like one one box of flavors so at the moment I know there's a lemon haze and there's a ghost train then you got a few other ones but I at least tried the other flavors all the flavors are as good as this then they definitely definitely have some potential in the game in the black market card game I guess you would say but yeah if you've ever tried these definitely let me know what you thought I got a ton of videos like this on my channel if you're interested and yeah so", "Jd6dPGAGbEU": "hi I'm the top shelf grower I'm welcome to episode 25 week 25 of seasons of outdoor cannabis I know it's nighttime what I'm shooting this early in the morning sleep is for the weak hmm no coffee no a spliff look cause I've been hmm about stations all week and it's absolutely paid off now it's time to show you guys the final four plants we've got your last look at the most purple cush you're ever gonna see and some two superstars sativas okay let's get through with folks here we grow hmm it's been a very very busy week fortunately there hasn't been any rains hasn't been any terrible thunderstorms but nevertheless - at the ready and I've been keeping unusual hours I've also been busy harvesting a couple of plants so let's pick up with blue coach berry the most purple specimen of the bunch and it is safe to say that this girl is incredibly dank and incredibly close to harvest get a load of these boards oh my god maximum frosted maximum purple tones and those beautiful orange hairs oh yes oh yes okay this week I promise is gonna show you my jeweler's loupe but I just couldn't figure out how to you know get a good angle with on the cameras I can't really zoom in any better on these trichomes than with the with the video camera or something I'm trying to get in under what you can see look it's totally frosted and I'm trying to hold a napkin in there at the error all on this particular plant completely milky had a try comes now I just I'll show you the actual jeweler's loupe in one of the smoke reports or maybe just in the next episode before we wrap it up so you know when I'm talking my book pocket microscope whatever you use was that is all you need you know to really get in there but at the same time you know your quarterly ball I'm gonna be honest with you because I've never come that's of course had so many so much frost that's how many orange airs and within at the end of week age and you know that wasn't dawn so this girl is absolutely ready to go so I've been just flushing it with the five milliliters per liter of coconut water and we'll just take it down here we have a look and the medium is not quite dry so I'm gonna clip her tomorrow wit her sister that has also produced some purple tones now not quite so rich the developments but get a load of these notes oh yes indeed you stuff so just a sugary and just as ripe and ready for harvest too so just a pullback week that Blue Crush Berry is a really killer strain that's one for definite I'll be growing this again pleasure to grow out of the whole lot of the easiest to grow most suitable in my opinion to the environment and the climatic conditions and definitely responded really really well to my experimental organic nutrient regime does it go admit last year was all about you know using the minimal amount of Canada synthetic a typical indoor nutrients and applying what I knew there outside this year starting off with the auto flaring plans you seen back in spring was you know taking that a step further okay seen what's the minimum we can do with the autos with those synthetic nudes but still got great yields okay then with this particular crop how can i integrate as much organics as possible and then finally make the switch where I'm just using organic products on a pretty much there now ladies and gentlemen so the next crop you see sometime in 2020 God knows where I'll be hopefully I'll be on the move applying for a lot of jobs internationally so anyone if you have received my CV take this video into consideration the mind knows how to cross course okay right now moving love and the purple tones don't stop get a load of this LA amnesia they can't you two just keeps on giving okay definitely the sugars and the frosty and fattest colors it luck quite possibly the pick of the litter if I'm honest it depends on the high now it's gonna take a lot to cut that new course very but this is in your direction swinging city but it's gonna be very uplifting as opposed to crack a lock and you can see no popcorn those few boards you say even the kind of stragglers I lollipop themselves just the top no bit so it's all lovely stuff and purple tones yeah that is now confirmed right this is what my hypothesis was going into it that it was the OG Kush if it's in the mix in their genetics and you got a bit of cold water then you'll see some purple tones and depending on how much of it is in there and if it is the real deal OD Kosh has been crossed in and you'll see because I didn't see it I'm a sense Easter because that's not cross that og cush and it didn't see it I'm a Mendocino skunk that's also that's not grass ecology cush but I think all these strains have a little bit of G caution including the atomic cell Hayes get a loaded up these purple tones super sugary nogs now these are actually beginning to rival the LM need very very frosty city without a paradise seeds folks and they don't take that long to flare get a load of this and we gate I reckon next week I'm gonna say now it's gonna be the last episode of the cultivation part and his series so there you have it folks say bye-bye to the blue coach berry been amazed so Colin time I'm eight weeks I'm furious flaring and that was nice you know eight weeks of adjective growth got your shooter mainline and that's another thing if you want to learn how to mainline yourself got a recommend this technique for all the kinds of growers indoors or outdoors want to get total control over your crop and the maximum yield only the top shelf colas that's in looking at a torchon yes absolutely I could have blasted all of these plants out with a variety of chemical fertilizers blown the boards off twice the size oh yeah I could have done that but it would have been fit for human consumption absolutely not why not gonna smoke it up that's another reason why you know I stay away from hydro if I can I'm not knocking it in a desperate situation as yeah as opposed to smoke and not yeah it smoke your highlighter

"L6XRFAEV0AM": "[Music] five strongest CBD cannabis plants trains for 2020 where tetrahydrocannabinol or THC is responsible for the euphoric high associated with cannabis CBD or cannabidiol is associated with the war mellowing effect CBD has also become popular for its alleged medicinal properties in treating mental ailments such as stress and anxiety consequently if it is legal for you to grow cannabis for your own consumption and you want a variety for medical purposes you hardly want a strain that leaves you with a massive brain fog and a sense of euphoria but can last for hours the following list is of our five most popular strains of CBD rich cannabis plants which are also referred to as medical strains at number five there is CBD crack auto which has a relatively equal balance of CBD and THC at around five to ten percent we like this one in particular because of its high heels fourth on the list is CBD critical mass which is an unusual name for a cannabis plant that is not designed for massive highs this is a genetic 80/20 ratio of indica to sativa which again provides a nicely balanced cbt to THC ration of once or one at between five and ten percent concentration at number three we have royal medic which can produce up to 12% CBD and THC at around 10 percent raw medic comes from two Spanish strains including one eater lacrimosa which is renowned for its purported medical properties and high yield in second place comes a strain similar to raw medic and that is CBD Otto blackberry Kush for those wanting to maximize the benefits of CBD without the excessive highs of too much THC this is one of the few cannabis plants where the percentage of CBD exceeds that of THC at eight and one cent respectively at number one and by far our best choice CBD cannabis plant is Auto cannabis light which has a remarkable 1 to 20 THC to CBD ratio with an approximate 0.5 concentration of THC yet an excellent 10 percent concentration of CBD it's a bit of a no-brainer if you are looking to grow a cannabis plant for medical as opposed to euphoric reasons perhaps you have a CBD favorite that is not on the list to let us know in the comments section below and of course if you

dankity dank miss but unfortunately captain coach couldn't join me today he has some things to do in private life but uh I guess all has to be this one but I don't see the problem with not I enjoy these videos myself this I believe you already know the name of the song the songs name is wrath and I forgot to pack the bowl that is not good I usually prepac bowls before the videos because Bowl packing takes a while but you know whatever I guess what was packing here but today it's another view the first nug review this this mega I have in my hand is called blackberry push sorry actually I probably won't turn out backwards but uh yeah it's blackberry push so this is one of my favorites personally it's in my top I think 5 i'm not sure but um almost citrusy almost and it definitely smell like blackberries that's for sure but honestly got very very nice smell to it it's like citrusy kinda sour yeah citrusy and sour unfortunately the camera I have at the moment sucks balls at close-ups on nug but I'll take a picture of this nug on my phone and Dolph link it in the description eventually so you can get an idea of what it looks like but anyway i'll look at it right now anyways very trico me very small hints of purple in here very small games not like her daughter nothing but definitely some purple too deep green with lots and lots of trichomes I mean this food wow it's like frosted in trichomes a little stinking up not too sticky so it's been tried out a little a little bit but um kind of like it that way overly sticky nut takes way too long to burn but uh ah there's that BlackBerry's not break that nug open and then you just get a rush of blackberries to the face I guess now I know what do they call it blackberry cush well anyway now we've done the smell and the overall look and pack this bowl real quick I'm not gonna pack a huge battle but I'll pack a decent sized one and [ __ ] camera oh so the next three categories are taste harshness and high so let's get right on with this very woody like take some bark and chew on that and that's kind of what the first case in life but then the aftertaste is earthy like like dirt basically the original blackberry I had at like some of the dankest case I've ever had like literally case it's like hikers but uh unfortunately i guess this batch was not grown too well so yeah definitely an outdoor grow and definitely growth at the grower did not take care of to proficiently fine neglected the plant that's not good but luckily the stone is still there that just that he didn't have good soil but he must have had good everything else it's very smooth at first it was a little tough because of course it's green hit and you're basically getting you know most th see that you're going to get until you packaging bowl so of course it's going to be harsh but after that first aid pretty damn smooth even for slightly larger ribs want to take a big hit just so I can see if this stuff really does kick your ass plus a little bit of extra just because I want to review it well cool just not cool um yeah let's just snap this home to see what what this weed is really made up Wow now that I actually took a somewhat decent hit I'm starting to get a better taste in my office no longer earthy actually I think that back it is still earthy but there's like a like a gasoline flavor almost victims like not diesel per se but gasoline so that's actually quite interesting it's definitely a sativa getting my head rush going just want to go do some [ __ ] right now I don't want to sit here anymore this review but uh I'll finish it for you so that was blackberry bush blackberry pitch well um harshness was virtually non-existent the taste if you take really larger like you know bigger rips you will get a better taste in your mouth but if you take smaller it you're just going to get that or a few days hi it's pretty damn good honestly very good sativa hi just yeah just want to go do some [ __ ] no couch lock starting to get some munchies going a little bit but uh yeah very good week anyway overall rating the smell was good overall looking this nut with excellent I'm gonna have to go with the good i'm going to say eight and a half on this snug almost 29 the snow gets just pretty [ __ ] dang that's okay you're telling you the way I can explain it great sativa you ever come across some blackberry kush make sure you pick it up because you're going to be wanting to pick this up you will get high from this [ __ ] no doubt but uh yeah that's the review and I hope you enjoyed the video so please rate comment subscribe spread the word about our videos and give us some input we want to know what you guys want we'll film just about anything as long as its pot related so yeah here's up with that too but until next time enjoy your medication peace out guys", "aK2j-9neSr0": "what is up guys it's your boy JD welcome back to another episode of THC and today not really like quite sure but we're gonna be just kind of discussing this ounce I got urban bud this anse went for a hundred dollars well I mean it's a little less than an ounce now I just smoked like not even a full bowl of it and then Instagram seen this first the like three point nine [ __ ] almost four grand back would so probably like maybe like twenty four twenty thirteen grams in there but picked it up back or not well technically like I picked it up my homie hooked it up so big shout out to Jay Quellin so this strain is called blackberry cream this was the bag it came in just felt like all the way to the top forty HCA it's 22.2% total THC 20.1 CBD a is point zero six and total CBD is point one there's one percent terpenes in there and total cannabinoid count is 23.92 so I'm gonna round that up to 24 so 24 percent [Applause] blackberry creams across between blackberry cache and cookies and cream it even lists some of the terpene profiles in the weed you can see that so that's the BlackBerry cream it's how a fire like you can see the trikes through the [ __ ] glass in the jar so basically I'm just gonna dump through it smoke it it's kind of a stranger view I guess basically just rate it overall or do all the basic Tacoma high club strain review categories and then at the end it'll just kind of be like would I buy the product again basically so I am gonna finish this bowl first and then I will load a fresh one so definitely hope y'all are smoking along doing whatever y'all gotta do to get medicated today [Music] still trying to get those canna pods I'm gonna be doing that review canna pods for the jewel but other than that I'm just gonna get down Cheers damn but on anyways I just wanted to take a before we like actually interviewing so you guys seen the close-ups basically the looks on this like I mean they it's covered in trichomes the really nice bright green with little hints of dark green leaves very little bits of orange hair looks on this I'm gonna give it an 8 because it is like kind of leafy but it still is like kind of neatly trimmed at the same time it's really fluffy like Ethan's this was harvested believe on the one year of December of last year so just a couple of months ago so this is still somewhat fresh cuz most weed that people begin from dispensaries is like harvested like last summer so a little little old weed but the looks definitely an egg sorry so how to repack that bowl but uh smell wise it is it has like most we'd should have that cushy undertone smell and I can't even really pick it up and like I can but I really can't because like the main smell I'm getting out of this is pretty much like a like a vanilla II like like a blackberry vanilla kind of smell that's what I'm picking up from it again if you're ever in the Tacoma Washington area definitely go check out [ __ ] urban bud couldn't think of the name for a second my [ __ ] close the door so I'm gonna have to take out the bowl today the bud tenders it's an indica hybrid but the the budtender said it was like on the heavier indica side if y'all [ __ ] with that hoodie go pick one up at war pony there's two locations in Tacoma go check them out the first location which is by world of weed and then the next one's like off of 44th and Portland but you know we're just gonna finish this load of bolt so it looks eight smell I'm gonna give that a nine not counting this for taste just because it's an old bowl y'all might get the double upload tonight blackberry cream strain review probably a STONER debate 5 stoner debate number 5 will pretty much just be like which like Rick little moolah great almost had [ __ ] Ritz for some reason which blunt wrap is the best to roll with that gives the best smoke so pretty much just what rap is the best and that's gonna be between light your swisher Sweets that includes like white owls jackpots like those basics like sweets and then [ __ ] you got your like hemp wraps you got your back woods and like pronto leaves in shape which I'm just gonna include in the back wood category so in that video will most likely be smoking this like third on the scale after I finished rolling it and it was like three point nine so that's [ __ ] it I love this fresh bowl and then we gonna [ __ ] get into this [ __ ] again the birthday's coming up it here in but now it's like a couple months so again if you guys can get me to 40 subscribers by May

possible and today we're gonna be checking out this blackberry Kush Terp sugar buy one of my favorites let's hop right into actually you know what let's talk about the packaging because they've revamped their packaging again so obviously this looks amazing it looks really good this is small like if you had to compare it to a it's about the size of a soap box essentially like pretty small so there's not a whole lot of like waste or anything still really pretty I love the designs as always this just looks like a high-end product like you're not upset that you're paying a little bit for this so with that let's go ahead and hop right into the numbers so THC comes in at ooh THC a 80.5 for THC comes in at 6.6 with the total coming in at seventy seven point three once again if you don't know why there's three different numbers for THC there is gonna be a video linked at the bottom of this towards the end that goes over that and I highly encourage you guys to check that out just so that you know what you're buying and why you're buying it and why the numbers are here otherwise if you don't care you don't care it is what it is with that I'm gonna go ahead and try to pop this open so this does have these weird seals here luckily I have my giant blade of death here also called a dabber ah there we go so I broke this head out of that see did that work alright so let me do this I'm so scared to cut myself right now like terrified I'm not gonna lie hmm I feel like there needs to be here we go it's gotta be a better way there we go so I'm gonna have to do it this way just because I think hey on the bright side LCB you know these guys aren't closing in their packages all the way a lot of fun with it at this point all right so there's the package and it's still kind of kind of pretty so this does have here's a label this is the inside it is labeled right there blackberry Kush this is something that I wish more brands would do and and then this is just a convenience thing for your consumers so once you take you know a package out of here out of there you know container most of them don't have the strain or anything labeled so when you put it in with the rest of your stuff it's just like everything mixed in together and you end up losing or you forget what some of it is this just makes it to where the consumer at the end of the day can just put this down know what they're picking up every single time and they're not gonna get so high that they're like oh man what was that one again dang and four companies and just guarantees it you're gonna get tagged on social media so don't forget with all that go ahead and pop this up let me zoom in and show you guys what we got going on so this is a Terp sugar you can tell by the sweat or the terpenes all that moisture that you see there it's just chirping so i'm gonna try to keep this here while i bring this up to my nose whoo so this is skunky and funky and sweet but it smells like if you've ever been in a grow room this thing smells like a brewery let me try to distinguish the flavor or the smells here so first of all you get a really nice strong skunky like pine followed immediately by this kind of like guava like sweetness ooh and I am very excited to go try that and with that I'll be back again with you guys soon to let you know how this works it's about time I do it it's about time I say this [ __ ] spend a lot of time on a waiting is roll up the dough [ __ ] and blazing [ __ ] who gonna give you love in the same is this a game girl I bring that [ __ ] I know you want the same last name as hell come be until I hear sorry yummy hey guys what's up so I went ahead and tried that blackberry Kush and as far as the flavors concerned it has this really good nice sweetness to it on the inhale on the exhale you get a little bit of like oh it's a berry flavor it's not necessarily black berry but you do get a very berry uniqueness there that you kind that very much stands out as far as the highest concerned this thing is a knockout it's one of those that you don't want to do if you're gonna have anything else that you have to get finished especially if you're a newbie something that I always like to like remind newbies about is the fact that if you're gonna take a concentrate it doesn't matter what you take if you're not a constant medical user you're gonna get floored almost every single time this one's gonna for you a little bit more than most is what I'm trying to say I guess so just take it a little bit easy if you are a newbie to concentrates outside of that have fun and let me know how it goes with that this has been recreational 4:20 and I'll be back again with you guys soon", "wCJWZK3hV9s": "what up and welcome to another edition of canopy where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased cannabis strain reviews so today we are going to be reviewing jenny kush by our friends over at abundant organics and check that out you guys so jenny kush is a hybrid strain that is thought to be a cross between amnesia hayes and rare darkness number two now jenny kush gets its name from a cannabis activist by the name of jenny monson who passed away in 2013 and this strain was bred in jenny's honor so let's go ahead and get this review started i'm going to bring it up on the screen for you guys and then we are going to check it out together okay so you guys just had your first chance to check this stuff out so i am going to pop the top on this abundant organics jenny kush and i want to talk with you guys about it so oh my god you guys like is if somebody lit off a sparkle bomb in this jenny kush that's what we'd be seeing right now because my god there are just crystals the size of baseballs on this bud and it's very very lightly lightly packed so it's not compact at all i'm gonna try to get out of the way and let the viewfinder focus on that but boy oh boy these crystals are huge and a great proportion of hairs and these are like not just thin little hairs they are thick orange hairs on this bud i mean it is man what a great proportion like from a visual perspective you guys this is a 10 out of 10 for me they trimmed they like a little bit of excess leaf matter and you can kind of see some of those excess leaves there on the bud that doesn't bug me a whole lot i don't think this was run through a machine which is the main thing an auto trimmer it was hand trimmed now let's talk about the smell okay the smell is really faint but it's sweet what is there on the back end is just really really sweet now this is like what is considered the reserve i mean you're gonna probably pay about 50 bucks an eighth for this bud and that's pre-tax so you know about 55 bucks after tax or 50 55 bucks whatever it's gonna be you know you're right in that top tier reserve tier so you know you i would at least expect for a top-tier strain to have like really strong pronounced terps just as soon as i pop that top and this is like a little seal you know so that should seal in the the actual freshness there i mean grow science does vacuum seal all of their jars which organic abundant organics doesn't do but i love these jars i'm just a little disappointed that the terps aren't a little bit stronger now i'm gonna tell you guys that i did already grind up some of this herb and that sweet smell like it just surfaced it comes to the surface it is not as strong as i would like it to be but boy is it sweet and it's not like citrusy sweet which i was kind of reading some other reviews of this saying it was like citrusy or like that lemon i'm not getting any of that i'm getting kind of just that fruity like cookies or like sugar cookies like type flavor but boy i mean that is a flavor that i like i like sweet that's not citrusy and more just on the fruity side boy oh boy so i am excited to try this out today you guys so today we're going to be trying this out of my arizer xtreme q vaporizer desktop vaporizer i have got this bad boy set to 375 degrees fahrenheit and then i have then fed that in to my scientific inhalations three filter or triple filtered bubbler we're leaving out the carbon filtration here because there's not going to be any ash in this brand new purified water that i just filled this stuff with uh oh you guys here the dogs are even excited now oh mama boy oh boy that's getting me excited kona and marley are going to party and i'm getting ready to party here so i have just cleaned this bad boy out we see there is just fresh as fresh as can be on this brand new organic cotton filter here and this is just gonna ensure that i am getting the absolute cleanest draw possible so that i can report exactly what these terps are like to you guys so without further ado let this can of pedia party get started okey dokey so that first rip you guys wow wow wow i got a lot of that sweetness and it's just faint but like this is actually some really smooth bud a lot a lot smoother than the last strain we tried that secret punch from abundant organics this is definitely got a lot better flavor and at least those terps are pronounced but i was just thinking as i was sitting and taking that first puff from now on what i'm gonna do i'm gonna take a little break right before i get started so that i can cue you guys at home watching along with me to fire up your js your blunts your pipes your bats your bulbs your bongs your dab rigs your vapes your pens whatever it is that you are puffing and chiefing on so that we can do it together you guys because this is one big community the cannabis community is all about peace love kindness and wellness and i will tell you guys that from now on i'm going to try to start doing that before my video so we can get that first token together here and enjoy it together but i'm diving in for my second one i'm not waiting for you guys this time whoa wait oh there was that sweetness man that was just like it was smooth fruity and overall that left a really nice just like sweet flavor on my tongue now it's not coming on super super strong for me but i wasn't really expecting for it to come on super strong just yet first of all i'm only two ribs deep here second of all this is a hybrid strain like a 50 50 sativa indica blend so it's probably going to be pretty pretty mellow or you know middle middle of the road you know not too indica not two sativa so what i'm gonna do now is i'm gonna go ahead i wanna show you guys what this stuff looks like under a 25 times magnification macro lens so you guys can get an up close little purse excuse me an up close and personal view of this jenny kush from abundant organics so here is the jenny kush by abundant organics look at how many bright orange hairs this blood has on it now the one thing i'm going to make note of here is i wish they would have trimmed back some of these leaves a little bit better here but boy are those some nice trichomes and huge fat crystals on this stuff and overall this stuff from a bag appeal standpoint is absolutely stellar all right so what did you guys think i just finished having some of it i really enjoyed it you guys i really did like i i just was kind of like reading a little bit of information about it whatever and i like kind of got lost as i was just sitting popping the bowl and it was so smooth from the beginning to the end and that was really really enjoyable um you know honestly as far as the overall high goes this is just kind of exactly what i kind of described before it's like very level headed i mean i'm happy um not like overly energetic but i'm also not overly like tired or relaxed i'm kind of right there in between um so it's like this is very a good clean clean feeling you know as far as the high goes it's very clean and it was very very enjoyable um so let's go ahead and before i give you guys my final rundown i want to show you this stuff one more time on the screen so i'm going to bring up this jenny kush by abundant organics one last time for you guys before i give you guys my final opinion on it okay you guys so we are back and this is what the deal is because you guys saw i mean this is some ridiculous looking stuff ridiculous looking stuff and i know this had to have been hand trimmed it did have some excess leaf you know leaf material there that i'm not a super big big fan of but like that that can happen i wish they trimmed the butt up a little closer to excuse me they trimmed the leaf up a little closer to the bud um but boy oh boy these are like huge crystals and huge huge orange hairs on this and they're very well proportioned um and the high is just very clean it's very clean it's not like super super potent so that's you know one thing that i will note but i did really thoroughly enjoy that sweet flavor now i personally just wish it was more pronounced i really really do and like the flavor straight out of the jar for me you guys the terps are just lacking and i honestly would put this stuff in a whole nother category if it just had stronger terps and i know with the last um the secret punch that we just tried from them the terps were also lacking in that bud so this seems to be a common theme but you know again i really liked their bubble gum chem which had great terpenes and if this again if this had better terps it would really knock it out of the park for me but because it didn't i'm gonna give this a 7.5 now i'm going to recommend it absolutely recommend this um because i really enjoyed that fruity sweet flavor so so enjoyable for me um and just a good overall clean high and if they wanted to knock this stuff out of the water to take it to another level i'm telling you just get those terpenes where they need to be and this stuff will be kicking on all cylinders and you know the potency would be again a tiny bit lacking for me but again i'm you know a regular user so i need that ultra potent stuff i don't go buying the you know low tier the mid tier the top tier i am going straight for that reserved here we are quality over quantity here and i want to save you guys money and that's why i started this channel doing unbiased reviews i've seen other reviewers certain people know exactly what they're talking about others i'm kind of wondering i'm like man i wonder if like some of these people you know are getting this but donated to them you know being sponsored giving their boys big what ups what up what up what up you know and that's cool and fine hey listen you know if you want to donate some product i you know i'd be happy to review it but again it's like if that's what's happening and then the reviews are becoming biased like that's what i'm afraid of because i've just recently seen even a couple reviews of some of the same strains that i've been reviewing and i'm like man i had that exact same stuff and that stuff was whack so again you guys i'm not doing this for anybody other than the consumer at the end of the day because i have your best interest i want to have the absolute best medicine going in my body and same for you guys so with that being said we are going to go with a 7.5 for this jenny cush by abundant organics and with that being said i can't wait for the next one you guys until then be good to yourselves and one another i'm out peace", "vP7nRT5FPlk": "so hey YouTube Happy New Year oh my god it's been like forever since I did a video but I got something amazing to review with you guys today I couldn't pass up this offer to review this amazing strand that I had never heard of until two days ago so we have some Kimbo push excuse me I took a up close view of it and I'm gonna give you like a little closer view okay so I just wanted to give you a up close and personal view of this Kimbo Kush as you can see it's heavenly resident with trichomes crystals everywhere which is beautiful it has a lavender undertone some of the buds as you can see which is very very beautiful and we're gonna get right into it I'm ready to smoke it's um a very very beautiful flower and it smokes very very well so let's get right into it I am so ready to smell it I actually could use a dab hit before I even roll but um I don't even know if I'll go into that but that is something that I do want into a review on I have a new kit that my friend one of my besties bought me for Christmas and I've been wanting to do a review on it I've used it of course but I took vacation a little bit before Christmas and I planned on doing videos during my vacation but it was more like birthday Christmas New Year's then getting back to California so I really haven't had time I did one video while I was gone of making some brownies on Christmas Eve and I haven't even did the editing to upload that so bad me but I'm going to start taking more time out at least one video we to do a review because I really enjoy doing them and hopefully you guys really enjoy watching me so let's get right into this Kimbo push so Kimbo push is actually named after the late Kimbo Slice the boxer that used to be known for his knockouts so I believe that's why they named him after this powerful in the indica dominant hybrid so we have a 70/30 ratio 70% indica 30% sativa and it's beautifully flavored it's a cross between a blackberry cush and a Starfighter so star fighter is that heavy hitting indica that you get the strong effects from so when you smoke this this is actually going to be a little stronger than your average push experience because of the star fighter and I must say for myself having a high tolerance this strand is very very strong I found myself yesterday after a girl gave it to me to try out I smoked like a quarter of it and then I put it out and he was like what's wrong I was like nothing it's just so powerful I have to still be able to function after this I can smoke all this right now so I puffed on it periodically throughout the day because I had to be productive but this is definitely a nighttime smoke trend I would recommend and if you smoke it during the day I would say moderation so if you do have the function that you're still functionable because I said too much of it I can tell can definitely be like a one-two knockout punch like Kimbo is known for now um as far as the smell just it has a very very potent smell just me breaking it up alone is um I can smell it it has very strong I would say citrus like that citrus but dinky cush no but also very fruity it's weird smells amazing though but it's it's more like a dinky for thankee krishna with a fruity but you know Christian has like that fruity smell - so it's like a dinky fruity smell and it actually tastes just as good as it smells I can't wait - I have a long day today so I can't wait to smoke it's very sticky - all the resin on it it's very very very sticky probably have about a gram that I broke up to put in here I might have to take a little bit out leet Rai to roll up before I do the video to make it a little faster but today I figured I would talk while I do it because um I was planning on trying to do two videos but realistically I should have probably did dosey doe before Kimbo push um if I was gonna try to do - because I know after I finished no penis I'm gonna probably be out a little bit and maybe out I won't need to do smoke anymore for tonight the dry pole is a very fruity flavor I would say citrus and very mixed which is just simply delicious to me the two guys I already knew that because you know I like fruity cheers everybody hopefully you rolled up something or smoking with me if you're allowed to smoke so yes so just a quick rundown again so this is a Kimbo cush hybrid it's indica dominant very very very flavorful the first poll when you first pull it you might get like a citrus piney peppery taste but the undertone is the fruity flavor that you get and that's another reason why I like it so much besides it's very strong potent effects it's very smooth smoke so yesterday when I smoked it after about two or three minutes into it I could feel my heavy relaxation we'll see how it goes today the effects of this trend is like like I said it very relaxing happy euphoric uplifted and too much of it will definitely cause you to be sleepy so I would say it would help with pain stress depression PTSD insomnia with enough of it should be able to treat insomnia and also I think I read something about it being very good for glaucoma the only negative effects that I've seen is dry mouth and dry eyes because yesterday when I was smoking it during the day my contacts were bothering me in dry mouth you know that's a side effect with smoking period so I'm doing this natural curl I've decided to go natural last year and I haven't part my hair in over a year or more actually probably I've lost count now so these are my natural curls the only bad thing is I got a big bit on my forehead from the oils um probably touching my face but I'm trying to learn how to wear my natural hair and deal with it work with it and I love my curls when they're fresh out the shower with conditioner and stuff like I said today it's been a long day but y'all bear with me but yeah this is definitely a good nightcap for me so in a few minutes I'll be totally relaxed everybody who does watch my video make it your business this week to try to share my channel with some friends of yours at least one or two I'm trying to get my subscribers up and I thank you guys for subscribing I just want my channel to grow so before I start actually filming my plans and my garden and doing more live things that I want to do with you guys I have to have a thousand subscribers so you guys helped me reach my goal you'll see more of areas of interest yes it's like every pull puts you in a deeper and deeper and deeper full body relaxation I love it I challenge any people who have a very high tolerance and takes a lot to get them where they need to be please try the string because I was shocked they say the THC level is somewhere between 25 to 27 percent from this problem every batch is different but yeah so I definitely missed you guys I haven't um forgot about my youtube channel just in case people did think that I forgot I haven't forgotten I just was busy I was in Florida for almost a whole month and then you know if you take a vacation for a month even though that I mean even though I was like not supposedly working I was still working in Florida trying to help get recreational marijuana on the ballot as well as taking care of business so it was like a vacation and then when I got back I needed another vacation because I was ripping and running the whole time I was in Florida and I'm just getting back to my norm like being able to go to work and have my free time and because when you got family and friends and you're trying to see everybody that you haven't seen in a long time it was crazy but I enjoyed it even though I don't know when the next time I'll be going and spending that much time in Florida again it was fun but I have things that I need to be doing so I just don't think that I'll have that much time to spend in down there again that's one reason why I tried to see everybody and hang out with everybody as much as I could because I know for at least ten months I'm gonna be across the country over here in California and when I do go back it might be just for business because I am trying to start a business and party shouts out to my crew hmm I don't want to announce it too soon but um I definitely have some things in the making with the crew of some bosses in Florida so we got some things coming y'all stay tuned but yes um I'm not gonna keep you guys long I'm not done with this but it's almost done and um I'm feeling great but it's just a little sample of what I'm gonna be doing in 2020 you guys don't forget to hit the notification button so you can get notifications when I post this week please share my

in here and I had to add an extra fan buddy but every girl is different and I had set the soil you know super soil up for certain for you know regular and I forgot that the these two plants are heavy feeders they showed me you know the lead there's something that I didn't put enough food in the soil so I'd not related some more top dressed it little more and if it's about two days I already took their enzymes and a little bit more the flowering newts in here so I can get my I'm gonna change I'm gonna change this red light up here because these buds in the middle are bigger than the ones on the side over here so some thinking miss liking that doesn't like so put that in there but this is how I was looking so far it is day 20 some food smell of France Skywalker grows a little nice little heart did snugs so you see how small of legs are there and compared to the BlackBerry cache so we going they say to age reason at the lights but down here the plant is liking it but this is how it is I know next time you know I don't know these strings right here I read I just do once a year usually I get a big big enough I still got some last year just despise I think a quarter laughs but it goes fast I'm trying to save the nice choice nuggets and put them in the jar only my stuff and then I let my friends taste the rest gotta have me some blackberry kitchen so Skywalker og every year it's a taste you must have burns bits most well gives you nice nice buzz nice hi I like the way it makes me feel I have a strain of uh this is a dentist rating but a hundred straight-up lightweight fish it was those raid way different there's have more spicy and having one of my partner's smoked it and he was the comedian he's just jabbered makes you laugh and talk they did a little trimming trimming up

we have a really nice sticky indica this is called purple berry you can see the color on those Nuggets they're quite nice I like to draw a little moon for the indicas meaning it's kind of more of a sleepytime blend or bud I should say these are nice and big juicy buds those are good that's like we're not to smaller ones let's see if I can find an even bigger one oh yeah oh this guy love less stuff okay so this as I said is an indica purple berry it definitely has that purple berry kind of smell it is rich ripe red fruits purple fruits almost has a candy like flavor to it like almost the concentrate of a berry that's nice cool okay so we're gonna grind this guy up I think this will easily make a huge joint got my grinder here it's quite like if you squish your fingers together it's gonna stay that way like it's it's quite malleable for a pot so sometimes that is not the greatest sign for being able to bust it up and sometimes it's not the greatest sign for smoke ability factor like it you might have to light it a bunch but we'll see let's see how this one goes it definitely grinds nice sometimes it gets really sticky in there when it's like that it doesn't grind very well but let's see how it comes out not bad not bad it got stuck in there a little bit cool okay yeah the fragrance of it just being busted up so what that does when you bust up the the buds like that you release all the oils and it's it's kind of like when you have a garlic and then you mash it a bit and it releases those fragrances that's the same kind of idea it's a lot of flavor trapped in those buds that bud gave me a huge amount to work with here so the busts up so you get a lot out of how much you you are putting into your grinder that's good that's a good thing yeah you just kind of roll it and you get yourself a nice little joint pinch the ends and you're good to go Thanks okay and with all this excess material here I mean that's almost enough to roll another joint but I still like to put it into my blend this is all the ends like this yeah so you can kind of create your own little like hybrid blend things going on okay let's see how this tastes mmm put it in your mouth just before you light it you kind of can taste up what the bud tastes like by itself and it's really almost strawberry sweetness to it like kool-aid or something okay mmm its way nicely got my Rasta guy whoo mmm that is sweet that is dense that has again that nutty flavor to it that a lot of marijuana does mmm nice stuff mmm running into the problem of it not lighting very well which sometimes happy happens with those really sticky dense buds let's keep this going maybe we just didn't grind up well enough but again those of you who do not know indicas like this like this purple berry are great for nighttime relax and food are having trouble sleeping good for insomnia all sorts of things where the sativas they are kind of daytime pots where you can they find cannabis where you can do things and be active and be social and whatnot mmm out again so that's maybe my only complaint with this stuff is that it's a hasn't been maybe cured properly it's smells great but it just might have had to been dried a little bit more before it was cured really nice though anyways thank you for joining me this is YouTube we'll see you next time", "gvWpHq3rAvg": "hello and welcome to highland brothers extracts so today we're going to be looking over the strain black dog by humboldt seeds it's a blackberry kush crossed with an emerald headband so to really factor in and really absorb that blackberry kush two two parenthoods right there an emerald headband two more paranoids right there leading down to black dog's parents that in turn made black dog so we have a big genetic lineage build up there all right and we look through these these are these are feminized seeds from humboldt seed as you can see it's got a very condensed short stout cushy structure which would be the kush from the blackberry kush um very evident and it comes through quite nicely as far as the bud development goes it's not quite far along yet so to get a real um proof or the smell uh would be a little little difficult at this point but it does have uh subtleties to it whereas some of the other ones at that same stage will have a little bit of a stank um again it's it's so ever changing it's hard to nail narrow it down when it's this premature but uh let's have a look at some of one of our bag seeds we have remember blackberry kush emerald headband okay so whereas the last two plants you saw were black dog they were also feminized straight from humble seed very short stout subtle smell cushy structure cushy buildup now we have a bag seat of our blackberry kush with emerald headband and bag seed like like i said in previous videos unlocks that very diverse uh lineage through the ancestry of that of that genetic buildup so when we look at this the blackberry kush it has a very i know obviously you guys can't smell it and that i apologize for that it's not doing it justice however this has a very evident or berry creamsicle almost raspberry in this case we know it's blackberry um uh stank to it the structure is is a total 180 from for from the cushiness uh the even even even the nug structure like the bud buildup is very opposite of cush it's very elongated type trailer park boy donkey dick buds that are going to be forming on it rather than ball ball ball ball ball as per the bali cush type build up um but again just some of the benefits and also could be disasters of starting from backseat or even choosing to grow bag seed is uh you could get some some gems like this with with large diverse genetic builds buildups or you could be getting something uh that sucks ass you know or as a herm or a male but i mean hey if you if you can unlock some some golden phenos such as this i say it's worth the risk", "_jsYjS3cq0s": "I want to do this one a lot more casual like I don't wanna be so official about it it's a little early in the morning a little tired I haven't really gotten my feet up to myself yet as far as the morning goes so we're gonna really really do a really loose strain review this morning um I got two kinds of weed here from my last video oz video we ended up going to two dispensaries right across the street from each other which put them in direct competition so I'm gonna tell you right now Zen zoo wins but neither of them beats MMJ MMJ all of the way so from we medical I ended up grabbing a little bit of the blackberry and a little bit of the tuna cush and I think we're gonna do the review on the blackberry this morning all right here we go stream review blackberry here it is there it is okay so here we've got the blackberry from we medical coming in at 10 bucks a gram gorgeous looking weed there it is the BlackBerry BlackBerry's popular strain known for its balance of an active sativa buzz and a high yields of plants due to its indica side it was spread in 2009 by Dutch company Nirvana seeds as a cross between black domina and raspberry cough flowering happens between hundred and eleven weeks plants will have tight see structures frosty bugs indoor growing recommended but be warned blackberry plants are plenty it's a strain as strong smoke that can have a fuel smell but it is dominantly fruity Bane driving infect here is going to be relaxed so I guess let's get ready to relax it's funny when I bought this weed I thought it would be a lot better already smoked a whole bunch better got about two grams of it all I got a lot left is this little nub and I thought it would be a little bit more potent than it was but the fact that it's a hybrid it makes it a great daytime smoke so so I've got this barn here that I use in my videos it's been holding out very very well beautiful spots on glass and it's a red idea I'm chugging on this bomb too hard it's [ __ ] spitting up the back here so just as I got off work yesterday no standing at the bus stop outside of my work a little bit early about ten minutes early had time to smoke a joint so I busted out this joint of the tuna Kush also from we medical although 15 boxes there now I'm not quite worth it I'm standing there smoking this joint guard walk sit beside me I'm not gonna be the old the old heads up and you know he had that little stoner moment for a second move we both knew what was good so the guy had the saying that he told me and it was if you're good at something never do it for free if you're great at something never do it for someone else right as I was getting off the bus I gave give this guy the channel information and you know hopefully this guy's watching right now Andrew if you're out there I wish you all the best great conversation great talking Nia this one's for you buddy pick we got very earthy and sweet I'd say on the berry note yeah I guess so it's pretty fruity earthy definitely sweet maybe goes hand-in-hand with the berry I guess blackberry bong lows number three there anything you have to think of what to say baby wanna see something but I can't really talk to myself all the time it feels [ __ ] weird even right now talking to myself like somebody else is here and I'm talking to them makes me feel crazy you guys want to see anything else happen on this channel just let me know in the comments section and totally open to your ideas yeah let me know what you think what you want to see I can do it we can make it happen guys well anyways guys that was the BlackBerry bong review blackberry bong loads I hope you enjoyed that smoking that blackberry hybrid pretty [ __ ] stoned right now if you can't tell I guess I'm just gonna go get ready for my day and I'll see you guys on the next video

holistic health sabine holistic health is a non-profit that helps medical cannabis patients with medicine costs all patients who need medical cannabis should have affordable access to it no patient should have to stop using the medicine due to the cost today i'm discussing three medical marijuana strains that all have berry in their names a 50 50 hybrid blackberry lemon berry a sativa dominant hybrid and god berry an indica dominant hybrid this can give you an idea of the effects that hybrid strains produce for most users and some conditions that they treat so let's talk about these hybrid berry strains the most important part of successful treatment with medical marijuana is to choose a medical strain to meet your needs all medical marijuana patients should be aware of strain types thc and cbd ratios and the medical uses of all cannabinoids and terpenes in the cannabis plant use the links in the description for very detailed resources and free downloads for choosing your best medical strain medical marijuana is so versatile with hundreds of different strains each patient should be able to find exactly what he or she needs that treats medical symptoms with or without intoxication and other effects that fit their lifestyles all of the strains i included for this discussion are high in thc and will produce euphuria also use the links for non-intoxicating ways to use medical marijuana and how to use thc without intoxication the first strain is lemon berry a sativa dominant hybrid strain lemon berry is only slightly sativa dominant as a 60 40 sativa dominant cross it provides a balance between the energizing effects of a sativa strain with the body relaxation of an indica strain leaning only slightly more towards the sativa side lemon berry grows like an indica and blooms like a sativa strain lemon berry has an average of 22 percent thc and less than 1 cbd with this 22 to 1 thc to cbd ratio it will produce euphuria in the form of a high again this is an energizing feeling with body relaxation and calm tones it could be good for day or night time relief of symptoms and is good for being social focused and relaxed lemon berry tastes like citrus and smells like blueberries contributing to its name it is an energizing strain that promotes clarity and calmness lemon berry has been reported effective in treating headaches migraines pain inflammation stress anxiety and depression of course lemon berry could treat other conditions as well but these are what patients say they use it for lemon berry is related to dabney blue and lemon thai it could treat any condition that would benefit from the balanced effects the next strain god berry is an indica dominant hybrid that is much more relaxing god berry is related to god and blueberry it is an indica dominant hybrid with relaxing and sedative effects leaning heavier on the indica side godberry has 21 thc and 1 cbd approximately with this 21 to 1 thc to cbd ratio it would produce euphoric high effects these effects are those typical of indica and some but not all indica dominant hybrid strains they are relaxing sedative and give the feeling some call couch luck the feeling of not wanting to leave the couch godberry produces the deep body relaxation of an indica and may induce sleep in some people godberry has a sweet fruity taste patients have reported it effective in treating anxiety stress pain depression inflammation insomnia spasticity muscle spasms and multiple sclerosis it could certainly treat other conditions as well these conditions are just what some patients use god berry to treat it would be beneficial to any medical condition where deep body relaxation or improved mood increased appetite or calming effects are needed the last strain is a 50 50 sativa indica hybrid that provides balanced effects blackberry blackberry is related to black domina and raspberry cough blackberry has 24 thc and less than one percent cbd with this 24 to 1 thc to cpd ratio it would produce euphuria or a high blackberry produces a good balance between the cerebral energizing effects of a sativa and the body relaxation of an indica it has energizing effects with body relaxation and promotes being social and creative blackberry and godberry are both noted as potent strains that don't require much to relieve medical symptoms patients have reported blackberry effective in treating muscle spasms spasticity multiple sclerosis stress anxiety and depression of course these are not the only symptoms it could treat just what patients most often use it for and have reported the most important part of choosing a medical strain will be to consider the medical applications of cannabinoids and terpenes and choose a strain that has those that treat your medical symptoms as well as determining an appropriate strain type and thc and cpd ratio to meet your needs you can find resources to do this using the links in the description that are detailed and include

"G4kmXqCa-_M": "[Music] welcome to weed entertainment and i'm telling you the tips every day are pushing better and better and better flowers to get reviews and my picks aren't as good as the tips they're just not as good anymore every once in a while before i would show up at a really good one but today most of the good picks are and i'm going down and buying and looking for these strains are by tip and today we're going to talk about something called 42 sharks and this is by bohemian estate and this was a tip flower someone ran me down says shark lotto is down at la cush and when i went down there on the menu said shark lotto 42 sharks and when i got down there there's no shark lotto there's only 42 sharks and this bottle actually doesn't say sharp lotto on it anywhere so i'm not really sure of the story of the relationship of shark lotto and 42 sharks but i'm sure one of the brothers or sisters knows so if anyone knows please post it under the video you know it's crazy because on the la kush menu it says shark lotto 42 sharks but not on this jar it just doesn't say it at all and here we have the bud and it's beautiful it's an absolutely beautiful bud except i don't know if you can see it i'm gonna try and hold it so you can see it there is a hole from one side of this bud all the way to the other side right through it it's skewered from one of those bucking machines and i've seen those machines work and i've you know it's been very few buds that i see one go all the way through otherwise those there's better machines than that and these people should know that too i have some experience i'm no expert in the bucking machines but i know that people have saved a lot of money by getting these machines and they see they get more yield too there's some science that you don't get a beautiful bud usually like this maybe this machine skewers it but it keeps the bud shape better right that maybe that's part of it too so you get a beautiful shaped bud but you can see the bucking hole i mean it's just right through the whole thing like a bullet hole crazy right or a woodpecker hole anyway we're gonna load a scooper of 42 sharks into vapor cup straw and we're gonna tamper and then we're gonna just stick it down there just enough and we turn it over over the grinder so everything that it's gonna fall out falls right back in and gets used i'm gonna stick this right down into the vapor cup and this cup with just the amount of one bong hit is going to give you 12 flavorful draws on an average really good flavorful flower and it can even give up to 20 draws if the flower's really crystallized and i think that's the trick is the more crystals the longer the flavor lasts and so if you see a bud that's all crystallized like you can imagine at a vapor cup it's probably flavorful through the roof and unbelievable and we love doing those type of flowers so today it's all about 42 sharks and so i've got it in the cup and i've got this thing set to 330 and i believe the cultivator of this is bohemian estate and i really can't tell it says 42 sharks by bohemian estate so i'm going to call the cultivator bohemian estate or chocolato one of those there's some lore for this please whoever knows please post anyway let's check it out 42 sharks by bohemian state at a vapor cup at 330 degrees so this flower is smooth enough and i've got at 330 but at this point i know this flower could use less heat so i'm going to turn it down a little bit to 320. if that doesn't fix it you could bring it down to 315 or even 310. this flower is vaping right now so you can turn down the heat and actually for sunflowers you can fix them i want people to see so i'm going to turn this down to 300. that little straw is going right now and i would say this flower has good taste of beanie but it does go south but 300 just mellows out and it's crazy so what did i think of 42 sharks this flower for me it had you know it's funny because you have some expectation this is a tip someone emails me so i don't want to disappoint them either the flower they liked is not the same for me but it's not the same for me you always will get the truth here so what did i think of 42 sharks i thought this flower was just okay for me there were some good things it was there wasn't a head and i hate the head so that's good and there was some light euphoria but this flower is light for me i'm a heavyweight so you put a flower like this in front of me and i'm going to give it an 8.5 but i also gave it a range so i gave this a lightweight 865 which is a good flower so i'm not poo pooing anything here if someone wants to try 42 sharks by bohemian estate i got this in l.a kush and this flower does have some lore and it's worth the try but if you're a heavyweight i think you would think this is not strong enough right it is what it is if you want to see vapor cup if you want to get a vapor cup if you want to enjoy a better flower experience i am

today I got another strain review another flower strain of you coming at you guys again I picked it up from highway 99 and today we are going to be reviewing blackberry rhino this it's kind of odd the budtender came when I asked for a couple strains she handed me this I I smelled it it smells delicious and I asked her what she thought of it and she's like oh it doesn't taste very good and I I needed it was like more than why would you hand it to me and then she was like oh if you don't like BlackBerry's over the [ __ ] doesn't like blackberries right right so of course I had to pick some up in it and it looks alright it's not like the most crystal tea stuff it's not like that I can't remember that other stuff I reviewed earlier but the other day either way so this is gonna be in the same format as the other most recent strain of you was I still got little kids in the house so I'd prefer not to smoke in the house just out of respect for them and theirs so let's uh get this ganja up and that's a take a gander at it shall we [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] there's some good-looking weed is super-trike Romi now it is a mix between a white rhino and blackberry although there is some suspicion that it's not the normal blackberry genetics let's break one of these open all of my fingers I got crystals on my fingers [Music] now I should also say that this strain is also known as blackberry white so if you go to look it up or you find it in the dispensary and it might not be under that same name let's break open one more these [ __ ] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] oh yeah do you see those purples yeah well I'm really excited to smoke some of this stuff let's get one more good group shot and then I'm gonna pause this now and I will see guys in the garage and we'll test this stuff out and I got a surprise for y'all and boom again see the power of magic aka the pause button we are back in the garage I'm excited for this one and change it up the ball and water because it was filthy filthy nasty nasty nasty [ __ ] butt [ __ ] so let's grab a good bong will have a bowl that can pop on the top of the bong neck like that so you can use it to pack so you can always use an extra pair of hands dude I'm breaking this up I can literally see crystals falling off this would be a really good weed to have if you have a high grinder with a Keef catch I bet this would be an extremely high yielding strain for teeth or even better yet if you had a tumbler but you know not too many people have tumblers now right off I do get a berry tastes like right off the bat that quickly goes away and to kind of an unknown taste I wouldn't say quite a burnt taste but I don't know let's go back for a second taste and see what's that I have to say though it did burn really [ __ ] fast like it's kind of dry so that might be attributing to that kind of birth taste I was kidding you know I keep getting a slight berry taste well I got a slight very pace tonight in part but not a lot like hey let's go back well I think that'll be it just kidding there's this a new addition to the show I've had this Sherlock for well this is more of a Gandalf Dan Dolf Sherlock no what the [ __ ] ever I've had this thing for kind of a while I got it pretty cheap because if you look it's got some like weird [ __ ] wiggle going on to it and it's not the most perfect piece but it was cheap and hey it's kind of cool so I thought we'd bring this into the show pack a little bow out of that and see if we get a different flavor than we did out of the the bomb Plus this has a nice long skinny neck hopefully that'll condense flavor for me of a saber we go cheers y'all now that's really weird because I don't get much on the very taste at all from the pipe the pipe taste is much different than the balling taste and that is very very odd I don't unfortunately I just think this batch is just a little dry because it's just tasting really really flat and unfortunately that's how several of the flowers I've been getting up and I have been they present really well on the looks and the smell but on the flavor it just doesn't deliver but the highs always there it's always a really really good lead but I like to smoke for flavor like I to be honest if there was a super don't let me think like I love Green crack love Green crack and it's got to have that green crack flavor same with most Purple's but per if I could smoke something like purple and not get high guess what I probably still smoke it because I love that taste in fact not probably I would still smoke what are you [ __ ] talking about i smoke cigarettes anyway that's going for another salute yeah I know that's just really really disappointing for a plant that had so much promise a batch that had so much promise and I'm sure it was really really really [ __ ] good earlier on but it it's just I think it's just too dry when you were brittle and I was breaking it it was it was really easy kind of broken to dust almost so uh you know there's that well I think that's gonna about indeed uh for real this time in I'm not gonna forget to do the raining this time I think I'm teetering back and forth between like probably you know it's probably a solid six I'm gonna give it a solid six it the looks are really good the smell is pretty damn good the high that's come over me it was pretty mellow it's nothing to write home about if something changes highs which it very well could I'll change the my rating in the description but I think I'm gonna stick with a solid six which is very sad this week had such great potential literally everything the looks or probably attend the smell was probably I don't know probably a solid eight maybe maybe eight and a half even it smells pretty good ya know it's it smells real good it's a nice berry smelled that it is pretty dry and it's so covered in try cause man that is so bright that that's just too bad well if you guys like the video please like help please like the video throw a comment down if you have any suggestions any weed strains you want me to look around for I can jump on weed maps and look for a specific strain of something or inedible if you guys want me to do although that would be kind of an odd video we could work it out we could work it out either way just please subscribe like share comment all that [ __ ] thanks for watching the

blackberry JC comes in about 20% but very Christians are indica strain that is recommended for nighttime use it's a potent strain that offers a powerful high a little bit of this goes a very long way if you try to smoke this like some of us lesser counterparts you will most definitely fall asleep in no time if you're growing this you may want to note that this plant is not a high yielding plant

is an excellent strain great flavor good for paint when I smoke black very cushy a child to do it like like it was just basically some Reggie you know and I was just smoking way too much and after about a blunt and a half I was passed out I woke up with half a blunt in my hand for the smoking that and passed right [ __ ] back out um this is a very strong strain I don't recommend it for newbies

"hey guys is dabbe connection and we are taking a look at the eureka vapor syringe and doing a review and i've been hitting on this for a little while this is actually the second one of these got two of these and about one and a half way through and let's take a look at the oil actually first so nice clear oil this is from colorado you can see a little eureka logo on there this is the ATF coming a 96 percent THC very strong very high I'm out actually tried some of this on the Hermes 3 and I tried it on seeso because I was actually I like to whenever doing a hardware review we like to do a comparison of kind of what the baseline is and a cartridge we're familiar with so see so we know it's kind of like the standard and let me compare to that so this oil very good if the 96% really mean anything not really because there's oils that have been in 80s that have been just as strong in fact I would say the AMA oils from Nevada are just as strong as this there's actually been a couple am am I've been been a little bit stronger but this is still awesome oil this is great it's really Rica and here's what it looks like all I'm saying is it seems like when stuff gets to the 80s and above I don't think that the THC helps that much more I mean I've I've had stuff that was 80% that has been better stuff that was 92% so that that's happened quite a bit actually but still whatever the percentages on this 96 it is strong it is good it tastes good and another thing I like about Eureka is it doesn't have that co2 II taste like some of the co2 cards might have like I think the the rhythm cartridge kinda had like a co2 much taste this they've gotten rid of the co2 is taste and it reminds me of w Bates because w of apes also has co2 oil but it doesn't have that co2 II kind of odd taste to it it tastes more like a distillate kind of thing so let's take a hit of it so you can see what it looks like I've been hitting on this battery it hits nice and yeah the oil stays consistent seems to vape pretty slow absolutely nothing to complain about it was 60 for a full gram which you know compared to Nevada prices that's a very good deal compared to Colorado prices it's probably about normal and compared to California prices may be a little bit expensive but overall Eureka ATF definitely we get it again I think it's a quality product and I can't wait to try more Eureka stuff definitely we'll probably just keep getting eureka stuff when I'm in Colorado so there's nab connection two thumbs up for eureka vapor atf syringe thanks for watching and have a great week", "jmTJlprTLMI": "I blog I'm gonna start this [ __ ] off by saying just Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] about an OnPoint far about a tennis [ __ ] crazy very soon I was coming back with the reviewing a Alaskan

dunno be with you on that dough so I just added that on blinding the video cos my other Brooke can to wither this [ __ ] for this video buddy get inked out sniggle there Boston checking your eyes and this [ __ ] you", "2quA9B22k4M": "welcome to community cannabis review so originally my strategy with videos was to basically make one video per brand essentially didn't even really get into multiple videos per strains um mostly just to show you that so you got a brand you searched it up on youtube or you saw it at the dyspo before you bought it search it up on youtube and just verify that they don't make some crap or they're not basically gonna scam you for some booty that you don't want um but i've been having a lot a lot of people say that they want more videos more often and i kind of want to make some more honestly more frequently than i do so i'm going to start making a video basically every time i get a cart or a concentrate if i can or as frequently as i can to that anyways so um i'm not doing the editing on this one i'm gonna re-download my editing software and stuff but for this one i don't feel like it needs it too much because there's not very much packaging to even go over let's start with the hush brand cartridge because i was really surprised with the last one that i got so i picked up another one so um i got this one at beaver bulls where are we at let's see if i can get it to focus there we go phone's actually focusing uh purple cali cush cannabis extract cartridge try that again um this is one gram container uh contains rather 77 points 77 percent thc there we go 77 point actually the 770 milligrams dhc excuse me i can't talk today um then the cbd is 22 milligrams total i believe that puts it at 0.22 percent i don't remember how to work that i'm not thinking clearly um you got all your production info on there and then compliance labels and stuff but other than that it doesn't come with much it's very bare bones for a cart um you got the price there before tax which this dyspo does a lot do before attacks some do after etc anyways and here's the cartridge itself you can see that's some really nice looking distillate which this looks hard to screw up but at the lower um lower price points you will find just like i assume it's made from trim that's even worse off so it just requires more starting material allowing more contaminants in total like chlorophyll and just well everything that's not desirable and you know with distillation i don't know that it matters maybe it's just they got better with their process don't know what the situation is all i know is in my opinion they got better here's the you got um got two silicone caps and then you got the compliance label which i always tear off or peel off whatever and this little weed sticker got these like everywhere all right let's see if i can get some better pictures of this i got a sun lamp right now which is doing nothing but making my eyes look gorgeous nothing for the weed though um let's do some different colors put it in front of super clean um super clear what got me into this was i actually got a cart a couple days ago and it was even better than this one i don't remember the strain i think it was like um maui papaya or something like that um all right well i'm throwing everything i can't speak or grab anything right now apparently um that's the one that i was talking about same same deal basically but yeah i tried them out and they were readily better than i remember them so i wanted to make a video plus i just want to get into making some anyways so let's see if i can't taste some terpenes on this the other one was very interesting terpene wise that's also something i was grateful for they normally have some basic ass servings but this last one they had um i definitely tasted some one of the more exotic terpenes i'll say i don't remember what it was though the consistency is really nice on this dude's gotten a little better i'm using a mirror behind my phone so that i can point it straight at me so bear with me as i look that way and i hit super nice these are up there now with like what i call gold standard distillate cards because like i said distill it's hard to [ __ ] up so once you get to a certain point it doesn't really get any better it's just like as good as it gets and that's really not hard to achieve either but somehow people occasionally mess it up but you got like buddies and select those cards are just distill it how it's supposed to be done hush is getting up there they're pretty dang close now other than the fact that buddies and select have better hardware i want to say it's very close for this one sadly the terpenes i'm only really getting some pretty heavy mirror scene it tastes like a lot of purple strains for sure which that might be something different yeah these cards are solid um i just wanted to get another video out because i want to start putting out more so i hope you enjoyed this like and subscribe and stay tuned and i'll put out more and ideally better ones soon thanks for watching", "GLmPY3FeYu4": "it's good everybody thought I'd smoke a little quick jaunt with you guys got

founder of sabine holistic health today i'm discussing some medical marijuana strains for treating sleep apnea and sleep disorders medical marijuana is established to help symptoms of insomnia that accompany many conditions there are some clinical trials and a lot of pre-clinical evidence that show medical cannabis is able to stabilize respiratory levels during sleep medical cannabis shows a lot of promise as an effective treatment for sleep apnea and other sleep disorders these are approved conditions in some states sleep disorders insomnia or sleep apnea may also occur in conjunction with other serious medical conditions that are approved for medical marijuana treatment such as cancer lou gehrig's disease multiple sclerosis hiv aids parkinson's disease and so many more today i'll discuss some basic considerations for choosing a medical strain for sleep disorders as well as some recommended strains for sleep apnea and other sleep disorders so let's get started i always start my strain videos with these basic considerations for choosing a medical strain because they are so necessary in finding the best strain for you the first consideration is the cannabinoids and terpenes needed to treat your symptoms and condition for sleep disorders thc is very important and medically beneficial thc is sleep promoting as well as cbd and cbn but thc will induce sleep in the most effective way sleep promoting and relaxing terpenes to look for are micrine linalo and karyophiline these are relaxing and sedative and good to look for secondarily when choosing a medical strain the type of strain is also a huge consideration for sleep disorders indica strains are usually the most relaxing sedative and sleep inducing indica dominant hybrids can also produce these results sativa strains are energizing and uplifting and better for daytime fatigue focus or energy i'll go over a few sativa strains and 50 50 sativa indica hybrids that have been indicated for sleep disorders today but most people will need to choose an indica strain for sleep disorders also consider the thc and cbd ratios equal or higher levels of cbd will reduce or eliminate the psychoactive or high effects of thc but still retain the medical applications of thc higher levels of cbd are good for those who don't want the intensity of higher thc strains or those newer to medical marijuana finally consider using patient logs patient logs give you a measurable way to keep track of what strains you've tried and how they affected your condition they are excellent to take with you to the doctor to show how medical marijuana is working for you you can download patient logs at sabineholistichealth.org using the links in the description you can also find more information about thc and cbd ratios strain types and the medical uses of cannabinoids and terpenes using the links in the description so now let's look at some strains the first two strains are higher cbd strains these strains would not be as relaxing or sedative as higher thc strains and probably not as beneficial to sleep disorders however these strains are good for those who are newer to medical marijuana or don't want the intensity of higher thc strains thc is sleep promoting and some levels of thc are needed to treat sleep disorders the first strain is lemon aid it is lemon aid or also known as cbd lemonade lemonade has a two to one cbd to thc ratio it has about eight percent cbd and four percent thc lemonade has a lemon vanilla taste it can treat depression lack of appetite nausea pain anxiety stress and insomnia the next strain is remedy remedy is an indica dominant hybrid with high cbd it has about a 13 to 1 cbd to thc ratio with 13 cbd and less than 1 percent thc remedy has no intoxicating psychoactive or euphoric effects it has an earthy floral lemony smell and taste remedy can also treat spasticity stress migraines inflammation hypertension muscle spasms anxiety and epilepsy the next strains are sativa and 50 50 indica sativa hybrid strains sativa strains and 50 50 hybrids in general are not recommended for sleep disorders sativa strains are generally uplifting and energizing and better for being active and focused there are just a few strains that are recommended for sleep disorders these strains the sativa strains are trainwreck and og kush and the 50 50 hybrids indicated for sleep disorder are white widow woody kush and gorilla glue number four these strains would provide relaxed effects but not be sedative and induced sleep if you need relaxation that doesn't put you to sleep these may be good strains to try generally people with sleep disorders benefit from indica strains or indica dominant hybrid strains indica strains are more relaxing and sedative and will induce sleep so now let's look at some of the best strains for sleep disorders in sleep apnea these strains are indica strains that will induce sleep and be very relaxing and sedative the first strain is mazar eye sheriff mazar i sheriff is an indica strain from northern afghanistan with 16 thc and less than one percent cbd this strain has spicy sweet and earthy tastes and smells it is relaxing sedating and induces sleep mazar eye sheriff is excellent for both relieving pain and getting rest it can treat pain inflammation alzheimer's disease insomnia depression anxiety stress sleep disorders nausea and a lack of appetite the next strain is blackberry kush blackberry kush is an indica dominant hybrid strain with 20 percent thc and 2 percent cbd this strain is related to afghani kush and blackberry blackberry kush has a hashy jet fuel smell and tastes like berries blackberry kush has very strong relaxing and sleep inducing effects it can treat a lack of appetite nausea pain inflammation sore muscles and joints depression anxiety bipolar disorder sleep disorders and sleep apnea the last strain is hash plant hash plant is an indica strain with a 20 to 1 thc to cbd ratio with 20 percent thc and less than 1 cbd it is a very calming relaxing and sedative strain that often induces sleep hash plan is also an award-winning strain and is related to afghani land race and northern lights it has mild sweet woody tastes and smells hash plant is an appetite stimulant and can be used to treat depression headaches migraines anxiety nausea stress pain insomnia sleep disorders eating disorders and a lack of appetite so you can use all of these strain recommendations as a guide to find similar strains that are available at your local dispensary these are just recommendations and there are so many

sometimes not used to yet mystery guys great the kimbo cush wax down the healing corner right now best dispensary connecticut and dance clubs what's up guys I think you really do get a lot better flavor off that demon I'm like it was heavy I paradise black sailors know that burnt flavor it's really sweet and very tasting unless there's just some super quality wax from I might as well terrific very can be to you know my guys will be nice night uh-huh JCC do we", "KswEF_lWf0o": "ok this is my update on my Tigers and my blue dream children going pretty well santhali longer legs buzz by the way that one's advanced nutrients with general hydroponics very question best on da keep giving a little bit guys my clothes i should i say my teens they're about all this one's about like seven inches all these tears I got him beautiful still growing and yeah it's my update keep it green and peace out", "Nyq45v8Mkyg": "all right the reality is another video restraining we got for today is Kimbo push cable cushions are really wonderful strain nice kind of slide dance buds that whoo nice smell anyways this is an indica dominant strain and it's a platinum blackberry push cross wood starfighter f2 super stoning really wonderful before we get into it we'll take a quick hit and we'll get this party started it does have a bit of a cough but there's just the lung is kicking the smoke out nothing major you're not gonna be gagging hacking up a lung or anything like that the hips they're not harsh either but they have a really nice taste to it it's kind of sweet fruity kind of a sweet earthiness to it it's kind of got a tropical kind of uh I don't hint to it that's a what I was thinking when I was hitting this is a kind of going away really nice though um for me because of the couch lock and that's what this does have it has couch lock and it does have munchies so those are the two things you might want to keep an eye on but because of the couch lock this is probably best for like evening time late night rainy day when lazy Sunday a time where you don't really have nothing to do they you don't have any plans you can sit and chill kill some time waiting for your car to get fixed no maybe not because you might pass out because I don't know I got locked down with this I want to take in a nap but really good strain I love it I love the hits I love the effects of it the pain relief is wonderful too great pain relief in fact this has got a really deep relaxing body stone and it's kind of sedating in a way so if you've got some pain that doesn't go away from just a little minor kind stuff you know this is if you got a little more than just minor aches and pains if you've got stuff that's kind of you know bothering you there's probably a good string to try out because this is a heavy hitter from what I found out this strain tops the 27 percent THC mark so you know it's not a light weight or anything it's a good strain it's just that crash other than that's great it's great for anxiety pain relief panic attack stress anything that you need to chill out from you're frustrated that kind of stuff this is a good chill out strain great friends song the uh you have restlessness you have hard time going to sleep you might want to take a couple puffs of this might help you out also ready this is good for muscle spasms and other than that it's a really stony strain I wake and bake with this the other day and I found like it was good for the weekend big great for meditation but that short lived like I found like after the 45 minutes one hour in I started locking up man and I just wanted to sitting around watching cartoons until I want to passing out really great strain would totally you get this again but would only keep it for the evening times because other than that this is a it's good its stony doll but I would totally hit this train again", "cATdcgH3Tl8": "morning everybody doctor sketch here and welcome to this installment of sketch TV wanted to show you these clones let me shut this off real quick see I got those little plastic things there to prevent that kind of stuff now this first row is Humboldt 47 the second two are called Venice Beach Afghan and these last two rows are critical mass now all of these came from attitude and you can see they're ready to go in beer cups that looks really good they've been in here about two weeks i'd say maybe a little less and in this other cloner here we've got two rows of pineapple express two rows of critical mass two rows of one called qwirkle and two rows of fire alien Romulan from OG rascal now these cortical are across between space queen and purple urkle and they just went in there a bit ago but you can see the other ones are ready to rock they're ready to go in beer cups right now turn that back on now I've got some people asking me questions about a strain I've got in the bedroom called blackberry before we go in first of all I'd like to say I got it from a guy who owned nature's medicine named dusty he got it from some other guy who got it from some other guy honestly I couldn't really tell you for sure that it's actually called blackberry I couldn't tell you for sure anything about it other than where I got it it's one of my oldest strains you can see it's really really crystally now these are seven these are eight weeks along we flush them yesterday and today these buds are just hard as a rock these are the densest but I grow I once took a bud to some party that I went to there's about 20 people in this one room and I sent this but around I let everybody hold it and I told him I want you to squeeze it as hard as you can just with one hand try to break it everybody gave it a shot and that bud got back to me it looked identical to one at left there wasn't even a dent on it now these big girls right here are called white Romulan from OG rascal these are about four weeks along maybe three weeks maybe somewhere in between these things get ultra big they get huge the buds now we grow the plants a little bit too tall sometimes that's all right now you see a really tall one back there let's go back and see what it is you can see it the buds are kind of right up against the glass of the light nearly Wow let's figure out what we've got there fire alien Romulan this one's promote your a skull I'm not smelling much of anything yet smells kind of like the white smells kind of like Romulan i guess i'm hoping the buds grow bigger than that but honestly this would spend most of its time growing straight up we have other fee noms of that one that we haven't put in the bud room yet we're hoping those turn out better but we wanted a taste of it so we threw that fastest-growing one in now that one is from seed just as these front plants here are also from seed these are called sketches LLC we didn't know what to call him last year I went to Los Angeles in the summer time and when I got back there was a hit man og in the bud room that had been in there for two weeks pollinating merrily away you've heard this story before to say I was pissed he's an understatement so we tried to make lemonade from the lemons and we planted some of those seeds and we've harvested a few of them and we've got some that were really really good and we're going to keep and try them again like those and some that we just got rid of the first time right out of hand it was just crap so anyways I have no idea what that blackberry was originally called or where it came from but it's been in my stable longer than any other string it used to be a lot more crystally than that and i'm wondering if i took one and harmed it and harvested seed off of it if i could rejuvenate those genetics so to speak and bring the crystals back now it's not one of my favorite plants it's not very strong but it's high in CBD and that makes good medicine for a lot of people there's a lot of sick people out there anyways thanks for watching sketch TV you", "BCc3ik2M8GA": "oh gee shout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] don't watch this video this video another stream of your video I did one video like this in the past you guys kind of liked it like it's getting a decent amount of views but that was like a wife's car I got another wax car I'm gonna do a review on soon that's coming up but this video is some some buds and fire ass bud this rain so the strain of this is called a Blackwater OG get some fire fire but she was like some little picture about with some information about this rain so it's an indication it's like a crush it's a cross between um Mendel perps and uh San Fran Valley og og cush so it's like really it's like a really really purple bug as far as [ __ ] crystal use for crystals all do the budgets fire and it's just purple on top of that you know what I mean everybody loves some purple we just like the looks of it like it's fire I got a couple close-up shots I I had some like about an eighth of this I smoked probably about two grams only got like two probably about a gram left but when I had like a little bit more blood I got some quote but when I had like about it eight left or so I got some closer look I got some close-up shots with this camera for you guys so I don't know how well they turned out I guess we'll find out right now so yeah that's the close-up shots at the camera they didn't turn out that good I'll guess they posted shot to my phone real quick with this last little nugge have but this body's [ __ ] fire if you guys couldn't help little close-ups that's what I got left right here so I got I got this snug left and then I got like another like a little ball or so I mean you guys already seen it but this boat is [ __ ] fired alright so just got done with this close-up so you guys seen it it's [ __ ] a [ __ ] fire Frosty the Snowman with a prequel they do it it's a stupid strain but um let's grind this up I'm gonna roll up one I'm gonna smoke a bowl for you guys the balls are gonna feel kind of like a taste test the plump me smoking it just showing smoking talking to you guys and just a little smoke sesh you know what I mean so let me go to ball real quick and we'll hop into that and then what I'm gonna be smoking the bowl out of I should have cleaned it a little bit better before I made this video but I got this every side piece and I should have said this in the beginning of the video I'll probably edit it in some more but um so I mean don't watch this video unless you guys are over 18 or 21 whatever the legal age is legal ages in your state or you guys have your medical marijuana cards like I do back into this video um I'm gonna load a little Bowl real quick I load about like probably loaded like half the bowl in a little full bowl because the mother smoked a blunt - but this is just for me to get like the taste because you know you get the taste more through a pipe or a water pipe more than up lump because when you smoke a blunt you're like tasting the wrap as well as the weed just use the bowl I loaded so all right so I was thinking I want to take one fat hit just like I don't know a little challenge or something for you guys but I'm gonna take one small like a decent sized hit just like actually get to taste I mean I've been smoking on it for a while so I know what it tastes like but just for video purposes you know what I mean I'm gonna hit it once kind of a decent hit just too good I'm gonna hit it once it's like a decent hit to get the full taste experience for the video and then after that I'll probably take a bigger city or something just happened so yeah this part is so fire dude like it was cured perfect there's it's not like it has like the perfect like you guys think that close-ups like it how I have that snap to it and it's like the perfect but you know what I mean it's not dry doesn't it doesn't turn it like you know that weed that turns inside [ __ ] dust when you crumble it off or this bar that's like way too [ __ ] moist and this part is like the perfect here you know what I mean so the taste is [ __ ] fire doesn't taste too strongly anything in particular like doesn't I can't really taste like though the SATA friendo Ju cush you know necessarily at all it tastes more like the Mentos perps and the San Fran would be cushioned this to be honest but if you guys had this drain in the past time I don't blow on the comments what you guys think of it but let's take off that I said of this thing get into that block the ball is pretty much cash so my grind of a bet I'm gonna grind up about a gram throw up a blunt probably get a little time lapse think me rolling the blunt or something I don't know yeah I just don't want this video to be too long then I'll get our back smoked tip alone I don't know if I'm gonna smoke the full-blown and I don't know if I'm gonna trying to talk too fast and I'm stumbling over my words I don't know if I'm gonna smoke the full blunt in this video just because I don't want the video to be too long but let's get him to me roll on the blown out in one second I'm gonna work on the wraps you guys like I like I bought once pretty much done just gotta pack the rest of it there we go all right so much I'm gonna strap my phone it's a while back in my backyard that's something kind of weird we're in my backyard and I got the blunt roll so yeah so I rolled the blown up added a little crutch to the end of it it was a little loose um it's not the biggest blunt you know I mean it's a little personal one huh thank you guys didn't know I had a dog or some of you guys might look okay why you scared [ __ ] what I don't know what the [ __ ] is going on with him but this is hot back into this video so yeah I got two dogs I got a

I was young I don't even know what he want me to say it on camera but I'm not trying to brag it's not a good thing you don't smoke when you're a [ __ ] miner that [ __ ] is really bad for your health and just bad for everything in general but I'm just saying I have a really high tolerance when it comes to weeds I [ __ ] can smoke like this I'll be like in a different state you know what I mean like I'm not gonna say I'm not high but I'm not as high as some other people with lower tolerances would be no I mean lunk on the ripped on the end a little bit that's why I added the filter or a crutch so it's not hitting the bus let me see if I can fix it or do some but the ash is really white for being [ __ ] up with being a blonde this is a really good week the taste is [ __ ] fire especially in the blunt it makes it taste even way better it's [ __ ] like some exotic [ __ ] I don't know you guys send the picture I'll post it again right here let me read it because I don't even think I read the whole thing myself Blackwater og and the constraint typically bred from in dopers San Francisco Fiocchi because it's round compact but take a deep purple color sweet grape aroma never leave stress in his ID that's one of the things that seemed and that's [ __ ] I didn't know I didn't know about when I got this dream but hey that's just [ __ ] exactly what I needed I made the right

it's a indica dominant hybrid / indica whatever we want to put it on the back on the Kim will crush its the BlackBerry cush across the starfighter the BlackBerry cush it's across the starfighter those only needs on that and I to break that down a little bit more with the BlackBerry pushes that's an app that's really you know heavy indica Afghani cross with the blackberry and then the Starfighter

purifies it really really well and I fitted the pebble although because it's too bit strange and I came across you get the BlackBerry crush I'll fire both fire strength so I figured double bubbler

called actually from them the indie call oh so then the call Oh and again the percentages on this are pretty good I mean it's a 19 percent THC strength okay so let's get to uh let's get some

just turn to like a powder they just want to have to marijuana something like that mm-hmm all right so this is exciting I like the purples I'm purple dude I've always been into verbs like even before the medical man all aboard and picked off like that was always helping with my symptoms like like I had to get like I was always on the hunt for a bleed um you actually see my little [ __ ] my icon there my name versus we who's there in my little thing he said purple bud right there that was actually my weed way before the [ __ ] medically wrought prototype off I was like wow because were some of the first real like a Beyonce wasn't the thing catches medicated the most but was the first real all purple we never had so I take pictures of it but I've also noticed some Purple's actually don't do [ __ ] for you for a medication statuses like that [ __ ] is just you know sometimes they just grow and they can make make it look properly but that's people I found out through the hard way of my experience of marijuana summer of wheeze even what stank is [ __ ] the trichomes are daily you seen all these trikes the medication anything it can be purple as [ __ ] but it's a try Center the tracks where the TV is and that's what you want alright guys so we got bowl number one pack up here let's uh let's get this [ __ ] going like it's snowman anytime I see that dude I just want to s'more looking makes you miss your medication in that I love medication my marijuana this strain is down to healing gonna right now they are they got a hundred pop it in the end call Oh from advanced girl labs at the only corner in Bristol Connecticut tell jr. I sent you okay all right let's get this [ __ ] going I'm excited about doing a couple of balls here I'll probably get it looks like to but I'm if there's not enough for three I'm doing third ball which excited to get [ __ ] medicated and then I'm gonna go I like some cut the hair and I'm gonna [ __ ] out there and do some snow blown because winter storm Jonas is stopping us Jonas Brothers real soft flake oh gosh okay okay now definitely been in the house for too long that is what it is definitely medication time alright so again Kimble cush from advanced girl labs we're almost heated up here in my hot one vaporize this [ __ ] double lovely let's do this [ __ ] that's nice that's really smooth I'm gonna get a lot of that musty blackberry purpley pump that's nice as soon as you exhale you could honestly almost feel your whole body get a little bit more relaxed like dress just went away nice that was really nice this is definitely more of a body high you feel your whole body yet relaxed again squinted up nice a little bit not couch locked a lot by any means but you're getting a more like relaxed feeling like everything's going mellow on me that's definitely it's feeling like my back [ __ ] just got real loose my grace was so tight it's not anymore and my head got like I felt like a weight guy lifted off my shoulders I guess that's the best way to describe it like did the medication effect itself really took ample stress off me like pain relief off me this is one of those relieving strains have you need relief from your symptoms this medication is a symptom relief type strain it's not oh I'm gonna go i medicate stone and laughs none of them this is more like almost compared to like a CVD it's almost comparable that it's got an indica your body affects your body effects which is nice I like that a lot work it's awesome um and again nighttime this is what you don't want you know to relax online sleep issues you know this will help with it um during the daytime and the flip side if you're all stressed out and spazzed out this is gonna mail you out as well it's also not gonna really put you down I need to do a little bit fat of a ball and over a couple more but it was put also in this one yeah okay um okay so this really kind of makes it so it slowed me down a little bit as you can see I can't even lost for words there didn't have much to say right there um slowed me down dami medicated indica work that's nice so basically I'll get in the zone when I'm out there blowing snow look my lines are gonna be straight my driveways gonna be clear like that snows gonna be gone look like that's no up okay this is a good medication just get focused on you want just get in the zone over sign no now it's starting to kick in through my body in my face like it worked it's wet out my back a nice fine and I with the stupid [ __ ] smile like a Morgan I'll cheesy and [ __ ] that's nice I'm actually you can't really see him with [ __ ] weird hat on your [ __ ] with my eyebrows a little sweaty my head is actually getting a little hot from this so that's cool um and it's like I said indica dominant hybrid he's label as an indica but there are definitely some hybrid effects me that's coming from the lemon alien dog and um that's you know the topology that's more from the Starfighter side of it the BlackBerry cush side of it is way more of the indica dominant side with the Afghani in the blackberry and everything like that but the Schiphol cush is about I would personally say it's like a 70% in they're gonna 30% you know hybrid sativa hybrid style feel because you're getting a shitload of the ending effect put a little bit of stevedore oh now I'm getting like really heavily indicated indica indicated I'm getting indicated you know if I can have any indicated out really bad really bad and he has a little back get out third ball I feel really good right now really good action didn't [ __ ] really [ __ ] stupid and laugh he told me I guess what I just said ago with you pretty complex tone on this like letting it medicating perhaps the facts are pretty pretty nice there buddy blood spurt [ __ ] huge okay there I you definitely must shut the [ __ ] up Medicaid okay I can [ __ ] stop [ __ ] brain was but I was yes and see um I'm gonna read this all [ __ ] but oh [ __ ] it it's like a Saturday night on a job bring get [ __ ] to do you know

the calendar on this row first this plant is a hybrid that wins 66 days outdoors in a manual light deprivation hoophouse from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. temps were high at the very end of the grow but did not inhibit this feetoes ability the purple at all it's made purple from start to finish we started with a very long bench time to keep things very branching just to buy time I kept them in 2 inch nursery pots for the first two months then I upgraded to a 1 gallon fabric pot with 315 watt ceramic metal halides for another two months excusing general hydroponics Togo take an armored seat we moved there outdoors when it stopped freezing and I benched her another 6 weeks and 15 gallon pots using elite nutrients with more topping so it fit in this four-foot hoop house if you follow the elite nutrients feed chart using cocoa and perlite medium My Week would go like this I would start the week with mammoth pea and feeding and would go feed feed flush feed feed flush and then the drive a at the end middle that's where I'm good health no signs of mildew or bug infestations energy was spent well on its mini tops and purple continued into the 90 degree days even the bottom buds were bright pink instead of green the only green you'll find on this plant are on the families and sugar leaves this plant is a little bushy can benefit from some extra pruning especially around the bottoms but it was overall pretty easy to grow with an average growth rate Leafly and seed fighter don't list it in THC finder was the only one with a little information they listed as plush berry cross with blackberry push plush berry is black cherry soda cross with space Queen I thought it was a black cherry soda and a blackberry push cross so I feel like this information is correct since it's not far off of my original guest the pictures I am able to find online all look exactly like my vino and I have not found any seeds for sale so I do believe that this is a West Coast clone Oh mate flavors of this are very purple like an acai bowl or a warm berry jam harvest was averaged with a bushy plant with big colons it's spaced very well with its neighbour plants here we see the plant just after harvest prom date style next the branches are getting cleaned up for the trim some nice colas with a banana for scale sugar leaf wet trim weight was 218 grams our wet blood weight was 355 grams which is about 75% bud to 25% trim ratio after fans and tips are clipped our final yield weight was 164 grams and dry but not counting the trim which is about a 75% water reduction on the final weight the biggest complaint is this one is on the lower end of my acceptable leaf to the trim ratio it requires a little longer to process a small price to pay though for a heavy ilding purple plant buds also held a fair amount of water making them less dense after cure this plant I hope to keep around for a long time I've had a great time growing her and she tastes as good as she looks I hope you enjoyed this

with this Big Chief so extracts hypotenuse and see lab tested premium this related college okay so we got the flavor of black berry cush so this time and then yeah and it comes in this little box right here which is pretty small and then I have a pretty nice logo so it gives it a little bit of like you know looks aureus look in the back you also have the total THC total CBD and then it just tells you her grandma for blackberry cush you could also have scanned this but yeah let's open this bad boy up so so what we have here which is pretty mean I probably some of the ones I have seen around doesn't really match up to this one and it does say from Kathleen you guys can see that so it might be you know might be something else when you open it up you're gonna see this and it's like a little capsule you also got the instructions in the nozzle that gives you the flavors so a lot of flavors are that our Gorilla Glue looks good should try that one now and then the cool thing about this is that it's actually certified so for example it says right here to certify this on technically she further locate scratch sticker behind cartage and enter code so basically I was trying to figure it out what they were saying so you remove this piece off and as you guys can see it's a sticker I don't know VI elsker really see what it is about its achieve and it has like the rainbow in the back it's pretty cool you asked me and then I started scratching it but as you guys can see right here says scratch me so you go ahead and I'll scratch that off which I'm not even gonna do per I'm just trying to show you that yet oh you can take this off my - sorry and it does provide you with the code right there and then that code you can go on the page right here and then you just you know answer and so the code and I will tell you if it's authentic or it's not authentic because you know a lot of people be doing crazy [ __ ] out there crazy world but hey do your hustle get your money man ain't nobody stopping you but other than that yes so that's pretty cool you know I get a nice package gives you a way to basically see if it's authentic or not so let's put that to the side now let's focus on this bad boy so this hasn't looked a little release button ring here yes cuz see and it says push you press that and then that just releases the capsule just kept like that man there it goes so this one's pretty and it has a little like oh I took it all but I had a little cover on top so make sure it has the cover on top so yeah this is pretty much it", "15MRhN-i7Uw": "what up and welcome to another edition of canopy where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased cannabis straighten reviews so today we are going to be reviewing lemon dough by nectar farms now this was gifted to me from my boy my life in a blunt so i don't have a full eighth here to uh review for you guys but this stuff is still pretty fresh packaged on the 15th of september today you guys just so you know is the 11th of november so it's barely almost two months old which is probably a perfect cure on this stuff um now if lemondo is new to you like it is to me let's go ahead and chat about it this is a hybrid strain that is a cross between lemon skunk and og number 18 which is basically just a phenotype of og kush so let's go ahead i'm excited to try this out even though you guys know i'm not super into the lemon terps um i want to bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys and then we're going to go ahead and jump right into this thing okay so what did you guys think of this lemondo my nectar farms not too bad right this nug that i got wow now it's funny i'm not into lemon turps i just got done prefacing that but i can get down with these lemon turps it's like a doughy like a lemon cake or something it's really doughy it smells just like and oh my god okay so i'm gonna just tell you guys flat out and honest i can't tell you the last time i saw trichomes this fat on bud it's they're huge the trichomes on this nug look at how beautiful that nug is you guys these are the types of nugs you should get in the eighths that you're buying right like one and a half gram nugs or so is what you guys should be getting and honestly this stuff is so beautiful so frosty i wish there are a few more hairs that's the only complaint i have but oh my god is this stuff it's literally it's riddled in trichomes and they're big fat globular trichomes and the smell is like creamy lemon so think of like if you had like a creamsicle but lemon flavored you guys oh lemon and cream wow and i haven't even broken up this nug yet to put into the gra put into the vaporizer today i wanted to do it on screen just to see how the terps develop here so that's all i'm gonna break off of this nug you guys i'm literally gonna keep the rest of the nug intact that's what i'm gonna save from this these are nugs that i'm going to break up here and honestly that should fill up my bowl because this stuff feels pretty dense and oh my god you saw when i was pressing it down there it stuck to my finger you guys i'm barely even pressing and it's sticking to my fingers wow i'll tell you what i don't know the last time that i had blood that was almost two months old that was still sticky like this um let's go ahead and get this ground up here wow and see the flavor is probably going to develop like through the moon honestly i'm guessing you know it's weird the lemon terps are kind of subtle let's do it look at that stick test stick test look at that ganja just sticking right to my finger like that that is how it's done look at that it's all sticking together you guys oh you can't even see my finger's blocking it i'm an idiot i'm so sorry you guys that was hilarious i'm like look at look at the gun just sticking to my fingers there you go you guys sticking to my fingers just like glue oh my god maybe they should call it lemon glue because god it's just so sticky man it's funny i really i thought that this flavor would be like the terps would be way more aromatic um i thought that they would be way more aromatic after i broke up the ganja and put it into the grinder today but it really didn't didn't let out too much more flavor in all honesty um so i just want to make some notes here while i'm doing this um because i'm like you know i know i'm gonna forget something so i just wanted to take a couple notes here on the computer so today i'm going to be enjoying this lemon dough man does that smell good even if you don't like lemon terps i think you might dig that it's not like that train wrecky like reel in your face pine solid it's different um we've got this bad boy set 375 degrees fahrenheit i've got my whip the end with the screens on it that one is going to go into the bowl itself which sits right on top of the vape the other male end is going to go into my scientific inhalations triple filtered bubbler now this i'm only using two of the filtration chambers the distilled water in the bottom the organic cotton filter in the third chamber the first chamber which is in the down stem that holds carbon would prevent ash from getting in the water you know i'm not letting any ash muck up my water today so here's the deal um let's go ahead try this stuff out and see what it's all about you guys if you're ready to burn down i'm ready to vape down so let's get this party started and try out some of this lemon dough by nectar farms my boy my life in a blunt said he picked this up like five times so it had to be good let's see what it's all about wow that i barely got any vapors you guys just saw there but that lemon the lemon is art lingering on my tongue and it's nice and subtle and subdued not super in your face i didn't get a lot of vapor i might have to take three rips on screen with you guys more of that citrusy lemon it's like if pine salt was way watered down and had a little bit of creaminess to it um even that one just barely started producing vapor and that's kind of what happens you guys that's why i like to let the herbs grind up beforehand or grind them up beforehand let them heat up beforehand so that it starts releasing the actual vapor um when i start doing these hits on screen with you guys but since i'm doing it in real time it didn't have enough of a chance to warm up quite enough which is why the vapor is a little more uh subtle than thick so i'm gonna go for the third rip here wow now that one was a good rip not super buttery smooth but i don't typically find tangies or citrusy flavors buttery smooth they always have a little strangeness to them but man flavor's starting to coat my mouth and i didn't feel it really coming on just yet but i'll tell you what while i'm finishing out this bowl i'm gonna bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under the magnification of a 25 times macro lens you can get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of this stuff so here comes the lemon dough now okay so you are looking at the lemon dough by nectar farms and wow you guys look at how white this butt is it almost looks yellow here under the macro lens i love those bright orange hairs towards the bottom you guys see even towards the top now they're a little more sparse than i typically like um and they certainly are on the thinner side but my god the trichomes on this bud you guys are amazing and another thing every time we get nectar farms bud they have been manicured and trimmed just perfectly this stuff the leaves were trimmed right up to the bud a great bud structure and overall this is just some really good looking bud okay so what did you think of this lemon though under that macro lens pretty nuts right here's the deal i just had to laugh you guys because it's so funny like i'll go into the dispensary or i'll talk to my boys like yo i don't like lemons herbs i'm not really into orange chips or whatever and recently all i've been reviewing like the dispensaries sold me a bunch of lemon turps my boys are gifting me living terms and stuff and i'm like you guys you guys are killing me here give me something sweet that's not citrusy but anyways i still appreciate this bud that was gifted to me um from my life in a blunt so thank you for uh letting us do this review and sharing this with us so that we can do this review for everybody so here's the deal you guys this lemon uh dough by nectar farms is real solid it's got a lot of things going for it i do think that there's certainly some room for improvements though absolutely there's no question about it even in the category i think it did the best thing which is the looks i still think there's room for improvement so i want to talk about that but let's go ahead and get into it okay how i do my reviews all the streams are rated on a scale from 0 to 10 0 being the worst 10 meaning the absolute best i break that down to four different categories look smell taste and potency or how effective the medicine is i'll assign up to 2.5 points each in each of those respective categories tally up the total and then give you guys my final rating on this stuff so let's go ahead and get right into it i want to talk about the looks bag appeal or jar appeal of this lemon dough so let's bring it up on the screen one last time for you guys to look at and then we'll go ahead and get into my final review on this lemon dough by nectar farms okay so let's talk about it you guys this mud is so crystally it's like looking into another galaxy the bud like the trichomes are honestly some of the fattest i've ever seen nectar farms just keeps consistently putting out some of the best fieriest looking bud ever you guys and i think they were hiring uh you know at least they were in november here of 2020 when this is being recorded um i'm not sure if it's gonna get released next year or this year or what but i'll tell you guys it's beautiful looking bud the only thing that i would say it needs is more hairs like a little better proportion of the hairs on this bud and it would literally be out of control i think that the crystals are just in more proportion to the hairs and i typically like to see things in equal proportions but honestly it's better than good it's not a 2.0 it's a 2.5 because i have to round up it's not quite a 2.5 but i have to round up in this situation you guys this bud looks great covered in tri columns some of the best looking nectar farms but i've seen to date now let's go ahead and talk about the smell if you like lemon terps you're going to like this doughy version of it it's like a creamy lemon very citrusy though you guys um for me i've got to be honest even though it's just doughy i still don't think the lemon terps even with the creaminess added are dynamic enough to warrant a 2.5 i think these terps are good i don't think they're great and and that's just my generic you know i think the lemon flavor in general is just a little too plain even with that creaminess built in so i'm gonna give it a 2.0 in the smell same translates to the taste i wish it was a little different with the taste but honestly it was just lemon that whole time there was a tiny bit of creaminess there i wasn't really getting any of that kush or the pine that i was wanting from you know the uh the og-18 which is that og kush fino type so that was kind of a bummer for me so you know i wish it had more of that um and that probably would be a 2.5 in the taste if it had something like that but it was just the lemon terps they were good they lasted from the beginning till the end i could still taste them so i'm going to go ahead let's just say a 2.0 in the smell category that is not bad and the potency at first i was like it was a creeper that's what it was you guys this is a hybrid creeper i've got a good chill body effect my mind is still uplifted i'm joyful i'm happy i'm optimistic so i'll tell you i'm feeling good i'm not feeling great this isn't going to be the most potent medicine you'll ever have smoked but it is good i mean it's a 2.0 out of 2.5 so you guys that's an 8.5 it's a 2.5 in the look a 2.0 in the smell 2.0 in the taste then a 2.0 on the potency i'm sorry it wasn't a little more uh you know crazy of a review but this one was kind of a simpler one for me it was an 8.5 so the lemon dough from nectar farms is going to get canopy's thumbs up recommendation and we are definitely going to recommend this strain now here's the deal let's get to my personal recommendation am i going to recommend this strain at 50 for the 3.7 grams personally i'm not gonna recommend this strain because i don't think that the strain is dynamic enough to warrant a 50.8 even though it's a beautiful nug uh you know a couple nugs in there i just don't think it's dynamic enough for me personally to warrant that type of price so i wouldn't be picking this up again at that price but again it is going to get our recommendation 8.5 for the lemon dough from us here on canopy you know we recommend anything seven or above so thank you so much my life in a blunt for helping contribute this thank you nectar farms for continuing to put out the great quality thank you guys for your support and let me know if you guys think this is a fair review um and let me know what you guys want to see next time but until the next one you guys take care of yourselves and one another and i will see you guys soon [Music] peace", "P2cqM2eB9yI": "hey Danvers and Avenue of me mr deburr on another before you dab today we have a gram of Strawberry

and they charge me a little money for this comparison give me a ziploc bag without you guys", "mw9FvzOnLaw": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 and today we're gonna check out this fire online cannabis and the strain is gonna be blackberry chem edgy now again these guys don't give you too much information as far as like the numbers go they just provide you with the THC which they say is 23.5 and CBD which is 0.07 now there is gonna be a video linked at the bottom of this I hope that will give you the formula for figuring out true THC when companies do provide you with the THC a the actual THC and then you know you can figure out the total after that for yourself there's a couple different reasons why you want to know that and you'll figure that out in the video if you're interested and if you're not well then don't watch it anyway so we're gonna hop right into it like I said I've gotten into there's a 23% THC again this is a new company I haven't tried too much of the one thing I will know if you guys saw the other video from this company their harvest date was 5 something this one's a month after that so this thing's still just shy about 4 months shy of a year so 8 months old THC turns into CBN I between six months to a year so this is going to be interesting to see if these things are actually still potent or if the THC has now converted into CBN and with that we're just gonna hop right into it these guys do have score marks and as you guys know I always love to have them probably only gonna say that a couple more times and then I'm gonna stop just because it's gonna get annoying for you guys I'm sure anyway so first of all I'm gonna tell you guys this stuff smells stinky I can smell it from here before it's even up to my face and it's got some definite like pungent this to it some some stinky stinky so this wow that's weird that's like feet slash incredibly dry still oh so this is a mix so this is since it's a chem dog mix it's got that like nasty nasty like sour chem dog smell I want to say nastiness is a good thing to me by the way I don't know if you've ever nevermind I'm not even gonna make that joke trying to make this a family-friendly cannabis show come on so okay yeah so this is definitely it has more of the chem dog smell to it a little bit of I think the blackberry cuts into the chem dog smell and gives it that little bit of a sweet kind of edge torque to it towards the end of the snow of the sniff or snuff yeah the end of the whiff if that makes sense if not then just once you guys pick this up you'll see what I mean but these things are frosty the nugs are kind of dense but they are still incredibly dry again and had I paid attention I would recommend that you guys don't pick something up that has a harvest date that's six months or older just because there's a good chance that it could have degraded as far as like THC content and all that but with that I'm gonna go ahead and try this and I'll be back with you guys in a day or so to let you know how it went hey guys what's up so I went ahead and tried that BlackBerry cam og and like I said I was kind of skeptical about it like not working but I'm actually really surprised it did the job really really well it was a really strong stony product it gave you like the really tired behind the eyes effect and like right away and it just kind of hung out I I'll explain to you guys how I smoked it so the night before we tried the green ribbon and that stuff absolutely no high one so ever so the next morning I was like well this stuff's a month newer you know or a month yeah I guess I'm month younger than the last stuff we were assuming that it was gonna give us the same effect so we had it at 6 o'clock in the morning and know this thing is a knockout it made us want to like curl up in a ball and go to bed I think my girlfriend actually took a nap before she went to work on that day and so the butt itself was really strong as far as the flavor goes the there there wasn't much of one there was a slight sweetness but outside of that most of the stuff is already gone it's been like I said eight months since it was harvested so I wasn't expecting too much in either high or flavor due to the packaging and how long it's been but with that I mean again I'm on the fence on this one I would say if you see it for a decent enough price and you feel like you want to try it I would go ahead and pick it up it does actually get you high but if you can avoid buying anything that's over six months old you know eight months is you know it is really the cutoff for me personally but yeah just let me know if you guys end up trying it it if you don't or I mean if you do and then like what your reactions were on what not if you guys agree with me if you guys don't think it's so stony or maybe it was even stronger than I think it is because you know again THC is deteriorated by now but with that this has been recreational for Tony I hope you guys enjoyed that and I'll be back again with you guys soon", "YHGFkl2BueY": "everybody to do is nothing on my clothes well blackberry push you don't see the half purple stems every single one is

was kind of a funny one because I bought this in October of 2018 I had to look at the date and I put the package in the book and totally forgot to review it um left the the concentrate and everything in the book so it was kind of funny I was like okay well I guess we have another grammar works so I decided today we are gonna go ahead and send that one out we're going to do that review considering it is so old sadly and for that I apologize but I swear almost every week I end up putting weed in the book and forgetting about it concentrate in the book and then forgetting that it's there and I'll go to do something and it'll fall out of the book and I'm like oh yeah I forgot about that cause what I've done with the review I packaged it all up put it in a book take the book inside and if I don't pull it out of the book right away I totally forget about it so yeah um there's one more thing I wanted to try here okay we are almost done one more and we will get on with this [Music] and post we are done let's do this hey Angie how you doing today are you having a great day what do you guys smoke in all right we're doing this so today is Kimball Kush I bought this again back in October and I wrote it up and did everything with it and totally forgot about it in a book never did the video never did anything so we're doing it a day we're probably gonna try to run through this pretty quick because it looks like it's gonna rain on us over there over here it's pretty cloudy it's pretty dark no it's I can see the clouds out they're starting to move pretty fast I can see my little trees and stuff the winds starting to kick up so we're gonna kind of run through this as quickly as possible so I'm gonna go ahead and pull a little bit off of here and we're gonna go ahead and test her out I have my new trusty dusty email here with me today so as always guys [ __ ] cancer Oh oh so yummy so very very yummy I me do get a pepper burn in the back of your throat with this one but she has kind of a sweet berry herbal spicy taste to her she's really good so let's go ahead and talk about her real quick so she's Kimble cooks cuz she is a 70/30 into the hybrid she comes from the platinum berry push and Starfighter we got this from Arizona organics your THC level is about 27% or it's 27 to 29 percent with a CVT rated level of 1% this is a nice good thick snap and pull you can see it's a nice golden brown see you there so this is a super potent indica dominant hybrid that placed at the 2014 Seattle cannabis cut cut see I'm a cannabis cup it is great for insomnia the effects of this are relaxed happy uplifted sleepy and giggly I medicinally to treat stress insomnia pain fatigue depression PTSD a DD ADHD cancer those types of things she has a really good very sweet almost there's like a vanilla hit in there with his spiciness and that herbal taste so it's kind of trying to think this one would be really good in like a good honey that you're gonna put in your tea that would taste amazing in because it just it has that right flavor to blend in with it well I can see little dream drops coming down so let's go ahead and hit this real quick because we're gonna get wet if we don't [ __ ] cancer guys yeah so let me get to your comments real quick doing good how's your pain level today today I'm at an eighth a little bit of nausea really tired for some reason I have been I've had that nausea all morning so I've been able to chew kind of snack on a little bit of angel food cake that has nothing on it just plain angel food cake um and that kind of helps well thank you I was something different I saw it on on a YouTube video and I thought I could do that I'm sorry like put it up real quick and I'm like I like that so I'm like okay I made my own ears today instead of wearing any kind of fun thank you so this is it for today guys I'm sorry this is going to be a fast video because it is starting to sprinkle and I really don't want to get wet I have electronics and email and stuff out here so as always guys as always guys are Olivia um but that's it for today mmm I will see you guys tomorrow on eleven have a great morning I'm gonna get out of the rain bye guys", "u9FFum6r2x8": "good morning YouTube we are here sorry guys I am video camera so sorry about the noise is there is a bunch of construction and equipment going on around me today so I apologize so I will make this review as quick as possible because we have another box unboxing interview this morning so hopefully between all the noise so today we are reviewing black and blue from Wickenburg alternative medicine so here is what we have so the bud is actually a little darker than what it would normally be because I'm gonna head and activated this bud prior to putting it in this bottle I will be showing you guys all about so this will actually make my a little bit you have a contest coming this week we are giving away this Venetian $50.00 grinder it's the large back grinder so the giveaway is August 30th join this dense crystal covered into custard raid is as well as a mixture a blackberry and EJ shorts blueberry so it's a black and a blueberry tends to party at the aroma and flavor balance by sweet berries and skunk thanks to its strong into the body effects and strength is often recommended for treatments of pain insomnia not those types of items which is also important so I'm just particular one the effects that we're gonna be looking at our relaxed happy uplifted euphoric and sleepy additionally treat pain stress insomnia depression and inflammation and the negatives on this but of course like everything else is dried milk right I'd still be headache parent and paranoia so let's test her so she has a really very skunky aroma and this is a little bit harsher because I did activate all of the cannabis but before putting it in here and actually this one's kind of fighting because the way that I activated it which you guys will see all about next week I can actually take the flower bud [Music] an intimate eat it and get the same medicinal effects as I would is if I'm smoking just takes a little bit longer so yes I just ate the cannabis itself vegan it's actually very good it's great anti-inflammatory properties there's a lot of really good things to do when you're eating the cannabis law if you think about it in the wild animals eat cannabis raw just the same way and they get that medicinal qualities out of your smoking before smoking it you will release more of the drippings that are in it you will release a little bit more of the psychoactive effects that are about it oh I forgot my tray because these grinders suck are you doing two things sweetie it's been surreal I had to relook at your name again and make sure that I've said Michelle in a twinkle okay now that I'm gonna throw this everywhere because I am just not coming a day of it I feel like I do bring your tray with me because I say not as I do okay so this is going to have a browner less green book to her purely because I did activate her before grinding her up and I'm gonna go ahead and use my little bit Kabong that I got out of the daily high club just because it's so cute so to kind of give you an idea of the difference between activating my cabinets and not activating with cannabis before and after using or before using is I get an immediate hit to the dome with this basically what that means is I get the immediate euphoric effect to my head which helps with that pain in that nausea right away so I don't have to wait for that anti nausea effects that I'm meeting me so much most of the time which is what I find absolutely amazing so if you do have the Naza to the distance and the problems that I do getting are activating your cannabis before smoking it would be extremely useful and I'm gonna show you guys next week exactly how I do it that we you guys have the whole nine yards to make it easy for everybody I just wanted to try it a few times to get used to it see how it works yeah I can give you guys more of a full of of why doing it is such a great thing so you guys know I have been without cannabis for the last week which has been horrible absolutely horrible it is been health that is why I haven't really been on too much lately I have been in a lot of pain I've been very very nauseous I had this wonderful habit of over paying my bills sometimes to care I over send money on my bills and forget that I have other things that paper do so whereas you always have internet on electricity and water and places live and those types of things I don't always have a medicine that I need to help get me through I'm getting better at it but I do have hard time with it it's one of those things I really hard to make balancing is not eating the sand anymore so that's why I do this oh now after I activated this particular bud this really cool thing happened this aroma comes out of it so I'll just sit here and I will literally just sit and smell the but if all I have to do is just smell it and it'll automatically start calming my nerves down I'm not getting any of the effects from it because it's just a sensory memory for me so by smelling it I can start relaxing and calming and bringing some of the effects of the flower that I know I'm gonna get into play as I'm smoking it the other things that we do quite often is we will bounce back and forth between our concentrates and our per hour forgetting sometimes that if let's say like I spent the whole last month revealing nothing but concentrates it takes a lot more flour to get the same effect as that concentrate would so taking a whole week off of cannabis last week kind of brought me back into play with my flower which is really kind of not ease one of the other things that I really really noticed with activating my flower before smoking it was we did this last night and my husband and I sat down to smoke it like we normally do together tour we can kind of get a really good blend of what the cannabis is doing for him I can see [Music] and if you want somebody at home or a significant other that's pretty quiet not real talkative unless they get into something that they really don't know about after eating your flower I noticed opened up a whole new conversation he talked to me more last night about parking a bus and he's talked to me about anything in Ohio which is kind of funny because we we talk all the time and we talk about nothing all the time which is really good and very healthy for everybody involved getting this good balance of of an intelligent Jabbar as well as a very intelligent unintelligible Jabbar going about is a good thing getting that good laughter going on it's free and get those endorphins out helps get that duck egg that negativity out it helps raise that depression level up toward your not as depression on a sluggish you're not as I guess this is really what you want to say it so in calculating this cannabis beforehand I found that that kind of helped to bring that a wet quicker so I highly recommend doing this now when we do this next week because I'm going to show you guys this whole drawn-out thing and different ways to do it I never recommend activating all your cannabis all the things only activate what you're going to use if you open if you over activate it it is going to go stale and it's not gonna taste good quickly so I have found a few things and a few tips that we're gonna do for that next week which I'm really excited about I'm also gonna introduce you a new company around to help you with some of this stuff too which I find really cool I'm really hoping that they get on the end of making some videos with some of their product because I can really see a lot of possibilities with this particular product so I'm excited I am I really can't wait so I have one more video to do for you guys today we do have another unboxing today it is not the product that I was just talking about

recommend them big chief in hollow point broke on me i haven't even had it for a couple hours won't come off stuck to there waste of money don't get it", "IcMmrCyvk7g": "hey everybody my name is Julie ahem and this is the hemp reports brought to you right here at hhc plus dispensary in Los Angeles ok so today we're going to concentrate on talking about all the myths out there about medical marijuana and you're in for a treat we're also going to contrast compare the different strains of indica sativa and hybrid a lot of our viewers have been asking us what is the difference between all the strains of medical marijuana like indica sativa and hybrid I mean medical marijuana is just a medical marijuana right oh no my friend you are definitely green if you think so so let me school you indica if you were to smoke that it would probably have you couch logged staring at the wall thinking all sorts of crazy things contemplating life whereas sativa it's more of them it took an active milk marijuana if you need to get out do things run some errands get some things done in your life then sativa strange for you or if you're just creating you one at all I try the hybrid because that's a little bit of a myth cannabis use causes crime mm-hmm fat a lot of people think that people who use cannabis are aggressive and they go out and they cause crimes however scientific research has proved just the opposite in this area cannabis use actually reduces people's aggression so you're less likely to go out and cause a crime which means that just because most of the laws of outlaw cannabis use people are considered criminals just for possessing it I mean think about this isn't it so much more fun to smoke a little weed and have some sex then go out and rob someone yeah so here we have two different strains of the indica this is the Skywalker and this is the OB one just look at the green texture in the beautiful red and orange hairs if you look a little bit closer you can see a frosty coating of key from the obi-wan there will be one and the Skywalker are very potent strains that will have you walking on cloud nine and you can get either one for a donation of about forty five dollars for an eight or $57 45 grams however the obi-wan is an exclusive strain just for our sponsor h HC plus it's very potent and it's a very distinctive hi much more so than the Skywalker myth cannabis use causes apathy and lack of motivation fat actually studies done on subjects who are given high doses of cannabis over days or a period of weeks shows that they don't have any lack of motivation and they're still able to perform you know what I mean however as with any intoxicating substance prolonged use and abuse will cause you to not function normally and also case studies have shown that men who often use cannabis often up higher paying jobs so what does this mean this means that they could pay for our dinners here we have two different strains of sativa we have the blue dream and we also have the sour diesel so for the blue dream you can see that it has a frosty appearance almost like it has a white coating the sour diesel on the other hand you can tell is much darker green and Oh much more pungent aroma this one has a much stronger sativa which means that sour diesel will put you in like a dreamlike state however unlike the OB one with this one you actually be able to get out of bed in the morning both go for about different donations the blue dream is about forty dollars for an eighth but nounce $52 45 grams the sour diesel on the other hand is a little bit more affordable goes for about thirty-six dollar for an eighth of an ounce and $45 45 grams but cannabis is a gateway drug in other words people use cannabis tend to move on to more potent drugs fat actually for most people cannabis is a terminus drug not a gateway drug for users of hard drugs such as heroin or LSD it has shown that they have used cannabis in the past however that's just toying with the statistics the numbers are way too small when comparing cannabis users and hard drug users so actually there's no link at all finally we have the hybrids here we have the blackberry kush and over here the Turkish blend the blackberry kush is probably the most beautiful strain you can tell because almost all the buds are coated with frosty THC this gives it the perfect texture not to dance then also not too light and not too fluffy this will give you a very strong high basically the best of both worlds a strong indica body high coupled with an energetic sativa kick over here the Turkish blend is very similar to the blackberry in appearance has the purple buds and it's nice and crisp however this gives you a very fast-acting body hi but won't leave you couch locked the blackberry kush is a donation of forty dollars for an 8th announced $52 45 grams however the Turkish blends is a donation of thirty-six dollars from 8th announced and 45 45 grams myth we makes you horny and increases your sexual performance but no actually I mean it's not a myth it's fat so what did we learn today well basically we learned that not all medical marijuana is the same and if you try different strains you'll probably feel very different with each one so what I would suggest to you is you stop by our sponsor h hd+ and you experiment with a couple of the strains yourself because you'll probably find one that fits just your personal needs oh and don't forget to tell them that julia have sent you you just might get a personal gift from me also don't forget to

the last video and some up some weed this is my bunk Roma I don't know if I've used it on the channel except the 10 second length videos that I have occasionally but this is karma um it's I don't i feel like i have talked about it but if I haven't and here it is it's really pretty it has like color-changing going on I'm it used to be all blue but now it's like a rains and stuff because it's been used so many times but I think it's really cool actually really like that about some of the glass my bowls are really really cool uh here I'm are shown to you it has the little bubbles and stuff and like the orange and tryna like folks it their focus almost focus on this focus on this it's so hard to get my camera focused but yeah and already have a bowl of blackberry kryptonite packed and that's what we're going to be doing today we're gonna review blackberry kryptonite it's a hybrid I believe it's around 50 50 of sativa indica I actually know I probably should know about ramp but I don't haha oh um I'm clearly not high but I'm so excited to be right now I'm actually gonna be writing at some point because I've been writing lyrics recently that's fun to do and yeah you know Michael Buble currently used to have the water comes out actually sorry you anyways let's move somebody shadow late I'm gonna try and make the light brighter think that worked I keep looking at myself because okay i'm using my phone camera for these videos because my quality actually isn't about and this is so sounds good too but because the camera is on one side of the phone I'm always like looking at the screen that's in the middle because I'm used to looking directly in the middle sometimes I don't look at I look at myself and not the camera still but I usually in the range but the cameras over here think anyways okay I'm going to summon winged I'm this then we'll continue okay there's a bunch of smoke trapped in the chamber and if you can see that it was really funny um Wow hell I'll show you some of the I'll show you to you since we're doing a whole review and stuff I'll show use on my lugs so as I talked about in the last video it is kind of dry but that's just the thing though the person that I got it from had it dry but this is what it looks like it's really really green and really have a bunch little brown hairs on it here I'm trying to like it doesn't wanna focus but there's a little looks like Israel Biron ugh it smells kinda like coffee it smells really really sweet actually like that the little nugs they I mean it obviously sounds like weed but you've acted she does smell pretty sweet as well really nice and he really see but a little brown little hairs like it does on this one as you can see it's really really heavy crystals which is really awesome and really nice it actually fits you rawhide because that's how it works and yeah I really like this train actually um I'm not high so let's keeps nothing but um it's good it's a good strange school wow they really smell sometimes oh and my chamber is so full of smoke and I'm not mentally the very very good so let's wait a second I want you to sit a beverage because I'm bow so I'm just like everybody benefit of being in the bathroom there's a sink writer so do some more and if you don't like tap water well it might use the word by Mike at borders perfectly fine my third time in a hard time right now happens either haven't let me shave my lighter this video's being really long so who's long I can wrap it up in the next man anyways it has a little picker a bowl bigger in it until you how's the good weed leaf will double own stuff it's actually mega rutlander i got for christmas the same chemicon my bong crib a different friend never little bit it's a clipper grand i definitely recommend this brand I'm not getting [ __ ] sponsored though clipper brand if you somehow see this video send me a ton of these and I'll talk about all the time cuz i love these letters but ok we're take one more head give a general review i'm working in this video let's do this pray for me not really alright so blackberry kryptonite is what we're stuck in here I give it I'm four and a half out of five little marijuana leaves um cuz it's actually really good and I think I'm gonna get it again because hopefully it's more moist that's my only problem with it but I think that's my fault because of who I got it from or the person i got it from yeah i do get it legally though so do not worry I am a legal come on Miss little marijuana smoker so I'm doing it perfectly fine and I do actually use it for medicinal reasons not gonna lie to you I give because high beam is really fun I do use it cuz it actually really helps things I pionship so anyone who tells you it doesn't just [ __ ] bullshitting you and stuff stretch um but i think is a really good screen and to recommend checking it out if you like high ridge I really love hybrids market like roses in Dickens TV I just like both right um",

the case may be so today i kind of have a weird review it's actually a really cool weird review um so this is two different strains that were put together um so what i kind of did was i kind of wrote both strings up and we'll do a little bit of a comparison and see how it adds up how it stacks um so this is called potent planet concentrates i had to tape it i was trying to tape it so everybody could see what it looked like together but it's actually kind of cool this way so let me show you what the product is [Music] like it doesn't look right but it is actually for concentrate just chicken okay so this is potent planet this is um jelly sickle and applesauce i would have never thought but okay um i did try a little bit of it it has a really really great flavor um so let's just go ahead and jump into this so this is the actual product itself real pretty golden color and it comes in with this little top on this little round container this little square container if i know my my little shapes here little square container cute cute cute and then just you guys can see that the sticker here that's potent planet what this retails for is um 45 dollars a gram so i thought i'd figure i'd share that with you and then this is just the cutest thing this wraps up their little concentrate just kind of really cute now it's sprinkling outside as i'm sitting here quiet not not not really seeing anything quiet obviously the um yeah i can hear it raining outside so earlier we have automatic vent colored covers and i'm the only one home right now the dogs are out there and they've been just like snoozing because it's almost dinner time um and the vent just starts going i'm like what the hell it scared the [ __ ] out of me it took me a minute i'm like oh yeah hmm the vent my bad so funny funny we're just going to jump right into this i'm trying to get everything set up so i have everything i need in the same spot so i have my my hand attended pad here so that way i can have the information that i need at my hands in case i lose the string information i have it written up on the website i can pull it up this way it makes it easier it also makes it a lot easier to see my com to see comments so that we if you guys are submitting something while i'm on a live i can see it here better and it's actually really kind of cool so that was neat this was it's actually kind of funny i had the very first galaxy tab available that you could buy very first one and i it's been five ten years five seven years um since that one had come out well we had we paid off we've had it and we kept using it until the screen broke about three months ago so i called in and i'm like okay the screen broke on this this pad and she's like oh wow okay so we don't even sell that pad anymore so she found the closest comparison and it's the s4 samsung s4 and the cool thing about having you know is not an up-to-date generation is this case with the keyboard and everything came all together with oh no this came with the pen you did actually if this was the pad um for 14 bucks i had to pay my 150 dollar deductible through verizon but other than that fifty you were golden so and we got we got four generation upgrades so it was kind of cool i mean isn't the newest thing out there but it does serve the purpose that i need so i like that but it's kind of like you know you got a free upgrade so it's kind of cool because now you don't get stuff like that very often so guys don't forget to slam that like button don't forget to hit that share button and the subscribe button to join the luigi family here on youtube i am here monday through friday hopefully i will be back in schedule and try and get myself every day at 10 a.m it has been okay this week i had i'm trying i'm getting there so um it was a very long very long hard summer and kind of winter and and and today's inauguration day and i'm like oh my god so i have completely stayed away from news channels social media i'm doing this i'm even taping this so i don't have to go online to actually pull it up because i just i don't want to see it right now i can't handle it so i'm just you know sweeping under the carpet and saying okay you know something one day hopefully please so today we are going to do this a different way we are going to first okay let's let's taste her so as always [ __ ] anxiety [ __ ] depression foot cancer and was a good and outward bad [Music] like i forgot what i say honestly this strain it has it really does have a good flavor the problem with it is when you do that first time inhale it kind of kind of it gives you that feeling or that taste of like having to eat soap if you've ever had you know been fed soap when you were a kid for lion or anything like that that's kind of what it tastes like but then it has this very sweetness and then there's this burn that comes right after and wow um it's okay right now it's clean very very clean tasting very good well let's see very good in that soapy candleway it's not i mean it it's definitely different i'm really quiet you can hear the ring hitting oh so okay today we're how we're gonna do this is i'm gonna i wrote up applesauce strain and then jelly breasting and we're gonna kind of just do both of them so we're going to start with the highest potency both of these are an indica dominant hybrid so we start with the highest potency and we go to the lowest potency so we can kind of do a mix match here so jelly's breathing is a 90 10 indica hybrid now that's the high number you want to look for i'm not looking for thc levels right now i'm not looking for anything else all i want to know is indica sativa because i need to see where that's going to add more or take away so it's a 90 10 indica hybrid indica hybrid comes from mendo's breath and docidos um this one came from potent planet um it usually has between a 30 and 33 percent thc level i have not been able to find an actual um test result on this maybe i will see if i contact potent plan and see maybe they got one they probably do um let's uh yeah overall jim she has a good look to her she she definitely has that golden diamonds going on um i don't know how to you know that you're going to have for this for her if it's just jelly breath strain you're gonna have a very flowery fruity sweet with that herbal burn which is where i think that one comes from so her effects are body high euphoria relaxing and tingly medicinally to treat chronic pain cramps depression fatigue and spat muscle spasms oh excuse me uh she is known for her fruity flavor excuse me she can have a burn at times you will feel a lifted onset that fills the back of your neck and the head with light tingles she is super relaxing strain that will have you snuggling up with a movie in no time so applesauce strain is a 60 40 indica hybrid so we have 50 or i'm sorry 30 points different so you're gonna drop your 90 15 points so this one should have a thc running rate should have a thc rating of about 72 give or take so we're looking at a 70 70 30 indica hybrid possibly um you're also going to water down that thc or the thc level concentrates because you have 19 and 26 versus they're 30 and 33. so that's going to knock that down a bit and you see how i did the math to begin with so you can do that for have at that so this one you're going to feel this thickening stimulating creative both of them run down that that path of this um she is applesauce strain a 64gb constrain black she comes from blackberry rush and [Music] ultraman strains this comes from potent planet concentrates she has a 19 to a 26 thc level um thick diamonds yellow light light golden um diamonds the effects of this are going to be of body high cerebral creative hungry relaxing uplifting medicinally to treat appetite loss depression headaches mood swings and nausea so i mean these both have very very good effects to them it should pass on to the combination of whatever this would make however i believe and i could be wrong that the way the way that it's written up has me believed that they just kind of added the two together which is fine makes sense i understand they are within the same boundaries they're going to do about the same thing so it's not going to hurt anything also with either well yeah either strain you could use it as an rso obviously jelly's breast strain would be a better choice for rso given that it is a 90 10 indica hybrid the higher the indica it is the better it is for cancer relief and basically a lot of things happen during that time for the first week or two you're just going to sleep that's all you're going to do enjoy it that's what your body needs give your body what it needs let it start healing from the inside out um it's a different thing to try to do i mean it's completely different than how we did um our actual cancer treatment so i'm thankful that this was so much easier and i'm mad that this was so much easier because this has been around since inception basically and it's been outlawed but it has so many cure possibilities and helps can help and has helped so many different people so it does hit me on the anger part of it it angers me that so many good people went to prison just for cannabis related crimes that should have never happened um rick simpson himself um in canada ended up having a tribunal and he got in trouble legally for the cannabis and all he was trying to do was help um his friends and his neighbors and stuff you know with curing their cancer and it doesn't always work so please don't think oh my god it always works i'm gonna do this it it works a lot um and it's definitely worth a try but it doesn't cure everything just like no but not you know we can't it doesn't mean it doesn't work for everything sadly also if you are depending upon um dispensaries to get your rso2 you need to start asking some harder questions ask them how their rso is made rso in order to have true um rso true cancer fighting rso that is made purely from bud okay know that this is not a cheap process no it is not um economically feasible for dispensaries to try to do that um so most of the time there are as much there are rsos made from trim basically what that does is that throws little buds little popcorn buds in there it throws stems and leaves and other things into this whole bunch and then they make this rs or this this it's actually cannabis oil is what they're making now cannabis oil is an amazing product it will help you with pain it'll help you with some inflammation it'll help i mean it has a lot of great benefits that's why i'll go into a dispensary i'll ask them you know the important questions and i'll always find out nope it's not actually true or rso but i will still end up buying it the reason being is sometimes the pain gets to the point where it's just more than i can handle i can't do anything else so cannabis oil has a great pain um fighting quality and it it works better if you ingest it so i will take an entire syringe of rso which is one gram and i will shoot it right down my mouth because that's what's going to help my body in the long run that's what's going to help most of the people's bodies in the long run but please please please be sure that if you are buying a product that has that name on it and you are not buying that product from phoenix tears you are probably not getting true rso i'm sorry to say that but that is just kind of how it works um and so we've been trying to get some of that information out so everybody knows um these things are cannabis oil versus rso um and you know we're not asking you to do anything major just change the package let people know hey sorry cannabis oil not ourselves that's really all it is it's no big deal it just i think it's something that would be the appropriate thing to do so especially if somebody is counting on that to save their life and they're like oh somebody so-and-so used it for my cancer for the type of cancer i have then they go to the dispensary they pick up this product thinking okay i've heard i've heard i've heard all of these wonderful things and it's gonna do something and then it doesn't do anything and they're like what the hell why did it help her and not me so it that is probably because of the rso it is made from trend and not from buddy exclusively so the reason why trend cuts the rso is because a lot of times what you where what you're going to find in that in that trend is those sticks in those leaves what those sticks and those leaves have that you don't want in your rso is cbd cbd if you don't know can counter a lot of those psychedelic effects that you're going to get so like the sleeping the food the hunger those types of things you could take cbd after doing a dab and it would take a lot of that high away from you it does the same thing with um rso if you put all of that into a mixture with cannabis oil or with you know a little bit of bud you're overwhelming the oil with our with uh cbd what that does is it's still a very healthy thing to do but that cbd counteracts pthd so that's kind of how that works so the one thing i have been forgetting to say is hey guys don't forget to hit that thumbs up button don't forget to subscribe button don't forget to hit that share button and join the league's family here on youtube we are hopefully going to be here every day at 10. hopefully keep freezing i'm trying let's see what she's like one thing i will say with this particular product a little goes a long freaking way i ended up getting one that my husband actually did it he got this big old thing of it on the on our little dab thing here and wow yeah he really did it wow so you know guys as always [ __ ] cancer [ __ ] anxiety [ __ ] depression in with the good and out with the bad yeah i did it she really does have a lot of really i mean the flavor is really good kind of resembles applesauce too [Music] oh okay is that time again um we are going to hit whoops the end the the edibles basket deep go away that one actually really burned the back of my throat it is very relaxing i mean i could like close my eyes and sit back and listen to a book or something right now really pretty easily i didn't fall asleep but i could do it okay our basket is getting lesser and so strawberry lemonade gummies or watermelon gummies let's do watermelon so these are watermelon cooler gummies from reaper reaper reefer gladness crave the flav it looks like there's a hundred milligrams in this bag so i'm going to assume that there are 10 gummies at 10 milligrams apart okay so we have um this diffused by 324.21 the amount of grams and then it's got a qr code and it's got two of them review me and crave the flavor to check that out and see what it's all about allergen information this product is manufactured in a facility that processes other products which may contain soy dairy wheat peanuts tree nuts and eggs and may contain traces of all of the above nice nice nice so then of course you gotta reach children and any other unauthorized individual made with bio thc full spectrum we are going to have to figure out how to use equal spectrum so while we're waiting let's find out what that is so we got this one right bio iot dammit [Music] thc okay it's an isolated so however it's used mostly with cbd i want to figure out cool things so we are going to try us a watermelon so that i got off on a tangent do that every now and again holy okay okay i'm completely confused now so there is definitely more than ten pieces in here um maybe they're five milligrams a piece and there's twenty that's possible but it doesn't say how many are on the bag and all it says is 100 milligrams so i'm assuming that it's a completely 100 milligrams per bag which would make sense so i will figure that out we have another bag of them to review so these are are not these are like a homemade soft gelatin gummy it's got the sugar sprayers that is this is a package that is the so let's see which tastes like and you don't taste sweet so i'll give it that you don't taste that at all they're not bad um i think i would have added a little bit more flavoring to them but they're not bad and definitely subtle um they have an odd texture to them so if you are one of those people that has a texture thing that a certain textures you don't get along with and it has to do with that soft gelatin type of textures you don't want to stay away from this because this one definitely is but it does have a good flavor you don't taste the weed so this bio bio thc what is obviously something that's really good because you don't taste the thc at all so yeah great stuff like it we will try the other flavor that we got uh tomorrow probably and i hope you guys have a great day as always mad love and i will see you guys tomorrow", "W1dvbka924Y": "[Music] what's going on dickweeds today

__ ] so let's drain do this again very cush I give it a four and a half out of five it's not the best I've ever had but it sure as [ __ ] isn't the worst it's very good stuff it's really good stuff I would buy it again now the reason I never give these strains and number five a five yeah the reason I never give them a five it's because you know not one time in your life you had that really good weed it was almost like it came from outer space you know I'm talking about it was like better than anything you ever had and then you just never ever find that weed again no matter how hard you look you could just never find it you know I'm talking about until I find that [ __ ] again I can't I can't give anything else in number five you know what I mean so I give these all four and a half out of five because they're really good and yeah they're close to the five they're just not the five you know what I mean anyway the reason I'm saying that is somebody commented under my harmony review and said they don't like what didn't say it don't like they said that all my reviews give I like it a little bit about [ __ ] it up I hate doing these reviews the second time over you know what I mean I've already had this done anyway someone said I always give a four and a half out of five and well that's the reason now you know why if you don't like the four and a half foot of five I give it a 9 out of 10 if that sounds better for you or to you or Alvia say it hey you want me to talk more about the color I usually say it's green because it's green today it had three colors it was green purple and had some red hairs as you seen you want me to talk about the taste it's smoky it tastes like marijuana hey it's got a smoky marijuana taste in this case it's got a smoky berry marijuana taste hey and you wanted me to talk about the high I'm high as [ __ ] and I have the munchies I just need a [ __ ] cheeseburger tasted awesome I was dry as [ __ ] I opened up a pop I only got about that much left and yeah I feel calm and happy and relaxed and I feel all kinds of things all good though hey let's get another bomb coke how about that one more Blanco it's so dry you can crumble it up with your fingers thing and it burns just nice yep a smoky berry taste maybe a little of something else but I can't place it but yeah smokey berry it's very smoky eh I love that sounded right but yeah you know what I mean I don't know what else I can say about it it's a plant get you really high it's smooth is [ __ ] the bomb I gotta clean my bong today looks like dehydrated piss again eh [ __ ] sakes no wasting a and yeah yeah berry cush is very good hey it's very good stuff head over a can of Bibble and get yourself some you will not be disappointed and yeah I don't really know what else to say about it I think I covered everything the taste the color I said something else I think I wrote down the little things here the taste the color layout of the high and the reading the four-and-a-half you want it to be out of ten so nine out of ten so it's a four and a half out of five or nine out of ten is what I give it Hey now everybody can understand today is that like the marijuana metric system or something so people like it to be out of five so people like it to be out of ten I don't even know if any of that just made sense [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah man go buy some it's good and yeah anyway I'm gonna [ __ ] off out of here and go wash the old meat cigarette because I got started another video for you guys and I'm gonna keep smoking this [ __ ] throughout the rest of the day so if I didn't answer any questions here maybe I'll answer something over there for you hey in the next video probably not but I'll still be smoking this stuff so whatever and yeah so until next time like subscribe and [ __ ] off hey", "ujO4oLo-CZY": "hello youtube we have a couple strains for you from berno heights collective all right so we have here ingrid we had it a long time ago it was fire it

blackberry and diamond doji guys when I say this one's one of my on my top list is it's up there it's up there with the Viper cookies very strong screen I smoked it once before I remember why when I smoked it because it was last year on my birthday that I smoked it and this stuff is delicious so when I saw it on the menu my patient station I had to grab it let's get into a smell test guys oh my god so pungent very musky earthy smell I also got a little bit of berry but it's very pungent one of those that I really like I love the pungent smells I love the ones you just open it and you just smell it everywhere but yeah guys I have some close-ups and these close-ups are so nice this but is very camera friendly nice and frosty purple and I hope you enjoyed those close-up guys [Music] all right guys before we give into a taste test I hope everyone had a Merry Christmas hope we got to spend time with their families and I hope you got everything you wanted for me just hanging out with my

right I ended up just leaving with some more butane for my torch I forgot something but Cheers [Music] YUM has a musky taste to it some people don't like that taste much every now and then I like it I like the earthy taste though this really musky sometimes I don't like it but still very good [Music] all right guys I'm definitely um another this is a strain that is going to give you the munchies guys this definitely one of those that helped with my appetite I have a really weird appetite some days I can go so you know barely eating and I know it's really bad and sometimes you know the weed help you this one is one that really helps me I get the munchies right away after I smoke a bowl alive my stomach is grumbling so it's definitely good for those of you who camp you know get an appetite for sure it's also one that definitely starts the giggles it's a good uplifting indica it also gives you that good you know relax feeling while you have that you know uplifting giggly high so it's pretty much one of my favorite guys I love those in because that you know give you that good uplifting high but you also feel relaxed yeah guys [Music] and nugs definitely remind me of blackberry

guess you did it too from the blackberry because blackberry is very musky ten on the smell guy on taste I sign up got I got a harsh feeling when you smoke I'm not a big fan of those on the high wouldn't have to give it a 9 out of 10 you know it's for me it's definitely good for my appetite it's a the strain that will give you the giggles finding random [ __ ] really funny I I'm just watching

do another video stream that we got for today is rainbow sherbert wonderful strain wave of sherbert is blackberry cross with champagne and I've had champagne before I didn't know what was in it but from what I understand champagne is Ashplant cost of OG Kush and blackberry is mental / Cross Fit mental diesel so some good strains and in here and the straighter stuff is pretty stony definitely in

relaxing there's crash with this there's munchies there cottonmouth munchies were pretty strong cottonmouth was it's pretty strong to crash if you're comfortable I'm in occator with this I went to the mall they're all kind of cruising around chill at home never had any problems wonderful day today and this strain is wonderful to just tons of coffee that's the only team other than that really wonderful strain I would get this began if it wasn't this crumble stuff Frick this I don't like this stuff well this crumble stuff it's like freaking sand well you know what that is man I've had a few times but it's like when I go if I go to the dispensary and I'll see it there I won't get it but I don't see like this one it was close though if I were to know your was this I wouldn't have gotten this the only thing I liked it that shatter I like that stuff anyhow wonderful string good effects pain relief it's wonderful highest grade even though it's super stony your fully functional you know it's great I think but I would get this again yeah as long as it wasn't this crumble it was something else totally would but yeah good stock great string", "3guvZL6nOpk": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 and today we're gonna check out this what does that say right there BlackBerry cookies by house uncle and so let's hop right into the numbers so first off you see the THC a comes in a twenty four point oh nine THC is one point four three percent with the total coming in at twenty two point five six now if you don't understand why there's three different numbers 14c makes yeah there is gonna be a video linked at the bottom of this towards the end they look over that for you if you're interested and with that let's hop right in actually before I do that I need to make sure that I mentioned that I do not buy cannabis based off of this THC like high THC low THC doesn't necessarily dictate my purchase and there's a variant like a bunch of different reasons for that with all that we hop right into it so first off I'm pretty sure that this is a nitro seal because it's got you know a little bit of like air in there and if it's not then anybody is more than half like I'd be more than happy to have one of you guys character because what I'm trying to say anyway so let's see so they do not score marks which is nice I just don't know how to use them on this package apparently alright so right away I get just hit in the nose with a bunch of like just so first first glances first feels this is still healthy flour has a tiny bit of stickiness left to it not a lot but definitely not like dead or anything like that I'm not like upset at all with this oh and then as far as the smell is concerned that's got a really unique kind of like it's a mix okay so it so it's kind of like a it's like a chem dog with a tiny bit of like sweetness to even out that like really like you gross under like tone that chem dog sometimes has oh this it gets cut with a tiny bit of sweetness which it's really confusing but I'm really excited to try it that's a complex flavor or smells so I'm hoping that it you know produces a complex flavor as far as the nut goes it is kind of it is a bigger kind of like you know tree and then it's not dense like super dense or anything like that but it does you know have it's also not super wispy either it's it's a really well grown bud all around so with that I'm really excited to try it and I'll be back again with you guys in a couple of days to let you know how this went [ __ ] ain't nobody so I went ahead and tried that blackberry cookies and as far as the flavor is concerned so this was unique it starts off kind of light muted you get a light kind of like pine and then once you exhale you get this big ol punch of like skunky like strong flavor after you're done and that that kind of hangs out there for a couple of minutes so if that catches you off-guard because you know you're initially you're smoking it and you're like man I was kind of hoping that I would get that like really strong you know scent that it has I would hope that I was kind of hoping that it would translate into the smoke then you exhale and boom you get hit with all of that flavor so it's a really really cool experience as far as the highest concern this thing's a knockout like I don't even have to tell you much outside of the fact that you're gonna be sitting on your ass in front of your couch watching TV not even on your couch in front of your couch no I'm just kidding oh so you'll be on your couch watching TV for the rest of the night but this is a great product I don't recommend it if you're a newbie definitely be careful with it not in the sense that like you're gonna see anything weird but just in the sense that you don't do this when you have anything else to do don't smoke this at noon hoping to go catch a lunch at 3:00 with your friends or anything that's not gonna happen so Oh smoke this once you're done with your day entirely and you're ready to chill hang out and just relax with all that if you guys are watching this on YouTube make sure you hit that sub button if you're watching this on Facebook make sure you follow the page this has been recreational 4/20 and I'll be back again with you guys soon", "sdCUruWczDY": "what up YouTube this is your hosting and dads and welcome to another can of curry

an accurate description as you guys can see extremely latency of trichomes price point a little bit high but let you know unlike the higher end but it is definitely one of those very very strong heavily medicating cannabis I am very or kind of a strange I'm very little ice [ __ ] oh yeah push goes kicking my ass fourth bull here well every time oh gee funky flavor I'm gonna go ahead I'm a big indica person and this this is definitely delivers that nice indica [ __ ] high um if you guys are looking for something really really heavily medicating with that nice og slanted eyes thing like nope no look no further than cushko OG I'm gonna go ahead and give a crazy ass 5 out of 5 on my scale I would pick this stuff up and smoke it every day I wish I had pounds of it if I could afford it I would smoking every day cuz this [ __ ] is [ __ ] lit peer og probably the strongest smelling OG I've smelled so far let's go ahead and finish this video out with one last final bowl as well take a

a little bit of this stuff and so it looks like there's not a eight here but this is almost an eighth of a berry punch I think that's a seed right there [Music] yep it's a premature seed so there might be some seeds in this bud so I kinda hope I find a seed because then we can grow this [Applause] [Music] let's get this bus also we're gonna do a video on hash oil cartridges this is hash oil and it is full spectrum cannabis oil there is CBD THC tha h bt h alphabet CBB alphabet whatever there's everything that's in wok pot in here it's not pure because technically pure oil would just be a pure one thing but pure CBD appeared THC whatever this is full everything it looks kind of dirty like there's plant matter in there no it's not plant matter is just every part of the marijuana plant this is good stuff [Music] and that's gorilla glue the straight they gave it to me today tastes nice and not sour very gorilla gluey I guess but anyways so she's super I'm gonna put this little guy in here this one's obviously an indica you guys see my uh my hair bounce on that oh so tired of my videos being so inconsistent something to list here for me to follow says strain name type price smell taste feel 110 rating and then number eight is stomach obviously because by the time you go through all this year's tone so strain name berry punch price this was twenty dollars in eight that move forty dollars a quarter and this what okay so move is really cool I think I explained this in the other video but all their strains are top shelf and every time they buy a new strain they just move that top shelf down a tier and the next stuff is top shelf but they don't buy bad weed they only get good stuff like look at this nug that's one yeah this is the other stuff from goof it's just a good bud just big fat keeping nugs and your hair good stuff trying to get the key for this from you here bust it off with the coin in the grinder jamming some Grateful Dead today let's see how keeping this bud is here's can see have a little pile right there that's from one little bud so I'll be enough to top off one boy hopefully you guys like the microwave honey blunt video um I I honestly think microwave is the best way to stock up yeah [Music] [Music] all right this challenge was really cool like this in all right [Music] all righty people so smell [Music] dirty socks that's gross taste [Music] [Music] permit would for sure [Music] [Music] it's got a burnt would taste but it feels floaty like my feet you're not on the ground I give this weed a 8 out of 10 and this is the berry punch so this concludes our flowers reviews and we have three hash oil cartridges we'll talk about and then a gram of diamond pho battery and the strain is forbidden fruit so that's gonna be a special video

first up its the blackberry pie butter sweet like fresh berries you forward and relax and that sounds amazing oh I wouldn't even want ice cream on top of this pie just wanted by itself it makes sense that their name is after a baked good because I feel like I'm gonna be a baked good here in a minute cheers everybody I can almost taste the crust I can almost taste pie crust I wish life had a rewind

i'm gerard i'm jesse and uh we're here with cloud rising here to review some weed uh today we've got the platinum blackberry indica hybrid weed and uh i haven't tried this one before so i'm interested to see how it is i feel how it is i guess kind of smells really good it smells like uh like like gin like gin actually like gin and tonic it's got floral herbal fuel-y earthy smell according to the package i can see that the floral herbal side of it um yeah we're gonna try it out see what makes us feel take a gander take a gander at it all right yeah it smells it smells good it smells dank you know this is a big ass bud too yeah it is nice eh you can tell it's a good yield now gerard gerard roll there's these beautiful beautiful joints yeah um it's just it's the best best this is quality right next workout i've seen so as you can see i roll joints professionally and i'm an expert alice that's my favorite part about this giant is just how loose the paper is the filter just kind of like floats in there and the uh you can actually use the uh outer edge of the filter as a filter too mostly inhaling some weed through the very tight filter you know what it tastes exactly like platinum and blackberry you know what if platinum if i know what platinum tastes like this would be it you know it's pretty tasty it's nice it is yeah it's good [ __ ] i approve platinum blackberry so where'd you get this my friend on the uh the west coast i hook up on the west coast nice nice yeah shipped all the way from vancouver pc thing i like about this canadian lumber paper is you don't get like that papery papery taste when you're smoking a joint it's very natural tasting so it doesn't really overpower the actual flavor of the weed so how's that making you feel gerard um you know hi uh i feel a little smiley happy yeah it's good feel feel slow a little slow but it says on the package it says happy euphoric relaxing creative i definitely feel the uh happy euphoric part i don't know about creative i don't know what i don't know if i feel creative though what is that that's not even i don't know that's why i stopped and like what what does he have thoughts like good amount of thoughts no i'm high just zoned out yeah you know what yeah i feel very uh dry mild yeah i'm in the dry mouth too yeah but yeah i think it's got very like numbing effects too and that's an indica right indica hybrid so a kind of sativa bit of sativa but largely indica uh i can't remember how much it cost but i think i got a pretty good deal on it considering i just bought a single gram on its

don't [Music] deliver [Music] you", "0h1NWjQPzzk": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and we're going to continue on this journey on multi-strain reviews today we're going to talk about a cultivator called exotic genetics uh i bought three strings from them we're gonna start doing some three i have three different strains within a cultivator reviews you know i was try i was i was doing them maybe the minimum was four before but i can see i have so many threes and i think these flowers are in the stores and people don't know so we're gonna move the uh scale down a little bit and so the flower you're looking at right here was actually my favorite and we're gonna try this at the very very end but we're gonna start with our least favorite and move up to our most favorite so if you want to buy exotic genetics you know and also people who if you know one better than these because maybe you've tried these you can post it below the videos i'll try more exotic genetics i mean some of these cultivators i've tried 30 strains four to even 40 strains but exotic genetics only three and today we're going to talk about them so my least favorite and coming in at number three of all the exotic genetic strains that i tried was something called tina and tina has 24 percent thc and it's an indica and i got this at cookies woodland hills and i gave this flower an eight and the baseline is like an 8.5 and i was joking because you know over my lifetime i've had a lot of girlfriends and there was one girl and i'm i just can't remember what she looks like but i remember she was really tan and cute named tina and you know you name things after someone so probably this is named either the growers tina a mother's tina but i bet you it's his hot girlfriend's name tina unless the cultivators tina and tina was just okay for me in this case and i gave it an eight but we're gonna move up to better flower before we do that let me just load my scooper with one more vapor cup a little scoop here and that's three same amount as a bong hit and you know i talk about vapor cup and we're going to stick this down in about a minute and a half it's going to be ready but it's a great invention this thing is in incredible it has two issues excuse me two u.s patents and instead of taking two drawers or bong rips off of that you can take i don't know 20 i take 12 i don't go so far down on the flower i just when the flower stops i'm out but people go farther and that little bit of flour can stone you to the bone and save you a bunch of weed your throat doesn't hurt your hands don't stink it's incredible device but let's get back to the video coming in at number two we have something called milk and cookies and i got this at cookies maywood i went down for the apples and bananas drop and this is what the bud teddy recommended this was a bud dagger pick and it's a hybrid i gave it an 825 and this flower wasn't really that good for me you know it's as i do these reviews this flower just didn't give me the right feeling and someone made a comment and i think it's it's it's it's absolutely can be true weed can be environmental you can have maybe a lesser weed and go to a rock concert an environment so good you're having a great time right or you could be in a bad mood and some weed might not make you happy right but i'm telling you the ones that i pick to get the high ratings you could be depressed and you're gonna forget about whatever happened and just smile and we're looking for that flower and this flower didn't have it for me so milk and cookies at number two got an eight two five but we're moving up to number one and coming at number one is a strain called luxury you can see i got these all over the place this strain has 22 thc it's hybrid and i got this in my new favorite store the lemonade arlita even though i'm really running by strain whoever has the best strange that's my favorite store but if no one has strains i'm going there why good parking no line better strains because everyone else sells them out revenues lemonade arlita maybe is a little bit of a slower store but i'm sure me talking about it's going to pick it up but this flower is an 865 which means it's stronger than the average flower it's more euphoric than the average flower and it's got focus and i liked it so if you want to try exotic genetics and you don't know which one to pick the one i would grab first is luxurati but there can be better than this i only tried uh three strange so i'm no expert at exotic genetics so if anyone has tips on exotic genetics post it below the video let the people know thanks for joining in we are going to take you out with a vapor cup hit of luxurati i've got this thing set to 330. you can see the vapor in the straw let's check it out i could never get tired of this this star's got a little bit of the og taste but it's smooth i'm telling you i'm old school guy i listen to old school rock and roll i like old school cars but i have moved out of the bong into the new school this thing is incredible and if you want to see vapor cup you can see it at vaporcup.com read the reviews i say it every day because you'll see

and dank Bates leave that oil at dank veyts official all organic no problem glycol like I said before disease you just take him down from the bottom open the bottom part and just slide it right up it has a seal at the bottom like always if it doesn't have a seal it has already been used either the tip always has to be a plastic plastic tip the good thing is that these are made out of glass so they don't break easily I dropped them a couple times on the floor I just figure right back up in this fight it also says Cecil and it has a code at the bottom with a cave if you mind probably doesn't zoom in as well but if you don't see that at the bottom it's fake and if it's Dave Bates official or Dave Bates official account both of them are real so you ain't got nothing to worry about a little bit left of Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] but I want to try out the blue breakers so let's see I totally forgot it is 90 point 54 percent THC and has a story at the bottom that I'll leave down in the description real it seems I like to primum before I hit it it already tastes like like a blueberry flavor it's spot-on let's see the taste is there funky it's pretty good it's not as strong as the Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] and the Alaskan tundra [ __ ] is the same THC potent potency and I barely kind of feel it let's see if the second year is better the flavor all right give me the flavor there's like a nine out of ten almost a ten out of ten the high I probably say like a seven out of ten it's it's alright it's not some nothing good but you know if you're into indicas and you want to be like slump on the couch are you Chinese you're trying to get something and just lay you down I would go for this one it's a blueberry Kush everybody wants this just stay tuned guys cuz I got more [Music]",

you guys been checking out i shot a whole bunch of horn of this stuff so it's really really good looking you know typical Bubba chatter well not typical at all but the typical way it comes out it's definitely usually more of an amber color than golden color but having this stuff smells like Street bubba kush sugar cookies at all it's just really really yummy smelling don't take my first day of this and give it a shot that's you talk to too much about it cuz i'm sure you guys got plenty of it shoot you guys can see all of it when i'll shoot does she videos of the oil just looks awesome to appraise I want this stuff to the cars you can nominate super light on the phone good stuff volume up way too much anyway have that awesome on the flavor literally just taste like I'm about Minogue's just super sweet really earthy and coffee like a really really clean lamoille honestly I always liked the way Bubba oil tastes better than Bubba nugs it just pulls out the sweetness so much more so you don't really surpasses all that earthiness so you get into Bowman ugh and this oil just tastes like ice is just like sweet sugar cookies it's delicious so one more look oh I just massive bit jealous of a fish I'll see you guys next time super stony I'm gonna get [ __ ] indica crush like that another I can already tell washing straight in of my eyes and my head getting a definite head bubbling effect in from that small hit so definitely very very good stuff so i'll see you guys next time do you you", "iwgBfZt1LxI": "what's up y'all this [ __ ] boys Shelton with another five ass episode wake-and-bake ain't this morning I got some bad news you guys horrible news oh my god so I'm walking out to the garage with my bone this bone here look what happened so I hit my mic jar up against this can have a moment of silence from a bone please thank you it was a good old bone what it's doing now I guess it's time to hunt for a new bone now so find somewhere to put that real quick not over there and we had to go with the old handy dandy you guys remember this bone here this he's got tape on because it's cracked right here this is the first one I had broke but it still but it still got some suction in so we probably ended up using this one here oh wait a minute this morning I've got to tell you this friend this morning the new strand is monster cookies monster cookies is an indica dominant hybrid that builds on some strong and flavorful genetics this strand is a cross between the omnipresent Girl Scout cookies and the flavorful and eye catching granddaddy purple sorry y'all don't feel that I'm struggling reading but I'm not this background gives the flowers are relaxing hi and a complex fruity taste mom let's see it looks really nice it's a really good with somebody it's all frosting here it is it's all frosty and stuff it's kind of flat cuz I was sitting on it earlier but that's nice looking bud there all right well let's see if this bone work it feels so it feels so small and tighten its petite forgot I hope y'all slept like kings and queens cuz you know me I slept like a king as I do every night Joe um I don't know how well this bunk is gonna work but we're gonna give it a shot in I don't know really use this as long as we can I guess it's like we'll get another bone so let's bust this open it definitely smells some granddaddy purp all right let's keep that up in here monster cookies I'm kind of scared this bone I feel like he's gonna fall apart who's like I said there's a crack all the way around and run the whole bomb let's give it a shot okay that nice little taste why don't I feel like I forgot my eyes definitely doesn't hit like the other bomb [Music] dammit there's a musk taste behind it I taste granddaddy purp in the must taste hold on a second please so I know that that must taste that I taste this that's the Girl Scout cookies I taste both of my tasty Girl Scout cookies annotates the granddaddy purp this is definitely a beautiful mix I wish I have moved water here so I can bubble properly but I guess we do we're working with so like I said I guess this is our hunt for a new bomb day hey how are you guys in 4th of July I don't know about anybody else was the holidays not feel like holidays to me it feels like we're just going through the motions waiting for something big to happen it's like I know something's coming something's gonna happen but I have no idea what it is I hope it's good whatever it is who I'm buzzing up already gosh it's hot as Hades in here you guys oh I don't know I really don't like smoking out of this but the alternative was to do the video with this this morning you guys know my video started out with a ball we started out with this put this bone right here's a matter of fact so I'm trying to keep it as it keeping it balls because I don't know to me bones is just pleasing to the eye watching them up here to bone as opposed to watching somebody hit a ball nobody wants to watch anybody smoke a ball you don't hear the bubbling you don't see the lighter going on the ball you'll see none of that this is aesthetically pleasing [ __ ] out here oh here we go I know one thing that I probably should have done is that probably should have changed this water this water's been in here for [ __ ] I'm gonna change the water I'll be right back so I don't remember how long that water was in there it's been in there since the bone crack so I'm thinking six seven months maybe so yeah I was like something funny taste in here tasting like old water it it tastes bad like swamp water nothing but it just tastes them like old water line that [ __ ] has some age on the other there we go little weak-ass hit bail something look at this bolt we're gonna work it out will you dish it together stop it on the coughing over that's a better taste I can really taste it clear now taste the Girl Scout cookies and granularity permanent is freaking delicious and it's quite nice I have a slight burn on talkback on my throat sorry the buzz is like right here now you guys know that usually when I smoke a hybrid it's like right behind my eyes lately the exotics the highs I've been right behind my eyes I don't know if you guys understand what I'm saying but I feel it right across the top of my forehead right now it feels different because I've been having like the hi behind my eyes this whole time and now it's like I can feel the years it's weird I'm sure you guys understand what I'm saying if you're a pothead you know I'm saying this is really quite taste ago I don't know if it's gonna be a chart topper but it's quite tasty it feels like a coffin less with this bomb so when I was using this bomb when I started the channel of this phone almost coughing like crazy like I was talking with the big bomb that's what made me get a bigger bone because someone was like you know if you get a bigger bomb you can stack the smoke whatever that means you expect the smoke and pull it and hit it in you yoke off less so I got the bigger bong and did film it felt great man I was still coughing but it was it was delicious I mean I love the bigger bomb and now I'm back to this little little petite [ __ ] man I don't really like it because it feels like I'm lighting the lighter right by my face you know I'm saying it's like right here I want to light it down here anyway let's go so on a scale of one to ten one being that [ __ ] ten being that bushy all love the flavor critique of monster cookies we're gonna give this a a seven that's the play we're gonna give to it a seven I don't know if you guys can see it in the jaw good but yeah we're definitely give us a seven these nerves are really frosty I'll see if I can find a good and frosty one they're really frosty I don't know if you can even get a good visual on that how frosty it is anyone that was that yeah can't even believe that I'll give that a seven years I couldn't even believe that I busted my bomb and I was like you hasn't broke your bowl and your bomb before that that feeling you get that like your heart drops it was like cuz I had the ball in his hand and I had to uh my jar in this hand and I think I went to switch hands or something and it hit it just take it teeth and then the water shows like I thought this glass the glass felt really brittle like like I don't know like I don't know like the water was eating through some because I really take it what the water stays in it 24/7 but I don't know it just felt weird like cuz only I just barely think of it like that and the whole bottom just fell out over some [ __ ] anyway let's get back in here I would like to see this [ __ ] be great at this because this is most surely street level because I feel like I feel like it's holding back you know like I know you got more to offer than this I mean it's a good buzz don't get it wrong but no one would recommend it to my friends really is I guess he feels dispensary grade or high time grade you know I'm saying you have seen them up how do we look some High Times magazines you'll never see the buzz look like that ever again those buds are grown under perfect perfect conditions with the perfect amount of nutrients there's no Mike's getting to them there's no insects on them at all they don't even see insects them shits is growing perfect and my stomach is growling I'm starving I don't like to eat in the morning though cuz you know it helps me stay keep my girlish figure anyway I only like to eat in the morning so I try to wait till like 1:00 or 2:00 o'clock before I eat I'll go ahead and drink some water so I don't drink no milk I'm drinking orange juice I'll drink no juice I don't think none of that [ __ ] Don Julio baby I'm gonna have to hurry up and get me a bomb even though like I said it's it's less coffee I'm gonna have to already get one oh I really did love this bone man this was a beautiful bomb here y'all but it's trying to move on to the next one I guess I guess that's the civilization of time for a new chapter huh all right we got a visit the old chapter first [ __ ] oh that is good though it feels like the highest is it increasing I was like wait a minute soon as I say lose I pinkie okay Goku okay let's calm tasty Wow I'm pretty hot now you guys I don't know what just happened but soon as I said the highs just stuck my nose now aura [ __ ] out of here I think um yeah my ball is definitely leaking definitely things I guess I should buy that they got some some silicone heat-resistant silicone whatever it's up to date repair the windshields with so I was gonna order some of that because like I said it's a cracking goes all the way around it so I guess I order some hangers repair this and I'll just have this glass as a safety glass get it now this is um I guess it'll be my backup singer we'll call this the backup singer cuz uh [ __ ] the lead singer just [ __ ] I got something I miss my ball my ready you know it's work everybody at seven Wow so I didn't hear anything about about any mass killings or shootings or anything yesterday he gets white people you know so on everybody was gonna learn I don't know if you guys seen the video where the UH the black folks were exercising area I think it's Second Amendment they were exercising their second Amendment right to bear arms yesterday were doing what when I'm Street is probably right I want to say like three or four hundred of them may have been more may have been less but um they were just all some of them had a salt rifle someone has shotguns they were all in black just like the Black Panthers used to look I don't know about anybody else but perhaps we need the Black Panthers back because Black Panthers wasn't a group like the KKK the KKK was like or is like well it's a hate group man they just I don't know anything about them so I can't really say with would they stand upright you know that they don't like people of color so with that being said if this seems like a hate group burning cross on the front lawn this one they used to do burning cross on the front lawn hanging the brothers you know that type of [ __ ] the Black Panthers wasn't about that it was a strong distrust fit-up for for black rights that's all it was black power black people you know what I'm saying I saw the was oh they weren't trying to go out and killing Bonnie that was just letting y'all like letting the racist people know that hey when you put them with the [ __ ] man so uh hey if you guys want to bring it we're here and ready got a rifle ready that's all that the Black Panthers in my opinion was about I don't know too much about them either I just don't know why we needed two groups I don't know why we needed a separation of groups I don't know why we need to be called a race I don't know why we had to cake here on the why we had two Black Panthers or one of those groups needed just like the police or the police really needed that I think the police are needed but not in the capacity that they try to us that they try to assume you don't exam because they try to act like counselors doctors your parents they try to act like all that [ __ ] they let their feelings get involved into it too much it's like if you walk into a cop and you say [ __ ] you Pig there should be no problems there should be nothing done they said he should just stand there be like but instead you walk up to a cop now say [ __ ] you Pig they're either gonna beat you actually going to jail but what are you going to jail for what law did you break you know I'm saying I don't feel like that everybody's saying respect the police respects movies first of all first and foremost [ __ ] the police but everybody's saying them Oh respect the police why should you respect somebody that don't respect you if the police ain't respecting you guys that's not respect that you're trying to give them that's fear see I'm saying that there's a dense between fear and respect of course you can get respect out of fear yeah you can get know you can get fear out of respect but you can't get respect out of fear one of those anyway so it's like they're there I'm scaring people that's what the police do they use intimidation they don't use common sense they don't use them they're like I'm the law of power you don't I'm saying it should be like they're supposed to settle disputes and [ __ ] like that you know I'm saying and things of that nature but it's like I don't understand what the police are for in this confession I think I I say it all the time you guys I think we need to fire every last single cop and start over and the way we're gonna start over is gonna redo the train and the Train is gonna take a lot longer but you know you can't fire all in at the same time because then people gonna start running amok it's gonna be like gossamer round this [ __ ] so uh yep like you know maybe we'll start with this police department over here cuz we got another one to support it will fire everybody at this Police Department start building back up building back up then we're firing buddy at this Police Department you know I'm saying - move along like that at any rate I think all police need to be fired all of them yes I know there's some good cops but if a cop watches another cop do some [ __ ] up [ __ ] or if or if he if he's told that the cop did some messed-up stuff and he doesn't say anything or do anything then he's a bad cop too you know that that's saying if you see something say something that's what I came from me came from them man but they don't say nothing when they see something started getting a little talky there home anyway the buzz table ketchup so on a scale of one to ten one being [ __ ] ten being a good [ __ ] of the high critique of this monster cookies I'm gonna have to give this because the high is still creeping that's why I was talking to you that so much because the highest still going up I know once I turn the video up on me super high so I'm gonna give it a proper rating I don't think it deserves a nine although it seems like it should be but really gonna eight I think that this monster cookies deserves a eight for the high protein a very high eight leaning towards a non it is tasty it's really delicious and the highest quite nice quite lovely indeed anyway I appreciate you guys stopping by ya'll say a prayer from the bone it may take me a few days may take me a few weeks to get a new bone but I no one's coming anyway I hope you guys have an awesome truly legendary day oh today's way better than yesterday and I hope tomorrow I'll sean's them both man I hope you'll have to be blessed stay safe you ain't gotta go home but you got to get the hell up out of here y'all guess what state babe"}
