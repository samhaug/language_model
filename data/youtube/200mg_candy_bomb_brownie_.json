{"db3sIVwDbUM": "- I feel like CBD is for people who do not have a weed plug, and can't afford a psychiatrist. (upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually.

guys jacketing - and this is a menu and by only how you guys go into youtube universe there this video is actually a video that uh I'm doing as you can see I have my special best buds stick to get a shirt on because it's video dealing with Timmy g1 of a sticky speak the icky icky so he's also brought in bored by it [ __ ] up that cup when you feeling low and you need to get right get [ __ ] up calm I'm just [ __ ] with you guys but this right here is um what I found at the store across the street and what it is called is cush cakes this is the premium relaxation brownie now the other thing is there's some things connected to me probably not it's probably a gimmicky thing but this one those neck cake if you can call it that cost four dollars and ninety nine cent and I was at first not really wanting to pay that much for it is particularly if you will but curiosity sometimes gets to me when I see stuff like this it's an all-natural pulmonary blend algorithm developed by a licensed pharmacist okay I'm not going to throw degrees but it's a lot of stuff like and read each sugar enriched to blend it bleached flour daughter bla wheat and knowledge Stephanie introduced ein but Allah there's a lot of stuff firstly are looking at the actual package Turkey wrapping itself like a tie-dye cutting everything kind of look to it as religious tea and I'm paranoid I try to put it up how's Gary d'etre but what I'm going to do is I want to try this brownie and I'm going to wait 30 minutes to kind of let you guys know what a new sensation effects I have hope it doesn't do anything I'm going to take medication so yes it's going to be open it we want to try the brown I like to eat the whole brownie in the videos I'm hoping we'll pay down on the ladies this head pain in the store so I feel kind of moist well from the looks of it let's take our it looks like a typical brownie let's get ready to taste it tastes like a fudge brownie to me sweet I probably finish the rest of it off but I can definitely taste like a little something in my clothing the aftertaste wise but I'll Dante's local brownie I guess I wasn't you have no what happens I read management now so yeah I'll be right back thirty minutes later you so how you guys blew I'm just [ __ ] with you guys okay so roughly two hours since taking the cush cake first of all it tastes pretty good I was very relaxed I'm not gonna lie they're pretty calm but I think it's more just a publicity ploy to build up excitement about it actually look there you get a whole box of them for 60 bucks and from what I've been reading here on the information as relates to the fish cake fish cakes are premium are a premium relaxation brownie basically it doesn't have THC or marijuana animal courses will be in stores but uh they simply give it the same effects as the kwang-ho Nikita Becky if you will but yeah all in all it's more of a commercial thing is gimmicky I'm not gonna buy it again I paid like I say five dollars was $4.99 for that one snack cake but I did like I say felt uh eager to catch something more to do the fact that I haven't had that much sleep so maybe it probably made me feel revered less because I was kind of tired anyway but all in all I would probably just say just pass on it it's it's it's like I say it's gimmicky is you know what it is and uh yeah I'm finna don't you even gonna get off but there are other similar products like the Rocky Mountain High hemp energy drinks and I've seen a couple of these of certain products that have been sold especially at the store or across the street from where I stay but yeah this is jacket 82 Schneider", "9PpfgI-Ak_k": "[Music] that you shouldn't fall asleep film go upstairs this is private time what is going on beeps welcome back to a brand new BuzzFeed test this week I am overly excited for this recipe even though we've been kind of overdosing with the desserts a little bit I did do a poll over on my Instagram story if you don't follow me already it's David underscore Seymour 1 I did four options for you guys and overwhelmingly over the other three you guys picked the brownie bombs I'm gonna be honest now I have unbelievably high expectations for these because the perfect fudgy brownies I feel like I just mention them every single week they're amazing they're the best recipe I've probably done on this channel besides some pizza recipes it's just so good so I'm hoping it's gonna live up to that let's get right into them so guys before we get into the ingredients obviously the main ingredient here today is the milk chocolate truffle that they shove it in the middle of the brownie and then it melts down and becomes gooey and delicious well that's a lot of you have pointed out in the comments and tweeted me the majority of chocolate truffles just like these ones have peanut and tree nut warnings on them if you didn't know I'm very allergic if I even have a sliver of any type of peanut almond anything you'll have a dead youtuber on your hands and as a result of that I'm not gonna use those I'm gonna try to substitute this baking bar basically just break it up into like an ounce or two ounce pieces and hopefully it'll work the same I guess we'll find out but besides the chocolate in the center the other ingredients we're gonna need for these is some oil and cocoa powder a stick of butter and some kosher salts some flour and granulated sugar vanilla extract one egg and some baking powder and let's begin by mixing up our dry ingredients and look at this and pre measured out ingredients are we on the Rachael Ray Show or David's Russian BuzzFeed test I don't really know maybe one day I'll be successful enough to have somebody else pre measure out all my ingredients one can dream once I add those all mixed together I set it to the side and pretty much began preparing everything else a third of a cup of vegetable oil and a half stick of the salted butter melted down along with some white sugar some of that cocoa powder I'm not gonna sift these out just cuz I'm mixing them with the wet ingredients and they should dissolve in the butter and the oil you don't have to add to that mix 1 egg hopefully no shells in said egg and a few teaspoons of vanilla extract and up until this point mine pretty much looks spot-on with how tasties looks so I began to throw in the dry ingredients and you're not gonna mix this you're apparently you're gonna want to fold these in so I did just that and got to this points which looks good on camera especially but it's really dry and crumbly kind of sure I'm gonna be able to form these into balls I just grabbed that broken up bar of chocolate from earlier and began to try to form some mounds around each square of chocolate this part was slightly difficult probably would have been a lot easier with a small circular piece of chocolate and a lot less crumbly of a dough but I was able to do it mine were definitely a little bit bigger than tasties were regardless the show must go on so I threw them on some parchment paper on my cookie sheet and in a 375-degree oven bake these for about 12 minutes two minutes longer than buzzfeed because mine were a little bit bigger after I let them cool I played it up a few and broke one open and this is looking pretty good guys so let's give it a try as you can see I tried to dress them up a little bit with some powdered sugar like they did in the video and even so they look like giant meatballs with some sugar on top they also appear to be very dry but they smell good so oh boy oh man good shot of that ooh I got chocolate all over my mouth not too bad the flavor of these are off the charts the chocolate is perfect or not overly sweet or rich or anything but uh they do dry your mouth out quite a bit maybe if you had it a little bit more butter or oil or something they wouldn't be so damn dry would recommend you guys trying it and I'll probably definitely be making it again so nine point six out of ten hello it's under the stove dextra why are you whispering I'm just gonna bump the volume up and put you in anyway but I hope you guys enjoyed today's BuzzFeed test if you did leave a big like on this video for me this video is probably gonna be a little bit shorter than normal I kind of felt that way with the recipe but I got another video for you on Sunday that one's gonna be a pain

and I see that holy cow there is just wall-to-wall protein bars and a lot of them are just total garbage so to be completely honest I wanted to do a video to help shed some light on what you can choose to be the best option for you now truth be told you really shouldn't be relying on a protein bar to get your protein in it's more of just a stopgap let's go ahead and let's take a look at some of the ingredients and some of these things and really try to find a clear winner so that when you go into Costco you can at least find that at least top to protein bars that are worthy of taking home for at least a protein emergency so let's go ahead and let's dive right in but first please do hit that red subscribe button and then hit that little bell icon so you never miss our daily videos all right where to start for those of you that are out there that like cereal and still want to be able to have cereal please do check out magic spoon okay they're a new supporter of this channel but they're a product that I've known for a while these guys are super super super cool maybe you've seen them floating around I just want to throw it out there that they are the bomb when it comes down to a low carb high protein cereal okay these guys absolutely no sugar they're utilizing like a whey protein blend to actually make a protein cereal and you're gonna get a really good deal on this stuff by using the link that's down below so I just want to give them a big shout out because it's totally relevant when I'm talking about breakfast they've got chocolate they've got like a fruity flavor they've got a blueberry flavor they've got a frosted flavor you have to check them out you've probably seen them on Joe Rogan's podcasts all these guys that are reputable within the health industry talk about them so just because it's bright colored and it looks fun doesn't mean that it's unhealthy it's definitely a good way to be able to swap out your breakfast so highly highly highly new legitimately recommend that you try these guys at least give them a shot so the links down below in the description you can check it out after you watch this video and thank you magic spoon for making this channel possible and for helping out so many people with their health okay this first I'm going to start with is a nature valley quote protein bar now nature valley is just kind of a regular candy bar type of granola bar but it looks like they slap the label protein on it to try to capture the attention of well people that are looking for a high protein satiating snack so let's go ahead and let's take a quick look at the ingredients on this onebut flip the camera around okay so here's what the label looks like and then let's go ahead and let's look at the nutrition facts like roasted peanuts that's not too bad to start but soy protein isolate as the second ingredient that is pure adulterated soy okay pure phytoestrogens which is not exactly something that we want when you look at overall thyroid affect when you look at the effect in the body in general soy is not a good ingredient especially that high up on the list chicory root extract not the end of the world but again this high up on the list that's going to be a prebiotic fiber that is going to give you a lot of intestinal discomfort that should not be that high up on the ingredient list so this one's a little bit sketchy already but then the big scary one is the vegetable oils down there okay so in terms of the fats that we're adding to the mix here we've got palm kernel oil which isn't terrible then we've got canola and peanut oil definitely not something I want to have in there the bulk of the protein here it's coming from soy protein isolate which is just not going to be good quality stuff and not worth the paper it's really written on it so this one of course we also probably have some sugar added to it yep oh we're some sugar we have fructose okay remember fructose goes straight to the liver and doesn't really get stored in the muscle let me explain something so here's what happens with fructose and fructose gets in your body okay because fructose can only get metabolized by the liver you can only process like 30 to 40 grams at a time which means the excess fructose goes through what's called de novo lipid Genesis and gets converted into fat very easily but it's also very easy for it to contribute to a fatty liver it's very easy for it to cause all kinds of other effects especially in the world of viruses fructose directly feeds a virus so we have to be really careful with that kind of stuff just in general we're worried about health so this one's a no-go let's move on to the next frankly a lot of these aren't even protein bars so I don't want to waste the time these are just granola bars or peanut bars fruit and nut bars these grain free bars are kind of cool but they're not a protein bar once again in the world of bars though they're not that bad I just know for a fact almonds pecans and maple syrup organic honey okay we still have fructose coming from honey and maple syrup so you have to be careful with that still fructose still gonna go through that same de novo epigenesis thing but at least it's clean ingredients not something I would really feed my family but worst case scenario it's probably one of the cleaner ones now this next one is one that I just stumbled across now I haven't tasted it or anything so I can't really attest to to that price it seems a very expensive it's called a ratio bar and $17.99 for 16 of them ethyl I mean not the end of the world it's still pretty cheap but compared to like the Nature Valley bars right but those are garbage so let's take a look at what's in this one I actually was pretty pleased with the ingredients I'll spin the camera around and then I'll flip it back and explain some stuff in a minute so label looks like this okay let's go in ingredients here we got almonds pumpkin seeds soy protein isolate which is definitely not something we want as far as the protein goes coconut oil erythritol whey protein isolate sugary root extract okay so you remember how we talked about chicory root extract this is further on down the list okay which I appreciate that means it has less of the actual binding fiber that's going to give it sort of the texture but it's further down the list meaning at least prioritize that I like this stevia extract that's gonna be really solid I like that it's a river towel that's better than sugar okay the problem is once again soy protein isolate alright we have a big problem there we don't want to use that now let me explain something with whey protein isolate which I was pleased to see when you're looking for a whey protein you want whey protein isolate not concentrate it means they've taken the protein and they've isolate X Q Z they've taken the way and I've isolated the protein out of it so that means you don't have any to lactose you don't have any of the milk solids you just have pure protein now with soy you end up with a lot of the you know soy isoflavones you end up with a lot of the phytoestrogens and everything like that it's a different story what's funny is they go through the effort of having a high quality whey protein isolate but they have a high or zooming a low quality soy protein isolates it doesn't make any sense they go through might as well just use whey protein concentrate and just use the cruddy stuff point is if it wasn't for the soy protein isolate in that ratio bar I absolutely wouldn't use that I think it's a really clean one and I think it's low sugar so it's not the end of the world it's better than some of the other ones but it definitely doesn't make the top two this is one that people love all the time it's not even a protein bar it's a protein cookie now they've done an amazing job of marketing but we have to be real here for just a second because it's not a bar and it's still thing of the day just a cookie fun fact as I was filming this someone comes up to me says oh my gosh I follow you this is awesome and she's holding one of these and she says is this good or should I put it down I said put it down I could already tell I'm Keeley so we're gonna explain some stuff in here but it's actually quite simple the Linnaean Larry's cookies are not good to go but let's take a look at the ingredients just for the heck of it bad price $13.99 I mean price wise here's what we're looking at label and okay first ingredient enriched wheat flour okay every time you have gluten or wheat you are triggering the release of a protein called Zhong Yulin within your body Zhong Yulin causes a cross reaction that triggers what's called a leaky gut thus leaky gut makes it so that what are called lipopolysaccharides which are basically things that coat your bacteria can leach into your bloodstream compromising your immune system and making you ultimately feel sick okay it doesn't matter if you have a gluten allergy or not even those that are not gluten intolerant will have an issue when it comes down to week 12 Lam Ettore since we have simply over consumed it now additionally what's in there chicory root fiber as the second ingredient okay bloat City once again we don't like to go to bloat City look at the protein blend the lowest quality protein blend I've seen sorry I'm talking quiet so I don't be rude we gluten as a protein pea protein which is okay but then rice protein not even using a way not even using anything they're trying to be able to call it I don't even know how they going for plant-based I don't know what they're going for here point is very low quality stuff and then invert sugar vegetable glycerin which isn't that bad cane sugar peanuts palm fruit oil this stuff is garbage pure garbage honestly I would barely even consider that remotely healthy junk food and I'm not trying to bag on them I feel like their mission was good in the beginning but marketing just caught on anyhow that's not worth again the cardboard that it's on next one was another popular one the rx bar good clean bar but not really a protein bar once again more so just a snack bar so let's take a look at what's inside this one again I actually like the company as a whole I like what they've done with almond butters I like what they've done with some of the nut butters they obviously got their start more so with the bars so let's take a look at what's in here's again what the box looks like okay so 1999 for 16 again not a bad price but let's see what some clean ingredients I do like that dates egg whites cashews almonds chocolate cocoa natural flavors sea salt we have to be careful of natural flavors I don't say avoid natural flavors I'm just saying use caution the thing with natural flavors is there's no real regulation on them there's a hundred and fifty different ultimately chemical compounds that can go into natural flavors known as what are called incidental additives so Organic natural flavors is what you want to aim for it or a company that you know and trust okay our X bar is pretty clean so I'm not too worried about them because I know they have a good reputation so that part doesn't bother me but the protein is coming from a little bit of egg white which is straight albumin which isn't the highest quality protein in my opinion simply because it can trigger an inflammatory reaction let me explain what that means so the dates that are in an Rx bar are still pure fructose okay it's got to be careful with that but then when I was talking about what's with the egg whites so albumin it's a complete protein it's a good protein but the problem is you have to remember that's essentially the placenta for the yolk right so it's full of different immunoglobulins different things that are there to support the immune system of well growing a chicken that can trigger an inflammatory response in humans in fact if you look at like the AIP autoimmune Paleo protocols where they actually remove inflammatory foods eggs are one the first thing they remove however it's not the yolks they're bad it's the white that can be bad can be bad you just have to introduce them to make sure you don't get flushed make sure you don't feel bloated personally I feel bloated my egg whites but I eat a ton of egg yolks anyone just fun fact okay this is the big one this is the one that people ask about all the time so I would be doing it to service if I didn't talk about it the good old Kirkland protein bars people talk about how they taste really good I had on for the first time about three or four months ago surprisingly good taste but let's break down the ingredients I'm actually pleasantly surprised with this and price-wise pretty darn solid check this out can you get 20 of them for 18 bucks so less than a dollar a pop different flavors but anyhow I talked about this in another video check out the ingredient in this surprisingly not bad okay protein blend milk protein isolate remember we want to isolate isolating the protein then we have a whey protein isolate once again isolating the protein from the whey dietary fiber from tapioca starch okay so not using chicory root tapioca is a little bit better you just don't overdo tapioca because what we're finding right now is that people are starting to become sensitive to tapioca because of the overconsumption of it in a much similar way to wheat we developed a gluten intolerances later on in our generations because we've been consuming so much wheat since the 1950s with the fortification and also trying to reduce fat and adding more wheat in we're seeing the same thing with tapioca just be careful there erythritol peanut flour could be inflammatory natural flavors again questionable cocoa powder cocoa powder butter excuse me cocoa process with alkali which just means it's gonna have a higher potassium content sea salt sunflower lecithin not a big deal somewhat of an omega-6 but again this is not something you're trying to eat as a health food unsweetened chocolate so they're not using sweet and chocolate with sugar in it which is great and then we have stevia and Coleco sides which is just straight up here stevia okay that is clean in the world of a protein bar not gonna lie okay now what scares me a little bit 23 grams of carbs 15 of which are from fiber four of which are from our mr. tall that fiber is gonna send you to well you know it bloat City hashtag below city and we'll say though in the world of protein bars it's pretty clean the only thing I would have wanted to really see changed in there is instead of milk protein isolate just left it with whey protein isolate but it probably would have made it less of a creamy taste and they don't really want that so I totally did it that's a good price and that would definitely make the list so I highly recommend that one in the world of Costco protein bars oh one more thing to add to that don't eat more than one or you will definitely be in below city I promise you that making this a little quick here next one Robert Irvine's fit crunch okay these are the bright yellow ones and you can't miss I know from seeing these in other stores they're not the cleanest Robert Irvine should definitely stick to being on the Food Network because he's got a great personality on TV but I'm not sure if he's a good formulator let's take a look at this well maybe I'll meet my words this is what it looks like 18 count still a little under a buck protein blend alright wait hey I will say at least he starts with whey protein isolate not milk protein isolate but then we got whey protein concentrate okay that already kind of notifies it and then ooh soy protein isolate dang it vegetable glycerin vegetable oils palm and palm kernel that's not the end of the world he could be using canola he's using palm and palm kernel oil so he doesn't have to use anything hydrogenated which is great but sugar then sorbitol which is a sugar alcohol gelatin bovine gelatin brown rice flour maltitol talked about below city that's again that's a sugar alcohol that does not digest so basically what it does it causes something called passive diffusion okay it draws water into the gut let me explain this it draws water into the colon and it ferments it essentially rots in your gut but it doesn't digest so they can call it something that doesn't affect your blood sugar I've seen enough that ingredient list was really long that ingredient list was really dirty that one definitely does not make the gun another one that comes up in question all the time is pure protein I'll save you a lot of time and headache and just flip the camera around and get right to it but I think they're starting to get the gist about the common ingredients and a lot of these just inexpensive protein bars are so when I'm in a little bit under a buck once again oh here we go milk protein isolate not the end of the world whey protein isolate nothing up then it goes to concentrate hydrolyzed collagen so they're getting a protein from a little bit of collagen but once again we've got that maltitol in there fractionated palm kernel oil sugar again milk unsweetened chocolate and oh my gosh okay so if you're gonna put sugar in it you already have sugar and soy lecithin but you're gonna put sucralose in it too that doesn't make any sense let's give you the worst of both worlds let's give you sugar but let's also kill your gut microbiome with sucralose that's a little sketchy not make the cut unfortunately obviously the Kirkland bars were designed to kind of take them out and I would definitely recommend that one so there's an interesting study that found that in human subjects if they had any kind of artificial sweetener it would make them glucose intolerance okay and then when they took their gut bacteria after becoming glucose intolerant and transferred it into mice the mice became glucose intolerant what that means is artificial sweeteners actually have an effect on our gut microbiome which has an effect on our sugar and glucose metabolism meaning if you eat a bunch of artificial sweeteners you change your gut microbiome and sucralose has been shown in other studies to literally kill off up to 50% of your gut bacteria that is scary scary stuff so when I get upset about the fact that our dicas sugar we've already done the damage with sugar okay why do we also have to do damage with sucrose it's like one or the other pick your poison sugars gonna cause a bunch of metabolic distress sucralose is gonna cause a bunch of digestive and gut biome distress why have both so that definitely that's probably one of the worst ones here to say I hate to say it okay we're down to almost the last one here this one is one called smart for life which is a relatively new one let's take a look at the price once again they're all about the same but this is a new one so I haven't really investigated it let's see that's what the label looks like collagen infused gluten-free okay that's a plus $15.99 for 18 of them whoa that's a lot of ingredients okay so let's take just one of them protein blend soy protein nuggets okay which contains soy protein tapioca starch and salt then milk protein not even milk protein isolate so you're gonna you're gonna use soy protein as the protein source might as well try to make it a vegan bar but nope then they go straight to milk protein but again not even go protein isolate just straight milk protein collagen coming from egg and kosher bovine okay that's a plus tapioca syrup soluble corn fiber okay SCF is dangerous stuff soluble corn fiber ferments in the gut a soluble corn fiber is derived from heavy duty GMO corn starch okay bad bad bad news then canola oil oh man so omega-6 bomb that's smoked listen milk chocolate coating which has a riff through tall malt so again here's what I don't know scent you're using a river tall which is a pretty clean sugar alcohol and then you also use multi salt but then you also use sugar and sustainable for me I don't understand it the world the processed foods is so sketchy like there's so much just nasty stuff that they throwing things just to increase shelf life and the reality is if they just went a little bit cleaner they could probably sell a little bit more to be honest if people start educating themselves which they are we can make better decisions on this stuff now there's only one more that I want to show you and then we'll have our two clear winners the go macro bar but this isn't even a protein bar to be completely honest okay it's kind of another let's see here's what I like about it its organic ingredients it is vegan it's clean organic brown rice syrup organic almond butter organic protein blend which is sprouted brown rice protein organic pea protein very clean organic puffed rice organic fair trade and chocolate chips actually a very clean bar to be completely honest when it comes down to it this one is one that I would recommend it's just not the highest protein okay so we have proteins here let's see only 11 grams of protein but 36 grams of carbs okay and again the sugar is gonna be coming from brown rice syrup which is not going to be the best solution here for us so technically yes it's a protein bar but since they're using the brown rice syrup that's a again it's a syrup sugar that's being directly derived from a brown rice which is going to make it a little bit better than say I don't know like a corn fiber or corn syrup or something like that and at least it's organic so at least it's not going to be as bad so that probably does make the cut at least for the best plant-based options the go macro bar for the best plant-based non keto bar but the cleanest ones otherwise are gonna be these two I'll be say the ratio bar even though it does have some soy in it not the end of the world okay so the ratio bar does make the cut but I haven't tasted it now I just say keto friendly which I don't really buy that and sugar alcohol yeah not really kind of two differently calls itself a protein bar was not a protein bar basically a knock off of a kind bar so technically not a protein bar also not a protein bar just so you know okay protein cookie disguised in disguise our X bar not really a protein bar but at least clean go macro bar gonna be the cleanest plant-based option not Quito we got the kind bar minis which again are not a protein bar then we've got Z bars not a protein bar Clif bars not a protein bar and in the cliff builders I don't even want to touch them to be honest I already know at least they are gluten-free and low glycemic that's a plus but they don't make the cut so we had those ratio bars and then we have the Kirkland bars okay these are going to be the two that you should choose when it comes down to it plain and simple obviously I could go into a lot more depth but I want to be respectful of everybody's done so I do want to encourage everyone to keep watching my channel but also if you're interested in a video that I did on protein powders at Costco I'll link out to it below and YouTube will probably recommend it but I highly recommend that one cuz I break down a lot more of the detail of what goes into a protein powder not in just a protein bar

candy man I feeling uh cupcakes was medicated frosting go good look at this quite the talented person Medicaid can domesticated sugar free sugar free sugar free frosting its medicated so diabetics and folks to have issues with sugar these here will suit the cause and I'm just dabbing it in here and filling up these brownies tonight sugar free brownies I made last night and I got a sugar-free frosting in a little pastry bag and then since I've put them in bags I can't frost the top so I'm gonna frost the insides and seal them up a little sugar free chocolate wafers yeah and then you're gonna put a chocolate kiss I think something similar to that on the coffee chocolate wafer sugar-free chocolate wafer yeah so it's like I can't believe it's not a cupcake cupcake yeah and there in the background there's a five gallon jug of homemade wine we made and it's pretty good it sent two people home I don't think we've heard from him since all right what it appears that we have looked like some Christ UFOs your soil these are area 51's they're sugar-free area 51's with the crashed you up following them don't like my Roswell racks except these are different and when you're packaging you want the chocolate you can either put it flat on it to seal it you know holding on to it where if you had a frosted you wouldn't be able to put it in the bag and take your 12 people that you love so you do it either way you can either stick them in sideways make it look like a little wrecked UFO disc which I like oh you put them flat on there be the their friends landed to see what they're doing yeah something's gonna land after a couple of these it will be landing on the couch yeah these are these are pretty hopped up these have some good donation from my friend that makes these beautiful gel caps that help a lot of people so he gave us a couple of big buckets of donation so this has his strains in it his strains Akif and we thought we'd doing something special so that's where these came along so we're gonna hook him up with a bucket a bucket of good animals well there you are three trays of area 51's sweet to the taste yet sugar-free I hope they enjoy these y'all have a good day stay medicated and keep smiling", "2PFqTmcCFSk": "intermittent fasting and fasting is a very sensitive period of time little things that you consume or don't consume can throw things totally aloof so what I want to do in this video is I want to help you understand exactly what can actually slow down the effects of a fast particularly in the way of vitamins and supplementation okay so we're gonna dive into some studies that took a deep dive look at this at the genetic level and overall at the enzymatic and even on top of G level so we'll break down in that in just a second you are tuned into the Internet's leading performance fat loss and nutrition channel new videos coming out every single Tuesday Friday and Sunday at 7 a.m. Pacific time and a bunch of other videos peppered in throughout the week as well you have to make sure you hit that little Bell button and turn on notifications so you always see my videos but also check out highly calm so you can see the latest and greatest premium performance apparel that I'm always decked out in in my videos ok so people asked all the time what supplements can I take during a fast I think the easier way to address this is what you absolutely should not take during a fast so what we're gonna do is we're gonna look at a study that was published in rejuvenation or research this was a really cool breakdown what they did is they took a look at 24 participants over the course of 10 weeks ok so it's a 10 weeks random crossover study so randomized crossover study so what they did is they broke them down into two separate periods of time for one period of time they did just intermittent fasting for another period of time after that they did intermittent fasting with the addition of antioxidants in the mix that they took vitamin C and they took vitamin E now over the course of both of these test periods they consumed 175 percent of their calories on their non fasting day and 25 percent of their calories on a fasting day and they fasted every other day so trying to make things super simple so everyone can track here participants fasted every other day so I was like one day on one day off and at the end of all of it they still consumed a net neutral amount of calories they didn't want to have any weight loss coming into the equation here they purely wanted to look at genes and overall antioxidant effect so the whole purpose of this study was to try to determine what actually happens at the genetic level and what happens in terms of antioxidants and what happens in terms of oxidative stress so what we have to remember about fast and this is super super important is whenever you're fasting you're trying to put stress on your body the whole benefit of intermittent fasting is coming from the stress you're putting on your body I know that sounds counterintuitive and counterproductive but it's true by depriving yourself of food by depriving yourself of nutrients you're putting stress on your body and it's your body's adaptation to this stress that makes you a more efficient more effective human being okay so what the researchers wanted to see was if we added antioxidants did it improve fasting or did it hurt fasting well the results were pretty darn wild you see what they actually found is that the fasting group when they did not consume antioxidants had a pretty good increase of something known as SAR T 3 cert 3 this is a specific gene okay they had a 2.7 percent increase of cert 3 what this means is that they had an increase in the body's ability to process free radicals to eliminate them and to overcome basically adversity in terms of the physiological sense so the body became more efficient fasting put stress on the body and it improved at a genetic level which is so wicked cool the ability to process oxidative stress what they found is that when the participants consumed antioxidants when they had vitamin C and vitamin E during their fasting period it nullified that effect there was no increase in cert 3 so basically what ended up happening is by adding antioxidants during the fast it gave them a crutch so their body didn't have the need to adapt as much because it already had the exhaustion is help from the vitamin C in the vitamin E now I'm smiling because that's freaking crazy cool the body is so sensitive with that so the best analogy that you can really look at it like this is like it's like having someone totally sheltered it's like having a small kid and never letting them see the world right they're never having a chance to be exposed to stress so as they grow up they essentially become weaker right because they don't have the ability to cope well basically by fasting and then adding antioxidants in you're giving yourself a crutch and you're giving yourselves a crutch so they don't have to deal with it they don't have to cope they don't have that coping ability or at least not as much so when we look at that we realize that reactive oxygen species while fasting is actually good to a degree so researchers at Cambridge University wanted to dive a little bit further so what they did is they took a look at adding a few other things to when people were fasting they looked at tray hellos which is a kind of sugar they looked at rep myosin adding that into the mix and then they looked at adding an antibiotic into the mix okay this is where things got wild they were looking at the autopsy of echt they wanted to see if antibiotics and things like that actually affected the body's ability to induce autophagy to actually start the cellular repair process well guess what when consuming those things the body did not go into as much of a state of etapa G so when you're consuming things that give you a crutch like an antibiotic you are reducing the auto Fujii the benefit of the fast one more wild and crazy thing it's also been found that plasma insulin levels of course lower when you're fasting this is one of the main keys to fat loss we want low insulin levels but guess what when you look at intermittent fasting with antioxidant supplementation during your fast plasma insulin levels didn't decrease whoa okay now it's not a matter of breaking your fast etc etc it's a matter of what's going on an enzymatic and cellular level so basically what we're finding now is that the reason the insulin levels dropped so dramatically when you fast is as a result of overcoming stress so the stress is actually driving the insulin levels down during a fast and anytime we give ourselves a crutch it stops that process now I'm not here to say that you can't consume this and you can't consume that I'm not the fasting police I'm just a purveyor of information and that's all I'm trying to do is just put good processes out there and put good information out there that's gonna help you get the most out of your fast so take supplements or don't take supplements I don't personally really care but I do want to give you the information that you can use to get the most out of it so if you're gonna suffer through a fast it's a little bit difficult you might as well be getting the benefit as always to keep it locked in here in my channel see you in the next video", "oONRHdBHFfY": "hey love Sistani here and today I'm going to be talking to you guys about a new company that I was recently introduced to and all about how it helped me relax more so this company is called diamond CBD and you know a CBD is and you already know what I'm about to talk about my basically CBD is a what is it it's a component that's found in green and that's the component that makes you actually relax and feel better that's than what's actually helping a lot of people with their illnesses and pains and all that stuff so this company actually just done the work to actually take the CBD out of lead and separate it and put it into different products and all of that so you can actually they have a variety of products so depending on what you prefer you can get whatever so I got this candy cuz I'm obsessed with it means like I don't know why lately I'm in love with these rainbow gummy so not even gonna lie to you guys when I first saw this company I thought it was leave like we'd have just food food and I was like don't do drugs I don't know how that's gonna work but but that company like they explained it to me and then they have a video on the front of their site that actually explains all of this so you do not make you high they don't get you high at all you're not going to be like tripping or anything like that they literally just make you relax and feel more I don't know like say you have back pain like I normally no back pain it helped with that if you have issues sleeping if you have just a problem like with anxiety whatever and you just need to be relaxed this is for you it also helps with a bunch of other things okay so you do need to be 21 to use this or to purchase this and so on the front when I got this package I actually did not review this bottom part here I just saw this and then I went straight to the back because I started reading you know the serving size and it said four pieces so I'm like eating eating and I ate three pieces right to eat my fourth and then I see on the front and it says do not exceed more than one to two pieces every six hours so I took three like I said and I'm a small person I'm only buckling and I don't weigh that much like I'm pretty small so I took that and I promise you like the rest of the day and then it was just around around like maybe four or five o'clock for the rest of the day like all the way through the night I was like I don't know I felt so tired and I don't think these are supposed to make me feel sleepy but that's just how I react to a lot of things in general like whether it's alcohol and I've never really I've never done weed so I didn't know that this is how I would react but I just got really sleepy you know supposed to get sleepy per say but and it's got really sleepy like it helps you sleep better but that means that like your body will relax it doesn't make you like sleepy it's not a sleep aid so you're supposed to be able to take these any time of day so I got really really sleepy I wanted took a nap and then just the rest of the night I was like really tired and drowsy but the next day I took the regular dose I just took one piece of candy it's like just to help me relax before bed or whatever and I didn't really feel any more tired because of it but it definitely did help with my back pain and it helped me relax so I will definitely say these work like these are like probably one of my new favorite things because it's natural one and it's just it's just a good alternative to taking pain medication all the time and all of that now I do wish the serving size is a bit more because I like eating candy but I just I just probably need to get it in another form other than candy so they told me they have it they have drops that you can put in stuff they have well so they have they have it in other foods they have they have a bunch of options you just have to go to their website and see and then you can use that to make whatever you want and put it in whatever food or you can take it directly under your tongue whatever you wanna do now these in here it says the serving like if we're going based on what the back says it says serving it's four pieces so there's about two servings in here so if we're going based on the front and there's about four to five start rings in here so I think it's that's great these cost 15 dollars that's before shipping and these cost 15 dollars this back and they have variety of products all different prices if I if you're saying like I can get like maybe five pieces out of this that's pretty good that's actually pretty good and I would definitely get this again I'm probably going to get this again because like I said I do have back issues like I'm spine and stuff and so it did actually help with that a lot I recently got a desktop computer so the flora would often work off my laptop and so I got my desktop and so a lot of times I have to use it because a storage is better and all of that I have to use it sitting at my desk and that is always been an issue for me for years and years and years because I've you know even in high school I was home-schooled and so working at home you know doing my schoolwork I'd have to sit up and then at my desk and all of that it just always been an issue because my back hurts so I prefer to work from my bed if I have to do like you know stuff on my laptop or whatever because it's more comfortable and I can prop up a pillow and all that but yeah so sitting at my desk often time really hurts my back and I don't enjoy it at all like I will do everything I can so that I don't have to work at my desk because it's not the most enjoyable for me but this definitely helps I don't know if I should be taking it every day so I'm not gonna do that but I think it's safe like to you know do it every day it's not gonna be addictive or anything like that but yeah I'm probably gonna use it again and I would suggest that you guys check them out gonna link your website in my description box this is like a really cool product that very happy I was introduced to so make sure you check it out if you have not already make sure you subscribe to my channel and also in the comments let me know have you ever tried CBD not weed not just not weed if you've smoked weed that's great for you but like if you've ever tried CBD by itself let me know and let me know if it works for you and do not forget to check them out alright I will see you guys in my next video bye [Music]", "DaUvNFeTEao": "Jenny

going to be doing a review of the medicated hard candies I've done reviews on this before I've just never done uh it's root beer so there are 30 milligrams each and I still have this really bad cold like it's it's horrible I don't have the the muscle pains or anything but everything's just kind of here and you just feel like [ __ ] so I'm hoping that this will this will feel better this will feel better this will make me feel better okay so let's let's see I'll do okay all of it why not it's Saturday I have nothing to do I've been like this since Thursday maybe you know oops make me feel better I'll put these two in at first um they taste like the root beer surprisingly because I haven't been able to taste [ __ ] and then you could taste like it tastes a bit of that that we'd taste or whatever it is but I will say the the root beer ones here you can taste the root beer I've done a big fan of root beer but at least least I'm not tasting like the weed because it wasn't usually when I do it really sticks in your mouth so what I'll do is let these dissolve and when I come back I'll let you know how long it took for them to kick in and also what I'm feeling and all kinds of stuff like that so it'll be doctor probably usually takes about an hour yeah it's like around 12:30 now so probably it'll be a little bit it doesn't work if art used to work really quick and notes that's real roughly about an hour you know what sometimes I wake to I've been waiting I'll go a little bit over when I first start feeling it because usually it what I'm done telling you guys it's you know if I would have waited the extra 15 minutes or whatever to do it or even half an hour sometimes cuz it just keeps getting stronger for me anyways and anyways we'll be back I'll be back to tell you what I'm feeling and everything else ok so it's been like um like an hour and a half I would say and at first like I started like when I first started to filling in feeling feeling this it was like roughly about it like an hour in ten minutes and then hang on I'm gonna I'm gonna light a joint so that one's looking around in an hour and ten minutes and then um I was like well like I started to feel better right I was like oh my sickness it's finally going away so I you know I went out and [Music] it's nice but it's like really windy here you know and then I put some like I had like these little um glass pumpkins you know whatever so those are going inside and [ __ ] this [ __ ] joint so then you know then a I had some other things I had to do like ahead of this list Lola this list that um but I you know whenever I thought of something that like had to be it has to be done before the snow comes and then I went back in the house cuz I was in and out doing stuff and it was like so nice and cozy in there but i was like no we can't feel okay like I feel better than I did yesterday way better there's the bus we better than the first day I'd say smoke this when when you're gonna cold still feel like that congestion and [ __ ] but you if you need to get some stuff done let's stand in here in the cubby [Music] somebody's mowing the grass and I don't know why anyways I'm dumb so the medicated hard candies you get them at Canada smell the root beer is actually pretty not like it's it's not that bad like you can taste a lot of the root beer taste some I find that you don't taste like you know I don't know I say strawberry Kiwi I think that was one of them but you taste like a lot of the THC the root beer I tasted the root beer I'll stay stay on stuff but the root beer was I need to just keep puffing on this [Music] thank you Charlie likes this kind of weather I know what I want to give this [Music] I'm gonna give it a 9 in the oh my [ __ ] category just because like this this feels better than when you take like cold pills you know like cool pills gets rid of like say this stuff you know is for a couple hours and but sometimes this kind of cute nut cures but it makes it better than the cold pills not too sure how it would work on the COFF maybe because I reek like if it's a indica and it was a really one of the things and it was feeling relaxed maybe you would kind of slow down your cough ever think anyways that's my gig at night because you know you're sick but it feels so much better like it's the only thing to is okay so this is we're still spoken the new Caen before I got sick I like the munchies like crazy since I've been sick I have like and cuz that's part of the cold they think that you have no one no appetite you can just you eat but it's like it's not a big deal and maybe it's because like you can't taste either I don't did you hear the bang fire a Charlie wait Charlie's right there he didn't even alert me what's wrong with you there's mr. Berg [ __ ] I was okay and now like I'm really maybe they don't like the smell but it's really windy oh maybe not just slam the door what the [ __ ] this review went from like being grade and it's still great but there's just a little paranoia anyways I was gonna say maybe gonna rake the yard but I'm not really sure I want to do that anymore this [ __ ] joint that's not even me that's rolling it's like a little machine so dr. everywhere there's one year that's one over there just keep smoking it and they won't know if maybe I'm having us like it just that cigarette cigarette come on this I'm just a little nervous I was all talkative Oh forgotten I'm coffee I [Music] don't think you all forget it's a little close I don't think you want to watch me rake the yard like that's a little bit boring so I'll just keep talking um yeah this stuff is pretty good I could move or they'd probably be so much better if you weren't second did it but and and you'd probably you know like when you're sick and you don't sleep as well this stuff here would probably you would probably get a good night's sleep yeah I would have thought a like if you [Music] stop charlie you take like cold medicine and whatever for how many years and like you don't even there is stuff that is and it lasts longer too like cold medicine is it doesn't last that long like four hours like maybe two hours this stuff lasts way longer than two hours and you feel way better there yeah there's Charlie he wants to play hey Charlie want to play um okay so um my hands are starting to get a little bit cold and I think maybe I should go inside so um I'll meet you guys back inside in like a minute or two okay so um it's been like it's just about been like two hours and then still I'm feeling uh still pretty good I'm a little bit hungry not like um not like you just you just need to like chew on something like a couple chips or I don't know whatever it is right and bettan you're good like you just um the only thing that I noticed that's different is my nose is really stopped right now but tomorrow I still feel good and get it at can abysmal and I was also just thinking like maybe it's not mad for everybody but I should take this before you know taking the cold medication and you're still like um you feel like when you do when you're high except if you have a cold then you feel the cold part too but it's like you know it's there but like the symptoms aren't really bugging you overclock the the type of day it is today like gum it's I don't know it's ten or eleven or out and sunny and there's like a wind and there's like there's not much there's not like a lot of leave while the trees most of them are pretty bare just the type of day it is it's like a you know it reminds me when I was a kid just like though you know like you can smell Thal it's like one of those days these hard candies you know pretty good and if you want to maybe experience um [Music] now that he said that okay so yesterday there was like a little bit of snowflakes here not like a lot but there was so many like there was not like enough and I remembered when I was a kid that we had a deck and there was me and my brother and my my friend and her brother so I was friends with her and my brother was friends with her brother I don't remember we're outside playing and and we were on the deck and for whatever reason I don't know what worden I remember when it started to snow and it was like around like 4:30 ish so it was it was um like night I think it wasn't a sunny day so it was my not dark but you know it was like kind of like dark anyways remember we started jumping up and down saying they was snowing and like how we were gonna go sliding from this little bit of snow and I was like I forgot all about bad yeah I find like other than like the the the being sick part it's good like I just I wish I wasn't feeling like this so it would feel better but it still feels good um and I think that's everything said nine get them from I can't abismo the medicated hard candies there thirty milligrams each and and oh my god no this is just getting really bad Hey oh yeah there's like a lots of different flavors they have on there I enjoy them [Music] and I think that's that's everything so that's it that's all bye", "DhGmpnoh7VU": "[Music] hi guys and welcome back to my kitchen now one trend that i am seeing everywhere this christmas are the hot chocolate bombs now these you can add into a mug and you pour hot milk over them and it explodes with cocoa powder and marshmallows now these are a great gift or just something really fun to make so if you haven't already tried and you want to give them a go in this week's video tutorial i'm going to be showing you how you can make them look like little christmas puddings now if you're not a fan of hot chocolate or you just want to try something different i'm also going to be making some that i filled with sponge cake or brownies where you can pour hot chocolate sauce over them for the perfect dessert for christmas day okay let's get started so you're gonna need to start with your molds now there are a selection of silicone molds available and i will put a link in the description below where i show you how i use the silicone molds to create some spheres which i've added on the top of the cake but in today's video i'm going to be using this more plastic mold and this one is actually by a company called fest cake london and is a three part system so i'm going to be showing you how to use this one now for these chocolate balms i'm going to be using some dark chocolate and also some white chocolate now when i melt this down i do need to temper the chocolate now you may have seen in some of my other videos i tend to use a lot of candy melts and i like using these because they don't need to be tempered now you can buy different chocolate in order to temper you can buy a little discs or you can just use normal chocolate bars that you would buy from a shop now if you buy chocolate from a shop it has already been tempered so it's got that glossy finish and when you break it it's got a nice snap to it now when you melt chocolate you change the consistency of the sugar crystals inside so it's no longer tempered so if you don't retemper the chocolate before you add it into your molds it means that it's never going to get solid it's also going to have a mac appearance to it and it can also bloom which means you get these little white dots all over the chocolate where the cocoa fat has separated from the chocolate itself now this mold that i'm using only has space for three separate spheres i'm going to be using 100 grams of chocolate which is going to give me enough for these three spaces so first starting with my dark chocolate i'm going to cut my 200 gram bar in half so that i've got the right amount i then want to take about a third of my chocolate and just break this into smallish lumps pop this to one side break up the rest of my chocolate place this into a glass bowl pop this on top of a saucepan of boiling water to melt this down now you can also use the microwave i just find this a little bit easier for me so that i can keep an eye on the temperature i've then got a thermometer so i'm going to pop this inside the mixture as i'm stirring it up now with a dark chocolate you don't want the temperature to get any higher than around 57 to 58 degrees now once it reaches this temperature even if all that chocolate hasn't already melted i'm going to take it off of my saucepan now what we want to do is cool that chocolate down and this is going to temper the chocolate so the extra third of chocolate that we kept to one side add a piece at a time just stirring this in allowing the melted chocolate to melt the larger lumps and just keep an eye on the temperature then that temperature gets down to around 29 to 30 degrees it's ready to be used in your mould what we're looking for is our chocolate to be nice and glossy and once it's hardened you want to be able to snap the chocolate and get that nice snap sound now if you are melting milk chocolate or white chocolate then you don't want the temperature to get any higher than 45 degrees for milk chocolate and around 43 degrees for white chocolate you then want to bring the temperature of the milk and white chocolate down slightly more so for milk it's between about 27 to 28 degrees and for white chocolate it's around 26 to 27. as long as you're working within this range then your chocolate is gonna be tempered now different chocolate that you can buy sometimes has some different instructions depending on how it's made so always make sure that if you are buying chocolate that is especially for melting and for tempering but they might have their own instructions on the packet now if you are finding it a little bit confusing to follow i will put some instructions in the description below this video for how i temper my chocolate now bring it back in my mould i'm going to separate the top so this bit just comes out and we have these soft plastic inserts so i'm gonna take those out on the mold there is a line around each of the semicircles and this is how much chocolate we need to add this mold is very similar to the silicone molds with the silicone molds we would just push it all the way up the side this one is going to allow us to get a uniform size all the way around and give us a nice thick rim on the top to stick the two together take the soft inserts push that chocolate down until it comes all the way to the top i can then pop the back on and just flip this over now if there's any parts where you don't think that it's come all the way to the bottom just work that chocolate round now that is ready to pop into the fridge for around 10 minutes just for that chocolate to completely harden now if you like these molds as much as i do i have spoken to fest cake london and they have given me a 10 off a discount code for all of you now this includes the seven centimeter sphere mold that i've been using in today's video and all of their full price bwb chocolate molds now if you click the link and i will put this in the description below the video this will take you to their website and it will automatically take over 10 off any of the molds when you add them to your car okay so i've just taken my mold out of the fridge and i'm going to take the back piece off now if your chocolate has tempered properly the shells should just release themselves from the mold and as you can see it's nice and glossy on the outside i'm just going to hold that and pull off inside of my mould also take off any excess bits and these can just be washed and used again now there are only three so it gives me one complete ball so i am going to make a few more just so i get the other half of this one so for these ones i'm gonna make these into hot chocolate buns so i've got some of my hot chocolate chocolate powder and also some mini marshmallows i'm gonna bring back in the back of my moulds i'm going to use this to hold my first shell and the great thing about this one is because this one goes in the inside it's slightly smaller than the shell that just pokes out a small amount i'm going to put my hot chocolate powder in there and fill the rest up with my marshmallows i've then got my metal scraping tool that i use for smoothing around the edges of my cakes so i'm going to take that and just using a kitchen torch heat that up bring back in the other half of my chocolate ball just place that on the top just move it around to melt that outer edge slightly and place that onto my ball and lift that out and just make sure there's no excess chocolate on the edge so then we've got our full chocolate ball now with these ones i'm going to finish these off so they look like little christmas puddings i'm going to add the cream that's going to go on the top so i've tempered down some white chocolate now white chocolate does have a yellow tinge to it so if you did want this pure white you can use some bright white candy melts pop it into a piping bag bring back in the balls bend these on the side so that you can see that seam and the reason for that is when you then look at the balls from the front you're not going to see a line running all the way around starting with a ball which is around an inch in diameter i'm going to drip this down the side using end of the piping bag as a guide now to add to the top i'm going to create a small piece of holly so i've got a dark green fondant and just a small piece of red you can either use a plunger cutter or i'm going to be using a little holly shape which is from the christmas foliage sweet stamp elements there stamp that into my fondant to create an outline cut this out with my craft knife i'm going to take my shape and just pinch one end together and take in the red just roll out some really small balls around four to five millimeters in diameter and these are going to be the berries taking those bits of holly i'm going to place that onto the chocolate and add in those little balls that we made now i'm going to leave that for that white chocolate just to harden up but then we have our hot chocolate choco bombs so all you need to do once they're all set is just take your chocolate bomb and pop this into a mug you then want to heat up some milk and just pour this over the top that milk is then going to melt our chocolate balm and those marshmallows and the chocolate powder is going to explode from inside you can then stir this around and you have a delicious cup of hot chocolate now as an alternative to the hot chocolate bombs if you wanted to use this as a dessert instead then you can fill it with some sponge cake or here i've got some small squares of brownies and this can be used as a dessert possibly for christmas day so i'm gonna take my first shell fill the inside with my chocolate brownies so i've got four small brownies in total and each brownie is about an inch by an inch and a half so making sure that it's not coming over the edge melting that outer edge so the two halves are going to stick together and then going to use my white chocolate as i did for creating that drip on the top and adding on a little piece of holly so we have exactly the same design but instead of using this one for hot chocolate we can use this for a really fun dessert for christmas day once your chocolate balm has been made you can then pop it onto your plate or into your bowl and tip hot chocolate sauce over the top the hot chocolate sauce is going to melt that outer shell and you're going to have a really yummy chocolate dessert i really hope you've enjoyed this video and we'll be able to use it to make your own chocolate bombs if you have enjoyed the video as always don't forget to give it a like and if you'd like to see more videos like this or more christmas inspired videos

video reviews and commentary on all things cannabis and today I'm gonna do a video review on morsel cookies and this is what they look like so what they are are just little edible cookies and they come in 80 milligram doses and all these kind of different flavors I have sea salt caramel and cashew and blueberry boys so I've already tried these before I've actually had the other flavours I can't remember I had chocolate raspberry and another one that I can't remember but they come in so many different flavors I know they have a lemon one assignment one and I believe they have one more flavor that I I just can't remember off the top of my head so I'm just gonna show you guys like what they look like and stuff I'm not really gonna eat them in front of you because I'm actually saving this for next week for a very special event or occasion um I'm just I don't know they actually just have simple ingredients I'll just tell you what they have they're actually made of eggs flour sugar blueberries and butter well for this one cuz it's the flavor is blueberry but I'm pretty sure the other ones are made with all different kinds of stuff well they're all basically made from like eggs flour sugar but like this one the sea salt caramel this one's made from caramel extract cashews butter and the same eggs flour and sugar so that's pretty nice and they were actually like not that expensive there were only $5 at the place that I bought them from which I will not disclose that on this video just because I don't want to put out any names or ideas that I'm favoring a certain place I'm not but I'll just open these up for you and show you what they're like they're kind of like hard to open I think like I need to get some scissors real quick so I'm when you go do that okay so I got some scissors and I opened up the package and this is what it looks like inside it's just a square little cookie I don't know if you can see it it's pretty green too so you can definitely tell that this is what we're looking for and I'm just going to take it out of the package just I could show you guys it's really crumbly so I don't want to mess it up and there it is it comes in a perfect square and I pulled out the sea salt caramel cashew so you can see it has little cashews in it and it's just a little square and yeah this is 80 milligrams all by itself so I don't know if you guys like eating edibles or a lot or if you're the type of person who likes to just smoke more than eat edibles which is that's the type of person I am so usually when I eat edibles I'm like blown I'm like [ __ ] up out of my mind and it's just awesome um as far as the taste goes I'm not gonna taste these ones just because I know what the other two of tasted like the one that I bought I wouldn't say they have like a very distinct flavor to them because you could really taste like the weed and [ __ ] in it like you could really taste it it's like it's not bad because I'm the person who loves the taste of weed but if you're not then these probably aren't the edibles for you but they're really good if you don't like eating a like a big portion of edibles just to get a high like these are like really small and potent even the lady was telling me like these are super potent like they're honestly they're good and I know I trusted her um I took them last week and I was just sitting maybe for like an hour and a half two hours and yeah you could definitely feel it was just like you're sitting there you're like oh my god it's coming like you know repelled like it's it definitely works is what I'm gonna say and usually like edibles just don't work for me it's it's really weird but these are amazing and I do recommend that you take these on the go or I mean if you're wanting a small little snack or you just want to feel high for a little bit these are so perfect I love them and they taste good like you can tell that they have a little bit different flavor just because it says well this one has cashews obviously you're probably gonna taste the cashews um as far as the chocolate rose Brown chocolate raspberry went it didn't really taste like raspberry but you can definitely taste like chocolate weed and that's what I would say it tasted like and that's all I really have to say about it um you could follow them on Instagram or any social media site that morsel cookies are on for medical cannabis patients so that's all I really have to say this video thank you guys for watching and just sticking around and sorry I didn't get to show you what's inside this it's basically the same exact thing it's probably just like slightly blue because it's a blueberries but they all are generally the same size and they taste amazing like I said if you don't like the super weedy taste you probably wouldn't enjoy these as much but if you are a person who does not mind the taste then yeah you will love these so some of what you guys think and catch me on social media I'll put my links in the description and thank you guys for watching peace out", "JZ5akY3-O74": "hey guys what's up it's your highness the channel that does video reviews and commentary on all things cannabis

on our seventh or eighth video now if there's anything you want to see technology-wise let me know and we'll talk about it on the shelf in the meantime let's get to cooking this is chocolate chip cookie brownie bombs I don't even know that term just sounds illegal to me but it's gonna be amazing we're gonna do it right now all right let's see we got here I've got butter I've got little mini chocolate chips flour brown sugar milk white sugar vanilla pinch of salt fudge brownie mix and candy quick this is for melting chocolate and dipping things into it you ready my first thing we're gonna do cook your brownies according to the Box recipe okay egg oil water mix it up and get your brownies made in a 9 by 13 pan you're gonna need that done first so let's do that okay time to make our dough we're gonna put our sugar in there and white raise it up and stir it till creamy okay now I'm gonna put in my milk and the vanilla and let that mix in for a moment eating kind of like smell it then our flower [Applause] and our pinch of salt [Applause] and let that mix up all right it looks pretty good let me show you what it looks like can you see that that's some cookie dough put the cookie dough off to the side take one of these scooper things and you wanna cut them down like that and just scoop out here cook you know bombs this is the heart of it all okay I'm not done with the cookie dough balls yet but the brownies are done so pull them out and let them cool okay it made way more than they thought look at those I'm gonna pop these in my big freezer in my garage you want to harden them up so get them in the freezer for a little bit and this is just a single recipe guys the recipe just down below if you need it I'll be right back okay so take one of your your cookie balls I made mine flat bottom you don't have to if you want them round when you pull them out of the cookie scoop just roll them in your hands but I like the flat bottoms and what I did was I cut my brownies into one-inch sections so I'm gonna take a section of a brownie some of the it's really moist still gonna press it flat I hope this works this is the part that would probably go go wrong I'm gonna put it right here and then press until it completely covers the cook you know there we go and there it is set that over here on another try and do that with all your cookie dough balls they're all covered in brownie now let's put it back in the freezer again all right if you've never worked with candy quick I haven't either but it's pretty simple I just read the directions you pull this out leave in the tray microwave on HIGH for 60 seconds that's it then you got chopped up to coat your stuff so I'm gonna get this in the microwave and go get the cookie dough bombs look it's not even melting oh wow it did no look at that that was weird okay that's what it means it holds its form until you're ready all right so let's start moving these quickly you put your cookie dough brownie ball

up in the morning take a shower like this sucks these kids have been pretty good doing the homestay right although when school was out it was really difficult to find weeds so it was a lot easier when he went back to school it was like yes you know i'm really happy that we have this uh medical program since you mentioned that yes it's nice to be able to go to the dispensary and i'm really excited about that dress because it's beautiful thank you very much i appreciate you you are stepping it up and making me look like uh like i just rolled out of bed well you know it's really it's really much easier than you think see if i wear it over top and a bottom i have to find the top two things but this i just throw a dress on i'm always jealous of girls where i just have any shoes on that guy from uh harbor side what was his name dress yes yes he figured it out he's like look yeah this is just one thing i don't gotta think about it i think tie-dye dresses you get them they're like 10 bucks when they go on sale and then he changed his name to dress if you haven't watched weed wars that's something you're definitely going to want to check out it's uh i don't know what it's on anymore i gotta find it on youtube i think um i'm having the same thing you were having yesterday with your arms with with my arms today too times are feeling tight i'm feeling huge yeah but mine are feeling more fat than huge well i know mine are more fat because i'm not doing anything i have a little bit it's crazy how fast it comes back i can feel it already like all i'm here right yeah i like this mic because it makes your memory all my shirts look like a v-neck that's cute v-neck gives me that v-tape around v-neck v-taper that smells good that's right so duct tape yeah i think so the duct tape i put a couple of reels up for vitican and man people love that that that duct tape yeah you know even at like a pretty low percentage i think it's like 13 or something yeah but it's still very much it's still really great you know like um we smoked some other stuff that was like 27 and i didn't tell that much of a difference right that seems to be the thing lately i can't really tell when it's higher percentages i think that's going to be a new thing maybe we do a new segment where it's like we have you know two different strains that are like really different and then we see which one we like better yeah because i'm finding that some of the ones that are lower percentage are especially during the day time you know during the daytime i felt like we were getting too much before or maybe i'm thinking that maybe it's not that maybe the higher percentages are just [ __ ] maybe it's all for me that sometimes just make me tired too sleepy especially first thing in the morning yeah i like that alaska alaska is good we gotta get some more of that that's what dr uh michelle weiner said when i said i'm tired all day she's like well how many dabs do you do like i actually don't like dabbing i smoke like three or four joints a day and you know but i have been taking the rso yeah i mean i haven't don't have any right now i need to get some more but um that definitely increases your tolerance but that could also make you sleepy yeah i like those uh i like the the the [ __ ] strains are really interesting like i i don't know how to describe them but i really like that um that alaska and i posted a little video of it right and everybody thinks it's alaska alaskan thunder [ __ ] oh that's funny and then like is that alaskan thunder foot i'm like no where'd you get that i i wish it was but completely different type of strain this one is actually totally um um researched and bred well it's 15 years of research over in israel for a specific specific purpose and specific effects whereas alaskan thunder [ __ ] is just exactly what it's called there to [ __ ] you up right i've only had that once i've never forget it's one of you know these memories that are just crystal clear you know never forget right i'll never forget my friend walking into the band room yeah with wheat he had just been in the coast guard okay right and he had come back from being in the coast guard and he was like visiting for a few weeks or a month or something right and we all used to hang out in music studios in in staten island there was this big studio had a whole bunch of rooms in it every everybody was friends with all the bands and stuff right and lou comes in and he's like i got this alaskan thunder [ __ ] and we were like what the [ __ ] is that we didn't we didn't even know that there were like real weird names like you know like like maui wowie or you knew like rags but nobody ever had any you know what i mean like you saw it in cheech and chong movies yeah but it was like asking thunderbug that sounds amazing right and it was yeah it was amazing and so i remember it so well maybe it was amazing that's why i remember it yeah how would you be able to remember it i'm kidding i love that kidding kidding so what do you have for news today oh news news what do we got we got considering there's uh edibles have come out i have eight things you need to know about eating marijuana edibles right um and not just you know for the people that are watching the show but for people that are watching the show to share so um i you know i don't see the big like excitement for me personally right but there's going to be a lot of people taking them yeah i think i'd rather just make my own maybe with rso but it sounds that way but i have a feeling that people are going to well to me you know being so body conscious right or you know right wrong or indifferent right i have a hard time with i was always like making my own because nobody was ever making healthy healthy animals um there was one company that came out i don't know if they're still around um but it was called auntie dolores and they were at arc view they got funding um i think they didn't do well with the funding i'm not sure i think they didn't spend it well right um but they created healthy and savory stuff like they had nuts that weren't sweet that were infused right right that was like a couple years ago you couldn't find any of that right and that's what i was saying like how come there isn't like something that's not made out of sugar or something that's not made out of fat like why is all these edibles unhealthy right and you would think california you have like right they're usually like on top of the health right that's usually like oh there's too much sugar in that and like you know like so i don't know maybe now there's like [ __ ] keto edibles out there i bet you there's actually yeah there's got to be but i use that's why i used to make my own is because i could not have all the sugar they make it so easy now selling rso it's true yeah i saw someone posted earlier for the first time they uh made some um infused chocolate and couldn't believe how easy it was basically just melt the chocolate down and out of the i was thinking that your slitter are so and you know it's not like so simple but but you could just take a bunch of godiva chocolate bars and put them in a little double boiler right right should have been there right exactly yeah and then you gotta figure out what to do with the chocolate and not eat it while you're making it it's kind of like you can dip stuff in it right you can be infused like chocolate dip dipping make like cake pops right that's not healthy use dark chocolate ghirardelli 99 right you can add some bitter nice and bitter so you don't eat too much um so i've got that we've also got um the wonderful article you said here we're going to save it for later he had marijuana coming out of his what it's warm up here today isn't it um a little warm yeah yeah drawing uh no i'm gonna change no i'll be okay i can turn the fan on no i'll be all right i'll survive i'll survive i also have uh boomers smoking twice as much as medical cannabis as millennials what yeah that to that that you have an operational word there medical cannabis okay so i'm thinking that that means that millennials are more or less getting cards right i can see that's a lot of uh good statistics expenses good statistics recent survey determined baby boomers consumed cannabis for medical purposes twice the rate as millennials when it comes to recreational weed though those numbers are reversed maybe it's just common sense so boomers uh 50 of boomers uh in the survey use cannabis primarily as medicine 28 use it for recreation only for recreation it's very strange very strange strange question yeah and 22 percent use it for both i would say most of them using it for both yeah because we've spoken recreation is medicinal right and then millennials 22 percent use cannabis as their primary primarily as medicine 50 or 49 use well they change the terminology to weed because it's recreational apparently only for recreation and 29 use it for both so millennials are a little bit more up on the uh crossover between medical and recreational because they're the same i don't know what's so amusing about photos of grandma's smoking weed but it's pretty funny because it's cognitive dissonance you don't expect to see it it's pretty funny um i want to see them like i want to see like a bridge game you know like my grandmother's bridge game but instead of like the cigarettes they're smoking marijuana like this one looks like she's pretty cool what are you trying to say about your mom she's not cool that's not what i'm saying i'm just saying that she's um very innocent yes she's the same like she's definitely got that completely opposite of me she's definitely got that like um june cleaver right kind of like innocence about it it's gonna be so funny that he's here it would be hilarious yeah yeah um i would try and i would love for the moment where she like lights it the wrong way like underneath the bowl well my first book yesterday about the 80 year was injecting they took the pipe too far in the mouth and then the lighter was kind of did you see the did you ever see the video of the guy that do i have a pipe in here let me get you over no i don't um you see the video of the guy that's lighting the pipe from underneath like a crack pipe so funny he's like heating up the bike that's hilarious like dude too many tara videos i know i know i was just thinking that see i'm getting my mic off already is that lighter working over there spidey can lighter yes that layer is working so for those of you who haven't heard yet this thursday we will be in brandon curalee is having a grand opening in brandon and then we will be in fort lauderdale for the grand opening at um fluent on friday right yes ma'am can i say that correct holy mackerels i knew where that term comes from is that just like they see a fish and then it's like holy mackerel yeah we could find out what it's all about um i'll be enough mackerel it's the one type of sushi i do not like it tastes a lot like fish very fishy sounds disgusting have you never had it i eat a lot of sashimi when i get sushi yeah like we go to sushi place because i don't like all the rice and stuff so um i would get like the sashimi deluxe when it comes to like 22 pieces of fish and or something like that 22 24 something like that and uh like yeah it's all like the sushi it's like sushi would have the rice underneath it that's all but it's all raw and then um they they don't let you pick like the type you want they give you like an assortment of selection so it comes with like three of that four that three those three this and the mackerel is like me yeah i have like i've never had it don't get in wasabi and stuff and just like kill it it doesn't sound very good it's good it is good it is no chuck that's perfect that is the perfect explanation of where the cure leaf is in brandon because i looked it up on um google maps and it's exactly what it is it's the old world of floors next to taste of india taste of india we should go there yeah um because you like the no meat i do big feet yeah you know what that's from do you no meat big feet i eat wood no it's from uh it's from uh this is doubtfire the end you read in the comments yeah yeah okay yeah yeah you ready smoke that no come on nope you're teasing me that's interesting what this article that you're going to next pro tips oh i don't know if i was going to come to that one okay i think we need to do this one first okay because the edibles are coming mm-hmm okay these are simple though all right these are like basic basic rules still sleeping eight things you need to know about eating marijuana edibles number one start small it's going to be kind of easy to do that because we have a 10 milligram limit right on individual servings but there's going to be a real um there's going to be a lot of people that don't know i was going to say it converts right yes yes i think we get to i think this article gets set up but i might it might not um yes i think it does um so edibles are going to come out people are really excited about it and i think people are gonna over consume them right um i think it just goes without saying that that's gonna happen at first um it's you have to understand that you should start slow even though you may think that you want to jump right in um here's a good example when the bins tinctures came out right right we decided to dose them just like we would normally dose yet 40 milligrams of that was was a lot right a lot more we felt more like 200 milligrams right um so i would say when these companies start coming out with edibles you take it slow at first even if you're experienced even if you're eating nerd ropes 1200 milligram nerd robes right right you don't know how this stuff is made right and you don't know how that stuff was made i'm not for nothing i've eaten 1200 milligram rice krispies treats that i've gotten on the black market and you know god damn weight is 1200 milligrams in there so um start slow they're going to come out in 10 milligrams um at five milligrams so i start slow and then number two be patient edibles my favorite favorite story my favorite thing to do in college was make a [ __ ] ton of pop brownies and just give them to people chunks in it big chunks in it people would be like he did eat it 10 minutes later i don't feel anything come another one sure here you go no problem then they go down to the bar they come back like 20 minutes later sit on the couch completely silent just sitting on the couch did you have fun you give me some shrooms with it that was one of my favorite things to do shrooms were more when i was out out at the bar i don't know what it was i was just like here i found entertaining very strange uh yeah it's probably it's probably psychological that you just like the attention probably no one was giving me attention for anything else um oddly enough i didn't like sell weed or anything like in in high school very much right a little bit here and there i remember when i was hanging out at the foster house this guy came and they used to try and get the kids to sell weed so he actually would come with an ounce i think it was an ounce it was you would give us 10 20 bags right and you'd have to give him 200 dollars late he would front it to you it was all wrapped in tin foil there's all these little tin foil things and your job is to go out and sell those 10 20 bags and i think i can't remember like the profit margin but you had to pay i think it was 10 20 and we had to give him a hundred dollars right so it was like half price you know or something like that and um we ended up pinching all the bags and smoking them all trying to come up with money to pay back but that's how they got and then like it's so weird like this it's like it's almost like a dare commercial like the guy would come over to the foster house with like 10 pizzas right and it was like you know 15 kids there he's got all this wheat throws all the weed and pizza on the table like how is there not like an adult they're watching you guys because it was a foster house and there was like regulations where there's like an adult has to be there okay so when anne was not there we were like it was it was craziness it was an absolute free flow it was lawlessness there it really was that's why i hung out there because there were like no rules so it was like man might be upstairs on the third floor we'd sneak the guy in downstairs into the basement you know and then and would come down once in a while and she screams and start throwing stuff and screaming at people and be like oh [ __ ] dan's going crazy and then she leave and go back to what we were doing i mean don't forget we were shooting 25s into the doors in there you know like it was a weird place but you come in with 10 pizzas like a case of beer not a foster kid you guys no i was not a foster kid i hung out with you somebody else tell the story i'm like i think it sounds like you were a boss again it does and i only hung out there for like two or three years like a lot and um it was really just kind of like my friend the people i made friends with right were foster kids so i first how i met them is i went over this girl denise's house who was my friend from junior high school right and i'd have a lot of friends so me and my friend radic went over her house to go swim in her pool right and we're swimming in the pool like making a whirlpool or something like freshman or in high school or something and um as kid danny thomas comes over he lives across the street he saw us there and he we had met him before and i can't remember where we met him but we had met danny before and he was like oh [ __ ] come over to my house i got a pool and and you know it's cool [ __ ] he lived at ann's house in the foster house so me and radic went over there to go swim in his pool felt really bad leaving uh denise right that he's the same yeah um leaving denise there and but we were and from then on i just started hanging out over there like a lot and that's how [ __ ] happened you know and then post script to that denise dated this guy matt who lived in the foster house who was like he had all his potential he's gonna be an architect and everything they broke up he takes all her clothes and lights him on fire in front of her house right the house siding starts to catch fire he gets arrested for arson wow whoa and he was like the good kid there like he just like had a real breakdown after the breakup i felt so bad anyway that was a major divergence that's okay so but i was definitely not a foster kid it was just an interesting place to hang out and they and my point was that they had you know some of those dare commercials we're very we're very uh real you know this guy would come in and he was come in with like 10 pizzas and a case of beer and like a few ounces of weed and you throw it and starts rolling joints and playing drinking games like like setting us up to play drinking games and stuff and that's how he you know got you to sell weed for him you know i got you to come back to him to to buy it so if we was legal that guy would not have come and done that and those guys also the guys that are saying oh you think you can make money where selling weed start selling coke you really get some money and that's the gateway right right of course it is of course it is like you said the dealers come over and try and sell you something something heavy or something harder in their opinion more profitable exactly this board is like all wrapped around my legs here the microphone cord is like wrapped around all right so um this is what you were talking about understanding the edible high right earlier that it's different than smoking because you're actually um well i have a funny story your liver is metabolizing it so it makes it stronger a few years ago my son came to me and says here start low and go slow it's the first edible i ever had oh really yeah and it was a pretty big gummy and so i took half and i wasn't feeling anything like an hour later and i was gonna take the other half and i see him walk in the door he's wearing white pants he has grass things on his knees and he's like he was so sick cause he ate too much oh and he was in his bed like so nauseous and it actually didn't hit me right away the next day i was like high all day i didn't even take that much really yeah i don't know what that was all about i was like i went to st patrick's day parade and i like was like totally like spaced out all day wow and i'm passing out miss my dad's birthday dinner oh jeez yeah it's not a good experience but um yeah so he and he told me he's like starlo go slow and then he came home sick and i don't think we had any cbd on her hand or anything he usually lay in bed and just suffer it out yeah yeah you just got to weigh that out and he was like i don't know maybe he's like 20. and i'm like bringing him like gatorade like are you okay garbage it's so cute but you have to remember it takes about two hours it can take effect and if you have a hard time digest digesting it um take a digestive enzyme or probiotic with it yeah yeah i i can't recommend those enough they've changed completely right my the way i take edibles yeah yeah they really really really do help because a lot of people and it's just i think it has to do with their diets do you just have you get fresh you get frustrated too when you because like a lot of times they take ourselves you're like yeah it doesn't do anything for me i mean i would get frustrated i'd be like oh why isn't it working i feel like i need a lot of it and it's just not um cost beneficial to me right now i mean you can take some of it and it affects you and i think just a little bit sometimes but i'll need i need to take like half that thing or at least a third of that thing right and that's just and the for the effect that i'm gonna get from it unless i'm actually like healing something my good side of me like the effect that i'm gonna get from and is like that is a lot why i take it like a preventative i'm hoping that it's gonna heal some or like you know prevent me from getting you're probably right well my father's had a lot of cancer since he was like 49. he had colon cancer and a bunch of other cancers so i'm just hoping to like you know prevent those maybe um and then his sis two sisters and his aunt all died of ovarian cancer right so yeah the the jeans but they all did use the talcum powder i'm pretty sure so that's the connection there i'm hoping everybody used talcum powder right right right they were up with the uh avon lake that's where they were up in ohio they had all the avon and johnson and johnson's and all that you know so who knows what reason they were putting on who would have thought talk about it right anybody that that studied um geology i knew it was johnson johnson anymore i don't how did they increase their profits by 25 percent on baby powder something with the holes or something right i'm 25 bigger right so people use 25 percent more crazy and bought 25 percent who thought it like i want to meet the guy that was just like wait a minute what if we do this and like did that guy get a bonus right hopefully the way corporate world works probably not but how upsetting though you're putting like these products all over like your babies and then like it's freaking poison like jesus what is wrong with this world huh it's true um ah so um they're talking about the next step then the next uh what is this number three number two i know yeah oh no i think it's stopped numbering them number four number five i think you were keeping track before at night so there's basically two kinds of marijuana edibles stuff that you're gonna eat and it's gonna hit your stomach immediately and then there's stuff that you're gonna suck on for a while well even um arso and distillate tinctures if you don't keep them in your mouth long enough they're also um digested right by your liver that's why i think when i went on the west coast um a lot of the like the lollipop 50 milligram lollipop affected me better than a 150 milligram cookie right because it stays in your mouth because it was absorbed orally as opposed to hitting my gut so we do have lozenges approved here so we're going to see those come out here in florida um which would basically be like a lollipop like a jolly rancher you have some uh info some inside info that you're not letting me in on no it's one of the things that's approved it's the first thing okay i thought you meant someone else it's lozenges which is basically hard candies so like jolly ranchers and stuff so if it's approved if it's on that list you're guaranteed a company's going to come out with it because there isn't that much [ __ ] that's approved right um let's see number five six seven eight whatever um think about what you chase it with right so we were just talking about that um uh if you a lot a lot of people will mix drinking and edibles and i can't say i haven't done that can't say that it hasn't been a good time it's just uh you have to be careful doing both at the same time yeah i'm not a big drinker i know yeah i i just i don't know i just don't like the feeling as much as i like cannabis i agree with you i'm just saying i don't know if i've ever mixed them before yeah i'm not sure have you ever had a glass of wine all the time oh yeah yeah sure yeah like every night actually i've been drinking wine lately but yeah no no lately definitely not but you know that's that's yeah that's all it's just you have to make sure that you're interested we stopped drinking wine we drink wine every night and now we just have yeah um i'm i'm kind of really chewing on my stomach um well what happened really was two things one i was like man i just want to get back in shape and two the wine was like that we were getting it was just like i don't know it was giving me like heartburn or something right and then like after a glass i'd be like it's funny because we would forget which ones gave us heartburn and then we would grab it again and then it was like oh my god this one's horrible yeah so i'm not gonna you know i'm cutting back on on like a night cap like on a nightly drinking like even just a glass of wine for a while um i've just been kind of cutting back a little bit but i also you know i'm not like you know completely give it up or anything right you know what i mean it's just like i'm i don't know i feel like i want to get in better shape and it was making me a little queasy definitely not good all that sugar at night either but um i will say that it helps with um getting the rso out of your mouth you take a swig of water yeah oh my gosh you guys are so that we made does not taste good at all so i put it the other day on i'm sweating the other day i put it on a um whopper i think i mentioned this that i mentioned this yesterday i think so i put out a whopper and i chewed it and it got stuck in my tooth on the whopper it was like terrible because we made it with that uh 151 it's awful yeah yeah it's um not something that i've eaten since we made it right oh we should put it in capsules besides that remember yes that would be ideal we just got to swallow it that's that that's the idea just get it past you right but then is it really that medicinal that has a lot of alcohol in it like it's not like bitter to taste you think it's gonna be yeah i can't have that much i mean it's this big okay yeah i mean that's the thing too is that we just drink alcohol so why would it be so upsetting it's just constant it's so concentrated that's why like when we tasted it like it felt like it burns that's what if you take rubbing alcohol and put it on your tongue it'll dry that spot out in there and feel like it's burning gotcha yeah so you don't want to do that don't ask me how i know so the other thing with edibles is it's always good to know your source to where it's coming from so that's you know i like i said before i bought 1200 milligram rice crispy treats and you know how i feel about the sugar so i'm like you know what i'm gonna need a rice krispie treat yeah it's going to be 1200 milligrams right it's like that that um pumpkin we had that one nothing yeah oh the pumpkin jesus pumpkin was like 3.5 grams of sugar peanut butter chocolate i don't even know what it was but it was a lot it was i think like 3.5 pounds like high off just the sugar content oh my god let's stay in my stomach for days yeah i can't eat so it's like you have like a solid rabbit like from easter that's what it's like a solid rabbit too much you need a hollow rabbit see when i was a kid i wanted the salad one it was like the hollow one oh [ __ ] there's not in here now it's like oh good it's too it much is too rich right um definitely make sure you're in the right atmosphere if you're going to be experimenting with edibles um you don't want to well that's why most people were at the bar and came back and sat on the couch because they didn't want to be outside in a bar i mean who's what but like looking around um and you know be prepared that you you know you knew what you you knew what you took you know that's the other thing is a lot of people would forget like oh man i'm freaking out i'm just like don't you remember you ate two pop brownies you probably it was probably entertaining for you it was hysterical to me that's terrible it was hysterical because it was entertainment without me having to leave my couch right i could just sit there and they're going to play video games and smoke weed and watch movies mostly i was watching music dvds and music uh vhs's like concerts and stuff and we'd just be sitting there watching concerts and it was very i went to school upstate new york it's cold yeah yeah you know we do well people would just come by smoke weed bye weed eat brownies i'd come back from class sometimes and they'd be random people sitting on the couch that's how we got one of our roommates just started like just i'd get back from class and be sitting on the couch and then the next semester he moved in oh i wish i could see the comments up there and the landlord would come in and be like is he living here no i mean he has to pay rent no no he's not living here i see him sleeping on the couch no that's hilarious if you're up on instagram we can't see those comments very well so you could head over to youtube channel 710. someone just made pumpkin truffles and peanut butter strawberry rice krispie treats oh yummy peanut butter strawberry rice krispie treats sounds like a peanut butter jelly sandwich oh my god that sounds ridiculous yeah so who's gonna be there thursday i'm excited we are you hear my stomach i did i did we are gonna be mine's gonna start doing the same thing soon we are gonna be in branson on thursday right right and then we're going to be in fort lauderdale on uh friday right which means we're going to be driving overnight and it's not that far we're driving so i won't be driving all night what do you mean how far is fort lauderdale from here it's like an hour no so it's five hours instead of four that's all right no big deal oh yeah that's not a big deal i can do that you want to take a shift and we're getting word oh yeah i'd love to we'll take it we'll do we'll give you the i4 section you can do the i4 section the elevated expressway i love that it's my favorite spot where we like bounce around like we're on uh they're on a roller coaster boat that's why they're so much fun a boat with wait in the wake that's why those ramps are so much fun because you're like don't you see me in the front i go like this oh my god let me go over the top of the bridge yeah we're bouncing around you go over the top of the bridge like right there oh my god it's terrible um oh i can zoom in a little bit yeah there you go so um that's pretty funny ah are we done with our list yet i don't know i don't think so oh hide your stash don't let well hide your stash probably away from everyone because edibles are coveted so uh make sure that you uh know everyone make sure you know which uh which which is medicated which is your population so hide them from your parents i like that i had them from your parents like what's this and your grandparents i ate one of your candies do you have another one i've always wanted to do that bring some over but then i'm afraid that they're gonna it's gonna be too much for them and it's not gonna be a good experience yeah those are delicious let me have another it looks like your aunt it does um it really needs to well i guess we have some time yeah might as well i mean that's a good tip especially with these edibles coming in right it's a good good uh segway uh yeah so with edibles you can get too high pretty quick you know and we make fun that there's no such thing as too high but um it's not a pleasant feeling if you get that way yeah and some people can get you it can make you pretty racy if you eat a lot of it racing nauseous yeah your heart rate i remember dj once was like stuck in the corner of his room yeah the anxiety is like extreme like this all right close the light close the leg that's cute all right but i'm getting the video camera that's cute so there's a couple of things to do um when you're starting to get too high um and this has become this is very valuable information especially in investment circles people that are not used to marijuana right and they're going forward like hey i want to invest in this company let's do a few dabs okay that's not the best thing you have cbd on hand actually that's how i was really introduced to cbd was janelle ralph from palmetto harmony had these bottles they were just brown bottles it was like black cbd and it was thin the oil was thin but it was black and she was like oh yeah like if you're like getting too high you just do like a shot of this and brings you right down and i'm like no way that doesn't matter that doesn't really work does it um and she gave it to this dude who was also at the bar and i took some of it and i think tom might have taken some of it and the dude was so impressed with it that he she he was like oh my god that's amazing and she ended up giving him the whole bottle and um and i remember that's the first time i felt the effects of cbd i was like oh it's not like just some [ __ ] up until then i thought it was just like oh right right gonna try and legalize it like this like with cbd so um but that was the first time i really experienced it yeah so i did see that in the same context um those hemp caps these hem caps are really good and take two of them pop it over and you'll feel the relief from that yeah yeah with anxiety for sure um and then also the cbd rso is really good for that real feel right if you want to feel what cbd feels like try that yes for sure and we joke about the fact that we're gonna have a cbd like station at the wedding yeah no but we're serious you know yeah because that's why because if you eat the wrong cake or eat from the wrong oh we should have the same cake with just different sides kind of like alice in wonderland you gotta eat from the right side of the cake or the left side of the cake one really infused and one little bit infused let's make the cake in the shape of alice like the tom petty video right that'd be really cool and then we're gonna have some cbd syrup or something on the side chocolate sauce yes something um so the first thing you got to do like if you start to freak out is remember that you took something remember that you're you know they got something in here that's going to go away it's not going to be there forever and that's the first thing most people think like oh my god oh my god i'm going to die it's like no you're going to be okay as soon as you realize like a few hours you'll be fine like no matter what yeah yeah then it helps to calm you down and one of the things you can do to calm yourself down and start to breathe and focus on your breathing as opposed to freaking out right and realize that you are breathing and you're fine right right right um yeah a lot of mind over matter yes um and then you can go you know you can't die from cannabis no it can't shut down your system or anything like that so you will survive yes it's like the girl who ate 200 hits of acid as long as you know how to love what i know you can get by um and then you know once like you cut you kind of realize that you're you're you took something it's going to go away um you can start with like other stuff that can kind of mitigate the effects we talked about cbd but there's other stuff like um lemon pepper right interesting apparently um uh it can't uh let's see how does exactly it works i'm gonna post on this later yeah um so the terpene content and stuff like lemon pepper um can help balance out the high so sometimes the high you can feel like you're too high because it's just all like thc so um a lot of stuff gets you know a lot of products play like the thc game with marketing we want to get the highest thc possible right right and then um if it's a lot of it is just like they're hitting it with like straight distillate so it's all thc and not really balanced out with the other cannabinoids and terpenes right right well there's yeah a lot of high cbd strains have little to no cbd um so smelling um terpenes can help balance that out huh interesting you know um and you know we've yeah i didn't i never knew that it was like a uh a way to come down i know the the smelling pepper thing but um because of the carryophylene the smelling pepper thing but but isn't that just like um essential oils yeah more or less that's what terpenes are right they're flower plant oils right you know and scents and stuff so um yeah if you have like a little diffuser or something and you have you know that can help with something like that um yeah i like little drink water that's kind of a no-brainer yeah stay hydrated yes definitely definitely got to do that um oh did you like read that next one and reach for your coffee i did not see that um so caffeine can help um especially if you're feeling too high like that couch like lock stuff obviously having a cup of coffee or a bang energy bang that we know heidi doesn't like i don't like i mean i like them but they sometimes it's like too much like i gotta split up in like two servings sometimes too much it just gives me like too much like oh yeah yeah yeah totally no totally that's like um i understand what you're saying it's like there's too much increases the vibrations of my body there's an incredible amount of like caffeine and stimulants and stuff right right that's why i only i won't drink more than one a day intensifies my anxiety yeah so i often will just drink half but they taste so good yeah i don't know to me they do it tastes like liquid birthday cake i just i don't like the bubbles so much all the um carbonation i don't know what it is like i don't think it either makes me go it makes me burp i don't like my kids don't like it but i don't know like they're like i gave um phoenix some of my like i had like diet like something it was like something orange or something and she was like it tastes good but all the bubbles they hurt my my tongue yeah it's weird i don't like it either it's i don't remember that ever being a problem for me when i was a kid like i just wanted all the soda yeah um so i guess they lumped three in into one thing i guess you're supposed to do these in in order right each shower and take a nap if you can make yourself eat most people are like nauseous you can't even get up sometimes yeah or some board the other way you just want to eat everything well but if you're like if you taking too much edible is that what we're talking about or you get too high yeah or you get too high i know i've gotten too high where i just wanted to eat everything in the world yes i definitely have two and i've eaten that's gotten me sick eating too many white castles at three a.m i have to smoke an alaskan thunder [ __ ] that and one other strange that we had when i was in college that was like white and it tasted like vanilla i don't remember who brought it in i just remember josh was there and we smoked it and it gave me the worst we called it the ultimate munchies still to this day like remember the ultimate munchies and that's what exactly what it was it was just like there was not enough food like and we were eating everything like what was that animals always give me such munchies edibles yeah edibles edibles edibles oh sorry i was big yawn oh thank you i'm actually liking wearing these dresses it's really nice like i said it's easier when you see my reading comments what's the hardest question for our cannabis patient what were we just talking about ah it's like it's like a cannabis dad joke i like that you're gonna use it just in case i got my go-to dad jokes ah so this is pretty funny here's the story that you sent me this morning yes so of course it's florida man right right florida man florida man right indian river county he had marijuana coming out of his what i love the way this article is written it's like i feel like i want to read it just because it's hysterical just the way it's written it's got some great puns in it a man arrested on a weapons charge really stepped in it after deputies apparently accused him of pooping marijuana or something like that i feel bad for the deputy like that's like too much like who would have thought like getting into like police work and then you gotta go dig through someone's poop i don't know if they dug through it um go ahead and read it because it says they assume that it's full of marijuana oh god the alleged case of the dastardly defector defecator [ __ ] that the alleged case of the dastardly defecator began to drop about 10 40 p.m on august 17th in indian river county a deputy arrested the 29 year old man on possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and took him to jail the man was a passenger in a sport utility vehicle where the deputy reported finding a 40 caliber pistol less than four hours later the same deputy where'd my hello oh there he goes less than four hours later the same deputy was notified by jail staff who discovered an unknown object in the man's stomach they were going to take the man to the hospital to get it checked out i asked the man why he would eat the bag filled with marijuana the man said he did not want me to find the bag i feel like it's pretty obvious right all right evidently he didn't try to brown nose the deputy several hours later the man reportedly moved his vowels and there was a small plastic bag the bag was covered in poop also known as feces according to the report i'm not making that up it says that no i know i know it's hilarious i know in the bag is what investigators believed to be marijuana see they had to go open the bag and if you look at the actual police report no i'm not going to it says that they oh my god i found a bag covered in pieces and he cut it open and found green stuff cut the bag and found green stuff inside okay i didn't if i was a uh police officer uh corrections i don't know but i would not want that as part of my job description like when you gotta pick straws who gets this short straw who gets that job well they charge this guy with possession of less than 20 grams of marijuana tampering with evidence an introduction of contraband into a detention facility because he ate it and then pooped it out or he brought it into the facility yeah species all right now you got to show me this part here yeah see the orange part yeah blank had a bowel movement and there was a small plastic bag i then responded a nurse a nurse oh a nurse and i didn't read that part a nurse had taken the plastic bag out of the towel bowl and placed it inside another plastic bag oh i've served a small plastic bag covered in feces i opened small plastic bag and inside was a small amount of green leafy substance i was able to determine it was marijuana based on my training and experience so it sounds like the nurse recovered the bag from the poop and put it in another bag and then the police officer had to open who's the real hero the nurse always comes back to the nurse i mean you know i played with plenty of pc oh good lord i have one patient with ms right this is a crazy story guys so when i i was working at night still and in the hospital and i got a report on the patient at 7 pm and she had ms multiple sclerosis and her husband was in the room with her and i all four bed railings worked which was not really allowed just to at least keep one down or it's like considered like right um and i was like so busy because i had seven different patients so i got reported on her and i go on to the next and i'm helping someone like in the other hallway and i get a call from the nursing assistant saying um so and so in room blah blah can walk i'm like i didn't think so well they gave her like the stuff to make her go to the bathroom to clean out for surgery the next day she had gotten up out of bed climbed over the railing went sat in the chair pooped got back in bed and had diarrhea all over the bed like oh my god how did that happen she's like you gotta come here and just see this oh my god oh my god the one that was in the chair was fully formed oh my god too much detail too much detail visual is getting clearer imagine the smell and then you gotta go eat lunch after that there's not a janitor if you can get no that's not this should be it's great but you know it's something that the nursing horses and nursing staff have to clean up jesus there's another woman who like paints the walls oh jesus enough poop talk for tuesday morning oh man yes welcome to uh tp tuesday uh barry white from cura leaf is excellent just checking out the comments it's just going to the toilet marvin that's funny if you're up on instagram you can head over to youtube channel 710 and there's more people to chat with yeah look at all that yeah it's hard to go all the way back in the comments because i don't know the context and apparently the um youtube is better on like uh desktop as opposed to mobile it's easier to comments i think yes i can't figure out a comment watching it on my phone um we'll be at cura leaf on thursday until at least noon right right um because they're going to do another ribbon cutting right we're going to get there and broadcast from there so we'll be there like from like 6 30 to noon but they open at nine i believe right um i believe so i believe they're opening their minds to double check on that good morning rebecca yes code brown that's funny um then we're doing a 420 meetup yes on thursday and a 420 meetup on friday yes yeah so um it's gonna be fun it is it's gonna be fun who would have thought did you ever think that you would be going to dispensary grand openings and having 420 meet-ups and driving around in a big green bus i did not ever think that no you mean that wasn't your dream as a small girl you weren't like six years old like i wish one day and draw pictures of a green bus i want to ride in a green bus marvin friday we're going to be in um at curley from coral springs for the morning until about noon sorry fluent flunk coral springs all right glad you're paying attention um for once for two seconds right exactly yeah yeah just to correct me okay i'm kidding um uh yes okay john i'll get to you in one minute but we are going to be friday fluent in coral springs and then we're going to swing by and say hi to dr michelle in the afternoon and then we're going to go um to holy mackerels which is in um wilson manor yes and that's going to be at 4 20 on friday yes 4 20 friday holy mackerels we're gonna make some little yeah post about it later so you guys can see what's going on and then john actually that's a question i wanted not a lot we can't give you enough lead time to make plans that's the idea right right is that you do it on purpose you have to do it spur the moment that's how we know you're a real good fan asked about tallahassee um we will be up there sometime in september um right um yes we'll be up there it's looking like the last week in september the last week of this month um that could change but that's what they're they're pretty confident the last week in september yeah that's what we're looking at right now but while we're up there we're gonna stay probably about a week and go to as much as we can up there yes yeah i want to see as much of the panhandle i've never been to the house never been up to tallahassee so i'm excited we should like drive by the capitol and like have a big rainbow yell something out of the big green bus on the pa system legalize marijuana today and just drive around the capitol right like throw out joints hemp is legal in florida smoke them if you got them and just throw them with people around the capitol i mean that was the point in getting a lot of that help wasn't it wait for lunch like wait for all the legislators to come out for lunch yes yes have joints at him smokeless i think susan susan has something or sherry or somebody asked something here it was like a pretty long question i wanted to see what it was um yeah she's up here or something my first flower from cure leaf was strawberry diesel any flower they always have purple but that wasn't what it was right there was like a question or something because she said to all right well just messaged me because i can't is this this one figure out what it was dm colleen and ask about distillate and if you could take it sublingually maybe it was um oh we're about to lose instagram um you could take this lit sublingually i would maybe put like a little swag of um alcohol in your mouth to kind of help it like absorb in your mouth you can't take distillate sibling willy but leave it there for a good minute or two yeah um i think that alcohol like just like a little bit helps to i don't know break it up or something i don't know what it exactly it it does but it i guess that's what it does bye guys the wide shot today so we got like the whole sink over there and everything the wide shot what's the difference between co2 and non-co2 well co2 is the um extraction process the the solvent that's used for the extraction right is it considered a solvent it is right yes butane ethanol i prefer co2 for distillate right yes you're asking me if you prefer it um no making sure i'm saying the right thing here um no i believe i think i think you're right i'm not like i don't want to go on record right as i know for a fact right but i find when i smoke an ethanol it kind of irritates my throat and my nose like a little tickle i can understand that but we did find that the um are so made with ethanol preserves some of the plant material that's really medicinal like the plant fats the um chlorophyll right um so i don't think it matters if you're taking it orally as much as it does if you're smoking it right right yeah i agree 100 because when you're smoking it like there's all that um i mean you can release the residue or what it is but yeah but when you're eating it i mean like the worst thing that you're going to do is eat a little bit of alcohol yeah so you're right right yeah right with co2 i think um the appeal is that you don't have to heat and heat it so you can make these extractions and without using heat super critter super critical cold co2 extraction it's pretty funny because you see these big machines and i think all they really do is shoot co2 into a big tube full of weeds right right and then it and and then they drop the temperature and then they just separate it right and it's uh but these extractors are amazing they really are like if you've ever seen one oh my gosh we still need to do that um if you're watching we would like to do a um how it's made yes mark geez that would be so cool to go like follow the process through like yeah yeah absolutely i would love to sing and everything i would love to see that and i'd love for you to see like one of those machines up close they would i actually have seen the machine when i was training down at cure leaf i was training at the processing center but you see all this thing um we were training the processing center which was so cool it was like uh you felt like it was like a really highly secured area and you had to go inside the gate was like um double and had a little guard house and they couldn't open the second gate without the first one being closed and i had like the barbed wire but the whole thing smelled so good and you could walk by the window and see all the machines in there i didn't actually take a tour to see like how they worked but that would be really cool too that would be we had a uh extraction company come out for that orlando the highlight video that you saw one of our big sponsors was this extraction company that came out i don't know if they got any business out of it right they very well could have been even like one company here you know yeah worth the trip it's worth the investment to come out right um and they brought in they needed to get in early they needed to load all the stuff in they had the whole corner of the place was like these giant machines that they brought in they're like i don't know if they were in the state already like i don't know the whole business model or whatever but they had them there and they were enormous you know it made the show so much better because she was like look at that thing over there sounds like a brewery or something yeah it's exactly like kind of what it looks like yeah we would do a lot of our events and breweries and it was so cool because like um which one is that is that in tampa the one that would go in the back and do it like right next to the yeah yeah that was the saint pete one i think yeah right the one with the um yeah like that the one where you uh they had the beverages thing right that one right that's the one yes that's the one yeah yeah yeah i like that place that place is cool that's the first place we went with the bus um it is the first place we went with the bus of course i remember it's when the bus was white before it was big great yeah it's funny because the bus is still registered as a white white rv i think that um co2 is more expensive hey look what susanna's saying over here it might resonate with that oh it says after trying all the types of extracts i could last month i decided vapes aren't worth it only flour in a jar and shatter wax dabs and the cure leaf gummies i totally agree it's something with there's something lost in the vapes i believe yeah i mean they get close you know the select ones are close the live resin some of them are like um dabs yeah and that's what i think those are yeah some terpene profiles are really good and right they taste like flour but those affect me the most similar to flour but other rapes i'm like it's not even worth it for me because i don't um you know feel them you know um i used to use them a lot more but what i found is that i feel like and it's just conjecture just me speculating what i feel like is there's something missing from from them so what you do is you keep hitting it to try and get that right and what it does to me anyway is it does like whatever effect i am getting from it intensifies that which is usually kind of like a spacey what's so crazy is that there's something missing like i don't know what it is like because you could vaporize flour like with the volcano and you still feel flour the same way so at first i was thinking well maybe it's a temperature because when you combust it it's definitely much higher temperature and i'm like maybe there's something that's hitting at that temperature that's not with the vapes but then when we vaporize in the volcano the flowers still felt the same yeah so it's got to be i still miss the feeling of the smoke though for some reason i agree even though it made me cough yeah you know like i was like you know like i was like i definitely got a hit it's definitely not as healthy what the smoking of course yeah yeah um but like even though it was like it hit hard i still didn't it still didn't feel like smoke and maybe maybe that has something to do with it i like the combustion uh what's the best pen oh the best pen uh i like the apx wax i don't have one here to show people but it's about you know the size of one of these bottles and just about a puffco pen susan says if you want a dab pen you can't beat the apx wise like that or i mean it's just a puffco pen yeah i have the puffco pen and the puffco peek and i mean they're they're nice and sleek and beautiful and all of that but this little apx wax thing i mean like it's got these quartz chambers i have a bunch of the chandeliers that you had and you had to get rid of it because yeah because because it just it was literally you hit the button and you blew out this cloud and it was like and i had it next to my computer and i would just apx ap x wax yeah and if you can get it with the blackout top which is made of metal instead of glass because you'll drop it i broke so many of the glass ones judy have you ever tried the um ceramic donut coil i can't do like the metal coils i hate those but the ceramic donut is really cool that's what i like and the apx comes with all of those and i don't and i don't have one on a used one i'm just saying that that's been like if you want a mobile dab we were at a capital grill right after an event and we had this big round table a capital grill right a whole bunch of people there and um where were you like in florida it was here yeah it was i think it was down here actually i think it was somewhere down here um for an event and like boca area or something and we're capital grill late we're like the last people in the place and it's at a mall i think for memory serves i don't know it's doing dabs and um we're sitting at this table so somebody on the other side of the table decides to hit their vape pen and kind of blow it like under the table right right yeah and i can't remember who was sitting next to me but some dude was sitting next to me and i gave him the and he was like oh like let me hit that pen you know let me hit that thing and the girl over there had just done it so i gave him the pen and the next thing i know he hits it and the next thing you know and it was just like it went under the table and then out like you saw it come out like from under the table and i was like oh [ __ ] we're gonna get kicked out of here and it's [ __ ] luckily it's like we're almost done with the meal and um they came over to like i think we asked something like hey can we get something like that and like you're going to have to leave and we're like why before the cops get here because you guys are smoking weed at the table and i remember just like that i was like all right see you later we're like come on we're going but uh yeah the apx wax that's my gets my endorsement and this is just a bottle of oil not that vaporizer very cool aha ah see i go to like the time it takes my brain to hit the button yeah the thing moves i know i'm like what the hell it's hard to keep up with them uh yeah quartz and a torch it's ah i'm like i'm like over torch dabs yeah every once in a while maybe how you doing i'm good you're good all right we're on um our almost at an hour 10. how do you feel about uh wrapping it up that's cool you're good yeah i got a lot of stuff i wanted to get ready to leave tomorrow okay sounds good all right we are out of here hope you guys have a wonderful uh day you're welcome for yesterday's two and a half hour marathon i know yeah actually my back's not bothering me i'm good no yeah i did another ketamine treatment last night but i i didn't take enough the nurse underdosed herself because last time there's an overdose on yourself right last time i took one lozenge and then we had the conversation upstairs i only brought one upstairs and i'm like i wonder how many milligrams that is and i convinced myself it's got to be 200 but it was only 100 so i didn't take enough right but i do feel like um the pain is not bothering me today i think it's really good for nerve pain yeah it's interesting yeah it really is i mean i haven't done anything since yesterday about that and my nerve is usually like like irritating the [ __ ] out of me that's really interesting at this point in time but yeah i know i'm good cool yeah i'm looking forward to

we'll see you tomorrow", "Pp1TV1-T8L8": "[Music] [Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are looking at another product from farm caramels caramels however you want to say it this time we are looking at their 120 milligram indica variety the last time we looked at the sativa variety I did not like it much but I'm willing to give their indica variety a fair shake so again this is a caramel I believe although I got this at a discount or xev I got this for free I think traditionally these are about seven dollars each so you know they're not super expensive for 120 milligrams an\u00edbal but it doesn't really matter if they're not very potent right so these are caramels they're very thick and chewy I kind of like the taste of it last time of the of the sativa variety so we'll see if the indica varieties just as good if this is the first time you guys are tuning in the wheats the way we do our reviews here is I'm gonna take this animal I'm going to ignore the recommended for serving suggestions just eat the whole thing playing here and come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling so that's the most important part about any add aboard we're having a little bit of trouble getting this out here oh there we go so there you go you can see the caramel there pretty basic looking caramel nice rectangular no weed smell smells great smells just like a delicious caramel punkin your mouth because I can't really bite any of it off without breaking my teeth [Music] hmm Casey just like it's sitting with Raul well there's not gonna be much else for you guys to see I'm gonna sit here and click on this cool not for a while but I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling until then thank you for watching weeks with you guys in just a bit hello it has been two hours since I had the farm caramels 120 milligram indica variety and I gotta say I think it's a little bit more potent than its sativa brother whether that's this particular strain or whether it's maybe just you know this batch whatever the case may be I am definitely I definitely feel more high than I did with the sativa variety not a whole lot more but noticeably more I still would not given a wholehearted recommendation but I would definitely recommend it more than the indica excuse me this is then the sativa variety and just to spell that out again I think the indica variety of the farm caramels is better than the sativa not a whole lot but but to a matter of degrees it is I'm still going to say totally recommend it but it is better tastes identical they both taste the exact same no no flavor difference between the two in terms of a high it's a pretty typical high mostly fill in the head a little bit in the body but not a total couch lock like in most sort of indica strains so yeah I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed it more than its sativa brother so again that is the farm caramels 120 milligram indica variety and I was pleasantly surprised thank you so much for watching weights guys we will check you out on the next review peace hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below

spatula and some Nutella well because I want some fat I want some fat my body before I take this gummies just a little bit of fat as a vessel for the THC in the bloodstream so I'm gonna eat a little bit of Nutella the best part of all gummy reviews is getting that little spatula full of Nutella and then I'm gonna eat that infused creations um which I'm not looking forward to because gummies usually taste terrible and don't get me high at all oh excuse me but you know I'm willing to go the extra mile for you guys so let's uh try this Nutella yum yum yum mmm again that's gonna be the best part I am certain of this review my favorite part hmm all right I've got all the fat I need now I've got the infused creations very very slices 300 milligrams of THC so they say sativa variety of pot in their ingredients on the back bunch of corn different derivations of corn syrup and of course some cannabis so let's open up give them a taste if this is the first time you've ever tuned into wheats the way our reviews work is I'm going to eat these berry berry slices maybe all of them friend the camera depending on how long it takes to eat them but rest assured I will eat them all and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review process all right so here we go our berry berry slices they're pretty to look at pink white and purple but how are they gonna taste oh the answer is very bad they're gonna taste awful that it's stringent aftertaste they have a pleasant first taste and then it gets progressively more awful as you chew not bad not bad oh and there it comes yeah that is bad I am NOT looking forward to having the like 20 of these but I will do so all right guys I'm gonna polish this bag off again this is the infused creations very very slices sativa 300 milligrams and I will see you in two hours thank you so much for watching weights and I'll see you soon peace welcome back to wheats guys two hours have passed since I had the infused creations very very slices 300 milligrams sativa variety so a little Nutella right there on the package um and I'm a little high I'm not very high I'm not 300 milligrams high or comparative 300 milligrams if this were say a you know like kirova or something not feeling that at all I do feel a little bit of something but again a disappointing amount however I did get this for an affordable price I think this was only ten bucks at my dispensary so for a 300 milligram edible it's a good price I just you know again not as high as I'd like to be and they taste terrible they taste really really awful they've got that burning almost burning sensation when you aftertaste when you bite into them not a fan at all I do have another infused creations 300 milligram to review and if that one doesn't improve if that one doesn't change my opinion that will probably be it for me and infused creations no more reviews I can go ahead and dust them off into the bin of edibles that are not for me or probably for you guys so disappointing result this episode but I still appreciate you guys tuning in and watching thank you so much as always we will catch you on the next review where we hope to have a more positive result thanks again peace okay hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video

New York currently it's about 92 degrees a little warm for flannels but who cares really there's Nala squirrel hunting in the background she lures sits there for hours and just wait for squirrels to run along the fence anyway today on the BuzzFeed tests I put four options for you on my Instagram story I didn't get screenshots of when you guys voted on them but trust me it was not even close this charile bombs won by a longshot you know what I'm gonna go up on the deck because I feel a little strange vlogging in the middle of my yard so like I said guys the cherubims won easily these look delicious I've done churros a few different times on this channel the churro ice cream bowls come to mind those were really popular now the only issue that we might have if you guys remember a few weeks ago when I did the brownie bombs you need chocolate truffles for the middle and because of my nut allergy I can't eat pretty much any of them but luckily you guys let me know in the comments that there's a bunch of nut free stores online so I'm on this one right here it's called Vermont nut free chocolates and it looks pretty good and here's some truffles so let me go to order them and quick ship them to my house well for 12 it's about thirty eight dollars more expensive than I wanted but what are you gonna do let me fast track them here and that was quick now that we have our very expensive chocolate let's get right into this so peeps today for the chair Oh bombs you surprisingly only need a few very simple ingredients consisting of some water and salts a stick of butter and a few eggs some cinnamon sugar some vanilla extract and then sugar and flour it's pretty much it we also cannot forget our almost $40 chocolate truffles so let's get right into this I started in my saucepan with a little bit of water some of the butter a little bit of sugar and salt hop on over to taste these video if you want all the exact measurements for this recipe but I let this come to a boil before adding in about a cup of flour at this point it is very important to take the pan off the heat as you're mixing in the flour and let this mixture cool before you add in your three eggs if you do not the eggs will cook in the heat of the pan and you'll have scrambled eggs in your churros delicious but I just added those in one at a time thoroughly mixed between every single one that I added until you get this shiny elastic dough to finish our batter off just toss in a little bit of our vanilla and you're pretty much done just transfer the mix over to a piping bag with a larger star tip on the end and you can start piping these out on a cookie sheet so over the course of the next hour one at a time I would pipe out a little disc of dough on the bottom plop down a truffle in the middle and then carefully pipe around the truffle it's kind of important that you go slowly and try to fill in all the gaps because if you do not the chocolate will seep out into your oil and it'll be a hot mess trust me anyways once those were complete a few very simple ingredients consisting of some water and salt a stick of butter and a few eggs some cinnamon sugar some vanilla extract and then sugar and flour that's pretty much it we also cannot forget our almost $40 chocolate truffles so let's get right into this I started in my saucepan with a little bit of water some of the butter a little bit of sugar and salt hop on over to taste these video if you want all the exact measure for this recipe but I let this come to a boil before adding in about a cup of flour at this point it is very important to take the pan off the heat as you're mixing in the flour and let this mixture cool before you add in your three eggs if you do not the eggs will cook in the heat of the pan and you'll have scrambled eggs in your churros delicious but I just added those in one at a time thoroughly mixed between every single one that I added until you get this shiny elastic dough to finish our batter off just toss in a little bit of our vanilla and you're pretty much done just transfer the mix over to a piping bag with a larger star tip on the end and you can start piping these out on a cookie sheet so over the course of the next hour one at a time I would pipe out a little disc of dal on the bottom plop down a truffle in the middle and then carefully pipe around the truffle it's kind of important that you go slowly and try to fill in all the gaps because if you do not the chocolate will seep out into your oil and it'll be a hot mess trust me anyways once those were complete I pop them in the freezer overnight to completely harden them up the next day i heated up some oil and then just plopped in a few at a time cook them a couple minutes at 350 degrees until they became crispy and golden brown and once I had all 12 of my cherubims fried up and patted out dry onto some paper towels I toss them in the cinnamon and sugar and gave them a nice coating around the outside plated them up a little bit and these look fantastic so let's give them a taste come say hi ah no trouble bombs", "P25FDWDJcLQ": "hey what's happening everybody it's Jay Lee thanks for tuning in so to all my subscribers out there pretty all about the vapor Channel weather yeah I know you guys all watch my my reviews on eliquid and on vape related hardware but I just want to make this clear in the beginning I'll just give you a heads up this is not gonna be review on any of that this is probably gonna be the first and only review I ever do on a CBD oil and there's a couple different reasons why I wanted to do this review mainly to give my experiences and thoughts and let you guys all know what I thought about this so if you're not in the CBD if it's not something you're interested in at all I completely understand you do not have to watch this review by any means at all this is more game this is more um directed towards people out there who maybe are actively using CBD and wanted to see what someone's experiences with precision baked product CBD is all about or to anybody out there who's been thinking of using CBD for any particular reason and wanted to get somebody else's you know point of view on it okay so drew from precision V products is the one that sent this over to me so big thank you to Drew I was completely uneducated on this guy's I had to go for the past couple months I've been doing research I've been getting educated by drew most of the time Drew's been to one educate me on CBD all the effects and what it's been used for and yes this is perfectly legal I know there's another type to CBD oil out there that is not but this is 100% perfectly legal just want to make that clear so nothing wrong with me using this right here I just want to make that known to everybody alright so basically it comes in table this this particular CB oil comes in 150 milligram to 5500 and a thousand he did send me over to one and 500 comes in this dark looking 30ml a glass bottle here now I did dump it into a clear bottle because it was a little hard to see through there but I did dump it's nice and classy gives you all the supplemental facts and serving size all that stuff here on the side all right so it says ultra premium CBD infused organic illiquid now CBD contains a ton of strong antioxidants and the taste on this i do hear a lot of people saying that CBD tastes disgusting a lot of CBD oils out there and i know people use it in different ways i chose to just vape on it i know some people say you know you take the drops or some people use it differently i just chose to vape on it and yes it has worked for me just it's worked perfectly fine it didn't at first and I'll get into that in a moment I was absolutely skeptical but it is now let me just go ahead and do a little bait ball here and just show you guys you know I'll just show you what it looks like cloud production even notice isn't a juice review or anything like that you can at least get an idea on you know how I like to vape it looks like a normal date juice it really does now normally I hold it in longer put some on camera I don't wanna waste too much of your time but normally I hold it in for a few seconds and then I exhale but I've been using it just in a regular rebuildable atomizer I just drip it right down there on the cotton just like that alright I actually got to put a little bit more on there and that's how I've been using it so I've been running in about 80 Watts here on my box mod and it's worked fine I've also taken a few drops and dripped them on my tongue it is a little strong when I do it that way so I just choose to do it like this but inevitably it finally started working for me eventually so a lot of people use CBD for different reasons guys the main reason I'm using it for it's not because I have any serious medical conditions I'll be using it just to reach basically a state of calm and relaxation you know just I work a ton of hours I have a very stressful job and at night when I get home I can't always fall asleep and you know sometimes I'm up thinking and just stressed the hell out so I wanted to just vape a little bit of this and see if it would help me get to a better state of relaxation and just help me put help put me to sleep now in the beginning I was expecting too much I think I was expecting it to do a lot more than what it's supposed to do alright so that might be a big part of it in the beginning and also I know I read up that a lot of people don't really experience anything at first so it did take me a few days until I honestly started to experience any effects of the CBD but um it is extracted okay it's extracted and separated from specific varieties of cannabis known as hemp alright so basically it's completely isolated and it's completely separated and isolated from THC and basically contains no trace of of THC so it is legal like I said this will not get you I I absolutely will not get you I do want to repeat that but a lot of people use it for different medical conditions like like I stated before for you know lupus Parkinson's epilepsy so there's plenty of other medical Risa's people use this as well and like I said you can read up on that on the phyto Wellness Solutions Group page on Facebook and I will put that link down below so basically guys I'm just gonna give you my I'm gonna give me my experiences with it so when I first started vaping on it as soon as I received it like I said I didn't really know what to expect I think I was anticipating too much and I didn't experience really anything at all so I came home the second night after work same thing took a couple vapes off it really didn't feel anything or didn't notice anything any any significant difference at all I would say about the third fourth night is when I really started to experience it now it wasn't nothing crazy or overbearing or anything like that I basically vaped on it a little bit lay down didn't really think about it just went about my normal night and I started to actually feel the effect of that nice soothing almost almost like a um I'm gonna say like an all-natural calming that I got I got a little natural calming cessation so it was nice soothing calming I was just laying back it was a good relaxation I finally had I felt like a little peace of mind I was able to fall asleep with no problems at all now I don't use this on an everyday basis I absolutely do not I only use it when I feel the need to but so far whenever I'm getting the urge and I feel the need to go ahead and use the CBD if I'm you know have a bad day just stressed out and just want to relax a little bit and try to fall asleep that's when I tend to use it and it's been working absolutely perfectly for me so I would absolutely go out and purchase this again now I'm not gonna get into prices or anything like that you guys can go ahead and see all that for yourselves over on the Facebook group page or if you have any questions you can go ahead and ex true but it has worked for me so I would purchase it again now I'm probably I'm gonna try to make this last as long as I can again I don't use it on an everyday basis like some people but um if you've been interested in this if you've been looking at the PVC PVC PVC the PvP CBD oil and you want to get someone else's pores you know someone else's point of view that's why I wanted to do this so again I don't use it for any serious medical conditions whatsoever I just wanted to use it to come to a nice little nice little state of relaxation and it has done that for me I did expect to you know in the beginning I was expecting a lot more of them with them what the CBD is supposed to do and I think for those reasons that's why I probably took me a little longer to finally sort of experience it but when I finally just laid back let it do its job it absolutely has worked for me so I was a skeptic I was a non-believer in it I'll be absolutely honest with you but now I do believe that this absolutely will help people for certain and specific you know specific reasons I can't I can't um go ahead and speak on any specific medical conditions because I don't have any of those but there's plenty of people out there who do God and who do basically you know give their point of view on it and let let people know what it's done for them and their medical condition so guys that's it I would recommend it to you if it's something you've been interested in if you're already using CBD and you're just maybe looking for a new brain or to try something else I would give it a try it's worked for me it's done what it's supposed to do and what I was looking forward to do so I can't say anything bad about it there's just my opinions again these are all subjective these are just what this is just what I've experienced just to make that perfectly clear but it has worked for me so I just want to thank you once again for educating me on this I absolutely think that it can do a lot it can definitely help a lot of different people out there all right so again it's probably to be the only review I ever do want to CBD oil um honestly if I do buy it again it's it's gonna be from Drew it's not gonna be from another company or anything like that it's worked for me I'm gonna stick with what I know and that's that all right so you guys have a great day be safe be well if you have any questions leave a comment down below and like comment subscribe if you guys like vape juice if you're into a liquid if you're in it they've been hardware and if your vapors out there and you want to see some good reviews subscribe to my channel I got plenty of our reviews that I post every Friday Saturday and Sunday and you guys can go ahead and see what that's all about so have a great day I'll leave all the information down below you guys take care of me well", "1-tYudrj3Oc": "[Music] this is sandy Krakowski and welcome to a real change hey everybody I'm so excited I can't even tell you how excited I am I have a guest today with me Nadim al-haj son the CMO of bangbros we're gonna have fun and just jump into it and just have a conversation here and see where it goes but you are my cannabis expert who converted me to using more edibles and different things without even knowing it amazing good so you know I was typically using what most people would with cannabis and that is inhalation and all that so my first question for you why did you choose watermelon okay so that's my favorite candy yeah okay yeah there are absolutely my favorite candy I mean it's already a gummy in the market that people love yeah yeah let's make it better with THC we did yeah but what's so amazing is I've used other gummies and like I've been using cannabis for three years weaned off of all kinds of medication and it's just changed my life but I've had other gummies where you know like two and a half hours later somebody needed to peel me off the floor you know I was like okay I'm fine I'm waiting for it to kick in goodbye lips right I don't get that with that it's real smooth and I go to sleep one of our core values is consistency and that is that is true to its core and and and so you know it's the infusion method in which we do this is the small batch method that ensures the consistency also the vigorous testing that we do so if you're following the initiative right now testing is something that's going to be coming into the market by next year right very very important think about that testing has not been required the entire 10 years that medical cannabis has been in Arizona I hope that is very that is very concerning yeah very concerning concerning and we were testing long before there were even facilities you know there was one group that was doing it a lot of ambiguity if it was you know even accurate or not but sometimes the expression that any data is better than no data you know and so so through different trial and error methods different mixing methods different implementations you know we would test this batch test this batch and fast forward to here we are today we're testing you know hundreds of batches every single month Wow so I don't I'm not sure if you know but this little green tag right here or on the back of the package there's a white label you can skin or you can enter that batch ID on our website and they don't pull up the test results oh wow yeah so we call that on-demand testing yeah and it's you mean your fitness yeah so just like with supplements transparency is key yes you know if I want to know what I'm consuming the hello from food to supplements to anything ya know and that's something that Thomas and I share him even more so you know sometimes I might dude you're such a geek so check it out though this does this and I'm like well that makes sense you know okay let me check that out so we've wanted to apply that same motto or model and to our products and it should be transparent you should get exactly what is in it you should know that there are no microbe eels in here you should know that the potency is accurate and that leads to your original question the potency right so we have a plus or minus and it is always going to be within two to three milligrams rather - yeah and and if it's not we don't put it out there yeah we district we pour bleach over the batch and throw it away Wow you know and it's we've learned a couple lessons but by doing that because you can't do that too many times no no and we've got a very very meticulous method and that ensures our consistency and that way you can go into any of the 85 dispensaries that we're in in the state get the same product anywhere you go congrat thank you thank you that's incredible I'm not even 30 yet almost my mom\u00eds hearts just like that kind of accountability is what gave me the confidence cause like when kovat hittin that and being used to inhalation and even micro dosing with inhalation throughout the day with a pen I wanted to make sure my lungs were stronger I knew my liver is okay for you know the edibles but you know I don't think people pay attention to if you run a company I don't have time to wake up right and have a cannabis hangover right you know I mean I don't have four hours in the morning to wake up at the dose was wrong absolutely you know and you were in the medical realm of all of this even when they had like medical marijuana farmers market I just moved here three years ago I was like what [Laughter] yeah tell me about it so early on so it became legal in 2010 I had moved here from Oklahoma went to school in Missouri with school in Oklahoma yeah came out here because it it helped a new and dear friend of mine a coach and my mom lived out here and so I was like I gotta go somewhere where I can learn about this and my intention was not to come out here and start an edible company not buy anyway no it was i-i've always been in love with the plant itself ya know yeah it was definitely you know using cannabis at recreationally back in school it wasn't you know wasn't Mike I'm gonna be a you know cannabis you know animal owner some day it was my mom bless her heart I love her she's a total hippie you know so she always just cultivated this this healthy relationship you know was never like it was never very strict mom you know but it was never like there was always an explanation with why it was wrong yeah you know or how to approach the relationship with whatever it be yeah so I'm thankful for that you know it and particularly with with in particular with cannabis you know like there were some times I kind of caught on where she found out I had cannabis and she was like you're gonna have to give that to me and I was like I hit like you know seven sixteen seventeen I was like aha you know and so that opened up and we became very just communicative with each other and I always had this I don't want say hippie but just healthy relationship with cannabis it wasn't ever like seen as a drug you know in my eyes were used as a drug you know and I I grew up wrestling so cannabis is really big and martial arts it's it's it means are up a really wrestling yeah we're going there in a bit yeah but eight or nine I about eight years old I started wrestling and got into it at an early state and there's a lot of story behind that too as to why you know my parents divorced and you know was on ritalin for a long time and it just a sport like that just really kind of you know hold me down and humbled me they say you know when you get put on your ass a couple of times you get humbled let's just say that and so I came to came to Arizona in 2000 into 2008 and I started growing right away you know I had a little closet grow yeah nothing big then just getting familiar with the plant and yeah there was no information out there in the early days nothing not like today like today where you go to like bake grows a column and you're like I'm making tasty drinks yeah and and there there were only forums available online so you dig yeah yeah you know and how to make cannabis butters and how to grow cannabis what medium to use to grow in and all this information a lot of it a lot of it out there and so had an early start into growing it passed in 2010 yeah and so that's when the ball started rolling right I you know got in with some friends that you know helped me financially get into a little bit of a bigger grow and yeah here's the thing though from 2010 to 2011 2011 there were no dispensaries so you've got almost two years that this has been legal but there's no dispensaries but so where do people get their medicine exactly so do you show your card - exactly so there I had friends that were caregivers and I myself as a patient would row I could cultivate and so I would be a cultivator and I could give you your allotment you're two and a half ounces every two weeks right so you would give me your grow right so you would give a caregiver your grow rights and then they could then their grow your play okay now I got two right so you weren't just my deal or I could exit right and it was and that was how it worked right now is a donation base you know I'm donating my grow rights to you and you can cultivate for me well what do you do with the excess you know and so I wasn't a big proponent on dealing and some I didn't yeah a very great area yeah yeah so you have these farmers markets right it's exactly what it sounds like if you go to the uptown farmers market over off like 26th Street in Bethany the biggest farmers market here it's yeah beautiful and lots of food all kinds and stuff it was just like that except indoors you've got 40 vendors that are been in all kinds of cannabis products I'm talking anything you can think of from capsules the cookies to cake pops to popsicles - we made it all we made it no you know and this is still around the time when we're trying to figure out dosing yeah and and that was a that was a real propeller in in Thomas and i's journey which which is about three years later because I'd gone to Washington and come back which maybe we'll get to and so those farmers markets allowed an opportunity to really start building a network you know like the other vendors and the other people that had these the caregivers and stuff like where some of us are still friends you know a small small group there's a lot of them weeded out but some of us are so contented [Laughter] no it's good some are now managers within dispensaries and so it's it's cool to see how everybody's evolved you know and Thomas and I we had met at the end of 2008 became friends we had no idea we're gonna be doing an edible business we connected over the similar interest yeah yeah right you know he had he'd recently lost his mother was you know kind of finding his life you know he went yeah did a five-year term in the Navy um it awesome you know he was a submariner so now yeah that can you know so we stayed connected the whole time and when he had come back from the Navy I had just left for Washington and then I had returned not too long after okay and that's when we were like hey cuz he you know he just got back he was taking a break he wanted to go to school to be a doctor still does and still will actually yeah very very very again he's just that mindset so be amazing yeah he's he's fun to talk to and so that's when we really connected because I came back and and while I was in Washington the Denver High Times Cannabis Cup in 2013 that was the first year it had ever come to America it all had been in Amsterdam oh wow right I had no idea yes so that and it was in Denver Colorado mmm was a big deal because Denver had just passed Connor creational that's it so you've got this event that has 50,000 people because it's recreational right and it's the first recreational cannabis event bigger than what stock saying it is it is it is contact hi - oh my gosh the whole city of Denver was lit let's just say and so and so I went as a just as a participation I was like I'm not this is history like I'm going yeah yeah the following year is when I'd come to Thomas and I was like let's enter the High Times Cannabis Cup it was like you're high yeah let's enter the High Times campus we can do this yeah and you know he you know crack jokes on me he was like no dude you're crazy he was going to school at the time and I was like listen dude we can do this and he was like all right find out the information let's at least Leslie see what's up you know I somehow got ahold of Rick oosik which was the editor at High Times during that time yeah contacted him phone call phone call phone call and he basic said Nadeem listen cuz I'm like well how much do we bring how many edibles does it how much do we make he's like it's gonna be the biggest cannabis farmers market you've ever been apart harbor's but I was like got it so make as much as I can like anything that I can write and so then we got the booth okay yeah so now I'm like hey yeah we can do this and I was like hey we should enter our products to join win he was like dude you're just pushing the limits and I'm like yeah let's try and do this and so we were making gummies at the time we were making brownies at the time which we don't make um hey you know baked bros 2 2 2 2 different directions either we make baked goods or we're baked right right so we're making cookies brownies gummy cereal bars all that stuff the gummies were really they've always been our niche and we get to there before we leave III said hey let's let's enter the cup and hmm you know he gave me some smack for it and then he said I tell you what and I believe he was joking at the time yeah he said if we win the Cup I'll drop out of school and I'll go full-blown bake oh my god I didn't hear this story yeah he goes I'll commit full-blown bake gross oh my god definitely so I said okay deal and you're the first contest oh yeah oh yeah oh yes and this is 2014 so I'm like okay cool man like I didn't really take it that I could use the help well fast forward we won the cop so our sour kick-ass which are still on the market today they had won the cup they won People's Choice so that means the people voted for our products we didn't even enter that product we entered a medicated baklava yeah yes yes when my mom comes to town I'll have her make some I would absolutely deliver something because it's a 45 year old recipe only the women in my family habit and she just so happened to infuse it oh my word it is fantastic it is fantastic and so we wanted to enter that into the medical cup and we're like yeah let's another medicated baklava it's a unique product like yeah yeah but he's got any didn't even make that make the charts you know yeah so again sour cush kids got voted by the People's Choice so we're at the award ceremony and we're like hoping to hear you know we didn't get it and then the following award was the sour kush kids and we're like taking my surprise yeah so it's like all of a sudden something just set in to us and were like oh [ __ ] like what does this mean I think we just broke through oh so that's what that was the beginning of what really brought us married yeah you know so I came back to Arizona with that under our belt started writing proposal letters of dispensaries got picked up by a dispensary and up north we were working there fast forward a little bit and you know we've been with true med dispensary now for going on about a little over three years yeah now we're in 83 dispensaries and rocking and and to close the loop on on Thomas he did he show me that I was going off to Denver yeah and the day of the cup he had a final so he finished the final okay the final yeah and then he had come out they come out to either finish the final or he had gotten approval from the professor to do the final when he got back and he told his professor like what he was doing and she was totally supportive like which is really cool because I could have gone any way could have gone any way of that happening super cool won the award I looked at him and like you know he said he finished out the semester and now going strong it's been really cool that story's just so incredible and in since then we've now got upward of 40 employees Wow we've got a strong leadership team a strong team marketing team production team packaging team distribution team and let me take a breath because let me say it has been a challenge oh oh while it has been wild yeah building I never thought that building people along with building myself would be something that I was doing ya know leading people and leading people as a group you know like I'm I'm finally finally after five years of actually being baked grows me in a business settling into my role you know which is a CMO which let's talk about labels right yeah we talked about like see chief ma officer it's like no man yeah I don't know like I'm not I don't know it's a it's a it's weird hierarchy it's yeah it's weird goofy it really is it's like it's you have to have this title so yeah you can get certain speaking engagements right it's it's because people see that yeah and then they're like oh oh my goodness you know it's like I should take you're serious I'm just yeah right right like I'm just a person just like you you know what I mean and this is what I happen to be really good at yeah and and want and impassionate about so I want to continue to be good at it and get her and I guess this is the label that I have to take on you know so Thomas and I always joke with each other we're like we're not CEOs weirdoes you know but you know from the outside looking in from other people we are and we have to own it you know it's a part of our ego my ego at least yeah yeah well aren't you play the role something you know says says you know yeah you want that title you want that title and then the other part of me like my soul self is like I agree yeah we care about titles no but it's it's got me to where its it's a part of what's got me to where I am today and and like I said finally settling into the role of who I am and what I'm to do now you know we've if we want to talk about the organization we can and so we brought on a director of business development a year ago right we recruited him well he worked at Apple for a very long time about 10 plus years and he built sales teams that's what he did he built sales teams good fine so an apple is a culture everyone admires I'm going to say we're a lot of people it's obviously absolutes right Amazon Costco Apple you know Nordstrom's like model yeah yeah yeah right these these these cultures that they have and so he really brought that you know for us right in the right time because Thomas and I were maxing out you know it's right we can't be the smartest people at the table anymore I'm not a CMO I don't have these answers yeah yeah you know right and so we needed somebody to to come in not necessarily to teach us how to be a CEO or teach us how to be CMO or CFO or any of that it was just the competencies yes on how to level up right coachup coach up coach out you know and and those competencies are what you know Dell is his name brought to the table for us so um some of the company's been like communicating effectively right what does that mean you hear it yeah right yeah yeah skilled version of communicating effectively look like yeah it is an unskilled version yeah yeah kidding effectively look like right and so in the moment you know he would call it out if we're talking or arguing or which we don't argue anymore we just know we could you know each other's love languages and an apology languages we've got to talk about absolutely absolutely a big component yeah you know and everybody needs everybody has to anybody that comes onto our leadership team they have to do their languages because to prevent arguments yeah to allow to communicate effectively like talking to different languages yes yeah you're talking Italian and I Chinese totally I don't hear you I'm just waiting I really like you I'm just waiting to give myself that's it you know and we need to actively listen to each other you know so having somebody that came onto the team like Dell was able to bring a component of radical candor and just man it hurts when somebody calls you out on your [ __ ] [Music] that component of radical candor and being able to receive that type of me vacuum in the moment you know runs congruently with you know learning these different competencies of just how to be a better person yeah yeah it's and it's not that it levels just our communication up in the business but life yeah like my relationships are better for sure my family relationships are better my friendships are better I mean you sign me up someday someday yeah I look forward to that that's um that's really my goal with one of my goals within the company is to you know be a thought leader and a thought speaker for this information because I know how impactful it's been again for our organization myself yes you you know yeah to be able to communicate here today with you yeah like it is wouldn't it happened before cannabis no way no not not where I was huh and you said you came from from now I'm interviewing right you say no best format you said you were from Kansas City I was there for a couple years okay Kauai I grew up from Detroit area that's right okay got it so Midwest area yeah yeah I grew up in Branson Missouri right yeah Branson Missouri is where I was in Leawood oh cool yeah yeah my babies live in downtown Kansas City buzzer awesome like my family's there right now my parents were there there my stepfather does like he builds businesses we'll just say that and so he's over there building out of business right now yeah and so she's like come on we're at the casino I'm like no get out of the casino what do you do it out man I don't know what's going on right now she's like nobody's here it's great yeah first time the casino didn't have smoke [Laughter] so just having having somebody come onto our team at the right time this is a little over a year ago again call it call it divine if you will you know I will and I was like I had met del from from the cannabis industry he built a dispensary here and then let's just say we recruited him right the best people already have jobs yes most people already have jobs absolutely you know they really do go get them yeah I'm learning this the hard way so you know he was making a transition and we were able to get him onto the team right at the right time and he brought a couple other people from Apple and it was just like did we manifest this happen we're doing submit my resume yeah it is every single day every single day it is his growth yeah it is it is seriously growth and I I don't portray it a lot I don't think on my own my social you know and and it's it's because people only see what you want to be like we only show people what we want to see yeah you know yeah I guess it's figuring out how to put it into a format you know and yeah with that I guess why I'm sharing that is because again someday I hope to teach people this these things you know and and and and it started from a drug yeah yeah started all because of an illegal drug Wow a beautiful plant I know that is our mission to eliminate the negative stigma associated with this beautiful alternative that is so good right which is why I'm super excited to be with you because like you know me I'm just a radical out-of-the-box spiritual girl who loves God and and I really feel like God asked me to break shame off that plan amen you know and the cool thing is is just where we connect because I'm the same way if I got to put on my CEO hat that's where my inner [ __ ] comes out way too much you know okay I gotta be bossy you know but you really a label I'd love to put on you as you are such a prophet and you are so apostolic in activating things in the realm and those are churchy words and we don't typically hear in business but that's the realm where I live right because God didn't call me to the church realm but I see so much healing in what you did I want to backtrack to when you were like in wrestling in that because you can see going from a tough childhood into a sport having such empathy and even awareness and being exposed to this concept of cannabis for pain because of your coach yeah and look but it's but that should be the new normal right that as you chased that it opens that up so tell me like you were not just playing around with wrestling I mean you were at okay I've got notes here but Oklahoma State cuz I didn't know there's like that's when you go when you're like the Olympic level make me blush so so I I went I got a scholarship to a school called to a college in Tulsa Oklahoma called bacon college and that's where I wrestled okay for a year and then I had gone to Oklahoma not Oklahoma State but Norman Oklahoma University and I had spent about a semester there okay I didn't actually go to school there I didn't like you know spend a whole I didn't go to school I ended up dropping out I'm an I'm um call a dropout but me too I spent a semester there and then I had moved to Missouri to to Arizona because I had met my coach and the assistant coach Matt and in Oklahoma and he had Crohn's disease right nobody knew what it was however he would smoke a joint yeah and cannabis helping him is again what led me to come to Arizona and I was fortunate to have my mom living here California was course an option right it's so sad it was so saturated yeah already been legal for I think almost 20 years yeah so there's like I'm just a I'm just a pee going there yeah Arizona's pushing to go legal for the third time that led me so immediately when I came to Arizona though I I got into just the wrestling crowd you know I got a job at Applebee's some lady saw my tears and she was like oh you have cauliflower ear and I was like yeah she's like do you fight cause like no I wrestled and she's like my husband teaches jiu-jitsu and I was like I've never done jiu-jitsu she's like we'll come over he trains out of the house garage and they ended up living a mile away from me and and this man has been a mentor of mine for 10 years now Wow yeah and and his name's Bobby's I love the men you know and we talked a little bit you and I offline about your story a little bit on you know being on 140 milligrams of was an oxy cotton 140 milligrams oxycontin and 90 milligrams prednisone every day yeah and so a very similar story with him his health took a decline so I started training jiu-jitsu and got an MMA in cage fighting and his health started to take a decline and my family had a restaurant we're you know so I was working at the restaurant and that closed just a series of events and we lost connection Bob and I and that's how it just really started taking a bad decline and we reconnected about three years ago he reached out to me I had reached out to him a few times I have this I'm leaning into this more now than ever is like when you think of somebody it's not by coincidence no it's you should reach out to him okay so I would I would unknowingly I would just you know unknowingly of that thought I would just reach out to my came in Miss you hope everything's well you haven't seen you for a long long long long time right and finally I think it got to him and and and he had reached out and he said I'm done like I'm hanging in the coat like I'm done I'm done with these opiates and tell me about this yeah you know tell me about he's familiar with cannabis smoking and stuff but I think he'd just been watching and seeing what we're doing and he came over and Thomas came over and I think Nick came over to is another you know one of our buddies yeah we all talk cannabis you know in three four hours later he ate one of these watermelon slices after 3-4 hours of me explaining the processes he ate the watermelon cuz he's like this is [ __ ] delicious yeah that you should start yeah yeah and you know from there I mean he was on I think 90 milligrams of oxycontin and I think like upward of like 60 milligrams of morphine yeah yeah together yeah and he was doing those you know simultaneously hmm put together and troubles with insurance yeah travels with the doctor is trying to travel yeah he said he said I'm done yeah no yeah and he made the hard switch and this is what breaks my heart though is that the regimen that we were able to provide for him I don't want to say it's impossible to scale it's very difficult to scale yeah because everyone's gonna be a little different everyone's different and yes the amount of milligrams that he needed yes is not affordable in the dispensaries yeah no no I get it yeah I mean we're talking to 300 milligram bottle of our syrup a day yeah a day right you know and yeah you're talking like $1,000 a month absolutely yeah absolutely you know and so I was very fortunate you know in our situation to be able to it got to the point where like we can't do a 300 milligram bottle every single day like this man needs like a hundred milligrams you know periodically stretched out throughout the day right know upwards of 500 milligrams so that's one distillate came into the picture correct distillate hash oil right it's a refined process it's a distal ated process of hash oil right and a whole other conversation yeah yeah because there's so many different hash oils yeah yeah but what that did distillate is it gave us a it gave us a base for accurate dosing karere and so you're taking something that is in a flour form right which may be 10 to 15 milligrams per gram right and you are taking this bulk cannabis flower you are concentrating it you know through using certain solvents that can extract the THC correct other components of it Reds and then you can clean it up there's many different ways of cleaning it up you can filter it you can distill it so distillation again removes primarily all the lipids and strips primarily the the the the profile of cannabis but leaves behind the THC right okay so now you have something that is upward of 900 milligrams per gram yeah okay huge difference is that similar to like I used RSO quite a bit when I was winning yes yeah yeah RSO is a little different yeah that was that's a horror so changed the world changed my life changed a lot of people's worlds yeah so RSO preserves that full spectrum profile of the cannabis plant yeah so distillate you remove a lot of that except for the primary cannabinoids of THC and a couple others right there's like trace you know yeah amounts however that is what gave us the the foundation to be able to help him you know so we would make capsules right you know I would make capsules for him now he makes them himself yeah yeah you know and this is again years ago so now we can make whatever we want we make 50 milligram capsules we make 100 milligram capsules 200 milligrams yeah however I do believe and Derick our former director of education now our creative director has found some information out there that like your receptors can only take so much THC pressure for it's just it's like taking too much vitamin C for sure yeah yeah so there is an optimal yeah right and so he was using this hundred milligrams periodically throughout the day and you know it's he's completely pharmaceutical free now you know I think he's yeah he just came out of surgery so he's had to use you know some steroids and South but that's all right beyond that I mean it is it's changed his life again absolutely and people don't get to hear these stories no you know or they don't understand that this is not side of the road Cheech and Chong right okay I didn't want AXI so now I just want to be high as hell and I'm getting out my medicines and that's it's fascinating too it's fascinating that it heals yes you yes mine and body yeah and body yeah it provides the amount of alleviation that you need yes to feel yeah and you feel how to feel what feeling good feels like right people have forgot what feeling good feels like so then when you have a little taste of it again you're like this is what feels like you know same with food you know yeah let's get what it feels like to feel good eating food you know and it's something especially like right now we're living in what I will call the group single greatest love a trauma to hit globally then that I've ever experienced you have so many people now walking around who've been literally traumatized by kovat and all the other different things and my journey started because of awareness of trauma crazy thing I don't know how many stories you hear about this I had no interesting cannabis like using cannabis when I was in high school was the drug I didn't want you know what I mean I didn't enjoy the munchies I didn't enjoy the cottonmouth I couldn't stand the paranoia why do I want to sit around like a vegetable going hmm and and yet I began to study what happens with the endocannabinoid system and the plasticity of the brain by using the full plan yes to help the brain release trauma to restore plasticity how the endocannabinoid system can you speak into that because I think a lot of people who are hesitant are just like no I don't wanna be high but I was higher on opiates right do you get what I'm saying I was nor out of it well yeah the dissociation that happens in the numbing I believe that's the word right there's a disassociation that yeah and that's what I was I guess trying to say with cannabis is like you you you all of a sudden get to feel what it feels like to feel again yeah right you are not disassociated from your mind and body alright and and and that is a concern of people they're like I don't want to get high well yeah of course a lot of people don't want to get high no and and it's I find it fascinating I would love to hear your your story or experience with the to the patients that we've worked with that require high milligrams more that are winging off or transitioning right they don't often get high yeah and I'm talking they're using high milligram doses yeah I take 50 milligrams I'm speaking cursive yes now I am with which is so wild that I could use super high dose right and now it's five telegrams maybe 1020 in a day or just 120 milligram coming at night and when I have my Remicade I might use some plant or something because of the pain in that but after a day or two I'm iron and so and so that could be associated to the enou cannabinoid system yes right because is a system in place that is its its primary purpose is to help us meet homeostasis right right right so if we're on all kinds of these pharmaceuticals we are way out of whack way right we're requiring high doses and effort transitioning we're requiring high doses of cannabinoids right to fill these holes right yeah homeostasis and then as we begin to heal that lessens right yeah that lessens and so that's that's how we did it with Bob - I mean we titrated him up we titrated him down yeah staggered his dose that's a tie in and that way it wasn't just like 300 milligrams all at once so it was you know every four hours yeah a little to prolong that experience or that that relief that he would get from it and you know we've had success with it's been a roller coaster ride yeah but we've had success with it well and the other thing is people are so used to just okay my doctor said I'm supposed to take my pill at this time mmm that you're not paying attention to what's going on with your pain like first thing I did is broke the percocet that was used for breakthrough pain so instead of a full percocet I took a half a percocet and a little bit of RSO under my tongue and what's fascinating though is I remember when it began to really heal and I had been off all the opiates for about a month or so and I'm now really micro dosing way down because I'm not using as much because my big high dose was to prevent I had no side effects that's also when I wound off everything that's that that's I had to work with that but I felt like I took a limitless pill like a Baba sudden it was like 30 days in and I would be just like whoa I haven't felt that part of my brain since I was two that's not why that was actually a level of clear yeah endocannabinoid system do that like what is so I'm not scientist my body so healed I don't get that anymore I would I would encourage it's because the endo cannabinoid system is meeting homeostasis more optimally right and so that could very well be it and that that feeling or a moment of clarity is against something that you have not had an experience for the however long you know you were on the pharmaceuticals and so now your body is like whoa yeah I see color I taste I see I smell I can't cry and feel and get a relief right it's crazy how much cannabis heals and this is where you know some of my fellow Christians are like oh you're treading on dangerous land but who created it there's a there's a funny opens you there's a funny meme out there that said God created gave us cannabis and then man made it illegal yeah hello yeah and yeah I grew up I grew up with the Muslim father yeah and a Christian mother yeah how's that work yeah well they divorced yeah and I moved to Missouri they from Texas redneckville oh yeah I'd y'all smoking oh my god you bringing it out of me if you've ever seen the movie or the show Ozarks yeah I lived in Ozarks yeah pretty damn accurate you know and so careful who you choose to be friends with you know and and yeah exactly and so my father remained in Texas and he's still there today remarried lots of siblings beautiful wife all that and my mom got remarried as well and however when we moved to Missouri so I was seven we moved in with my uncle which was I don't know if this is a politically correct term but bible-thumper I'm talking I'm talking Baptist alcohol can hand on the table this is how it goes yeah you know and I spent the next three years living with him and it's I put a lot of I put a lot of thought into this and and over the years because it shaped me um it shaped me it traumatized me it scared me it also established a lot of morals mm-hmm and values I'm so grateful for yeah you know I was having this conversation not too long ago I mean it was his house that I learned the proper manners you know yeah just manners are for other people that's what it's for yeah and in structure right I I learned a lot of structure from this from this man and I mean it was church every Sunday every Wednesday sometimes even Saturday's my Bible studies and all that jazz and and I just remember you know I so vividly the the pastor just smacking the the podium like you're gonna go to hell if you do not believe Jesus as the Son of God yeah and that put that put the fear of God in just a little bit so I'm thinking I'm like doesn't lead you to a great relationship yeah just a fear and I'm like wait a minute my dad's Muslim and so I'm bawling my eyes out you know and he took the opportunity to it was my opportunity to be saved you know and right I'm glad that's the reaction I got I didn't know the difference my eyes out and he's like you know read this verse and you know you've been saved by Christ and you get baptized and all the stuff and I didn't know what it meant you know I mean like okay yeah well I mean I went back and forth I went to Texas I went to Missouri because that always was my dad I went overseas many many many times they'd always joke hey what's your religion you know do a half and a half and I'm like well you get it I'm milkshake yes and so it was always kind of a joke in when I got into college I took a world religions class yeah that's when I'd open the door was I started I learned about different religions and yeah I have a very passionate interest about the answer and and learned that Christ is arguably one of the most influential people of our time that what he did he was and there's so much to talk about right Christ Muhammad Krishna Buddha Native American wisdom there's no are all religions are they all against cannabis no whoa devil's lettuce the devil's lettuce right I remember I got my grandma to try a sour cush kid once and she tried it and and and and then the following day she was crying and she was praying to God to ask for forgiveness but but she has no problem taking or xanax every night so I was just like gosh dang it grandma are like oh you know what's something though is that like I want to open up the conversation of self-control mmm because like is it the tequila is it the cannabis is that that this is that the better is it self-control that when our spirits are not governed by all these rules but we operate with that understanding that power that we have to just moderate how do you have self-control if you've if if your surrounding doesn't really encourage it you know like yeah like growing up in Missouri right I mean this is what you did this is how it worked there was no outlier that was like no that's actually not right yeah you know that's not true about cannabis all right that's not true about medicine or religion or whatever there was none of the I think it was from hell right right right I smell a skunk that must be a demon my mom when we would because you know Missouri and she would smell a skunk I never understood yeah yeah she's like oh she likes love that smell like you're weird mom now I totally get it yeah I'll loop back to self control but you would ask is cannabis you know wrong in all religions and so that brings up an interesting interesting points because it's encouraged me to learn about this and so cannabis originated in China okay that's where that's the beginning of time that we that we know of fine they weren't using it to get high now they were using it for medicinal purposes and they would use the roots okay and they would they would boil the roots and they would make tea out of it okay not gonna get high from that but there are vital cannabinoid and you know other other components EBD know so the cannabinoid to my understanding cannabinoids will not be in the root okay of the cannabis plant and it's more vital cannabinoids components right and they would use that they would make topicals out of it they make teas out of it Wow okay so this is we're talking almost three thousand years ago a long time it transitioned into India that's when I started getting a little okay gotcha psychedelic yeah yeah they started using the flower in the plant right and so we were yeah and so we were talking about this yesterday actually so it's really fresh right now that's when cannabis was used for started began to be used for you for purposes and spiritual purposes and India has a festival called Holi festival and during this time they would sell preparation called bong or Bank DHA ng okay and this is a drink it's it's a it's a it's a drink it has different forms like a yogurt form and different forms and they would sell it during this this festival and it had you know you would get high from it right and they're still out there today like if you were to ask if you would be in India and ask them about cannabis they would kind of look at you funny right if you said bong leave it go yeah you know yeah and it's interesting it is and so that's when like the food preparation of cannabis you know came and it transitioned to Middle East which is still so crazy that there's very few plants you can actually bake and put in something and it maintains its structure totally that's just so freakin miraculous that that took yes God to create that yes can't do that with other players plant is an alien plan resistant and from there it made its way into the Middle East and that's when it that's when it started getting really strong yeah you know in a lot well a lot of people will say because of the growing conditions yeah right that influences how the plant grows rain you know altitude and soil and conditions all of that has a big role to play in it but I wanted to close the loop on on do all religion see it as as wrong but some religions or some cultures such as the Indian culture and new culture they they see it as a spiritual practice you know and it can be there there are there are people today who have cannabis ceremonies yeah you know and that is a high dose experience yeah yeah and I've been there you like like yeah unintentionally yeah no oh yeah like when I ate when I had a sucker yeah last week that you I did ask you then oh dear God that's when I was praying I can't god help me come this way what happened right and you can have a borderline out-of-body experience you know I wanted to always being your an out-of-body witnessing what is happening and it's like what is going on it's crazy lemon juice just put lemon juice in water and it was okay that's awesome for my listeners I I didn't intend to get that high I for some reason there's not thinking and I didn't know the suckers were just for licking for medicinal i literally chewed the dang thing in a minute and a half and then in about 20 minutes couldn't feel my lips and was i live by myself was laying over my counter and i got some lemon it's wild though how you can use lemon or you tell me even pepper hmm so there's I'm sure there's a terpene within the lemon juice yeah Dee limonene or or somewhere probably one of those that helps same thing with pepper so beta carry off a lien is another Fein that is a common terpene in cannabis but just smelling it you obviously don't want to you know inhale no no it's kind of smell it a little bit and that can help reduce the nausea right associated to being high right beyond that I mean buckle up so many people like like when I talk about cannabis I've been building business obviously I talk about God openly and I love all people so they thought I went off the deep end and yet I'm gonna make a radical statement if I had to have surgery I'm not against opiates mmm that was never any work well here's the deal I was never addicted I was tolerant my body was tolerant I did not you know thank God because of all different kinds of thing was not psychologically dependent but physiologically now in retrospect we're talking 2004 to 2017 I was on opiates Wow so I find it more demonic what the opiates did to my mind my inability to heal my inability to process when I say cannabis opened me you know I don't know how many stories you've heard on that that's what I wanted to ask you where it was now time to feel and I felt like as it healed and for me it's just physiology at science I didn't get high and then I felt my body was healing and my brain and my heart and my soul could operate together men and I cuts they're driven yes and I could process and some of the feelings were so much that the cannabis actually helped it not get too overwhelming right when you're healing and and that that that healing that being able to feel is really what I think the the root of it is is because these opiates or pharmaceuticals can condole you down and and I want to be clear because you had said you're not against or I'm not against opiates and the proper usage thank God if I have to have surgery you ain't touching me without a so just for the audience listening right now I'm not saying that pharmaceuticals are all bad no work for some it's just that the long-term use yeah and the side effects that can that accompany it are are detrimental to your health like your bad is what I mean like they can hurt you you could use half the dose even after surgery by using your gummies and whatever pain medicine they give you and you'll use that yeah I mean I have friends that have had surgeries and use none yeah absolutely I had all four wisdom teeth pulled out and they gave me a bottle of them and I was like I'm good I got syrup Yeah right I didn't touch it awesome no you know and and have quite a few friends that are like that and them just again being able to feel again is what is the healing come is one of the healing components of what cannabis does right cannabis Jason Silva talks about this a lot and I love it because it couldn't be more true is that canvas has this innate way of moving our mind from the past removing our mind from the future and just allowing us to focus right here and now and some people experience that and and unintentionally and they don't even understand and when you can be here and now you can feel you can process you can rationalize you can think logically you know that's why you know you use cannabis or smoked cannabis eat it whatever and you start wondering how things work ya know right right it didn't it instills one curiosity and you're wondering yes yes yeah yeah it instills wonder back into your life right I think wander is is is maybe something that a lot of people lack now you know because wander could be correlated to perspective yeah you know it's like to be to have a proper communication I have to be able to objectively commute perceive objectively you know like yeah if I disagree with something that's okay yeah yeah you fishing that absolutely right I still need to wonder where your perception is coming from yes right yeah and and try at least to see that at versus being so close-minded to it okay you know and I'm just like no that's not how this is how it works you know and so little tools like cannabis being one of those right we there are there are plant induced modalities or plant modalities there are non plant modalities right meditation right and absolutely competencies and that can again instill wander right and that wander again is what can lead to healing right because I truly truly feel of all the practices I have done I've used cannabis for 15 years okay I've done other plant medicines I've dabbled with psychedelics we're going to talk about that yeah and and and very all are very powerful tools I do not think any single one is the answer not only they are all tools toolbox right if I have a screw I can't hammer it in maybe the proper tool exactly right so good and and so of all of those what I believe they boiled down to is awareness and love so combine those you have love you know right I cannot love you if I'm not aware and I cannot be aware if I do not have love for the other person and so what all of that compiles into is integration right conversation conversation is the integration of all of this work because when we can talk about it when we can rationalize and see each other's perspective that's where a lot of healing can come and yeah yeah we're not I mean I read a statistic recently that married couples I don't know how many people was done but like they talk to their spouse on average 28 minutes a week and I'm like what no that's insane you know right yeah and so it just that one statistic just goes to show how disconnected we are yeah in a time where we are where's my phone more connected than ever yeah right yeah they're so disconnected yeah you know that that human interaction and and again being able to comprehend the communication that's happening that in itself it's it's talk therapy you know that in itself is extremely powerful which leads to cannabis use or psychedelic use because there are if I may open the door on using psychedelics yeah yeah so and we're talking micro dosing Vitamix which is something I mean well let's back up for just one quick sec because one of the things we were talking about is that the number one thing that changed my life as I started sleeping hmm so like I'm 56 today 52 and a half years old and I'm now sleeping through the night okay that's why sometimes I'm like okay was it the sleep and the cannabis healing the endocannabinoid system that actually gives you the awareness to go deeper even in your own life to go into the stuff that might have been scary because like two weeks of I felt like all I wanted to do is sleep for a month initially and then you wake up and you have the exhilaration like you used to when you were a kid when you wake up because you wake up rested yes and then you're open to different things now going in is psychedelics go ahead into that on sleep there's a book called why we sleep by Matthew Walker he's a sleep expert and K is fantastic okay it will dynamically change your priority list for sleep you can add anything you want of mine oh my don't touch my yeah and there's a large there's a large contribution to healing health healing to sleep ya know when we sleep we heal right we have to and so what what's happening when we use cannabis is and there's there's there's some articles out there on this that talk about this we skip the REM State yes okay we skip um rapid eye movement that's where that's largely associated to where we dream right okay right and we skip this rim sleep also during if you have a lot of rim your sleep isn't always the best because people who suffer from PTSD yeah it may fall in that that that ever stay deep right that stage of sleep there's four stages I believe there are awake light rim and deep right and so when when we in like you said we go in cycles those cycles repeat itself three or four times a night light REM deep light REM d you wake up feeling exhausted yes if you don't get enough sleep or if you wake up in the wrong sleep state yeah wrong stage of sleep by skipping rim a lot of people who use cannabis don't dream often and if anybody who has used cannabis for quite a while and then stops using cannabis yeah if there are listeners right now you may be shaking your heads about to know what I'm gonna say you have very vivid dreams very married yes and and they can be bad they can be good I mean I had dreams of riding a motorcycle through the Amazon with Joe Rogan once I was like wow yeah so it's a sign what's up Joe very very vivid very real make you feel exhausted when you wake up you know and so you using cannabis you skip that and you go you go into deep sleep and that's why sometimes we feel a little bit more rested yeah you know however you know Matthews Walker Matthew Walker's book really highlights the importance of all the stages and rim in deep sleep and and and I may have this wrong or backwards but rim is more of a hormonal healing sleep state right our deep sleep is a physical yeah in sleep right yeah you may have that backwards but I believe that's correct and so there's this Acadian the circadian rhythm so there's there's a there's a there's a you have to go through all the cycles right and so that's why people who use cannabis will get really deep rested state and they feel better and yeah and and but we still want to shine light on that on that REM state and so going back to the endocannabinoid system we have endo cannabinoids right and then there are exogenous cannabinoids can I have annoyed czar in many things not just cannabis right food really Whole Foods and so there are two primary endocannabinoids there's two AG and an and amide okay Amanda might Ananda in Greek means bliss so they coined it as the Bliss molecule hmm really really we're alive and so if you've ever been working out yeah I had that runner tires oh yeah yeah that's an animai yeah I'm gonna run for president so working out or like that runner's high or entering flow state Remo with Marshall larger yeah we talked riding even riding even getting into that flow State yeah that's an and amide and that'n and amide you're literally getting high on your own supply so for people listening that have ever experienced that it I've never used cannabis yeah you've experienced the euphoria that comes with cannabis yeah that is it exactly one of the billing is the out-of-body experience but your body was still doing everything listen yeah you know that that runner's high yeah that I know a lot of people can relate to that is a component of what's happening so when when we use cannabis were we're if we aren't sleeping well or there's something in our body that we're just not healing for mind or body we're lacking a certain cannabinoid that's one component of it yeah yeah we're lacking some type of cannabinoids so we either need to change our diet or we can use other modalities like cannabis right that we are now bringing in exogamous cannabinoids right and so when we bring those in or in no cannabinoid systems like yeah and so or energy that laughs yes it doesn't go up and be like oh my god I'm gonna die consistent yeah right you're giving your body what it wants know what it needs you know and and that will then contribute to better sleep as way you know and that's that's a component of it and so from there we'll we were talking about psychedelics but sleep is so so so so important well and you know what's crazy too is they talk about the health of the gut and sleep and you know I battle Crohn's and I'm grateful for Remicade but even using like the gummies and stuff like that from baked grouse I'm excited to use the syrups because you can really titrate down to small amount of milligrams but my last Remicade I didn't even use any inhalation I've had two Remicade since all this cop\u00e1n nonsense and craziness has started but what was amazing is I actually felt better two days in because my number one objective with Remicade which is a lot of people with like chemo and stuff is to sleep mm-hmm I need to sleep for the night you know the doctor says I need you to sleep as much as possible when you feel like crap you're like oh yeah thank you very much for that because I haven't been sleeping for six weeks you know but you use that and you literally can feel your body the only thing I can say pharmaceutical wise is like when you feel horrible you have pneumonia you take an antibiotic and a week or so later also do you feel like quote-unquote yourself again but what that what the cannabis does with the deep sleep and with restoring the in the endocannabinoid system restoring itself right that is self healing right there gosh there are I feel we're gonna have to do another episode to talk about self healing and self-love yeah because there's a lot of healing that comes from that self-love and and and the cannabinoids that you get from products like these right so yeah yeah let's talk about the syrups okay so the syrups I can't wait to try them it's a great product and these are indica so these are indica do they come in both yes they do okay come in indica and sativa these are so there's a green tag on them and they'll tell you so this is granddaddy purple okay this is the unflavored syrup what's unique about the the syrups is that they are they it's a very health conscious product yeah okay we're talking primarily organic brown rice syrup no flea are no colors no artificials at all Wow real fruit extracts you know how in our flavored ones diabetics safe sugar free I mean it's that we made this product for that reason for sure yeah and micro dosing it is is how I encourage people to begin with it yeah if you do not know your dose yes so also on this tag there's a couple dosing I think we do one milliliter five milligrams teaspoon is 25 milligrams per tablespoon is 75 milligrams and they act fast because the first thing I can put it under my tongue correct they act fast and and and and so because of primarily because of the oral administration right so we're not chewing this we're not ingesting it right it is a oral application we have the buccal and mucosal lining of the mouth and the arterial glands of the tongue right help get it into the system much more quicker so in short the bioavailability is superior no no is that the same reason why inhalation works because of going through the mucosal in you know obviously it goes into the lungs I believe I've heard Derek speak about this and and I think that is one of the reasons why cuz right that's why a lot of people use smoking because it's quick yeah five minutes you know and you if you if you don't have enough in your pains bad you can actually just take a little bit more and and we'll help right but then you run the risk of getting like raspy voice and coughing I'm in the gym five six days a week and I can tell when I'm inhaling totally I don't have the resistance as much totally and so that's something that the products like edibles will help mitigate right right and so when you smoke it on sets fast and only lasts about an hour and a half to two hours right you so the the the conversion is different how long does the syrup last so anywhere from four to six hours depends amazes yeah this is because of the conversion so when we eat inedible or let's say the syrup for this for this purpose it it it it the liver converts THC to something to an active metabolite called eleven hydroxy THC right and this is arguably three to four times stronger than THC right so take that into consideration and eating that so yeah and so with the syrup what we always recommend is to use a oral milliliter syringe okay right a lot of people have them you can get at Walgreens yeah yeah I'll give them to you a little baby right one milligram or one milliliter is five milligrams okay gotcha now the psychoactive threshold of THC is two point five milligrams anything below two point five milligrams that's a CBD but likelihood is you're not you're not gonna have a psychoactive effect no so for the people that are concerned about getting high right start low for sure you can take two point five milligrams of this syrup wait I would say 15 to 25 minutes right assess how you feel yeah take another two point five milligrams you know and that's the glory of the restrictions being lifted and us being able to provide products like this for sure right so yeah now we can we can get into micro dosing right not just psychedelics but micro dosing cannabis absolutely you know and yeah and that's how I use it now other than like I go to bed it's just one gummy but if I need it during the day I'm micro dosing that's awesome yeah I think that's absolutely fantastic I feel a true micro dose of THC would be 2.5 to 5 milligrams okay and and and and we're seeing 10 milligrams as the common ground for a single dose of THC across the nation right and I I would I would beckon that that should and will change as it becomes federally legal because in the recreation states were seeing restrictions like yet that edibles cannot be more than 100 milligrams and they have to be able to be dosed in 10 milligram increments right okay all recreational right exactly I've seen five milligrams put somebody over the edge period and I accidentally got a hundred milligram attaboy showed you that I was that I was at getting my order which I do have to tell you guys this bake bros converted me from mostly I mean I'm I haven't even don't use inhalation as much as I use the syrups and the gummies in that but I accidentally I thought I had because no no Kofi do you have to order it online and then you go to the curb and you throw the dude your money and he throws you your bag kidding kind of answer you gotta go up there and then they've got a pre ready and I'm looking in my bag when I got home and I thought it's 100 milligram gummies yeah and how am I supposed to slice right you don't know you're making me nervous looking at it it's still in my bathroom I felt I felt a little bit of the past I mean I'm like okay so how long does this last is it gonna go bad no look well no I mean if I have this at home let's and I thought well at least I can cut it in fours or something how long would a gummy last how long do gummies last for efficacy I guess is the word like is this gonna last for six months so they're gonna start to do rating so we have a year on our product okay products which is amazing plant turns into like totally CBD after a while and so that's one conversion yes THC particularly converts to something called CBN okay I am over time I'm talking a long time yeah I'm talking a long time a long time for it to convert unless it takes a long time for it to convert unless heat is being applied okay so let's let's use the analogy of example of smoking a joint Blount okay we're smoking this joint and we're smoking it and they you know it's getting shorter and shorter right order and then we get to the the last half right the roach right right yeah yeah yeah and let's say we put it out halfway okay we come back to it the next day and we smoke it again well we are just ripped now okay yeah it's like what on earth happened with us yeah this is this is not the same feeling I had yesterday I'm like way more sedated more hi what's happening is that THC because of the heat is converting to CBN and and that is that's acts more of a sedative and it makes you more tired and it makes you more stony and so no wonder I only needed a hit just one little I had to sleep all night there's I'm coughing in my sleep yes yes yeah yeah and to that point though there's there's so much that we're still going to be learning about this plant and there are so many restrictions that we have that prevent us from being able to do control trials right you know or double-blind trials I know like we just can't do it like they can't be done you know I think sue Sisley is doing some of them for cannabis and PTSD but the restrictions are very like it's very limited to what we can do and how we can study this and so a lot of this has been trial and error and people's testimonials and people sharing their stories of yourself that have a large reach like this what we have to do is provide this type of information and so going back to the to the syrups you know being able to microdose it that and it that that is arguably anybody that is new to cannabis is the number one way I would recommend using cannabis is if it's not the syrups if you're in a state where we're not you know I would I would highly encourage using something that is a oral base right and dry yeah it has a test result yeah you know that way you have some type of base that you're starting with yes many milliliters equals this many milligrams right and I need to start with two point five milligrams and assess how I feel yes everybody will feel different to known this when I first started I was like you know well I remember thinking okay I'm really not fond of that not a drug I even wanted in high school and blah blah blah blah and so here I am the other side I'm a grandma you know I haven't I hadn't driven in three years when they put me on the higher doses when I was on lower doses okay but out of respect for myself and everybody else I hadn't wasn't driving and as I weaned I started to drive and nobody you know I studied a lot I had a couple coaching calls with a few people who knew and my advice to people is what happened to me was I didn't realize how much a potentiated the opiates yeah so I was literally high for two weeks three yes and I remember thinking okay I'm supposed to be a social-media influencer and most of my fellows are Christians and I'm upping up my phone going no how do people do this certainly they're not high all the time and I'm wondering if this sometimes this is what people think when I say I use cannabis they just think I'm high all the time I remember saying to somebody when's the last time you met a high on who runs a company works out six days a week and hello I can't even do that when I'm tired let alone what was I totally but the body begins to adapt which is amazing mm-hmm cuz like you can hit your tolerance and I've done that in learning how to use it and weaning but then you just wait a day or so you use lemon waterway today this is not like oh my god now I got a wean for six months to get back to my dose No right how incredible that the body would readjust it like sixty it really sixty out you know hours it's like two three days you're fine totally yeah that that's and you can go back to your small dose again that is that is something that is really unique about all psychedelics yeah right is that we some have some you can build a tolerance you some you don't really build a tolerance who's gonna hit you how right it's you you know and though there's there are so many plant medicines that that we don't even know about III I mean there are so many cacao ayahuasca ibogaine yeah cannabis you know mushrooms my favorite psilocybin you know like there are and I speak of all of those psilocybin well let me start with LSD okay that's not a plant medicine it comes from a it's it's synthetically created in a lab typically as how LSD in the controlled trials but it comes from a fungus called ergot it grows in which your God grows in rye correct kay and Albert Hoffman is one who discovered this brand and it Elysee has more white paper studies than any other medicine yeah any other medicine we have today besides caffeine wait until I open that topic with you we I really want to do another episode because I never and some of my my listeners are like what the hell did you just say but my doctor my gastroenterologist said to me I think you have trauma trapped in your gut and there are proven not spiritual although it will affect you certainly there are medical studies showing hundreds of these he believes that that will be part of you getting me off yes Remicade yes so now I'm pursuing EMDR with an incredible therapist and I'm open to doing a clinical trial on now on doing that my only hesitancy is not that it's mushrooms or you know a micro dosing people understand you're talking a very [Music] naltrexone has been historically used for ms so tell trucks don't gets people off of heroin addiction different things like that is used for a variety of ways to cause people to come off of opiates or whatever eighty milligrams or something like that versus point five right for ms so we're talking a very mystical dose now the crazy thing to me my only hesitancy is Willa s mess up my SSRIs in my gut because my SSRIs are very like when they had me on antidepressants years ago no no I don't I don't like Cracker Jacks and II but the stabilizing is very different than ketamine it's very different than other things used clinically for PTSD to help the parasympathetic nervous system reset yep will you talk to me just a little bit about psychedelics and PTSD and releasing trauma yes so LSD and psilocybin particularly have been studied well a lot of these that all that I've just mentioned have been studied regarding PTSD it's one of the most fascinating topics you know sue Sisley here in Arizona is leading a study for with cannabis and veterans who have PTSD also MDMA so using MDMA treat pts yes you know and there are Institute's out there you Sona which is I think out of Wisconsin where psychologists and psychiatrists are being taught how to do psycho assisted their therapies therapeutics right yeah and this this was happening this was happening in in 1930s to 1960s almost 1970 right 1967 is when all this got shut down yeah by the government absolutely you're getting too well stopped little literally yes yes and so like Johns Hopkins was was leading this and and they're they're the psilocybin psilocybin is the active ingredient in mushrooms okay just as th yeah is the active ingredient in cannabis that's what psilocybin is to mushrooms okay no mushrooms I get violently ill from so I may have yes something different yes rooms and and and I won't get deep into it now but there is a purpose for micro dose and clinically what is labeled as a heroic dose right that is that is what Johns Hopkins will refer to yeah as a heroic dose and and stanislav grof he's a pioneer in this you know he's led over 5000 psycho assisted their therapy yeah you know where they I saw it a New Amsterdam and the TV show Oh incredible like incredible that they were doing it this is and my listeners need understand we're not talking about a bunch of unicorn no in a room pink enough had somewhere you're talking John Hopkins Duke Mayo yeah and so I'll run you through what that process looks like a little bit you using psilocybin or LSD what they will do is they will you'll get very familiar with the therapist right typically 2 8 hour sessions with the therapist right because the two most important factors one of the two most important factors in any psychedelic micro or macro will say is your set and setting yeah so your set being your mind set exactly mindset going into the experience right if you are terrified and just you know neurotic and just likelihood is it's not gonna be good for you and it's not the right time and there's other things we need to work on before this is interesting if so mindset set and then your setting alright I've been in in experiences where I'm at a festival and I've had friends I'm truly speaking friends and I'm not saying this is me because I know better but I have friends who have taken psychedelics LSD and MDMA at music festivals and they just freak out the setting is not conducive for that type oh no components not it got it all you know anxiety and fear and all these things can set in and so set in settings so John Hopkins providing these controlled settings right it's a very it's like living room here you know it's beautiful yeah you know therapy chairs music you trust you know you've built trust with this therapist yeah that you've spoken to and yeah anybody who's been through therapy knows how the process gonna talk and the answer that's it yeah I'm an unbiased point of view hopefully yeah and so you you establish this relationship you establish this trust and then the third component so set setting the third component is intention right very and this is such a fastest T important word because prayer intention they have they have am I in my heart a large correlation to each other means right in prayer prayer I've always felt is you're putting it out right you're speaking to God or speaking to the universe you're speaking to source your yeah your our words have a frequency yes we can measure this we can know that this is science aside you can see words just have in a lab you're not a hippie house exactly exactly I are and I encourage people to listen and learn about this like yeah our words have a frequency and when we put them out there whether it be through conversation like this yeah or it be through prayer and more intention exactly we can alter the energetic space our auras around us it's the it's the conversation that helps build context okay context is what you need because when we are under the influence of these altered states psychedelic and yes if we don't have the context what's happening right it can be terrifying yeah anxiety absolutely yeah but if we have the context to deal with the experience yeah then we can then make sense of what's happening right and so you you patients will relive the experience which can sound very terrifying but it can also help bridge the gap in the parts that were blacked out or missed yeah right and then you speak to the therapist about that and again integration yeah that conversation is where the healing occurs and so in and so maps maps dot-org is is leading the world in psychedelic studies and anybody listening wants to go there you can go to resources and you can there's a link for or a page for all the studies that have occurred yeah all of the stage and you can see psilocybin or al a psilocybin used for addiction right right being able to break people who have smoked for thirty years right right PTSD depression yeah you there's so much out there and so that that is the that's the king of resources right there they're leading the world and in these studies and so that's where I would want to direct anybody who is fascinated by the science of this and you can actually read the the controlled settings that occurred yeah it's and and I mean one session for some from any one session yeah what I'm gonna take their whole life right yeah and so there's a joke like I see a couple of your books over here Titan and and tribe of mentors Tim Ferriss who really is uh who really started my personal development growth today but he talks about an ayahuasca experience that he had yeah and he jokingly but seriously says that had I known that I could go do this 8-hour experience and get fifteen years of therapy dello I would have done that hell you know yeah and that's what happens yeah I heard about it so many times fifteen years of trauma and in therapy in an eight-hour session yeah like what yeah right cuz and that's where dr. Joe Dispenza mm-hmm speaks about what's happened he gets into the science I know is you are a see wiring your brain very much so you wire very much so and it is incredibly fascinating yeah I I'm I am a big proponent I love the science of it me too and me too Thomas takes to do it Thomas is being about yeah yeah yeah I'm I'm more in love and passionate about the metaphysical side of it so yeah yeah chill side of it yeah also understanding yeah there's a scientific side to this yeah so when you have someone like Joe Dispenza who bridges the gap between the metaphysical the spiritual healing yeah things which has occurred for thousands of years shamanistic approaches they were doctors shamans were technically spiritual doctors and then you bring this component of science to it you're like oh that's what's happening it's fascinating they're both happening yeah this manifold side is happening yes but neurologically in your body this is what's happened we're tripartite beings yeah so we're body so spirit you can't rest connect right the trinity yes absolutely it's incredible and and I I love Joe Dispenza because he really metaphysically and in spiritual practices it's often that breath is a big component we it's an autonomic process we just automatically do it we are either right because if you don't you're dead yeah uh-huh and we also breathe on consciously right we shallow breaths right words and when you're on opiates you cannot take deep breaths oh wow cuz it's a massive cough suppressant Wow I that was one of the first parts I had to learn is how to react so Jen ate my lungs Wow yeah and and so when we we connect mind intention mm-hmm with heart yeah yeah hate love yeah with breath life yeah something happens in cross something happens yeah right that these practitioners figured out thousands of years ago yeah and have used for thousands of years yeah however someone like Joe Dispenza has dedicated his life to figuring this out Sam Harris these these individuals yeah I have all their books they have measured it and they have the monitoring it and they are sharing it that hey when you connect mine heart and breath yeah this is what happens yeah right incredible and you have all of a sudden these miracles mmm you know people wouldn't consider them to be miracles like it's incredible yeah it's it's I am one it's really awesome and and I I really do I'm very passionate about it I can tell very an incredible human who would have thought a watermelon dummy could bring cannabis I need him to be in watermelon and then I need him this is where he's gonna grow people sometimes ask me what's your purpose you know and it shifts shifts you know that that's I think I think that's a difficult question for a lot of people and I save quite a bit of time on it yeah and right now my purpose is to be here now right Rama das be here now yeah and because if I can be here now I can serve whatever purpose it is I need to serve right here and right now yeah right and I try and apply that because trying to figure out my life's purpose yeah can get overwhelming you know it's gonna change if I'm too tired if people that were in my life and circumstances or maybe I lose a family member and that purpose is gonna change yeah if my dad is sick then my purpose is to go take care of my dad my purposes right right but my purpose is to just be here now so gonna be a blank sheet like sheet of paper yeah you know and and that's that's the that's the karmic way of looking at it right is just to allow what's happening to happen right and yeah that's always been that's that's always been something that I've battled with people with and not like I don't say battle maybe because I don't argue about it but try and get people to talk about it and understand you know because I have friends and family that are like no like you just rainbows and butterflies you know this and that no and and it's like that's a component of it yeah you know I think it's a skill oh yeah yeah very much you know it's not that what's happening if something bad this Cove is happening right mmm-hmm you could perceive it one way I can perceive it the other mhm the same stuff is happening exactly sucks it does it's my choice to deal with it the way I deal with it yeah you know and and that's that like that's my purpose right now is to be here now I think you also have a purpose of helping people be wide awake yeah thank you very much and I'm just so honored that we've been able to spend this time it feels like it was like 20 minutes and yeah I think oh my gosh and I'm excited about opening up more topics but I want to make sure that people can find you we're gonna make sure we put links by the videos in the podcast episode they can find you as Instagram your favorite yes Instagram is my personal primary platform okay you can search Nadim al-haj I guarantee I'm probably the only one on there that'll pop up but it's a latin word called unit iose you have two stands for unity yeah and that's that is my instagram handles you nati yes i'm on facebook but instigated my main platform you can always check out bay crows calm yeah vapors are calm is our baby you can actually access our podcast from there as well yes know your dose yep so we talked about just our cannabis without it without knowing you don't it's really truly truly so you can hit the menu you can access that we also have know your dose podcast calm yeah look out for us and know your dose podcast is also on Instagram yes it is Instagram as well we have KYT podcasts and know your dose podcasts though yeah a couple different pages out there it's been amazing my friend you have how I felt they came for sharing your light your wisdom and knowledge and yeah thank you for watermelon come [Music]", "TdwTiUja3Ao": "[Music] alright guys so we are doing something fun today so we are going to do the chia seed pudding so obviously you guys can see I do have the chia seeds right there now have the link for that one down below along with a few other items that are right here in front of you so we're going to use obviously the chia seeds which is like no net carbs we're going to use some unsweetened vanilla almond breeze almond milk now that one for one cup it's no net carbs so that's the base for it I do have those for kind of like mason jars in the corner the link for those will be down below as well now the four mason jars are gonna do four different flavors obviously so the first flavor we're going to do is just like a little mixed berries I do have a frozen bag of mixed berries right there as you guys can see so we're going to do maybe just like a few maybe like two tablespoons of it and mix it the chia seed pudding and make that type of like fun flavor we're also going to do use some premier protein maybe a quarter cup mix with some of these delicious raspberries right here chopped up to do like a protein type of cheesy pudding with strawberry flavor and raspberry flavor you know what I mean for all the cheesy pudding I'm going to use a vanilla extract and the cinnamon so that's gonna go for all four of the flavors now the vanilla extract has zero net carbs so don't worry about that we're only gonna use a tablespoon anyways or a teaspoon sorry and for the cinnamon which is - it because it has no net carbs just to give it kind of like a flavory aroma so for the was it that the third flavor we're going to do a chocolate brownie chia seed pudding if you guys remember the keto brownie mix that I had I had some leftover brownies from last week so I just chopped up a very very tiny piece and I'm gonna add that into the chia seed pudding and make it kind of like a chocolate brownie type of mix I'm actually gonna go ahead and add some of that cacao powder as well too just to kind of give it more of a bold chocolate flavor now the fourth thing we're going to do is the peanut butter chocolate while almond butter chocolate so we're going to use the gel since almond butter I have a link for that down below as well and we're going to go ahead and top that off with some of the cacao powder to give you that chocolate peanut butter flavor so I'm super excited to do this guys I'm gonna do each of them separately and you guys will see how I mix everything together put them in the fridge and I'll do the final presentation tomorrow once everything settles and it's ready to go so [Music] we tell you guys in last week's video that I was jumping into my turf Aikido so this is the week that it's happening so for today's video guys I'm going to do a meal prep for modify Aikido so let me just kind of give you guys what my fight Kido means to me or I'd classify it as if you are regular q you want to say under-20 net carbs because that's the best way for you to lose weight rapidly and you know get it done so with modified keto I just bump it up to 50 to 100 but because I'm just starting in to modify keto I want to kind of dip like kind of go into like the 50 range so 15 net carbs is where I'm starting at right now and if actually once the summer time comes in I'll go to Lincoln Hunter net carbs as my total serving for the day now even though you're doing like a hundred net carbs or 50 net carbs if your calorie intake is still kind of like low enough you're still be able to lose a few pounds so it's all moderation so it's how you prepare the foods what you're preparing and you gotta keep that in mind when preparing keto meals in general so most of the time even if I do modify Kido I'm still able to lose weight because my calorie intake is usually kind of low so you gotta keep that in mind too so that's why it's always a factor of adding more facts adding more protein just to kind of balance you out and adding the carbs it's really important so when it comes to adding carbs in or I always look for the good carbs so for instance instead of rice today I'm doing quinoa quinoa is a good carbohydrate it has good fibers and it definitely works with the GI system so that's what we're gonna use when you're doing a research or you're looking for good carbs healthy carb and stuff like that you can find list of really good ones not low-carb ones but healthy good you know suitable carbs for the body quinoa over rice obviously they'd be better so we're going to do quinoa shrimp bowls and we're also going to do barbecue chicken with macaroni salad the noodles that I use are Keitel noodles I'll leave them down below honestly and truly I've made a lot of noodle recipes with these noodles and they've been the lifesaver and it is pricey you can even go on Amazon and buy a bundle pack for a little bit of the fraction of the price I'll leave an amazon link down below for you guys you guys want to order those noodles from Amazon same exact noodles but the company just outsource this to Amazon as well so you can go ahead and pick them off from Amazon which is cool so I'll leave a link down below for that along with the company's think if you want to order the bread and stuff like that but when I order from this company I usually just tend to order the noodles because the noodles are legit like a lifesaver so I also want to show you there's new barbecue sauce I did not create the barbecue sauce this time in this recipe I actually picked it up from Walmart for about $3 so I'll show you guys which BBQ sauce it is super keto so because I'm doing two meals you guys know I mix things in between so I did show you guys a chia seed pudding recipe today I did three flavors so it's really awesome so you guys will see that I'll kind of have that as a dessert mixed with like maybe yogurt one time that I also have a few like you know nuts it's something that I want like little mini snack but because I do intrument too fast and still on my fan keto i don't eat till like noon time anyway so by the time noon comes i'll probably have my macaroni sat on my wings first and then have a protein shake in the afternoon and then have my dinner which is the shrimp the quinoa shrimp bowl so I hope you guys like this one super flavorful low calories you know low carb and very tasty so my aim for this week with my meals is to stay under 50 net carbs and I think with the recipes that I created it's perfectly within like like a little below the 50 net carbs so that's great so that's let's alright guys so we're starting off with the wings first so I'm just gonna go ahead and drizzle some olive oil into the pan no you don't have to use water or anything like that because the wings will produce its own water I did not pre I didn't pre cook these I actually just seasoned them overnight so they're gonna be all oven base so when I first start off I put them on their back first guys just because it's easy that way and you don't want the skin to go ahead and get stuck down first now I did put my regular seasoning the only difference that I added this time I did actually season this overnight guys with the liquid smoke so the liquid smoke is actually in the marinade so that's gonna be extra Barbie he's gonna give you that extra kind of like barbecue style Flair and I'm telling you guys that liquid smoke is the business so like I said I'm putting these backs up just because I don't want the skin to stick right away well not even it right away just while that's cooking you want to make sure the skin gets firm upwards first and then once we start cooking we're gonna turn them on their backs and then start the process of adding the barbecue sauce to them so this is what it looks like guys originally this bottle is 12 wings in here I do have a little bit of a liquid smoke juices and all the like juices I'm just gonna put this on top of it like that and yeah so we're gonna put this under the oven we're gonna let it cook on one side for about 20 to 25 minutes we're gonna turn them for another like 20 to 25 minutes and then we're gonna base them for 10 myths on each side so processing time for these to be like really soft and good is about like 50 minutes I'm saying that because that's how I like my food I don't know how everybody else used to feel but that's how the way that's why I do it and if you ask anyone that eats my food bomb dot so what we're going to do now my friends is we're going to do broccoli so I have frozen broccoli that's a little bit damp because I did sweat it a little bit and I had it taken out earlier but we're going to do frozen broccoli so I'm going to use the entire bag obviously me and my honey-bunny are obviously we want to eat together so this is a frozen broccoli guys I'm just gonna take a just won't spread it out so it is frozen which is good because on parchment paper reason why I use parchment papers when you're going to do roasted broccoli it just makes it extra crispy so this broccoli actually came fresh and I froze it so I usually buy from Costco's or BJ's for about like six dollars and I freeze it so it's it's fresh frozen as you guys can see so I'm going to go ahead and use some Himalayan pink salt get it nice and matted with salt all on it hopefully I was like me slowing this down explaining it because it just makes it easier do not be afraid to use flavor please don't let people give you guys a misconception that you don't need to flavor your don cheadle okay we're gonna do some black okay so the next thing we're going to do is go ahead with some olive oil and I'm gonna just olive oil it up a little bit I'm only gonna use a little bit because I'm gonna use some sesame oil as well the sesame oil is gonna give it that flavor that I like now I did take the liquid smoke off just to show you guys I didn't show you guys last time so this is a liquid smoke I used as a base for the chicken as well so that's the liquid smoke just to show you guys I'm not putting it in here and want to grab it to show you guys so here goes the sesame oil I don't know I liked a little bit of like an Asian Flair even though my quinoa dish that I'm making is not Asian but you know just have that little flare just makes it taste so much better with this I'm also gonna go in with some soy sauce just I use a bottle cap to measure I'm just gonna use maybe two of the bottle cap it's tough it's kind of hard to measure it out look at I just made like a big triple right there but I'll mix everything ups in a minute so I'm gonna do that and then we aren't going to go in with some sesame seeds love sesame seeds so we're gonna go ahead and drizzle sesame seeds all over this will give the extra crunch like I'm telling you parchment paper trust me guys if you want to be like you know earth friendly I guess I guess paper is not friendly and but you know what I mean luminol for like really why am i eating food on luminol for aluminum is an element like I don't know I just run anywhere but whatever I'm not like one of those freaks whatever but yeah so this is it guys we're going to go ahead and roast this up and the chicken obviously already put in so it's gonna be different timing but this is gonna get really crispy trust me parchment paper makes a difference trust me on this one so that's alright guys so we are going to cook our quinoa in the rice cooker just because it makes it easier don't have to pay attention to it I did get the boil-in-the-bag one because reading a label on this one this one had the least amount on that carve to the serving like I said this one is a quarter cup serving is 20 net carbs so this had the least amount of neck carbs guys so I decide to pick this one out if you guys know another brand of quinoa that has less than 20 net carbs for the quarter cup serving please let your girl know but this one was the only one that had the least amount so I'm going to go ahead and use the serving bag it serves about eight so I don't know what does gonna come out too but I'm gonna make it like this I'm gonna do this I'm also going to use I wash these and took all the stuff off because you know how I call that starchy stuff so I have a cup a half a cup of the Goya organic kidney beans now I don't originally use canned because can it's not good for you but this is the organic version we read pretty clearly and fine so I just went ahead and took this one this one is the only can of beans that has the least amount of net carbs I don't really like these types of beans I like them but I prefer black beans but this had the least amount so I went for this one let me tell you guys something a few MS beans modifying it up don't want to overdo it I feel like the serving size of this you guys already know if this is gonna fluff up like crazy in the rice cooker so doesn't matter so I did go ahead and start it off with some olive oil I'm gonna bring the camera closer and show you guys everything I put in we're gonna let it cook alright guys so we're gonna start off with a little bit of this garlic paste right here so I'm just gonna grab a little bit just like that I do tell you to put olive oil in here already because I want it to be a little seasoned we're gonna go ahead and put some Himalayan salt and yours love to crush it up crush it up not sure the flavor profiles on the thing I'm pretty sure it's plain 1/2 we're gonna add some onion powder to it not too much not too crazy now I'm also going to use my Maggi seasoning you guys know that onion actually I did read up today I got the cubes instead so I'm finishing this one off there's not that much of somebody who's the rest of that we're done with that now we're gonna go in and just drop the beans like I said I only use a cup of these beans a cup is I believe like 14 net carbs and a little bit remaining a back with garlic paste so you still want to sound like a little bit of flavor we don't want to take flavor out you know like minimize the flavor profile so I would say to guys go ahead and put a Laver in it so there you're gonna get the beans coated cuz you know beans can be very nasty so coke beans to make sure your beans are coated nicely now we're gonna go ahead and with the bag I'm gonna go how to set the bag open its okay we're gonna go ahead and use this so this is one bag serving so I'm just gonna go ahead and pour this all up in here it looks just like chia seeds guys but they fluff up nicely and you're gonna get like a really good serving I'm gonna go ahead and add four four quarts of water which is equivalent to three cups and then we're gonna go ahead and close the top and let it cook for about like 15 minutes so let's go guys so there's a lot going on right now so the rice cooker is back here percolating that couscous so go ahead and do your thing so we're gonna leave that on cook so I have some water boiling right now cuz we're going to go ahead and cook our great low carb bread company there's about two and a half ounces of the noodles I'm probably just gonna make it a full three whatever my boyfriend so I'm gonna eat some it looks like it's not a lot but they fluff up to be really big so I'll probably just keep it at the two and a half ounces or just make it three ounces make sure you read the serving size to know how many net carbs you're using everything's on the back of the packaging so read your labels so I'm going to just add a little bit of chicken broth and there's well too no fancy chicken broth I got this on sale that's Evan Farms chicken broth ready to serve so I'm gonna add this to here I'm not gonna put any I might put a little bit firmly in salt but just to give the flavor flavor profile then noodles to touch a little bit of flavor I add that in there and we're gonna drop the noodles in there I'm actually gonna add a little bit of olive oil so that they don't stick together and get all gummy so there you go so the next thing we're gonna do right here guys is we are going to and fry our ribbies so I do have some shrimp that I put like some nice regular seasoning black pepper salt garlic onion powder I did use some Cajun seasoning the occasional seasoning that I use is the Louisiana little Louisiana Cajun seasoning I'm just gonna more of that to the top doesn't really have too much of a soft Bazemore has like that Cajun kick to it so we're gonna go ahead and airfryer these for the quinoa bowls so you guys can see how that works out so we're going to go ahead and air fry these up and meals almost repaired guys [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] alright guys so this is my modified keto meal prep I hope you guys enjoyed this video so I showed you guys all the details on how I made the macaroni salad the barbeque chicken I did the shrimp roasted broccoli in quinoa with red kidney beans so everything is proportion and measured out so everything is within the keto you know spectrum obviously I'm doing modified keto so I'm adding a little bit more carbs so like 50 grams to 100 grams carbs per day so I do have some nice keto friendly snacks as well as well so you kind of stay within the realm of keto the only thing here that's a big carb is the dinner bowl right here which you guys seen so I obviously have four bowls I'm missing one the serving size that I use for this one only made four servings I have a quarter cup so I did have some leftover mac and cheese from the weekend I told you guys Akito all took all the time so I made a kilo mac and cheese a cauliflower keto mac and cheese so I have that with two more wings so one day I'll have two servings of wings but that's fine because if you guys know me I love chicken wings so that'll be one of the fifth servings plus I have five of the pasta salad with the wings the pasta style is actually really really delicious guys no lie I think that this one actually came out good I did not even need to use the tuna fish that I used in last recipe if you only have a few items in your house this is going to work perfect it came out super good so I do have some cashews as well so these are the hundred calorie packs it's about like four three net carbs per pack just like a little bit of a boost if you want something crunchy I usually get these I got this at Target the pack was like I believe four dollars for seven I figured the smart treats I favor the petering so I went to Whole Foods just down got about like ten of these I got four peach rings to afford the sour and two of the fish so these are bomb I'm only going to add like two into the week sometimes only eat one so I'm just putting in there as an option my chia seed pudding guys came out pretty good so the top ones are like the berry flavors and the bottom are like the chocolate makes flavors they actually came out good I tried the one with the brownie mix and the brownie mix tastes good then one with the peanut butter I have to tweak it a little bit just because you're not getting the almond butter you no rush which I really wanted but that's fine the berry ones taste good is berry and the one that has a protein shake in it you can actually taste it so that's great so I did go ahead and order some new premier protein I am going to be doing an Amazon haul so um ooh lost my breath so wait for that Amazon haul so I could show you guys what I shop my monthly Amazon shop pantry and everything so stay tuned for that so I got these I just added three in the in here just because I'm on the go for two days out of the week and the other two days I'm kind of like scattered around so I put three just in case I'll do like three a week or two a week nothing more than that because it's not something you want to kind of you know drink all the time it's a supplement so it supplements if I'm like at school or about clinical and I'm just sitting on my feet all day I do have two of the two good yogurts here one blueberry and one strawberry just in case I don't want one of these chia seed pudding I can just replace it with this one and I like it plain and goes well with your vitamins to it especially if you take those really big vitamin pills go ahead and scoop it in with the yogurt coz those pills are hard to take so that's basically it guys I hope you guys enjoy this everything is super delicious do not forget when you're on keto to make sure you flavor your food I feel like that's the issue with people when it comes to keto they're not staying consistent because they get so bored of the food and the ends of just going on ordering takeout I'm telling you guys right now the recipes aren't point everything's flavored and tasty and obviously guys can see right here it's alright guys that wraps up today's video hope you guys enjoyed my modify taquito meal prep today I will do another one of these next week and try

episode of week's the review show where we review marijuana edibles helping you make informed decisions have a dispensary closest to you well we are back with a nother Buddhist best animals one of my favorite companies we've reviewed a couple their products so far and have found them all to be uniformly excellent so I'm really looking forward to the Buddha's best 300 milligram peppermint delight cookie we've looked in the past at the chocolate raspberry brownie and the chocolate ecstasy lovers something-something cookie I believe I think I don't know all these names sort of blur together after a while but all I know is I would be good as best that I've had in the past sort of highest recommendation I'm not a huge fan of peppermint flavor so I'm gonna be intrigued to see how this bad boy tastes now again this is a 300 milligram edible they say it is supposed to be divided into six servings and like all Buddha's best like we're I guess like the other ones there are nutrition facts on the back which is again a rarity among edibles pretty cool so 372 calories in this bad boy but I'm gonna eat the whole mofo myself has a very strong peppermint flavor almost medicinal in its peppermint flavor like it almost was like medicine there's so much I guess because they use it as a as an extract but boy it isn't a strong peppermint motor okay one we're sorry thanks lucky to do okay it's a very pretty looking cookie as you can see got a little gummy here on the start the center just got these little peppermint white pepper mint chips in there and just knew that script lovely pink icing so it's a handsome-looking cookie but I won the first thing is I wish I was more I'm these are you designed to be refrigerated I wish it were warm it feels very very tough it's not a it's not a very moist cookie it feels like it should be moist but it's not because it's cold um and I am NOT a fan of peppery flavor and this is aggressively peppermint there's government icing peppermint chips um to be honest it tastes a little bit like eating toothpaste so this is the first one as best that I am NOT like the taste which is disappointing but I'm still hoping like all the other Buddha's best it's going to more than you live on value because this bad boy only cost me ten bucks so as with always I'm gonna check back with you guys in another half hour another half hour I've got the 60 minute mark and one more hour after that at the 120 minute mark and let you know how we're feeling there thanks okay guys whoops I'm here at the 30 minute mark with the Buddha's best peppermint Delight cookie and I'm feeling pretty good already to be honest like all Buddha's best it seems to be a hell of a good deal and for only being a half-hour after consume I'm feeling pretty stoned already one caveat however that cookie does not taste good that tastes pretty gross in fact maybe one or two bites of it would be okay and maybe if you're a peppermint fetishist it would be okay otherwise it is 600,000 percent too much peppermint for any one human being maybe they could have just had one level of peppermint instead of three that being said if you love peppermint or if you're planning on splitting that bad boy up against with a bunch of people you might so enjoy it but I will check back with you guys in another half hour as we always do on wheats and we will see you then thanks for watching welcome back two weeks guys we are one hour in after consuming the Buddha's best peppermint Delight cookie and I am feeling pretty [ __ ] high right now I'm glad I'm glad I'm feeling that way because I'm still thinking about how gross that cookie tasted now let me let me rephrase that cookie did not taste like wheat in any way shape or form that is not why that cookie tastes bad that cookie does not taste like weed it tastes just like peppermint and just like too much peppermint did I get my point across not we peppermint still bad but it'll get you [ __ ] up so with that being said I'll check back with you guys in one more hour if you have the two hour mark thanks for watching okay guys last time I'm going to be checking in here this is the review of the Buddha's best edibles peppermint delight cookie man I am pretty [ __ ] bummed right now to be honest well it's been two hours and the high is still coming on definitely not yet Pete so for 10 bucks what I got this for in Orange County is an incredible deal the only problem is is it tastes like garbage sorry I know each time I say it tastes worse than the last time but that's how I feel nothing so good in the stomach again not only tastes just sickly sickly sweet with peppermint but incredibly powerful and I can compute as bests other products that I've tried they're my highest recommendation in terms of taste and and potency so with that being said thank you guys so much for watching weeks and we'll catch you in the next review", "f1iOUfItHPg": "found this one while cruising Pinterest for some Easter ideas Cadbury Creme Egg brownie bombs hello everyone the first thing you're gonna need is a brownie recipe now you can use up from scratch recipe or you can use like I'm doing in this case a brownie mix I had a couple in the cupboards that I wanted to use up and I prepared them according to package directions and I made enough to make a brownie that was a 9 by 13 inch size you don't have to make this big you can make it whatever size you want depending on how many brownie bombs you want to end up with now what I think is a good idea is to line your pan with some parchment paper and grease it with some cooking spray or butter and then bake your brownies and once they're cool it's very easy to remove them from the pan for cutting so bake your brownies let them cool completely and then when I suggest you do is you cut the crusts off because the crusts have a tendency to be a little bit hard and maybe difficult for the next part of the recipe so I cut them off and save them for snacking for later then you're gonna cut your brownies into small squares approximately 1 inch by 1 inch or so and a typical large size brownie you may probably will end up with about two to two and a half a dozen little brownie bombs now these are what I use these are the Cadbury cream eggs the miniature ones so what you do is take one of those brownie squares flatten it between your fingers place the little egg in the middle of it and then wrap the brownie around it and then just gently squeeze and mold the brownie piece around the chocolate egg until it's as smooth as you can get it and you get an egg shape I also tried these with the Cadbury caramilk eggs as well as the cream eggs then once you're done pop these in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes just to chill them and if you're wondering that very large one I actually did a full size a Cadbury Creme Egg instead of the mini ones just for fun so let them chill a little bit and then you're gonna melt some white chocolate or white candy melts then just drop your eggs in there and I found that using a spoon and a fork work well for this coat it and then you're gonna let some of that excess drip off and I just find that transferring it from utensil to utensil helps get rid of the excess and then place it on a piece of waxed paper and thence while that coating is still not solid sprinkle on some Easter coloured sprinkles pop them in the refrigerator to harden completely in you are done now the bottom of these will have a little kind of bald spot where you might see the brownie showing through if this bothers you all you have to do is turn it over and add some more of the white coating to the little spot but most of the time they're in a basket just like this with the bottom facing down it doesn't really matter they look really cute they look like little white eggs and when you cut them in half you get to see the little cream egg that starts to ooze out when you bite into it and here is the care milk one that I tried these are also very good so it makes a really cute little Easter dessert and it's not really all that difficult to make check out my Easter playlist for more great recipe ideas like these tie-dye cakes that are baked right inside of a real egg shell I have some coconut cream eggs and some peanut butter eggs if you want to see any of these recipes go ahead and click right on your screen or look for the link in the description box below for my Easter playlist thanks so much for watching bye bye", "YgUSIAe84sA": "life city family what is up it is our

good and a pinch of salt the best hot cocoa that's paleo you can make catch up on a few comments here we got uh brad parham art did you see my pre-comment that you look like van montgomery from the tv show riva saw that i've never tuned into reba montgomery is so that one went over my head here uh we have let's see where is he where is he dee brown dirk is in the house go brewers of course we're going to put the game on at six o'clock muay moy tuli minute okay come over here let's make our spice rub so i already have out cumin smoked paprika chili powder ancho chili powder i want to get a little more spice in there all right how'd you like cayenne pepper i like the sound of that and then let's put a little bit of oregano in there now let's throw a funky kind of thing i wish i had like mexican oregano i don't have that what's the difference uh it's actually a completely different uh leaf it's not even a different flavor profile yes different flavor profile let's go is it more complex or is it just different i think it's different let's go to coriander different in a good way not in a bad way so that'll be it for our spice rub remember arby's used to have that commercial same same same our bees is different i do remember that now it's what arby's we have we have the meats i actually got so sick one time from arby's when i was a kid i had a beef and cheddar sandwich and i puked everywhere sure people want to know right and because of that i never had it again and probably a good thing because it's not actually real beef there it's like beef with probably soy protein and congealers the sad part of the story is it was probably something completely unrelated to arby's and made you know you held it against arby's uh american food chain since 1967 they've been around a while no my brother used to take me there for the beef and cheddars and i just hurled one day so this is going to be our lovely little spicy smoky earthy aromatic spice rub and if you notice i'm putting chili powder and ancho chili it's two completely different kinds of chili when you see a chili powder like this art this is a blend of many different kinds of chili but when you get ancho chili that's one specific chili it's this it's the poblano chili that's been dried see this is chili with an eye this really should be e at the end that's true chile that's a good point and then i'm gonna put some kumino in there the second most popular spice in the world which you guys all know coriander's are really great aroma get in a milwaukee brewer breathing nerd i'm smell that it almost smells like toasted orange peel it's very very lovely and i always put less of that than i do uh cumin oh that's compromised our friend uh tully from finland was saying donations are not possible from finland unfortunately all good thank you so much and uh tyler hey bobby i've been gaining so much weight throughout quarantine lately i really need to lose as much as i can any advice dude if you want to lose weight on the hurry go keto work out in addition to that you cannot help but lose weight especially initially with keto because you're going low carb you're going moderate fat not high fat you're cutting out inflammatory bloating foods and carbs you can't have carbs with fat because that spikes your blood sugar that makes you fat and slows down the digestion that's how you do it bro just do keto if you need recipes go to flavorcity.com or get our cookbook and you're good to go let me go totally good to go so this is our spice rub we got a new a new subscriber here named muppets in oh i like that you have to throw that out there because we quote barry manilow all the time and we eventually bring up the muppets my girl sarah says i don't love smokey flavors that much is a poblano pepper smoky nope a poblano pepper is actually like a spicy green pepper and i'd say slightly spicy it's actually nice to use in place of green pepper sometimes because it has more it has more character more funk a green pepper doesn't have too much flavor so i'm going to let this marinate you can actually do this like hours and hours ahead of time we'll just do it probably for 30 minutes but um it's gonna be great because we'll get a hot grill we'll sear that into the crust of course i'm using organic boneless skinless chicken thighs one of my favorite cuts because yeah you could do this with chicken breast chicken breasts are just so darling you guys i don't know the infatuation with people with chicken breasts and i actually heard staying ma'am anyone watching in texas i actually heard that in texas chicken thighs are more expensive because y'all are so smart down in texas you know that thighs are where it's at it's all about supply and demand economics 101 but up here in chicago and i think most cities chicken breasts are more expensive because that's every what everyone wants but let me know i don't know maybe i'm wrong maybe when your hands are clean you can click the link that gochujang sent uh he said click on it but i don't want to you know screw up the line sure sure uh we got a super chat while you're doing that michael p just sent a 4.99er baseball on tv flav city on the phone happy friday all let's go mets let's go burritos uh skip smith i've been to the shedd aquarium probably many times bobby you ever been to shutterstock really yeah i've never been to the chef oh my gosh i just subscribed to hulu live tv i'm actually i just canceled my youtube live tv because starting in august they're raising the price from five dollars a month to seventy dollars a month and they don't get the uh cubs network called marquis whereas hulu gets all the channels i liked on youtube tv plus marquee and it's 55 a month hey i'm all about saving money and watching the cubs right jen h just came in with a canadian super chat five dollars thank you my dear i appreciate that okay so we'll just take this lovely marinade let it sit here do its thing actually i want to flip that over and get some more oil on the other side much love from area 51. is that don chopsky jill chopsky from michigan in the house jill will be here next weekend i'll most likely see her and hopefully maddie okay so if you're just joining we're in the very early process it's opening day we're we're in the we're in the middle of the first inning right got a couple batters there's a no-hitter going right now that's the first inning don't get too excited glastonbury get excited because is in the house and we're doing um we're doing chicken burritos so we're doing grilled chicken burritos with low carb cilantro and lime cauliflower rice and then a bunch of condimentos condimentos muy fresco fruits in spanish someone will tell me we're making a homemade guacamole we're making a homemade roasted and grilled tomato salsa with uh peppers and uh garlic and fruit thank you and we're making a crema a roasted poblano crema so i'm going to take this poblano pepper right here i'm going to put it directly on my heat back here i'm going to start preheating this pan for the cauliflower rice adrian i can't go outside yet cause uh rose is sleeping in the back well we got a super chat from uh 1x jericho's one 499. jerry from the new jersey shore thing jersey shores thank you love you all appreciate that thank you vivian that's rocking it off in new york are you using so this is what we're using vic check it out these are the new siente paleo burritos big and beautiful instead of using wheat which is made of gluten which is inflammatory and oftentimes made with uh sprayed with roundup these are made with cassava flour now i lost the ingredients ingredients to your left to my left cassava flour coconut flour coconut sugar this is what you want and also keep in mind a traditional tortilla that's made with wheat not only is it enriched wheat that has all the good stuff stripped away all conventional wheat all conventional oats are sprayed with roundup why do they do that because it's a desiccant it's a drying agent so at the end of the harvesting process or the growing process they spray it so it dries muy rapido very quickly so they can harvest that's bogus man because they're introducing roundup and glyphosates to all the wheat-based products and all the oat based products at the store so unless you buy organic you can't avoid those glyphosates it's totally criminal i hate that with a passion okay let's put these spices back and then we'll get going on the cilantro and lime cauliflower rice raise your hand if you're confident raise your hand if you're sure if you can't have cilantro meaning it tastes like soap to you there should be about 20 of people raising their hands right now and it's not your fault it's because you actually have a genetic disposition to not liking uh the cilantro and having it taste like soap so if you don't like that big deal you just use like uh breathing nerds one of those by the way no worries don't worry about it it's all good but treat your cilantro just like you do my parsley hack keep it in the jug slice the bottom off put the plastic over the top um so cilantro lime cauliflower rice um i have some frozen and thawed cauliflower rice i just thought it'd be easy to use because i have it in the freezer but we have to squeeze out a lot of that moisture before we get into the pan first i like to saute just a little bit of onions and garlic before i uh get the cauliflower rice in there no do the people who hate cilantro also hate coriander um i don't know because coriander is a whole different flavor i think so coriander that i use in my spice rub is actually the seed of cilantro bobby bobby stop what you're doing yes stop what you're doing stop what you're doing collaborate and listen randy ippolito 400 what the fudge are you randy holy cow randy ippolito that's insane we've never seen that before dude randy dude that is so thank you you guys are super supportive so

i'm going to send you a signed copy of this cook book right here art and i will sign it and then when the new one comes out i'll send you that one too how about that deal that'll be the most expensive sign cookbook we've ever done but yeah bobby at flamecity.com please do it randy sometimes things go to my junk email but i'll check it for sure brandon asked me this question but do you want to answer it why don't you use your redmond real salt anymore great question the reason i don't use my redmond real salt is because even though it's high quality salt it's very chunky mineral based salt and it grits your teeth i didn't mind it that much but desi was driving her crazy small season pasta water with it or certain food and you'll actually be grinding on the minerals so desi didn't like it so i switched to be honest though i do like this better this is celtic sea salt i do a whole spiel about them in a new book because it's one of my pantry staples i say have celtic sea salt have himalayan pink salt this kind of salt will change your cooking game because number one it has essential minerals that are normally bleached out of typical salt but the flavor profile is really complex and doesn't spike your blood pressure as much because it doesn't have all the minerals bleached so it's better for you and better get the gourmet kosher salt it's amazing stuff because kosher means the size of the salt crystal kosher is a certain size that makes it easy to pinch it won't leak through your fingers like sandwich or fine salt will uh tyler gave us a 4.99 super chat bobby is there any bobby approved wheat bread i can buy yes the only body approved ones are organic sprouted wheat breads so silver hills makes a great one and ezekiel obviously makes a great one too courtney i suppose i'll give you a ten dollar super chat courtney diaz gracias okay let's also chop a little bit of garlic so the reason why i'm using frozen and thawed cauliflower rice tonight is because i had it in my freezer i want to use it and um the key is also squeezing out a lot of that moisture so when you get frozen cauliflower rice here's what happened art go selfie style say hello everyone and explain to people what happens when you freeze something like cauliflower hello everyone uh when you uh freeze cauliflower or pretty much any vegetable mr gorbachev tears down those cell walls and uh you release a lot of water in the process exactly um so that's the answer that question there i just saw some stuff coming in super chat's there yeah we got uh karuna rose ten dollars with the superman pair thank you for that i love that uh superman thank you so much my girlfriend five dollars a home cook should i start a youtube cooking show yes totally do that that's the fact that you're a ginger and like totally go about that say you're the dorky ginger i would something like that yeah that'd be so smart gochujang uh you can find those breads frozen but the ezekiel i've also you can get it non-frozen yes you can get it in other places but yeah um for sure and then uh let's see milwaukee brewer five dollars i believe you once mentioned that allelos is cool what are the benefits of using it any drawbacks or cautions uh yeah i'm do it cool with that i've actually never used it the main benefit of that milwaukee brewer by the way uh yes they do get camouflaged the redmond real salt in the brownies the main benefit is that it's um it's a liquid so it's a liquid paleo keto sweetener there really is no drawback to be honest so i would go with that for sure i just generally generally like my monk fruit sweetener and another super chat here delisha renee five dollars first time catching a live stream wow thank you you guys do amazing work look forward to all of your content so glad you're finding us thanks for that donation thank you so much nathan wanted me to tell you that they tried his moroccan chicken recipe with cauliflower rice and loved it so much that they bought the cookbook that's what i love to hear it's probably not probably it is my favorite recipe in the cookbook so this happy friday to you jackie yes let me check what's going on oh wow this poblano is looking amazing char troyer in the house char from missionary so here's the cookbook the original one and the very first recipe in the chicken chapter called winner winner chicken dinner is this it's my moroccan chicken stew with golden cauliflower rice i think this sets the tone for the savory recipes in the cookbook because when you think keto you might think oh it's just a high fat diet with no flavor this is the opposite it's moderate fat very low carb look at this moroccan spice crusted chicken thighs seared and basically braised in a broth that has lemons chilies and olives and served with turmeric stained cauliflower rice with cashews shredded coconut and herbs amazing stuff the new cookbook also will have pictures with everything tons of shopping tips and macros with every recipe i'm very very excited to share that with you so thank you guys um if you want the cookbook it's in my amazon shop link right under the thrive link in the description box check it out and a bunch of you guys reviewed the cookbook the last few days thank you so much if you haven't had a chance to review it yet but you bought the cookbook please leave a review on amazon those are greatly appreciated a little bit of keto or rose it's friday y'all all right oh okay so uh gochujang sent you the van montgomery pick to your email oh already sent me the van montgomery pick okay uh check that mike dussy has a computer now but i only have the uh super chat here rachel mcginn 9.99 thank you rachel wait she has a new name too i don't recognize that thank you cheers to uh jill chomsky i mean the paleo chocolate chip cookies and they're amazing i'd love to hear that nets are winning the world series this year i don't know about that how old is that wooden spoon you use all the time to be honest it's only probably two years old and you can season it with a mineral oil because it's olive wood chris we need a shout out for chris christie watching it welcome chris chris a friend of skip smith welcome everyone so i said if you're using frozen cauliflower rice come here alright you gotta squeeze you gotta push it apparently today is national tequila day according to felicia and she's asking why we're not doing margaret are you serious that's a margarita told us wow sorry felicia lucy i had no idea um i think we're out of tequila to be honest which is criminal so here's my frozen and thawed and i just got to squeeze out the leftover water see there's a lot in here guys buy the five pound organic bag of frozen cabbage flour rice at costco it is probably the best deal ever i generally don't make cauliflower rice like pilaf and fried rice with it because it's a little mushy but for making keto tots and cauliflower crust we have a great five ingredient cauliflower crust recipe in the new cookbook it's really good for that we got a super chat from richard marcotte watching in the north side of the dfw metroplex 499 my weekly check in with the flav city home office go dodgers we're always here homie dodgers are strong dodgers are strong are they fierce they might be fierce to be honest oh we got uh char troyer with a 1999 super chat and an encouragement to enjoy the weekend thank you thank you sure now this batch i already squeezed out the moisture because we had it left over from a cookbook testing for the uh for the uh pizza now when you actually squeeze the water out it really reduces greatly because these vegetables are mostly water away so that's going in now i'm gonna season it with a good pinch of salt and pepper and let it warm up does that cauliflower ice have a funk no because it's uh fresh and frozen it's not the bagged ones that are shelf stable those are disgusting i got that shelf stable cauliflower rice from uh costco it was rinsed 114 mexican people joe jalapeno hi bobby keep being eerie sending you five usd and a question spotted a vegan collagen that says 94 silica something what would the other six percent be other brands less melted extra and this one cleanest uh interesting well it could be silicon dioxide which is actually sand uh the only vegan uh bobby approved one i know about is made by sun warrior uh let me know what that one is joey and thank you so now that's in the pan but it's bland it's bland as can be so a good pinch of unrefined celtic sea salt goes in there mrs bs new cookbook on december 1st december 1st pre-orders before that you guys will be the first to know we have to turn in the manuscript and everything on uh august 15th i spent a good time yesterday writing uh the introduction and stuff like that but i mean i'm really really excited the introduction something like you know i can't tell you how many times i'm in the grocery store and i see people staring at the wall of pastas or oils or sauces and not knowing what to get and i say this book is for you because not only will you learn everything you need to know to be an expert shopper and buy the best ingredients you're going to learn easy five ingredient recipes that are healthy delicious that anyone can make who doesn't want to do that there's really no book on the market that teaches you both super stoked about it green onions wants to know is poblano crema spicy sour cream um yes that's exactly what it's going to be but it's not too spicy because i'm going to blend that poblano up with this check this out you guys carolina venegas with a super chat 10 sending love from va thank you carolina thank you i'm going to blend up with sour cream but i'm using vegan plant-based sour cream this is cashew based really really tasty stuff i'm going to blend it with this i'm going to peel the poblano i'm going to add a little bit of cilantro salt and pepper maybe a squeeze of lime juice and that's it no moss all right check out what's happening to our chicken it's marinating very lovely and uh while i show that i'll tell you that susan creadure gave you a 4.99 super chat pulled pork tonight opening day have you watched nadia hussein on netflix her hacks are epic i don't know her hacks too much but yes i've watched her i love her show she's so personable and her recipes are really good i mean her recipes aren't something i would eat necessarily because they're not gluten-free dairy-free paleo or a keto but she's great she has such a great personality correct me or wrong she was the winner of the great british bake off then she baked the cake for the queen of england super cool yeah sheila i lived in tyler and i never went to athens but i drove through athens on the way to the airport sometimes now if you're going to make cilantro lime cauliflower rice you better make it super cilantro and super limey i'm gonna grab a big handful of cilantro maybe more if you hate cilantro this is a nightmare for you i would just use parsley this is what i do on art with all herbs i grab them like this and i roll them really tight not too tight not too tight like the magic pan crepery on seinfeld wow super chat city oh my gosh antoinette jones 9.99 i finally made it today's live streaming just bought ingredients for my paleo chocolate chip cookies i can't wait to try them i think this might be one of the popular most popular recipes in the new cookbook um i hope you guys uh have the measurements from that last live stream we did very exciting and i posted last night on my instagram story the final recipe for the uh wild mushroom and kale ragu pasta also go to my instagram story before it disappears in about play two hours and then i need lime i hear rose the roaster is up then i'm gonna just zest let's get the green zester for this i'll just zest it directly in the cilantro some would say you're obsessed with zest somebody say that i would agree 100 we'll use the zest and the juice it's a great way to get the bang out of the entire do you like the juice you know i like the juicer and i really like the juice i like all juices and i like this juice a lot so that'll be good and then we'll juice this for juicing a lime we need to get the appropriate color coated lime yeah get out the grapefruit juicer all right let's take a little break here cheers fridays with flav rose all day we got thrive market sponsor with the promo link in the description box if you're just joining please leave a comment down below let us know where you're watching from we got chicken marinading we're going to make grilled chicken burritos with cilantro lime cauliflower rice guacamole roasted tomato salsa and a roasted poblano crema dipping sauce it's going to be awesome we got our paleo siete burrito wraps here meaning grain free no flour all good stuff we got our chicken marinating in uh a really nice uh marinade right there look at those heirloom those beautiful heirloom tomatoes there those are great yeah all right roaster is up i'm under orders to make her a snack i got this i got a beautiful white nectarine organic white nectarine should i peel it for her peel it for rose i'm going to give her that and some plant-based yogurt viviana has a question would organic vanilla flavor be bobby approved it's an ingredient in my collagen powder yeah it is not unfortunately a lot of those collagen powders except for layered superfood which is a plant-based creamer have them the only time something like an organic flavor would be approved is when it's in like a really cool keto or sugar-free product that has no sugar instead has monk fruit and has a little bit of natural flavor but so many of those keto creamers have natural flavor i'm going to combine a couple questions yes please separate people but uh you'll see why what are your thoughts on the ezekiel burger buns and then somebody said uh any bobby approved hot dog buns yes so great great combination art yes ezekiel and i think silver hill they both make sprouted anytime you can find a sprouted bun that's going to be preferable because it's made with organic sprouted grains that are easy to digest and has the most nutrition for your body and it's not easy to find per se whole foods has them i don't know if thrive market has them but yeah you really want to sprout it it's very hard to uh peel this with a peeler what do you think about the simple mills almond flour pancake and mix the mix is that what you said yeah almond flour pancake and mix yeah i just i just talked about it in today's uh sugar-free video coming out on sunday it's really good stuff it's made with coconut sugar is there a pitter patter over here hello rose honey come here you how many are you a little mrs maneuver hey how was your nap my love wow here she is hey hope we don't wake you up hi everyone can we say hi hi yeah uh even the almond flour crunchy cookies are good quality from uh simple meals just avoid any of those uh pre-made cookies that have a palm shortening in there just make sure it's coconut oil uh whoever just asked about the carbs and the burritos 30 net carbs yeah they're not low carb but they're paleo microplanar be sharpened i don't think so i've actually take a lot of work yep each individual tine or whatever it's called kelly weinstein fridays with flav is one of my favorite shows to watch excited about burritos thank you cal i really appreciate that thanks for the burritos what's happening here because i rung out all the moisture the cauliflower is cooking and it's not getting soggy check this out sometimes you make cauliflower rice especially from frozen and there's a pool of water ain't none of that in here at all so what i'm going to do is check it for seasoning primarily just for salt and then dump in all that cilantro lime juice and lime zest richard microplane is a brand name uh it's a microplane there's my sister there's my bouquet yeah it's a zester microplaner invented microplanes dusters uh alice white 10. thank you bobby art and dusty for all your hard work and making videos and for allowing rose to make us smile you guys are the best alaska oh thank you for that very sweet cheers very very sweet all right all right you need some nectarines and you need some yogurt right so all right switch with me is the dave's bread still bobby approved it's not because there's too much sugar in there i really went back to look at it there's five grams of added sugar per slice it's astronomical everything else is good in there it's organic it's not sprouted but it's organic and whole grain but that amount of sugar is wrong gochujang uh asks if that's a haircut that he sees on bobby's head yes i got a haircut on uh on wednesday much needed clean up the old dew sarah windmiller still considers 30 grams of carbs to be low carb um for a burrito it might absolutely i don't know of any keto burrito wraps i know if keto um taco tortillas actually a great one is from this company called from almond with love have a hard time finding them now they were in production before kovid another one would be the only store-bought one that is really bobby approved is a lot tortilla factory low-carb because they don't use junky oils hold on a second sweetie whoa i don't throw on the floor that's good stuff yeah somebody said pull up her sleeves daddy here you go sister okay so we got this look gross mmm that's like sugar that's like oh man those white nectarines you guys are so tasty hold on what's that best parmesan cheese brand please i mean

lime it's all cooking together we're getting a little bit of color and living color on that uh rice but i want it to be on the acidic side so my guess is i'll need more lime juice and i actually want more cilantro in there what do you think of the parmesan cheese from aldi isn't it good you know what i've tried it it's okay i don't think it's uh parmesan i don't think i think it was american yeah

by the way that chipotle is gonna get low-carb cauliflower rice i think it's way overdue but i'm excited i think it's like an extra buff 50 or two bucks i'd get that all day because now i can get a keto burrito bowl instead of getting that paleo salad bowl that has the greens i can get a nice base of low-carb cauliflower rice which i'm stoked about so bobby do you want good news or bad news first oh gave me the good news this is coming from our dfw correspondent richard marcotte which one good or bad good uh bill and ted 3 will be on video on demand on september 1st okay bad news is top gun is delayed until july 2021 wow interesting uh art can you help with this query probably not but i'll ask bobby is all grass-fed milk does all grass-fed milk only have the a2 protein um it no there is no grass-fed a2 that i know about unfortunately it's even hard to find organically too oh you want you think that's the uh yogurt here i got your girlfriend i got you i even heard like uh that top gun movie was coming under criticism because they were like changing his jacket and like doing things that weren't uh offensive to china or whatever it's like come on what's his name in the movie oh maverick come back come on maverick lieutenant pete mitchell well actually he's probably more than lieutenant now uh because i'm not gonna ruin anything i don't know anything about the little anyways i'm not gonna speculate maggie be in the house maggie in the house let's see uh no so the best milk in general is 100 grass-fed whole milk 8-2 you'd have to get organic at the least they don't have that so i would get a whole milk either from maple hill or from organic valley a lot of people like to get fat and reduce fat or no fat milk it's a big mistake because in the fat there's the omega-3 fatty acids and the conjugate of the noic acids you don't want to miss out on that chandra says grilling the avocado adds a nice flavor um you know what i feel like it doesn't do anything but let's do it i got the girl fired up check this out come over this is garbage cam art check this out so i have my beautiful poblano pepper here i really really chart it over the uh burner directly then i put it into a ziplock bag to get all of the skin off the skin separates from the fruit from the flesh i hear you mama this is abuela style there's so much sabor so much flavor in here now it's crazy so i'll take this it's okay for a little bit viviana has the pithiest question you will be asked the whole day okay viviana what's up between art and bobby who would be bill and who would be ted uh which one is keanu reeves he's ted he's ted i don't even know how that question is which one's dumber what does that mean who's the dumber one well i'm going to say shotgun that's me who's the least dumb that's funny so this is gonna be a really cool dairy-free sauce we have the cashew based sour cream cilantro salt pepper and the poblano roasted pepper in there to buff it up this is something i wish they had at like chipotle moe's welcome my mom that sounds horrible [Music] i should save those uh tips there what is your favorite thing to eat me yeah favorite thing to eat you know what it's so i'm so like in the now whatever i'm making now is literally my favorite thing i can't say like pizza is my favorite thing i can't answer that i know everyone always asks me what's your favorite i don't know i don't know what my favorite thing is art this is my favorite check it out look at the color this is damon wayne's a living color right here beautiful you won't even know you won't even care that's dairy-free the question is we gotta check for seasoning actually we're just calling him ted but really it's ted theodore logan and bill s preston esquire delayed spice that's delicious it does need some acid i wasn't sure we'll throw some acid ooh lovely imagine drizzling that all over our grilled chicken burrito i think that's going to happen yeah imagine it's going to happen in 25-30 minutes so a little bit of lime juice a little more celtic sea salt we'll blend it up the flavor of the cooling of the sour cream the fresh cilantro in that roasty toasty poblano karise said uh ordered a keto bowl from chipotle today for my birthday treat and they had cauliflower rice was excited to see that they had it already wowzers rose let's say hi to everyone we have 1300 people watching hi everyone hi can we say hi yeah richard uh expanded on what you said the movie studio changed the original patch on the jacket that was considered pro taiwan to make something more better hey rosa say hi

milk containers before loading them into the fridge my parents always did it and the instructions from my fridge tell me to do it your fridge told you to do it milk containers like the plastic ones from the grocery store i don't know we're talking about the old school like glass ones and the guy used to drop off i don't know those were the good old days when the milkman would drop off milk every

oh we can if you want whatever you want i don't know uh i'm going to assemble the burritos in here it's just easier for me so yeah yeah let me invite it this thing is so good i got a 400 super chat yeah i heard that but it was kind of a it's a mistake kind of a mistake it was a fat finger he's getting a signed cookbook dog yeah randy's getting a signed cookbook maybe a couple yeah art needs to check out the wang chung video everybody stays safe tonight it's not too hot here it's a beautiful day not too bad let's see here that's right i was supposed to mix the uh nectarine with uh yogurt i blew it yeah let's see that's questionable [Music] okay i think the satellite should be up all right hey i'm currently outside vitamin shop what were those garden of life vitamins you recommend for men trying to get my dad on some better ones yeah those are great garden of life men's multivitamin those are the great if he's over 40 i think they have lower 42 i get the garden of life men's multivitamin but the one from the video they make another one that's not quite as clean uh you'd have to look at the uh the video really quick all right let's go outside art they're about like 35 bucks for a bottle i think yeah i get my samples your horseshoes all right guys keep keep leaving comments down below let us know where in the world you're watching from all that good stuff we're taking the party outside here the grill's nice and hot it says 460 degrees that sounds pretty good art huh oh yeah i love the black socks and the sandals that's classier okay let's see what's going on grilled nice and hot i believe it's clean but just to make sure always give it a nice scrub-a-dub-dub i have four burners going in i might need to do all of them so let's get a bummer without it burial bummers watching from his bunker in north korea is that where kim jong is hiding too okay so we'll put all the peppers on i'm gonna grill the avocado because one of you guys told me earlier i just feel like it doesn't really do much maybe if i had like a a charcoal grill and got some real good smoke on there that'd be nice i want to put a little seasoning on the uh on everything actually especially the onions here let's season these guys too it's my favorite part about cooking outside just being really messy cashew siete tortillas versus almond siete tortillas versus today's cassava siente tortillas which is best battle of the tortillas it's a cheese it's actually a very interesting question because the answer back in the day would be cashew flour tortilla but something happened something's wrong with the tortilla today i don't know what it is maybe it's the cassava flour we're living on the edge something happened they changed so they're wildly inconsistent i would say right now the almond flour is better and i do talk about those tortillas in my cookbook because i recommend them for a couple recipes and i say go with either or um but there have been some there are some known issues with the cashew one i'm not exactly sure what's going on okay so those are down now look what happened to our lovely chicken it's been marinating for about 45 minutes spices have got in there he's going to have to go in and wash his hand out here yeah that's one i got these things called tongs yeah i know but my hands were dirty already i'm just a caveman i don't know about your spring loading tongs i build fires and i cook with my bare hands he once was a caveman but now he's a lawyer on frozen caveman okay kelly weinstein 1.99 just for singing hey michael kelly oh my god it's hilarious kelly okay the skin on the chicken so yeah it's the skin on the chicken no no it's boneless skinless if i do leave the skin on i'll cook it in uh usually the pan but that's a great tip buy bone on skin on organic chicken thighs ask the butcher at the counter to debone them for you so they cook quicker but you get that crispy skin and then ask them to save the bones for you so you can make stock and bone broth with them it's one of my favorite things to do ask the butchers ask the fishmongers to fillet to de-bone ask the produce people hey i don't need this big head of cabbage can you cut it in half they will do it i'll leave you on that note and i'll wash my hands talking points while i'm gone baseball opening day who's going to be in the world series discuss you heard that question dual pine let us know drink time for those playing that game at home i see water dripping from up there and it's a beautiful day it's not raining that must mean that the automatic flower

maybe at the edge of glory i'm on the edge of chicken glory jill chopsky five dollars local foods in chicago are all the meats organic and grass-fed or do they sell meats that are not that are not clean uh great call um not everything is grass-fed but it's all clean so even the grain fed there is uh at least like pasture-raised grains fed but yeah they have pasture-raised pork pasture-raised chicken and grass-fed beef really really good step they do have one thing there that is not 100 grass-fed but it's bone marrow burgers they put a piece of bone marrow in the middle so it melts when you cook it um it's still very high quality unbelievable when you guys come in town you should get a few things from there um and then uh bring it back because i should cry oh yeah let's see what's going on here yeah for those talking about the hair thanks for the compliments it's just the uh the sides that are good out of control and leave the top kind of long but the back and the sides are getting crazy yeah you haven't got a haircut yet right no not since two days before the uh executive order that's right art has anyone told you you look like matthew mcconaughey didn't somebody say

be good like let me tell you it's going to be good really excited about it oh go white socks it's nsc it's anastasia wait sorry okay there we go there we go here we go man it's a bummer because we're losing the heat and the grill you know it's a bummer dude we had all that nice grill heat going let's turn this guy off this to see in the next house also add this to your spreadsheet the gas grill will not have a propane tank it'll be hardwired into the gas line i hate having to go to home depot or whatnot and getting these stupid tanks they're so darn annoying sheila um i'm from the chicago area natively uh tyler was a work transfer i was there for a temporary amount of time a few years five years but uh this has always been home so that's how i made the journey there we go i can hear the gas coming out but a great experience in texas loved it in the armpit of hell right the weather the weather felt like that in the summer oh that humidity is brutal and the heat oh my gosh okay yeah bobby uh i believe growing up your uh weber was hooked up to the uh natural gas wasn't it yes it was those were the good old days when times were simpler whew just worked up nope shut down rebecca shy town oh my hands are greasy i'll be back oh oh there he goes wow so who's actually playing along i know some people say like digital drinks but are some people actually uh actually playing along let us know sarah i don't i don't drink much at all texas heat is a whole new experience that's actually uh it's actually toughened me to the heat like i don't i mean i'll still say the weather's hot but my opinion of hot weather has changed since living in texas hey rose they're waving right back rose viviana's drinking fresca an entire can every time he leaves wow anybody drinking fanta wanafunta don't you wanna wanna fonta okay walking backwards can be uh hazardous to your health especially when you trip on a table i was wanting to go on same grill huh yeah danny m don't drink it work get open linda's drinking wine okay florida yeah florida's got the heat got the humidity fort worth very hot anywhere in texas pretty much okay hold up with the panhandle though yeah it's summer like up there i know the winter can be pretty cool i never really went there never went there i should say if you missed it earlier these are the uh tortillas we're gonna use never use them yet but they're the grain free paleo tortillas from siete so they have no gluten or wheat it's cassava flour we do have to warm it though on the grill so uh not now because i don't want them dry out we'll just grill it for a few seconds aside but i think just for time purposes after those avocados get a little bit of color we'll bring them inside and make a quick guacamole that way when the chicken's done we can chop it up do the chipotle line have you seen that stand up with uh sebastian maniscalco or he's doing that's not here the joke about chipotle and he's like these people don't even communicate with the workers they're just like chicken beans lettuce guac it's so funny he's probably what's 2.99 extras okay that's right do you want guacamole it's 2.99 extra i was actually referring to the panhandle in texas i haven't been to the panhandle in florida either uh yeah rose capital of the world arlene i never got to canton trade days first tuesdays first tuesday right and

wasting it is that albanero seated no it's whole and so i had a feeling i was going to happen carsto 1399 canadian because you love sebastian mezcalco nice thank you carstow nice do you like avocados that have been dropped on the floor five second rule and that was just three seconds this is what i was talking about come show on the griller here see this will impart a little bit of flavor i don't think it's necessary hey but it will impart a little bit of flavor so that'd be nice okay chicken i don't think it's ready to flip yet because winter winter chicken dinner yeah because we were messing around the heat so i think what i want to do is take the avocados off and we'll just make i'll bring it out here we'll make a little outdoor a little al fresco guacamole which which one of these is

shocked that they're still on the air making episodes how incredible is that totally goofy you guys okay so two grilled avocados are in shout out shalom dina happy uh sabbath to everyone watching a little bit of salt goes in and then here's the kicker so you don't want to add lime juice directly to the guacamole because the avocado fruit is a very delicate flavor lime is very acidic it's very strong right fuerte so what i learned four years ago in mexico city is to pickle the limes in lime juice that does two things it lessens the raw flavor of the red onion but it also adds a nice pickled flavor so i'll add some red onions grill and a skosh of pickling liquid people are mentioning all you need grilled limes um yeah but i'm just pickling here so it's not the most necessary thing and then i'll just mash it up you can add whatever you want to your guacamole it don't matter just follow the guidelines of pickling your red onions seasoning properly and that's it wow look at this all right it's actually steaming you ever had steaming guacamole i have not bobby i didn't know there was such a thing i know you can charge an extra four bucks for this rebecca rob eats avocados with meyer lemon straight on them with salt and it's yummy ooh meyer lemons i heard that's really good from someone a friend told you to try it out yeah you probably like it i read an article a long time ago from uh what's her name uh what's her name yeah what's the one from the latino girl from the desperate housewives there's also like an athlete yeah yeah yeah yeah she used meyer lemons i'm like i'll try it it was really good so let's see what's going on here cilantro i put it i put it in the bottom of the bowl it was there already a little more we'll take your word for it it was there trust me did you hear me chopping inside liam o'neil prefers a strong lime flavor yeah some people do some don't when it comes to their hair about that there's a dave matthews song about that some people i was saying that this morning actually some people do that that is delicious art puts milk on cheese balls for breakfast now you got me thinking about a new cereal come over here we still have our beautiful barrio bummer says it tastes like the floor that's why it's so good it's not jenna's secret all right so jenna says what it says nice grilled peppers here let's see what's going on with the uh maggie b i might have to have an instagram story like that so all right check it out look at the grilled jalapenos here they look lovely we uh yeah i'll stay here okay the jalapenos look lovely like a frightened turtle all the vegetables are done now i'm gonna flip the chicken here so even though the heat went out they still have pretty decent crust down there now oh brad parham oh i bet that habanero would be fantastic in the guac you know what i think i might do that brad what are you thinking about doing the jalapeno in there because well you know what everyone's going to have it not everyone loves spice so maybe i shouldn't do that let's do it oh i forgot to put the tomatoes on the grill oh you did that intentionally participate in your game wicked game all right back to this segment cue that jeopardy music right now you know let's go inside forget about i don't have time to grill them what we're using raw tomatoes you got time to grill nah get back in now the boss lady says no oh hi exactly we're done no no we're gonna come back outside you come in for a second oh we're gonna make the salsa really quick while the chicken finishes cooking grill the tomatoes it would take another eight minutes we don't have time for that i forgot to put the timbers on the grill no you're the boss lady [Music] she's getting a little a little impatient so here's what we're going to do we're going to take our beautiful fresh i don't think most people make with heirloom tomatoes check these out all right these are gorgeous i got them brad accounts for five if i go in following him they come five so i'll take uh a few tomatoes it would have been nice to get a little char in here but let's imagine use your use your imagination right okay so tomatoes going someone told me that the yellow heirloom tomatoes have less acid actually which is kind of cool then here's what we're gonna do we're gonna take what if you only have tomatoes could you use those instead i supposed to be homer simpson approved if you whoever just asked about the simpsons earlier you'll appreciate tobacco check it out all right i'm just to reduce the heat a little bit just cutting out the membrane and the seeds insane in the membrane yeah and stay in the membrane i'm going to take all those lovely look at this grilled red onions what do you think of air fryers um it's a unitasker that's not worth it we'll throw a little bit of red pepper and i'll save that for art and then we got the beautiful grilled garlic here we'll take that this is like a squeezing of pimple i love this right it's like oh yes this is my version of like uh rick bayless double roasted double roasted tomato salsa that's unroasted 100 double roasted divided by two that's right there you go there you go we'll put them i confuse people with math or we'll test their math skills put a nice what does that mean it's just roasted have extra virgin olive oil in there we'll put a nice single roasted because we roasted the

little roasty and charred it'd be even better you ever tried black salt um yes i have it right here i have all kinds of salt you ever tried black garlic oh yes i've tried that too this is like fossil river black salt here is that like salt from uh where that exxon valdez oil disaster isn't it's pure exxon valdez goodness there we'll use that to garnish later on it's just all about the subtle nuance of the flavor but it's another raw unrefined unprocessed salt that's so good okay now i'll just blend the sea salt from the exxon valves that's rare these days because that happened so many years ago here we go darlene says try black salt plus lemon on watermelon say again black salt plus lemon on watermelon well just on instagram stories we did unrefined salt chili powder and lime juice

food network no it's not safe to assume because think about all the brands think about all the brands that i trash those are all the sponsors of food network so i don't think they would give me one i'd like to have one like on uh netflix or amazon where i don't have to like deal with any of those sponsors and i can say whatever i want okay let me grab that chicken off the grill and then we can finally build some some burritos brb mrs bs uh i've got a youtube channel i typically just put uh concert clips on there so i'm guessing that her weight shops are by watching this channel not uh unless she was just that has the uh peppers on there there's no cooking advice on my channel at the moment so i guess you could lose weight if you watch my channel and didn't cook anything you got to warm the outside i think she got it from we got to warm them tortillas and the chicken looks lovely by the way absolutely lovely what brad parker says forget the sheet tray he needs to come in i need a drink folks be honest is this joke getting old or do you like it's not even a joke it's real look at the chicken chicken looks mon e they have really good chicken thighs at chipotle but they're inorganic like this so that's where they're going to put this right here and then when they come off like this all right i like to just give them a shtickle of avocado oil just to stay juicy lucy that looks like a taco burrito what's that in your speedo oh okay so put these down that's probably going to end up on an instagram story yeah all over that okay we'll take four of those you gotta heat

gotten pretty good at reading food labels and calorie counts are everywhere you know they're even on restaurant menus yet we're fatter as a society than ever yet walk down any aisle of processed food in the grocery store and you're more likely than ever going to see people turning around the protein powder canisters or the boxes of crackers to compare the nutrition facts between one and a competing product well if you want to lose weight the first thing you need to realize is that a food label is not a legal document it has become an advertising tool and let's find out why look the FDA has overworked I mean they've got vaping and fentanyl to deal with so food labels are not exactly high on the list so this ingredient list is really on the honor system the food manufacturer is supposed to list everything that's in the food and put it on the label for the consumer but there is no mandatory third party to check it and by the way do you know what this ingredient list is for it's actually for a beyond meat burger well there are other things at the FDA and other government bodies enforce claims using regulated terms on the label outside of the ingredient or nutrition facts list terms like organic low-fat low-sodium healthy and natural all have strict definitions and you can get a binged if you use them wrong but those are typically on the front of the package and bold letters and the FDA will really get on you if you have an ingredient inside your food that could potentially cause a food allergy like nuts but it's missing from the ingredient list so yeah you misuse these terms or cause a person with a peanut allergy to have reaction to your product but what happens if you mess with your ingredient list a little that doesn't involved an allergenic food what happens when you misrepresent the calories or the grams of carbs protein or fiber on a food label Oh what a food manufacturer actually do that well we don't really know because it's very hard to find cases see nobody really gets hurt if there's three grams of fiber in your food instead of six grams or 270 calories instead of 240 and pretty hard to prove that you got hurt by that so just get the label format right and you're probably fine as long as the numbers are in the ballpark and believable again it's the honor system and now the FDA is focused on adding calorie counts to restaurant menus to again on our system before now did you think that the FDA at some kind of lab where it's secretly tests the numbers on these nutrition labels with big fines and maybe jail time when processed food manufacturers get it wrong do you think that each food company hires some independent third party to test their labels the answer to both is a resounding no the numbers on that label are entirely under the honor system they don't have to be verified or checked by anyone just because processed food companies and restaurants can put anything they want on a Nutrition Facts label or a calorie count doesn't mean that they do although the limited literature available on the subject seems to agree that there is a bit of fudging going on with the data in this study both frozen foods and meals at restaurants both understated their calories the restaurants by 18% the frozen meals by 8% and some restaurant items were more than doubled the stated calories and many did not include the side dishes in the calorie count in this jives with long-term research done that shows that the more meals you have in a restaurant the fatter you tend to get and the more manufactured processed dinners you eat the fatter you get well let's take the best-case scenario of that 8% calorie overstatement and the frozen foods tested so let's say you're aiming to 2,000 calories and you unknowingly consume a percent more that is a daily overconsumption of 160 calories doesn't seem like a big deal right 8 percent now all things being equal and assuming you don't go out and exercise harder to combat the calories that you never know you ate to begin with then that becomes 50 8400 excess calories per year at the standard conversion rate of 3500 calories per pound of fat you would gain sixteen point eight pounds each year due to this innocent little eight percent over estimation here's another study that tests a restaurant food showing that 19 percent of items had significantly more calories and test a New York Times article from a few years ago confirm the same thing in a few fast food items like burritos well which processed food category fares the best actually snacking convenience foods only exceed the calories on the label by about 4% and that is mostly in the carbohydrate gram estimate which really is makes up the entire majority of these foods for some hard candies it's everything still the 1 Nutrition Facts label that people read the least snack foods are the ones that fare the best in these limited number of studies maybe because the processed food makers know that you're really not gonna look at them so why fudge it because you're not gonna buy one candy because it's got less calories than the other or any of these findings gonna put anyone in jail now the FDA expects around a 20 percent error in stated calorie and nutrition numbers so how accurate do you expect these breakdowns of carbs fiber sugar and proteins to be I seen many people turn around boxes and compare different brands based on these labels and I'm sure the one with an extra gram of fiber or an extra gram of protein or a few grams less of sugar is more likely to get bought this is especially true for hyper-competitive items like protein powders of meal replacement bars where there is a rush to have the most protein and fiber without sacrificing taste just don't put peanuts in the box and leave them off the label and you'll probably stay under the radar so the next time you buy a processed food based on the label remember this if it tastes too good to be true it probably is and like our title states you need to look at a food label as an advertising tool not a legal document and finally you should expect carbs and calories to be understated on the label while protein and fiber are often overstated since those will help sell more product in fact no study I'm aware of shows that any calorie count of a processed food is more likely to overestimate the calories and the food it just doesn't happen it's kind of strange for that to be a coincidence don't you think or other processed food makers slowly intentionally trying to mislead with their own Nutrition Facts label getting away with it a little bit more each time or why not just avoid all manufactured processed foods in the first place then you don't have to worry about any of this I mean if the labels are all potentially wrong and you eat 10 manufactured processed foods and they could have an error each of 10 percent then you're just multiplying the error on top of each other and that's frustrating seriously think about going a day or longer without eating anything that has a Nutrition Facts label I bet you'll feel fuller on fewer calories and carbs Ram's and you will also begin to erase your food addiction pathways at the same time so now you see another reason why we don't recommend manufactured processed foods so for more tips and tricks on how you can eat better and lose weight

I spent having the pleasure of working with so of course we all would like to live longer than their memories and their bladders monies and have to be hearing in that eyesight but you know we're gonna live as long as we're gonna live and I always think I have a bigger voice my kids always say that I have a really big voice so for I can't stand it behind a podium either it's a really bad habit of mine so you heard this yesterday that it was called the fatal granulomatous disease of childhood and I believe standing here just in the time that I worked with families with CJD that that life expectancy has even gotten longer just since I've been involved and that really is due to the great work of physician scientists like dr. Holland and dr. Rosenzweig and all the other doctors that you've heard and I'd like to also think that some of the nurses have helped a little too Yeah right so when I think about you know making the quality of life for families with CJD I sort of see it as this inner working of all of this and that includes obviously the medical side of it with medication prophylaxis with an early diagnosis which i think is incredibly key strong mental health support knowledgeable and accessible medical nursing care which was brought strongly to let yesterday when we talked about bone marrow transplantation how important it is to find a site where there are individuals who understand CJD and understand transplanting CJD avoiding potential infection exposures and then of course education which i think is really the key to solidifying success early diagnosis for many of you that I've met here that has been realization that you have been able to get your children diagnosed quite early it isn't always the case and and we have many many patients that come to us who do not get diagnosed until their 20s sometimes it's because they have suffered a significant and traumatic infection and in the case of that a lot of times we end up diagnosing siblings for the very first time so again affecting not just one person cjd but a whole family so some of the things that also you might want to think about is if there's not an infection as a part of the diagnosis there are the granulomatous parts of the complications that I know dr. Heller spoke about so eloquently yesterday but I'm gonna touch on a couple of the other granulomatous complications that he didn't talk about because these are important in terms of weight great weight gain and growth and if we can get that diagnosed early and we have diagnosed children as young as two with granulomatous colitis we can see that their growth curve does catch up a little bit more we said they have better learning and they meet their developmental milestones a lot better and of course be any antibiotics Asst again this is maybe a little repetitive what you've already heard that the average age for an x-linked effected child is about two to three years old and that's because they tend to present with significant infections very early for the recessive forms they can go as old as the 20s as if we talked about so again just reminding about the granulomatous complications which i think are just as significant as the infections you see those in the in the GI tract the urinary tract the eyes and the skin and about 50% of all patients with CJD will have some sort of granulomatous complication so just to remind you about the GI tract rectal disease is the most common that we see but it can affect any parts of the colon and I know doctor how I showed some pretty significant and painful looking slides yesterday what we see clinically often times especially in young children is constipation will be the biggest complaint and when that presents to a pediatrician there is oftentimes a question whether they're just not wanting to poop rather not being able to poop and so they will try things like mineral oil or other laxatives and it just really doesn't work but what we also notice are some subtle things like something called the albumin which is a blood test that gives you an idea of the amount of protein that's in the blood and if it's on the lower side we always worry about could this be a malabsorption issue with granulomatous colitis it could also be an indication of a subtle infection as well and just to show you there it can also affect swallowing we have patients with CJD who can develop what we call diverticula where they actually have out patching of their esophagus where food particles can actually get stuck in there and they can feel like they can't swallow and that is will usually be they'll throw up food that looks like it has never even been digested or they'll complain that that feels like something's stuck and also the outlet from the stomach to the small intestine called the pylorus can become very thickened and what you'll notice is what dr. Heller said yesterday a lot of vomiting a lot of discomfort a lot of belching and for small children infants sometimes this can be just attributed to some dyspepsia that infants can get but if they become more constant and more concerning this may be the issue and then there are bladder complications and I can't tell you how many phone calls that I've gotten from patients who tell me that you know they went to their doctor because they were having trouble urinating they never felt like they emptied their bladder well and so they went and they got a urine test and urine test was negative for infection but the doctor you know or the nurse practitioner or whoever they saw put them on an antibiotic but they're still not getting better and the answer is because it really probably is an infection what it is is the granulomatous inflammation in the bladder and the inflammation can cause outlet obstructions from the bladder out to the body to the urethra or it can actually cause obstruction from where the urine comes from the kidneys into the bladder and in that case sometimes the the kidneys can become swollen because they're not emptying and could also lead to renal dysfunction and we've had patients who've actually you know how to be had a kidney that no longer was functioning because of this the mainstay mainstay medication for all of these complications is prednisone and if you've ever taken prednisone you know why you don't want to take prednisone especially at the kind of doses that we prescribed for these things you they get doublet trouble sleeping feeling jittery being hungry all the time being cranky and that's maybe some of the reasons why if you are a parent of a child with CJD and they need to have prednisone they become an extreme nightmare for a period of time that they're on the prednisone but it does work and it works very well in the GI tract doctor how I mentioned if there are other medications that you can take by mouth or you can actually take as a suppository or an enema and they are all either aspirin like or steroid like so taking precautions I know that this was founded on about using both an antifungal as well as an anti bacterial prophylaxis and as soon as your child is diagnosed it's my expectation that based on their age and based on how they're doing they will be started on both of these medications and then of course there's the immunotherapy with gamma interferon or act immune and when I saw this you time to take your morning medications you know wonder wife not be eating so much and this my point in this is that there are a lot of GI side effects that occur with every single over-the-counter or prescribed medication if you happen to look in a PDR or even listen to the commercial on television which if you listen to the commercial on television I don't know why anybody takes any medication because the risk of dying or whatever is included in every insert more of a cover your behind statement than really helpful I know most of you are either on bactrim or have a child who's on bactrim it really the landmark studies for those suggested that infection rate was decreased from one year to one in every three and a half years and I've noticed just you know just not nothing scientific here but for me it seems like children do quite well when when mom and really in charge of the medication it's during those teenage years that we feel like this arrived and infection and I have to think it's because they're not even getting in one bedroom you know you ask them when do you take it oh I take it every day okay you check a level and it looks like they haven't taken it for long time and then dr. Holland mentioned this if you're allergic there are lots of options for you including just using the trimethoprim part of it rifampin or other medications caught cephalosporins and the benefit of choosing a medication like a cephalosporin and it might just be once a day or with rifampin things to think about when if your child gets placed over camp in for prophylaxis if that the your look change like a your reddish color and all these medications have side effects of course these are the most common that I see with bactrim complain that they're more sun sensitive and that they will definitely need to wear sunblock and also we encourage people to stay really hydrated when they're on bactrim as well nausea diarrhea are just two of the main things that I hear but in general I have to say most people who take the medication regularly do not have many side effects and really tolerate it pretty well rare is that you might see a decrease in the white blood cell count or you might see abnormal liver function studies one thing I didn't man it mentioned which I should if they're also granulomatous complications that can occur in the liver and it's something that we might worry about if we saw persistently elevated liver enzymes we may also be concerned if we're seeing that their platelet count is a little bit low so that's another complications of granuloma issues that I didn't mention but there are important and you should stop back from during pregnancy and often time you need to check with your doctor before breastfeeding so the other arm of prophylaxis is Ettrick on us all and again this is the the landmark study for this was done by dr. Holland and and our team and we found that it made a huge difference at least it continues to make that difference for our patients these are the typical doses that can be in pills and/or liquid as same as bactrim back then can also be in a liquid other easels can be used as dr. Holland mentioned but we don't have any specific randomized trials to tell us whether or not these drugs are better or different in managing infections or preventing infections the side effects of it reconnaissance a headache people complain of headache diarrhea some nausea and there are lots and lots of interactions with any of the easels and so it's important that before starting a new medication or discontinuing a medication that your prescriber knows that your child or you are taking at your connoisseur and then gamma-interferon there there's not a I can't say that every single CJD patient that I work with this on gamma interferon for a variety of reasons everyone has one why they take it or why they don't take it primarily I think the reasons people don't take it our constitutional symptoms that just be feeling very fatigued and and other people will complain of having fevers with it which kind of wears them out and as an adult and you need to work and you need to be functional sometimes taking gamma interferon just really interferes forget the pun with life for some children the adults feel bad giving their children a shot they don't want their children to get a shot they feel like they are hurting their child I mean a lot of people who are against vaccines have that problem as well so those are some of the reasons why people don't but if you decide to the injections are three times a week we calculated turn your child's body surface area and it does require a prescription for the medicine as well as the needles and the syringes a lot of advice that I've gotten from parents about getting being successful in giving the shots it's using very very thin needles that diabetics use that that helps a lot a couple other people have recommended taking IceCube and numbing the area before you can get your kid to sit still long enough and of course if you're an adult you can do that there are all these numbing creams like Emma I think I have a something excellent they it's like a lidocaine cream that you can put on you can you know work with your child to actually give themselves the shot which sometimes you know if you're if you have a cut it's much better if you clean your cut and put your bandaid on and somebody else does it always seems to hurt more if someone else does it and one point about the injection site it will sometimes be very red and and look angry but that goes away with time and it's not infected it's important that you know that it's not infected you can definitely pretreat with Tylenol or motrin based on your child's weight and that really helps a lot and in fact I've what I've been told is over time you don't need the title on the motrin the body sort of just gets used to it and it's no longer needed I in that case I have had parents who have used a recurrence of fever while giving gamma interferon as a tool to for unn for undiagnosed infection I had one mom who would tell me every time that when her child was going along not having any fever or any problems all of a sudden developing fevers that that would be her clue that there was you know a quiet infection going on and that that was true for that child and and for some other parents as well so just to keep that on in the back of your mind because you know our kids with CJD they can run around with a big fungal infection in their chest and like nobody will know they might have a little off it might just kind of look a little tired and it's those subtle symptoms that usually you know you drag your kid in to get their chest x-ray or cat scan most of you know this but I just wanted to make sure if there was anybody out there who didn't know how to get a hold of gamma-interferon that going to compass is the way to go and they do have a lot of patient support especially because it's a very expensive drug and it isn't always covered but this is like one of them number one FDA indications for this drug so you should be able to get it if you have insurance and I love this because you know this capsule carries whatever you need and then all the side effects that this medicine will give to you as well so you know that's probably the size of a pill that we would need for all the side effects that are listed for any medication that you take including Tylenol to eat or not to eat I get the question all the time can I eat with this medicine can I not what how many hours do I have to wait what I have to do and this is what I've come up with with bactrim there's really no food issues at all whether it's liquid or capsules or tablets I weren't those folks who are old enough or who think they're old enough to drink alcohol don't do it with bactrim you will not feel well most most likely with it Reconnaissance Allah tablets on a full stomach and the liquids on an empty tummy I have been told that drinking soda pop might help with the absorption of a true connoisseur especially I think the liquid and oh and avoiding grapefruit juice because it does delay absorption and that that's very very well known and then how do you get your kids to take medicine since most of your children will be taking medicine for their lifetime starting early and starting to give them responsibility should begin as was told yesterday about the age of seven and to make it a part of their routine to not make it a big deal this is just what you do you take your medicine and parental guilt is like out there and kids just like sense it and they they know that they've got you as soon as they know so making it very matter-of-fact you know take your medicine everybody takes medicine no big deal we'll help and if you can when you're starting to feel bad or feel sad about them having to take medication my best advice for you is to turn around and walk out of the room don't let them see it let them think that you know it's fine with you and you're good with it it's not a problem if they don't like the taste of their medicines which you know happens there are you in your I'm sure somewhere in your your local community or neighborhood there's a compound pharmacy that can do great flavor or cherry flavored or strawberry flavor whatever your kid likes and you take advantage of those services sticker charts for young children where you know after they've taken their medicine all week and they get a pencil or they get a trip to the Tastee Freez or whatever's good whatever works is is a great thing for medicine as it is for really you know anything like doing your homework text messaging for teens would be fun you know if all of a sudden they get a text around two o'clock did you take your medicine love mom pill box is to help them to keep organized straight talk just being when your kids are old enough to understand just being very straightforward with them why they're on this medicine and what will what it will do to protect them and keep them healthy and if you have Mary Poppins around that always helps as well environmental have hazards as you heard yesterday we give a free path to any boy or girl who has to cut the lawn they get a free pass they don't have to do that they can sit in the hammock and take a nap just kidding but what's in mulch you don't want to know what's in polish and it gives you a whole lot of bugs in there leaf mulch wood mulch mowing the lawn raking leaves turning compost piles repotting plants hauling dirt cleaning a cellar taking a hayride haunted houses with hay in it are all examples of kids who come in with really nasty fungal infections and then smoking you know pot in this case I imagine medical marijuana brownies might be the better choice not suggesting but if anyone has one seven three five my room she'll be there too it'll be a real great getting to know you session and then the big problem of swimming although I just heard this morning that the bacterial load in in any place is bad but in general you want to avoid the sharks you want to avoid still bodies of water where there isn't a whole lot of turbulence or movement of the of the water like ponds or lakes avoid hot tubs unless you can verify its cleanliness meaning it's your hot tub and you clean it the ocean is probably fine but you want to stay from what we consider brackish water water that standing still may be in a Cove or an area like that there's nasty nasty infections that have come from that and usually if you can smell the chlorine in a chlorinated pool you're safe but you have to be able to smell that chlorine which means that your kids eyes will be totally red and pretty dried out but encouraging kids never to swallow water when they're in the kind of public swimming area and to both rinse off afterwards and you know including washing the hair as well immunizations really important to say here that there are generally no contraindications for immunizations for kids with CED except for BCG no BC but also I want to caveat that by saying if your child is taking prednisone for a granulomatous complication make sure that your pediatrician knows the dose that they're on because that will affect their ability to get certain live vaccines all life vaccines most important if we could clone dr. Holland we'd put them in every state in every community but that's not possible so having a really good doctor to look after your child it's not always easy I know the idea foundation website does give you a list of folks to go to certainly being in contact with a large teaching kind of organization is fantastic and a great opportunity if you have it access to the Internet so you can go to the IDF website the Geoffrey Modell foundation as well as another good source and if you're looking for a research protocol clinical trials.gov it's a great place to go to look at what dr. Holland and his colleagues dr. Malik and dr. Rosenberg are doing to treat CJD and I know dr. Powell is gonna speak much better towards this but I can tell you as a child with it with a different kind of a chronic illness it's so important to have your mental health support whether that being a psychiatrist along with a psychologist or licensed clinical social worker or an advanced practice nurse finding ways to reach out like you're doing today is so important because no matter what I said in the very beginning I don't have siege idea I am fortunate I don't have a child with CJD so I'm only saying to you what it's like over the years that I've worked with families and I'm giving you their best advice and my best advice based on my experience but really look around you because these these are your family these are the people that will really help you to make the best decisions for you and for your child and so I really encourage you to look at a look at some support groups look at blogs and finally respite care respite care is so important and if you have good family members or good friends or communities like your church to give you an opportunity to not have to worry about the day-to-day things that you have to do with your child and especially when your child is ill or going through a gene therapy or a bone marrow transplant in the future knowing that you have an extra pair of hands or eyes to be it there at the hospital with you so that you're not so burnt out that you're hurting yourself and there are lots of great resources obviously access to insurance with the Obamacare because I can't say the other long we had the portable yeah that one yeah I got it right there that one right there certainly looking into what your state offers and for some folks especially our older patients with CJD who because of their multiple infections may have a decreased lung capacity which really limits them from working full-time looking at short term or long term disability and then looking at the supports again from nongovernmental organizations like the IDF Jeffrey Modell and the rare disorder foundation are all great websites to go to and to get educational support to be able to contact other folks with diseases like yours and finally to find the community research and medical support that you will need these are some you may be looking around the room the key was is so this is Thomas advice and that's to keep believing in yourself and keep on dreaming and as you see in front of him as this beautiful artwork that he does and this is Earl and Earl said never give up that's his best advice never give up and he is a father of three then this beautiful lady miss Carla is sitting in the audience to stay positive and you see her sitting with her beautiful family and finally I don't have a picture of him but this is a likeness Nick H says know your disease research it and ask a lot of questions thank you [Applause] so this is my first IDF meeting and I see that you do not have enough mental health in the program overall to start with that I was given the topic how to parent a child with a chronic illness so how to parent a child right there you've bought yourself a lifetime anxiety disorder okay so and then on top of that a child with a chronic illness that's double the anxiety and that's something that you're gonna have to learn to work with this is the NIH as you've already heard and I didn't have any financial disclosures to just close and you already heard the titillating relevant disclosure that I'm dr. Hollins wife so obviously when you have a child there's a lot of hope and dreams and thoughts that are gonna be in your mind about what's coming forward and for anyone who even has healthy children those don't all come to bear so it's a moment in your life where you have a lot of aspirations but you know you have to see what comes now I trained initially as a pediatrician and and you heard dr. Jenna Mesa yesterday our task in pediatric care is to maximize all children's functional abilities and sense of well-being their health-related quality of life and their development into healthy and productive adults but I also trained as a psychiatrist and a child psychiatrist and what we are concerned about is you know where's this line between what is normal and what is a disorder and so all behaviors can be at one end or the other end of the spectrum so if you sleep everybody sleeps if you sleep too much that could be a problem or if you eat you know that's a normal behavior but at some point that could be a problem we're all a little OCD so you know physicians hopefully you're a physician is a little bit obsessive compulsive and you know checks up on things so you want that to some extent but is it a disorder in which it's problematic for them and taking up too much time so any behavior could become a problem our disorder but you just have to figure out the frequency and the duration and how much impairment is it causing so that's what we think about so a chronic illness can be viewed as a condition characterized by a set of challenges serious challenges that can either be overcome or lead to a sense of emotional defeat and so I've spent my time trying to figure out and listening to thousands of parents like Nikki what is it that parents find helps them overcome these challenges and I have to say that I do a lot of consults with families who have rare disorders and I'm not here to tell you all the things you're doing wrong I'm really here to tell you that you're doing a lot of things right and that I spent a lot of times telling parents these are things that you're doing that are great but maybe we could tweak some of these things to help you with some of the problems that are going on so how big a problem is this there are 74 million children under the age of 18 in the US and approximately 20% of these children will have a chronic illness or special health care need so that's a lot of children and about 10% of children have a chronic condition that impact their lives on a daily way so I have to take medicine have to get chest PT you have to do some kind of therapy so and the good news is that you know at least 90% of these kids with chronic conditions are gonna live into young adulthood so because of our antibiotics because of our surgery we can take a 24 week old baby and have them survive into adulthood so there are a lot of things that we can do now and that's where mental health actually comes into play because in the beginning people were just worried about their kids surviving but the truth is you know if you're surviving and you don't have good mental health what are you surviving or quality of life what are you surviving for so it's really important to be doing this all medical management but mental health management along the way so approximately 10 to 20 percent of children in the general population have behavioral and emotional symptoms and approximately double that with children with chronic conditions will have behavioral and emotional symptoms so and the problem is that a child's adjustment to their illness is not directly related to the severity of medical condition so we will see children who are hospitalized dozens and dozens of times and they can still be funny and you know want to go out and whenever they get out of a hospital that are ready to go do their paintings or whatever they're doing and then we can also see the child who's been sick once who's completely impaired in an invalid doesn't go out as doesn't socialize so we don't have it's not a one-to-one correlation and so we and we don't know exactly what predicts but there are a few things so age of onset and illness of illness is an interesting one because in some ways it's harder for the older diagnosed person who was healthy who was you know athletic and able to you know was running around mowing lawns before they got thick and they don't see themselves as a person as opposed to a child who grew up with it and they don't really know any differently this is the way it's always been they've always taken medicine so adjustment doesn't necessarily be isn't necessarily worse just because the child is younger at the time of diagnosis so a person's intelligence obviously we there are a range of intelligences both cognitive and emotional intelligence and that can be variable and the brighter you are the better your problem-solving so higher IQ is better a temperament you know if your so I saw a pair of twins once in the hospital six year old twins and one twin was really irritable and the other twin was really friendly and of course AHA the nurses just gravitated to the friendly twin and the other twins kind of left off to the side all the time so your temperament can help you it changes the environment around you and social competence is very important now what does the color coding mean so I am always looking for the modifiable factor what is something we can change or adapt or help and so the question is you know can you modify intelligence maybe you know by providing a richer environment trying good nutrition trying not to do that you know no lack of oxygen that kind of things are taking care of things that you know can at least keep your intelligence and then temperament might be something you can encourage social confidence is something that you could help you know just like public speaking some people are not very comfortable with public speaking initially but they can overcome that they can learn how to be a better speaker so social competence has some of that you can learn to be more comfortable meeting with people asking them two questions asking for help so and that turns out to be a very key one as you'll see person's previous experiences with illness will also color how they adapt so I meet a lot of children who are families who've been told all kinds of strange things by doctors you know and it's easy to become mistrustful of the medical system because the doctors are wrong they'll tell you you know you're talking to die in two weeks and here they are at twenty or so it's hard to sometimes trust physicians and the medical system so you you do have these experiences that color how you're coming into a system and it would be helpful for you to tell each time you're coming into a new system what were the experiences you had that they can understand why you might be coming in a little more guarded about your problems the nature and the severity of the illness clearly if you do have brain affected problems those are more severe and can impair a child more and also sometimes having a physical disability can sometimes be more difficult but I have to say that people who have illnesses where you can't see it they will say to me it's terrible no I wish I had you know some skin disease so that people would know what was wrong with me I know I have this terrible I have CGG and nobody knows they can't see it and so I they don't understand anything about me so I wouldn't say necessarily the physical impairment itself is always a negative factor okay and then the Associated suffering her potential for reoccurrence I work with a lot of children with cancer so that's always hanging over their head and and even for patients who get recurrent infections are all sort of waiting for that next infection so it's hard and then how what are the required treatment modalities does it require just taking a pill every day or does it require chest PT three times a day and you have to worry about it before every meal yeah you know so how much is it encroaching on your daily life how much the time to the take can also influence how well you adapt now coping skills is something that you know we can teach right and there's passive coping and active coping in general the research supports that active coping and you all are probably active copers and sir here try to get more information and trying to learn what can you do so that generally is helpful there's always more things we can learn about coping and I was impressed listening yesterday because so we're gonna have bone marrow transplant and it could be a cure and three-year-olds may never even realize they had CJD as they're growing up but that's gonna present a whole set of different problems in their twenties and thirties that we're again I'm not just felt like I'm never gonna be out of business cuz there's gonna be different challenges are gonna be worried about fertility and you know why did we tell them about that when they were little but I mean so there's always gonna be new problems with technology there's ethical things that come up and they're always gonna be psychosocial problems that are coming up so where do you go for help for that you should Vicky kind of pointed that out to you but it's it's available so you have to try to find it and use it family factors so how the family copes is very critical and the family's mental health the parents mental health we'll talk a little bit more about that but community factors it's been shown that people who are religious or spiritual and have a community but again that's release talking about social support so every study no matter what especially bomb and transplant but every study that I've looked at that shows chronic illness people do better when they have more social support so that's why I'm focused on getting you to teach your kids social competence because being able to ask your nurse for being able to ask your doctor questions helps you and get you more help and your family relying if you can't do it all by yourself so just you need to not be a lot ask for help so I just want to key what are the things that you're supposed to be thinking about in a development of a child and the streams that the physicians are really good at are the motor development fine motor development physical growth we all got those charts that we all map all the kids on and everyone's very good at that they're not as good at they couldn't tell you you know you have to have 50 words by one and you should be putting two words together by two maybe they know some of that but there are a lot of language markers that are more refined but not everybody knows those and then cognitive development people are grossly aware of it but they really don't measure that very frequently and then really how many physicians you know who are paying attention to whether your child is socially interacting how are they attaching if you're spending a lot of time in the hospital when your child is very young attachment can be disrupted so and then emotional regulation and sexual development that's another one that doctors don't talk too much about but that's kind of key because as you will see there are adolescents that grow physically but they're not emotionally ready where I follow a lot of children with mental disabilities and the body is going you know full force into puberty but the brain is not anywhere near there so that can be a real problem with the disconnect so we do have to pay attention to sexual development as well and a lot of patients are afraid to ask their doctors about it and a lot of doctors are not interested in asking about it especially pediatricians because they're like roughly adult physicians problem just this is the psychosocial stages of Erikson and these are kind of what are your tasks at different ages and as infants it's just to learn to trust and then I see a lot of adolescents and young adults with medical illness and really they're trying to figure out what what are they gonna do for jobs what's their identity are they going to be able to have relationships these are all tasks that everybody goes through and that can be affected when you have a medical illness so what is getting disrupted in the kids with chronic illness for you if you can't see in the back says disciplining a child is simply too much work we've decided to let society do it later so I'm going through the normal development steps that people worry about and in infants no matter what genetics will play a role in disease and treatment response throughout life so that's a given and the environment how it responds to it is another given so its nature and nurture it's not an either/or thing so it's true that if you're once you have a baby who's diagnosed with a medical illness your relationship to them is altered so and the problem is and I sort of heard it in Vicky's talk no it's so hard to parent a sick kid because it's so hard to know is this the serious coughers that's just a cough I can relax about I mean there's not too many cost you can relax about it but so but every little thing is kind of like do I take this headache do I start worrying about this or you know in the health of healthy kids you'd say okay go two weeks the arm hurts you know it's probably a sprain and then you know you feel bad you take your kids of the ER and then it turned out they broke it you know and so that every parent faces that what to pay attention to and what not to pay attention to but you really have something special to pay attention to so it's very very hard but the key is that you have got to stay on those lines of development and try to keep your kid on that track of all those stages of psychosis psychosocial development because that's what you're always trying to aim for you might get derailed from it if there's a hospital stay but then you want to try to get back on that track because that's the kids that do the best and these are some of the things that do get affected when babies are small and it parents have told me you know that hospitalization when he was one just changed his temperament and he was he was a really happy baby and then you know he got really irritable after that and the steroids don't help necessarily so you know I think you have to just go with it but you pay attention to what you can do when you're not in the hospital and try to help help your child figure out the way to interact with other people parental mental illness can be very serious especially when children are young so it's very important to take care of yourself before you take care of your child and get things in order and as you can see there's some other things that can be just delayed or altered doesn't mean they're not happening but they might be the later altered so children who are in school aged the most important thing is developing peer interactions so you don't want to isolate them keep them away from other kids it's hard and I when I first started this homeschooling was a very religious sort of isolated thing that only a few people did I I wouldn't say that homeschooling is now they really have the curricula out there online and that's better now so I understand if your child as a child who gets recurrent infections and really probably shouldn't be around a lot of other kids at homeschooling might be an alternative but you have really got to find other ways for your child to meet other kids that is really critical peer interaction is very important in that developmental window and so that you need to focus on that school so school I would say the vaquita the childhood experiences is the routine nosov it and the structure and the truth is give closure ears kids need limits okay so they really need something to push against that's going to be you you can't be their best friend all the time and you you know that that's that's the role of the parent basically you know Vicky said so this is the thing you're gonna have to do things that make you feel guilty that are hard and every parent has to do that but it's harder when you see your child in pain or suffering and you just have to you know steal yourself for the fact that this is what you're doing and it's good for them and you're gonna that's part of the parenting role and after they get through that round of whatever it is they'll be better and you go back to the routine but so you're always trying to get back to the routine as much as possible it is really critical to help them develop self-esteem and mastery during that period and I always counsel parents find something your child's good at it might not be outdoors but it could be photography it could be music it could be computers but find the thing that makes your child really excited and that they're good at and that turns them on it takes a little while it took us forever to find whatever you know you go through a lot of things like soccer and basketball and you know then it turns out to be hockey or you know so you'll have to go through a few things but you wish but so it does happen now I will say that kids kids in this period of age the latency age kids or middle school elementary school and some of the middle school are pretty good with their medicines because you're kind of guiding it and they might actually remind you that they have to take their medicines one thing he said about adolescence is really true that is a very hard time and paradoxically you actually probably could be less vigilant in that middle period and you have to go back to being vigilant to adolescence it's counterintuitive you think okay there are lessons they're supposed to be more independent but not about their medicines so that would be my advice about it so you know their their identity is wrapped up in being sick and I would say I'm gonna give another talk tomorrow and I have my top ten parenting rules but I would say that don't let this illness define them they have red hair they have CJD they have other things but they have other skills and they're people and you know so that that's really important and you shouldn't let it define you as being that so it's important to help them find who they are but but they're not their illness and then they have a lot of physical and emotional changes isn't it's not unusual to find them to be a little bit delayed in that and so this adolescent period it's difficult because experimentation is normal so they're you know and but you just heard ones don't take alcohol when you do back from I mean what I lesson do you know that doesn't want to try at least a little alcohol or other things it you're gonna have to tolerate of that you can eyes I don't know how the other people feel about that but there's gonna be a little of that the medicine you can try to supervise that but there's gonna be stuff that happens behind closed doors and you hope for that actually so if they're not doing that then they're not on track so in a way it's a good sign even though it's scary and that's why you need to talk to other people to be like is this okay so they do have a need for not in here so I filed this this picture is actually from HIV I used to work with a lot of young adolescents with HIV and they really can't take their medicines one day and not take their medicines one day because they developed resistance to the drugs and then there's no opportunity for them to stay on this trip so we actually sometimes took a drug holiday but it was a discussion that we had as a group you know with the family of the patient and the medical team so sometimes you have to take that little break because it's part of their adolescence so I just saying to you that you really do have to keep in mind these developmental and mental health needs they're going a lot as you heard this morning from dr. Sullivan the patients need to tell us what is going on because the researchers have a view about things and they think we all take our medicines perfectly three times a day but there is not a single study that shows any patient makes it through the 10-day course of antibiotics three times a day so the truth is that's not how we're actually doing it that we need to hear from you all what is actually happening out there so there is data that says you know that kids with chronic illnesses have elevated healthcare service use more hospital days poor school attendance lower academic achievement less permanent employment more likely to be single and more likely to have delayed independence so this is why again I'm in the red what can we do to prevent these things and this is what I'm all of asking parents how did you get your kid to go to college or how did you get your kid to get that job I want to know so things like groups like this where parents share their ideas camps where kids meeting other kids who have what they have and they realize that's not the only thing in the world they have lives outside of their disease that really helps their kids see that this is just a part of their life but it's that there's regular life to be had so the other thing I would say is what's the life curriculum so skills that you need to deal with adversity in general you do it's good to be able to focus your attention on a problem it's good to be able to plan monitor and problem-solve delay gratification be able to work with others so that's the hidden curriculum that is not the overt curriculum of school but that is what is supposedly going on you know when you're with when you send your kids to school all of these things are also going on and I would just counsel you so I have parents again with children with more disabilities but don't be worried about if they're gonna take calculus or because it's more important if they can take a bus and they can read a bus route or really can read the metro or they can make change you know practical life is important and it's not a curriculum but people don't pay attention to that and they get very focused on my cart my child not you know reading the ninth grade English curriculum that curriculum why it might not be as helpful to you as taking you know a bus and figuring out how to go and run an errand by themselves so you do have to sort of be able to let go and that that's hard for parents with chronic illness right so you want to try to let them go to these special camps or have these little experiences away from you so they can slowly gain some independence because ultimately you want them to be able to leave you actually hopefully that's the goal and executive function refers to mental flexibility self-regulation and practical life that's what I was talking about but self-regulation means being able to tolerate delay so the guilt factor is is tremendous for parents and especially in the hospital the one kids go on the hospital you see the parents there's a gift store or by the bear you know they just feel terrible that the kid isn't it's what Vicki said though try to treat it more like the well everybody has to take those just take your pill you have to brush your teeth you have to take your pills it's not a fight every day have to do these things and try to treat it as part of their regular life and hospitalizations are gonna be part of their regular life I have many many patients tell me about their in house in hospital life and their regular life and sometimes they get sick because they just want to take a break from their regular life and the parents are so nice to them in the hospital they don't have any rules they don't you know there's no they they get a free pass they can sleep whatever they want they can you know it's right so parents have to be mindful that because a guilt of being in the hospital is so intense and you feel so sorry for your child and why do we have to go through this but really the more businesslike you can be about it like regular lines the kids tell me on the fly you know yeah you know I know my mom's gonna be like not make me do anything all right so in the hospital everybody regresses no matter who you are you want to be babied you want your comfort food yeah so and and the pole to the parent to do that is intense and you feel helpless this is adults too if you're anxious or guilty you want to deny there's any problems everybody gets a little depressed and their mood is labile frequently they have difficulty sleeping because the nurses are waking you up at 2:00 in the morning for your weight you know the hospital is not designed for sleeping well as anybody will tell you and you might be irritable or defined and so my job in the hospital and I'm a hospital psychiatrist is to kind of determine again these are normal behaviors but when is that behavior turning into a problem or a disorder is this depression so and again it has to do with how much how long and how impairing right so if you're if you're so all of these things that you're not doing anything the doctors are saying you're definitely gonna get I'm definitely gonna get a call so and then of course being in the hospital will aggravate any time a psychiatric symptoms you already have because it's an additional stress now there is this phenomenon that was described in the sixth and you still see today really but we don't talk about it too much and it's called the vulnerable child syndrome and it's what happens to parents when a life-threatening thing has happened to their child they don't want to separate from the child because they're really afraid this child gonna die and they they baby them and they're they make the baby over dependent on them because they want to do everything for them and I and literally see parents feeding their eight-year-olds you know you know at eight you can feed yourself breakfast so and they become very so this is a danger because you're gonna be very preoccupied with every bodily statement your child makes so how to kind of hang back a little bit and let them make it two or three times don't respond every time to the very first time they say it maybe if they say it at two or three times in a day like I still have a headache or okay then you know but the first time you're gonna respond to every little thing they say they're gonna know they're gonna know that that's gonna happen and they're gonna say things right it's not intentional but it's definitely and it's intentional thing that they figure out everybody likes attention so and the problem is that in your the back of your head you're anticipating some kind of failure like they're not gonna make it or there and you really can't have that you have to expect things from these children the people this happen to in the HIV a world tremendously because we all fought when we got those patients with HIV they were all going to die by the time they were five anyway so what was you know what did they pampered them whatever out of them and and cater to them completely and they had learned no rules and let me tell you trying to teach children rule that thirteen is not simple it doesn't happen you need to be starting them at two right so then we had a bunch of thirteen year olds who had never had any rules and just were miserable because nobody thought they were gonna survive but you just have to assume your child's going to survive and you have to assume they're gonna be an adult and healthy and you have to try to do all the things that you would normally do to make them a healthy independent adult so it's very understandable that parents would have this kind of anxiety but talk about it talk about what you're worried about with somebody it's been duly noted that generally you don't want to bring up those things with your physician because you think that's not something they want to be worried about or that's taking up too much of their precious time but then find someone else on the team talk to a Vicki or talk to you know talk to there should be a psychologist dr. Jean but find somebody to talk to about it because these can really be more important in some ways and so we this was called vulnerable child syndrome but I think it might be more aptly called vulnerable parent syndrome so why am I focused on this because guess what your child's coping skills come from you how you cope is how they're going to cope so your ability to cope is really really important and that's why I'm so focused on this it's definitely been shown parents who cope successfully with their child's illness can isolate their fears and anxieties just what Vicki said go out of the room before you like start crying about it you know just then you can help your child better towards and you're trying to get your child to self-care and independence parent treatment for anxiety all these things are the things your grandma told you to do get you know eat well sleep well exercise for weight alcohol but there are other treatments they have shown group therapies help parents just talking about it helps parents there are different kinds of cognitive behavioral structures that can help parents so and they can definitely show that they reduce anxiety and children when they reduce anxiety and parents all right so what else does a psychiatrist get called for in the hospital we get called for behavioral problems where they won't take their medicine non-adherence we get called for pain management and there are a lot of techniques your child can learn and there are a lot of people around the hospital Child Life therapists recreation therapists who can help your child learn these things and just because your child learned something when they were 8 doesn't mean they don't need to relearn it when they're 10 so you tell your child they have CDG at 8 they have a very minimal understanding that they have some cells that don't work and they got to take some medicine for that you need to have that discussion again with them when they're 11 or 12 what does that mean what do they understand about it what you know question and check with them what their ideas about it are because it changes and they can contain more information as they get older and they might be stuck with really primitive ideas about it if you don't go in there and check every once in a while well where are they with all of this so it's important for you to think about checking in periodically again about the diagnosis so there's a lot of examples in the psychiatric literature or psychology literature the patient says they told me there's a demon in my belly okay what the doctor said was there's edema in your belly or swelling right but the kid heard there's a demon in my belly so this is why you have to check what did the kid hear from these appointments I'm a little worried about all the things everybody's hearing today so you should go back and you know check with people about what did you hear what that write is that you know what does it really mean for me because not all of these things apply to everyone so okay so lots of techniques to learn deep breathing lactation distraction everybody knows - how distraction works terrifically we can teach kids guided imagery hypnosis a lot of kids can self hypnotize it works heat cold you know she talked about the ice cube for the shot so that's the cold so if there's a pain theory that if you have something else going on you can't be totally focused on the nerves that are doing having the pain so there now there's even this little thing we haven't tested it yet but there's a little bee sting kind of device that you can put on that supposedly causes the vibrations around where the shot is happening and maybe that decreases shot so we're always looking for ways to decrease pain and I would say that's really important because the less pain the less trauma overall there are behavioral methods which taking alluded to in terms of behavioral methods and some of those you know some of the staff around the hospital can teach you otherwise you can get additional help from behavioral therapists cognitive behavioral therapy is very targeted therapy which is not lying on your couch and being in therapy forever you have a problem go ask for help for the problem work on it for six weeks and then you know that problem can be addressed those therapies can be used in the mental health realm in the same way that you use therapies in the physical realm and these are just some of the things that can be used for sometimes medications can be useful if if there are persistent states of being sad or just such severe anxiety you can't leave the house or you're having panic attacks there there are roles for medication even in children and these are just you know a list of the medications that we have tried in children that are reported in the literature obviously you have to check with the primary team because there are interactions between things like it trick on us all imposed upon us all and but you really do want to know that this is still a tool that's there in the toolbox as well now when should you actually get a psychiatrist involved now this is again sort of the theme of the meeting there are specialists for everything and there are specialists who are psychiatrist for the medically and surgically ill and the chronically ill so that's called psychosomatic medicine that's a very unwieldy name but so I'm a pediatric psychosomatic medicine psychiatrist or compote liaison psychiatrist every Children's Hospital has one of these at least and in the so that's the psychiatrist level of it there's health psychologists who are all health they only study the psychology of working with chronically ill kids and so when you're looking for help you want to look for those specialty areas because they're used to working with people who have complex medical conditions and are on other medications and so they're used to the same kinds of problems so when I call that's either to figure out is this be because you know is this person depressed because they're getting interferon because sometimes interferon can cause depression are they depressed because they have CJD and sometimes I can run with or not so much CGG but like pancreatitis pate pancreatic cancer for instance people get depressed before they show up with the cancer so sometimes that's actually a sign of the cancer coming so it could be a primary part of the disease is it does the person already have psychiatric disorder maybe they came to the hospital they already have ADHD and it's really hard for them to stand around in the hospital and do things so you know sometimes they want to help get a management plan or is this the psychological reaction to being sick and so we try to help distinguish and again you heard it was because of kind of whole constellation does the family history there is it how and how long has it been present so just this is an example you could put is anxiety flash depression transient or persistent is it getting in the way of care treatment or recovery is the person not responding to the situation because they're so isolated and withdrawn from it and they just are completely anxious all the time without despite all these other attempts to do these other things so why does that happen so I do have a theory that children with chronic illness do are a little more susceptible to some of these anxiety and depressions as they get older not initially but you know stress and any kind of adversity does play on your hormones and this is a feedback loop and they do interact with inflammatory markers and they do cause depression and anxiety and if you think about it this way you have a problem you get a stress your cortisol goes up and then it comes back down but in your life sometimes you have so many stresses it just keeps coming right you know you you take your antibiotic and it doesn't work you're back in the hospital and you stop adapting and you either end up stuck just secreting reporters all the time in which is you're in a hyper supportive all state or you it's broken they can't it can't secrete anymore it's depleted and so you end up enough low cortisol state so this is the time I think some kids with repeated dresses might need some medicine to help kick-start some of these things back in the order I just I do research on screening kids in emergency departments for suicide and I just say that physical illness and chronic pain is a risk factor and that these are all the things that remember we're focused on the protective factors right so close family relationships meaningful school strong friendships cultural and religious beliefs so there are many protective factors that you want to try to us brick on and the suicide is very rare in this population but you have to ask you can't assume that that's not some thought that has crossed somebody in mind so you will be hearing people ask more in the hospital as they do admissions because that's sort of a general movement and and it's complicated in the medical so we initially made the screen in the psychiatric emergency room before kids with behavioral problems and psychiatric problems but in the medical hospital we're finding it very challenging because and you just have to ask directly are you think having thoughts about killing yourself because these kids all do have thoughts about dying at some point or another so that's not the same thing as thinking about killing yourself so if the physician is not very careful they're like not asking it right it comes out in a different way so you just want to be real specific about what you're asking about alright so we do help parents try to figure out if they're having any issues and how we can help them be the best parent they could be we do also want them to understand that they have to have expectations and not overindulge with their kids and we do want them to have parents reflect on their parenting style and work on communication in the family so I did I'm gonna just touch a little bit on this the parents are not the only ones that need help in this we do need to think about how we do medicine in general and you know you heard a lot about patient centered and many places claim to be patient centered but the truth is there are some things that we do a lot of procedures that maybe we don't have to do now if you come to research you're gonna be doing a lot of extra procedures and you have to think about that you know and we try to mitigate the pain especially when we're doing research because it's an added thing but does your physician have to draw blood every single day do do they really you know I just you know you have to think about this and I'm gonna make you know you are a bunch of pain in the neck patients but just from the child's perspective I'm saying that that's not necessarily always the best thing and you really want a question are you getting everything you need to get out of this does it have to be every day could it be every other day does it what is it really telling you so just you're always gonna be your child advocate now so we tried to work on making the hospital more ouchless and we also one of the things that was really lost in the current healthcare system back in the day when I trained teams all met quite frequently you know the psychologists and the mental health I mean the the medical teams all met together the rehab everybody and we don't have that anymore because it's not paid for so we really you need to push for your doctors to talk to each other [Laughter] and and then just we we are spending more time just making sure the hospitals are paying more attention to mental health issues so I spend a lot of time trying to make sure physicians understand that their medical decisions actually impact on children's development we want to create active partnerships with you have clear expectations for chronically ill children and enforce all the cooperation and we really want to try to minimize post-traumatic stress where possible because a significant portion of patients who spend a lot of time in the hospital actually do have post-traumatic stress symptoms we want to avoid that the other thing is and you've already heard all this you people are encouraging support groups telephone visits it's harder with the infections you know that when I went away for a little while cuz hospital infections were such a problem and but now that we have the internet and a lot of chat rooms I think it's really gotten better again but just you know have people develop their town they don't always have to be academic and I already mentioned maintaining behaviors alright so happy people are over 21 that our patients here okay and were there any issues in transitioning care to adult care not really so one of the things that we're quite concerned about is that transitioning to adult care from pediatric care is a multi-faceted process and really takes some time at least our experience and HIV it wasn't that like you could just hand them over and we had we lost a few patients because of the transfer because the patients were used to in the pediatric world the nurse calls you all the time are you taking her medicine you know adult folks are not going to do that the dog folks put all the responsibility on you and it's not about talking to your family it's not where there's not all these other services around you if you don't want to take the treatment they don't that's fine you're an adult they they accept that whereas we would not accept that at the pediatric world there's not as much supervision of the trainees so it's a very different world once you transition to the adult world which is why when dr. Hoffman you need to be teaching your kids their medicines when they're seven eight the name of the disorder yeah yeah so the electronic patient health record will be very helpful we used we make little medical passports for kids and say that you really need to have your medical record all the time because if your parents not there to tell the story who's telling the story or you go to an ER for some reason who's telling the story and there are examples on got there's a great website got transition org and they have you know the 3/7 story that you would give if you actually had a walk into an ER in terms of what your diagnosis is what meds are on and why did you come to the ER today can you can you actually articulate the problem and say it so I think there are some resources out there now now just to say I cover the whole span of what might happen in CJD and this is my example from oncology it's or currently I mostly work with pediatric oncology patients but this is like the patient Kakori that you heard about this morning and we've been doing patient centered care all along we talked to the patients it comes from the clinical service and we find out what it is they want what materials do they want just like the book that got created we also have created many books and games for chronic illness that you can play with your kids called shoptalk you know and we have one brewing for chronically mentally ill kids and we work with them and we develop tools for them and so and this you can set up a research shop in any center with a social worker or a psychologist and a psychiatrist that it doesn't take a lot of resources but you have to have some people that are interested in your center this is the mandala this is artwork that a child made who had cancer and you know when will there be a cure when am I gonna get sick again what will happen to me what would feel like to no longer exist when will I die but will I be live long after go to call school or get married so that you know when we talk to the kids these are the things they worry about you might not know because they don't want to tell you they're worrying about this because they don't want you to be worried about them and you don't want to tell them you were worried about this because you don't want to worry them more so everybody's worried but nobody can talk to me about all these things so fine find the third person and find a neutral person who isn't gonna be all of that if they hear these things I mean so these are what come from kids we talked to kids directly we think that's really important and in this case we did make a document so we were doing advance care planning there was no such thing for young adolescents and young adults for with cancer so there is this document out there that we made has been downloaded quite a few times all right so we're gonna summarize what do parents want help with they want to be assisted in the loss of normalcy on an ongoing basis they don't necessarily want it to be from their care their main care provider but they do want that from the team there really should be regular psychosocial evaluations in your clinic visits at some regularity and you need counselors who are trained in chronic illness issues that you need help with navigating school and home and how to develop coping skills and then I'm interested in modifying the hospital environment because I think we have to pay attention to how physicians give bad news and what the patient heard and that's always important to check back we need to be sensitive to the impact of medical illness on development and we want to structure and try to be more routine in the hospital we don't tend to do that and I have to say nursing you know is very good at detecting to the patient's needs but it's way easier for a nurse to attend to if you say I have a headache then they prop your pillows I'm gonna give you pill and then you start crying and they're like can I get you that pill honey and they leave the room because they it makes nurses uncomfortable when patients are crying so we need to get better at handling patient distress as it is and we also need to distrain to treat pain and distinguish between physical pain and don't pain alright and lastly you know we really want to get them health more integrated and provide more research on what might be actually part of the disease and what might not be so we had some indication that maybe there are some learning issues in CJD maybe there are so there's definitely some immune deficiencies that go to the brain so we were just we need to study those more closely in the future all right I wish I had the magic wand to fix all these problems but and we are not here yet but we will get there thank you very much [Applause] so I want to thank everybody for the conference organizers for inviting me and allowing me to learn from you guys and I wonder if any of you are like me my first night here did you spend the night in the elevator trying to figure out how to get to your room that's been the biggest challenge of more than genetics so my assignment was how do I get how do you get CJD so we're going to start off with just some very very basic genetic concepts and then we'll move on into some things about DNA and then the inheritance I expect most of you in here all of you in here are very familiar with this but it's just to get us on the same page so just as this is a blueprint and it gives and it contains all the information that a builder would need to to build a structure so in here would be the electrical things the heating and air everything that would be needed to build that structure so the human has the same blueprint has a blueprint and that's the chromosomes and that's the master plan for human development and functions so embedded in these chromosomes is the master plan for how we all look how we all feel how we all function this is what the chromosome pattern looks like for males we all have 23 pair or 46 chromosomes and everything is exactly the same between chromosome 1 and chromosome 22 before between males and females the males have the X chromosome and the Y chromosome there's a little bit of genetic material on this Y chromosome this is the female chromosome pattern also karyotype and the female has two x chromosomes so the first kind of the first drill that will let me back up we have pairs of chromosomes we get half of the set from one parent the other half from the other parent so sort of the first rule of nature is that we all need 23 pair of these chromosomes if there are more or if there are is less genetic material then it can cause some problems here is an example of too much genetic material and Down syndrome as we know is also called trisomy 21 and it has an extra copy of the 21st chromosome and that's why those young people and babies and adults look more like each other possibly than their biological relatives because this extra chromosome of 21 is what causes the features that they have we also know that adults with trisomy 21 have a higher incidence and are more vulnerable to Alzheimer syndrome or Alzheimer's disease so that is something we've learned from that population this is an example of not enough genetic material so these are women that are born with just one chromosome one X chromosome and they're missing their second and we these women are usually under five feet in height and have problems with female ovarian and uterine development and so childbirth can be an issue we also know now that the most common cause of first trimester miscarriages is the result of this chromosome pattern in the fetus so there's something about needing either the Y chromosome or the second X chromosome for reproductive fitness now this is the I have pull of here the whole chromosome is not missing we have chromosome five and it's completeness and the second part of chromosome five is missing at the very top and there are hundreds of genes in that little section of material that is absent and so this kind of chromosome breakage or pattern causes a condition call creature shock cry of a cat and these children are very small they're very underdeveloped they have very weak cry and they have developmental delays so the things that I just showed you are visible to the naked eye with the help of a microscope so if we let cells expand and we let those chromosomes grow and put them under the microscope we can see these long structures so extra material and missing material is possible to just see with the help of a microscope what we did in the first probably 40 years in genetics was this was the main test we had if someone had a child with a birth defect or a very serious illness this test was done and 50% of the time chromosomes were completely normal and we had no way of saying to them that this would happen again or what the recurrence risk would be in the family now I'd like to take it just a little deeper and I'm gonna ask you to visualize the chromosomes as a necklace so we can see the necklace with her naked eye but we can't see the beads on the string and the beads on the string are the chromosomes so what the human genome project has allowed us to learn is that each chromosome carries thousands of beads or thousands of genes and if we counted up those genes across all 46 chromosomes this is what we had about twenty twenty one thousand five hundred genes that's all of us and when I did genetics back in the Dark Ages we used to tell families we thought we had about 80 to 100 thousand genes and this is more specifically what we have so that just like there are rules for the chromosomes we have to have 46 or 23 pair there are also rules about how the gene looks and we're going to break open one and just look at it and I consider a gene a little like a recipe it is finit some instruction that the DNA machinery reads to build a protein or to build a some part of the body and the rules that we have first of all you can see that this sentence of instruction the alphabet is AC G and T these are the DNA this is the DNA alphabet you can also see that in this sentence of instruction each word is three letters long so that's another rule each gene all 21000 has a start message which is ATG on every gene that's like preheat the oven for a recipe and every gene has a stop message and it's either TGA taa or t AG so those are the rules every route every gene has a start message that tells the DNA machinery all right we're gonna start reading this next sentence and to figure out what to what to add next every letter must be three letters long and every gene has a stop message take out and cool if we're gonna use a recipe analogy now here is what those three letter words do every time the DNA machinery is reading through that sentence and it sees one of these letters it drops in this ingredient or this amino acid arginine these losing my mouth the seven yeah I like this one better I'm too to use that one Darla thank you so here are the seven the next one arginine you can see the seven letters seven words there and the DNA machinery drops in one of these and then there's the start ATG and then these are the three stop messages so let's just see how that looks so there's our DNA sentence of instruction and here's our start message and then TAC is the code to drop in that ingredient or that amino acid or that building block and it just keeps right on going reading those each each word and dropping in the right amino acids so there's 20 amino acids that are indicated by these words these 64 words so now there's one other thing you see the capital letters and you see the little letters and we call the capital letters that fit in these boxcars exons and the little letters that fit in between are the introns those are the connectors and as you saw in the previous slide all of these letters and caps indicate to the DNA machinery which ingredient to drop in next and then it gets two little letter GTG that means stop take a break we're not going to add anything for a while it's the DNA machinery still reads through all of the letters until it gets to a AG that means break times over now we add these things G C a and it's so at the end of every boxcar or every exon is GTG and if before the starting exon is a AG those are just some of the basic genetic trivia rules about the DNA now this is me trying to be cute and asking you and three letter words are you understanding this does this make sense am I making it clear okay so now we said a few minutes ago that 21,500 jeans is about what we have but they're not all the same size they don't all have the same numbers of letters in them so one of the conditions that we worked on in NIH for several years is a condition called Alps in the gene that causes that condition is called fast and that's a relatively small gene it has 1836 AC T's and G's another condition that we've worked on for many years at NIH is hyper IgE syndrome or Jobe syndrome and that gene that causes that condition is called stat3 and it's a little bigger it has 75,000 letters in it and here's breath cancer gene with a hundred thousand letters but look at this one the disdain muscular dystrophy gene is over 2 million letters long and it fits into 79 of those boxcars so just with this little bit of information what would you guess is the total number of AC T's and G's for all 21,000 genes 3 billion so let's just put that into context if we had a truckload or several truckloads of AC T's and G's and our assignment was to make three letter words and start filling up encyclopedias we could start at the bottom down the ground and keep going till we had enough encyclopedias to reach the top of him Washington Monument and that's how much DNA is in one cell so that one cell comes packaged with how many chromosomes 46 or 23 pair that carry 21,000 genes that are spelled with 3 billion letters that's a pretty tightly packed cell all right so now let's look at what can go wrong within the DNA that causes disease and causes unwanted things so our first rule was every word had to have 3 letters right so if something happens and a letter is left out or deleted what does the DNA machinery do to fix that it borrows one from its neighbour so here's how the senate's is supposed to read preheat the oven then add tyrosine but now that's been changed to serine what's supposed to be there was lysine has now been changed to arginine alanine has now been changed to leucine so let's just go back to the kitchen a minute and use a cooking analogy and this was a very simple instruction for chocolate-chip cookies preheat the oven add some flour and get some sugar and get the chocolate chips and now it's preheat the oven and add peanut butter and pickles and something else so that doesn't make very good chocolate-chip cookie recipe so this mistake is called this spelling mistake is called a frameshift now I'm calling these spelling mistakes when you're in talks and you're reading literature or you're hearing news about genetic discoveries the word you're hear the word you'll hear is mutation just flip that and that means there's a spelling mistake that's been found in a particular gene so this is a frameshift what does this TGA mean stop look at this word here T GC if an a is substituted there look what happens so the rest of this recipe does not get added so if this is the protein for making a heart or contributing to an eye or something we've missed about 15 ingredients and that can't be good in the recipe and it's not very good when it happens in the DNA machinery and this is called a premature stop and then the last one that I'll just show you is this particular word GAA is the code word freak with a macaque we can keep the three-letter rule we can substitute another one but it puts in a different ingredient and again using the recipe analogy if our recipe calls for s alt and there's a typo in the recipe you're in the cookbook and it puts in sa nd we can do that but it may not be something your relatives will have seconds for so those are the common there's way more complicated may way many other kind of mutations that occur but these are the common ones that happen and it can cause anywhere it happens it can cause disease like cancer or cystic fibrosis or you know PKU or any of the the primary immune deficiency diseases and genes that we find so this one's called a missense now he saw a really good slide in the opening talk this morning when dr. new tarantula showed the graph of the increasing number of genes that have been identified that caused primary immune deficiency and so we're gonna talk about those the ones that cause CJD now so there's one called the n CF one neutrophil cytosolic factor that's on chromosome seven and there's two genes there because it takes two hits to cause CJD you all know this the second one is on chromosome 1 and that's n CF 2 the third one n CF 4 is located on chromosome 23 and the fourth one is CY VA the set excited cytochrome B alpha unit is also on chromosome 10 and then I put this one in a different color because it's located on chromosome X and so all the red color take two hits one from each parent to cause CJD to occur the blue one just causes is just learn from one parent and that's the mom and it's carried on the X chromosome so just let's look at the inheritance pattern of that well first of all what does the disease cause what what does the mutation in these genes do in the body and as you know it impairs phagocytosis so this just shows the phagocyte ingesting the bacteria and or it absorbs it and it doesn't ingest it it fails to ingest it for younger children they may think of it this way that you know some like pizza and some others just like bacteria and then there's the pac-man theory where the phagocytes just try to inhale the ingestion that way the material that way so now let's look at inheritance pattern so we've started with a recessive CF gene and I just picked the one on chromosome 7 so mom has one copy on one chromosome 7 of a misspelled gene the same gene on the other chromosome is spelled correctly so the red indication in the red circle indicates the misspelled gene on each parent on one chromosome so I said at the beginning that each parent gives half of their material their genetic material passes half of their genetic material to their child so let's see what happens now so mom in this case passes on her ncf gene in this case the f father passes on his healthy chromosome seven the next possibility is a mom gives her healthy chromosome 7 dad can give his healthy chromosome 7 now we have to deal with dad mom gives her healthy dad gives his copy of the gene and the fourth option is where each parent contributes the CJD gene which then causes the disorder so what we're left with if we combine all of these is that there's a 50% chance with this couple that a child will be a carrier and that's indicated here and here there's a 25% chance that the child will not be a carrier and that's indicated here and then there's a 25% chance that the child will have CJD and this chance occurs with each pregnancy so you could have this happen 100 times you could have this happen every time you could have this happen it's just with each pregnancy these are the four possible recurrence risks that could occur now let's look at the parent with CJD and what happens when that parent starts having children are considering a family so you can see right off the bat that this parent only has a CJD to contribute so every child will be a carrier but unless the other parent as a CJD carrier also then you don't have to worry about the risk of CJD as much but that every child from that Union will have will be a carrier now let's look at the CY BB x-linked carrier again mom is going to contribute in this case her x that's unaffected with the normal spelling of the gene dad's gonna give his X is that gonna be a male or a female two X chromosomes right non-carrier female all right mom gives again her normally spelled CJD dad gives his Y so this is a male is it sick correct the healthy male now we've got to deal with that pesky gene so now mom contributes the CTD gene dad contributes the healthy X this is a carrier female is she sick by and large no and then we have the case where one out of four of affected male so this mom has a 50% risk of passing it to every any child whether it's a girl or a boy but she also has the same exact risk of not passing it on so that's where I usually like to leave that message that you have just as equal chance of not passing it on as you do and then let's look at the adult male with CJD you already know this that the mother's going to give one X the other X is going to come from dad and that means all of the daughters that that man has will be a carrier and all of his sons will be healthy and that's it so what questions can I answer for you great I enjoy talking [Applause]", "f-9Zk3b9nPk": "[Music] hi welcome to the Lifeline season Marty

plan that I have made for myself based on an alley Makua Wii video I will post it in the description box below if you want to see how she did it I had watched her video a few weeks ago and was just kind of blown away by the food she was eating and then still able to lose weight so I wanted to go ahead and try my own version of it I did week one a few weeks back and then just kind of got off track and was doing other stuff and didn't do week two right after I did week two this last week and I'm gonna do week 3 next week but if you haven't seen my week 1 video I'll put it in the cards above the results were very different than it was in this video and the the foods I was eating were they were the same in that my main meal was the same but the desserts I was eating was different this last week as well so definitely check that one out but what I'll do is I'll go ahead and show you each day what I was eating and I'm not gonna do daily weigh-ins I'm just gonna show you my beginning weight and then my ending weight and i will total up the weight loss for the week so without further ado i'll go ahead and show you my first weigh-in and first day of eating day 1 so i'm having a hard time today i'm gonna go ahead and have this snack pack it's a sugar-free jell-o zero carbs i think it's like 5 or 0 calories but i'll have this to kind of hold me over until dinner I did some meal prep yesterday and I have to cut up sausages in here I'm gonna go ahead and heat that up have that for dinner with some mustard ok so this is what I will have for dinner it's two sausages and some mustard I have just this really cheap mustard that I got a grocery outlet it's zero carbs and zero calorie have that and then I'll wait a while to have dessert so I'm gonna have a couple pieces of this strawberry jell-o dessert has a mascarpone cheese in it and a pack of jell-o I believe that's it I made it a few weeks ago and it's a little bit crystallized around the edges but it still tastes really good I took a bite out of one of the pieces but I'm gonna go ahead and have two little squares of that and I think I should be good for the rest of the night so I just had my first piece and now I feel really stuff so I'm gonna go ahead and put this piece back it's really good I wouldn't say it's rich I just needed a little something sweet I might have that later okay so I'm having a hard time waiting the for dinner so I'm gonna have some of these I've had already seven I think I'm gonna call that quiz one carb for nine pieces seventy calories so I didn't have these sugar-free Jolly Ranchers anymore so I went ahead to happy they're really tasty though they have all different flavors super yummy but definitely don't eat to make these okay I have my two meal prep sausages again have some mustard and then I also added some barbecue sauce today this is the G hues Hickory that's the nutrition but I only put it very little bit and I'll use those two sauces and I'll have dessert probably in a little bit but if you haven't tried hot link sausages with barbecue sauce it is amazing so I think for dessert tonight I'm gonna have some of this kind of like strawberry fluff with it which is the mascarpone cheese I think it's half a cup of water and a jello pot I'm gonna have some of this in a bowl and top it with some whipped topping okay so I was really looking forward to dessert but you can only eat about half of this it's just it's very satisfying I don't feel like I need to eat a whole bunch so I'm gonna put this back and have it another time I went ahead and had eight of these sugar-free Finland bears had these yesterday and they didn't seem to affect my weight loss so I'm gonna head and had eight right now because I'm feeling hungry and it's not even close to dinnertime so to try to hold me over till dinner I'm having one of these strawberry lemonade ices I haven't tried this flavor before but it's actually pretty good I thought it'd be really tangy but it's very mild but it's got a good flavor to it I like it only two o'clock but I'm really hungry so I'm gonna go ahead and have one sausage and then the other one I will have a little bit later okay so I'm having my other sausage here I have some barbecue sauce and some mustard same mustard I've been using and same barbecue sauce I've been using but this combo is really good because this is this mustard super tangy and this Hickory barbecue sauce is a little sweet on a spicy it's just all the things that's so good but I'm gonna go ahead and eat this and I might have a little bit of dessert right after we'll see okay so after dinner I'm wanting something sweet but not quite my dessert yet I'm gonna have one of these diet dr. pepper cream sodas for some reason diet soda is just tasting like carbonated water to me so I can't really say how great this tastes occasionally I will get a sip that tastes kind of like vanilla but it's been just tasting like carbonated soda but I think that's just something with my taste buds right now so I'm gonna have one of these just to have something a little sweet and then I'll show you when I have dessert I went ahead the rest of this bag which had probably eight pieces left which is about one carb seventy calories but I was feeling hungry first thing in the morning so I had that feeling hungry it's about 12:00 I'm gonna go ahead and put in the freezer let's diet dr. pepper cream soda and hopefully that will hold me over until the afternoon time or dinner okay so it's still a little early for dinner but not by much just by like 30 minutes I went ahead and cut the sausages the middle just to make them a little thinner and then I'll chop them into little pieces and then got my mustard and barbecue sauce just like yesterday and that's what I'll have for dinner so I'm feeling like having something salty but I don't want to have too much of anything so I cut up this pepper jack cheese it is 110 calories for 1 ounce which is an eighth of the block so I cut it in half and then cut each of those pieces and how and I just went ahead and had one of the little squares I didn't do a perfect job cutting you could see that like some of these are a little bit thicker than other but I just can't cut straight so I really feel like having another square but I don't think I can fit it in my calories so I think I'm gonna go ahead and have dessert before I eat something I'm not supposed to I'm gonna have for dessert two of these caramel cup slim-fast keto fat bomb I don't know if I test my ketones with these yet I can't remember but each of them are 90 calories and I'm gonna have two so each is also one met carb eight grams of fat so that should fit into my calories I've been a lot of myself about 400 calories or dessert and since I had that cheese I've had a couple of these I think I will be okay and these are really satisfying so I'm gonna go ahead and have two so it's ten o'clock and I'm feeling hungry I am going to have eight pieces of these gummy bears that'll be about 70 calories it is about two o'clock I'm going to have one of my sausages with some mustard and some Chi Hughes barbecue sauce so I don't really feel like having one of my other sausages but I am gonna have one of these two good yoghurts because if you like something a little bit sweet but not quite my jello they're only 80 calories per cup and they are three total carbs so we'll see if this kind of stops me from losing weight or not but I kind of just felt like it's the last day of my slim down so I figured why not so it's five o'clock I'm gonna have my dessert I'm gonna have two of these you know slim fast fat bombs the caramel cups they're so tasty we have two of these hopefully that's gonna be enough to hold me over for the rest of the night I'm not gonna have cheese today to see if that makes a difference in my weight loss I am just feeling snacky so I am going to have two bags of these smart sweets there are only 80 calories each so I'll still be below my 1154 calories for the day okay so my beginning weight was 137 point two and then you just saw my ending weight was 132 point two I think that is crazy I think I lost a little bit more than that during the five-day egg fast but I was only eating eggs for that so I'm I'm really blown away in my first keto slim down week I was much more strict with it I only had the sausage and mustard and then I only had ghido fluff that I made which was just like cream cheese and jello but this week as you saw I did different variations for dessert and I wasn't quite sure how I was gonna work out but I actually lost almost twice as much weight so in the last keto slim down week that I did I lost 2.8 pounds so my 5 pound weight loss this time was almost twice what I lost the first time so I was pretty blown away by that I'm gonna still play with it and definitely do some things different next week but as of right now I'm really happy with my results and I haven't been feeling like I've been deprived or anything but being able to test my ketones for a couple of different dessert variations was very helpful and then also see if I got kicked out of ketosis but I still lose weight and I know I didn't show it but I had tested my ketones for keto fat bombs from [Music] slimfast and also the peach rings I'll have a product review video coming out showing you those ketone tests but even after having the keto fat bombs and two bags of the patrons which even I thought was a bit excessive but I was still able to lose a full pound from yesterday so that's kind of interesting and I'm gonna keep that in mind during this next week and kind of have those desserts as like a fallback for you know there's some variety because it can definitely it can be hard doing the same thing every day eating the same food every day so I want to have some sort of variety and I've been so scared to have any other dessert options while doing this slim down because Ali MacGraw we had such great results and she didn't like venture out at all so it's like a recipe you know all the ingredients and all the measurements are there and I'm too afraid to alter the measurements at all because I think that like just one little tweak is gonna just mess all of it up and then the outcomes not gonna be the same so I had been worried about doing that in week one but week 2 I was wanting to venture out a little bit because I was struggling a little bit more by being able to have different sweets and having that variety really helped so I'm definitely do that next week I'm going to keep my main meals the same as those hot links because I think that fat is really important in the weight loss results that I'm seeing so I'm gonna continue that but definitely keep an eye out for my week 3 video will probably come out in a couple weeks just because I have a week to do it and then I have to edit it and stuff and editing it actually takes a lot of time I know I'm not the greatest editor but even though it doesn't come out that beautifully it still takes a long time to do so anyways with that being said that is all I have for you guys today a please give this video a thumbs up if you liked it I would really appreciate your feedback drop me a comment if you have any questions about what I did this week or anything keto related I will try and help the best that I can but I really just love talking to you guys and talking anything keto related so definitely drop me a comment I'd love to get to know you guys but I will see you guys in the next one bye", "BzmZ_sb5dZk": "Cannabidiol -- also known as CBD -- is so\nhot right now. It\u2019s sold in pills, as an oil, in gummies,\nas a cream, a vape liquid, and even in bath bombs. CBD is one member of a group over 100 chemicals\ncalled cannabinoids that are produced by the marijuana plant. Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is another,\nmuch more famous one. It\u2019s the reason weed gets people high. So THC and CBD are produced by the same plant\nand their structures look really similar. Which raises the question: could you fail\na drug test by using CBD? Even though the structures of THC and CBD\nlook very similar, they act quite differently in your body. So far, the evidence suggests that CBD does\nnot get you high, nor does it produce any of the other classic THC symptoms: hunger,\ndizziness, hunger, difficulty concentrating, hunger, nausea, hunger, elevated heart rate,\nhunger, dry mouth, hunger, hunger, and the munchies. And what about drug tests? Urine marijuana drug screens test for one\nspecific metabolite of THC. They don\u2019t test for CBD. But there\u2019s two pieces of maybe bad news. First, because the structure of CBD and THC\nare so similar, some scientists were concerned that CBD might be converted to THC by your\nstomach acid. It\u2019s not too crazy of a hypothesis. Acids catalyze ring closures every day of\nthe week. And a few years ago, some researchers did\nin fact use a delicious sounding mixture called \u201csimulated gastric fluid,\u201d which is basically\nacid, table salt, and a few other things, to convert CBD to THC. But they did this reaction in a test tube. Or a beaker. Or maybe an Erlenmeyer flask. The point is, it wasn\u2019t in a person. A few studies since then have fed people pretty\nhigh doses of CBD and tested for THC in their blood and stomach contents, finding none. But CBD isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. The bigger problem is that, because over-the-counter\nCBD products are not regulated by the FDA, there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019re getting\nwhat the label says you\u2019re getting. Back in 2017, doctors at UPenn analyzed the\nCBD and THC concentrations of 84 CBD oils, tinctures, and vape liquids, and found measurable\nlevels of THC in 18 of the samples -- that\u2019s more than 1 in 5. The levels were generally low -- but possibly\nhigh enough to set off a drug test. By the way, in that same study, only 26 of\nthe samples had CBD levels within 90-110% of what was on the label. If you\u2019re in the market for CBD, make sure\nyou look at that specific product\u2019s certificate of analysis first -- this a test performed\nby an independent lab to make sure the label is accurate. Make sure that the lab checked for THC, too\n-- sometimes you\u2019ll see relatively high levels of THC, right there in the fine print. You should also know that CBD has not been\nFDA approved for concentration, anxiety, stress, depression, pain, or almost any of the other\nthings it\u2019s being advertised for. As of right now, there\u2019s only one FDA-approved\ndrug containing CBD, for hard to treat seizures. So, could you fail a drug test by taking CBD? We gotta remind you that we\u2019re a YouTube\nchannel, and not a doctor, but our conclusion is: if you\u2019re 100% sure that your product\ncontains CBD and nothing else, you\u2019re extremely unlikely to fail a drug test for marijuana. But, given how often CBD products are not\naccurately labeled and how often THC was detected in them, it actually seems plausible that\nyou might fail a drug test because of a mislabeled or poorly analyzed CBD product. So in the end, your mom is probably right. Better safe than sorry. Have you ever had any unexpected CBD experiences? Let us know in the comments, and we\u2019ll see\nyou next week."}
