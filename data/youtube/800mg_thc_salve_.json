we're gonna learn how to make cannabis infused a body lotion for moisturizing your skin and also for pain relief also very happy to announce that we have a new scripted comedy series coming up called higher beings please stick around to the end of the video and learn how you can support that project on IndieGoGo now let's get started here's what you need to make cannabis infused body lotion you need a quarter cup of cannabis infused cocoa butter 1/4 cup of shea butter 1/4 cup of coconut oil 1/4 cup of light oils such as light olive oil and you also need 10 to 20 drops of essential oils for flavoring such as lemon oil mint tea tree oil eucalyptus you can also use some infused coconut oil and place of the cocoa butter in this recipe and then you could also use oil that's been infused with the herbal infuser and you can save $30 on the air blown fuse with a code ruffhouse at herbal infuser calm now let's talk a little about how you can infuse the actual cocoa butter now we've done this recipe a couple of times recently so but I'm gonna go over it real briefly again but basically you grind your cannabis and in this case you don't actually have to decarbonize effects it's time for the other cannabinoids that are in the cannabis and you do not have to actually activate this and you can do some research to find which level of activation you might need to relieve the certain type of pain that you have too but for this case you don't actually have to decarboxylate or activate your cannabis and then you're going to infuse the oil for about one to two hours and when you're done the cocoa butter is going to be a lot darker and if you let it harden it'll harden back up and it melts very easily on your skin temperatures enough to melt it and you can see there it's it's very slick oil and it's I got a lot of moisturizing value for your skin so that's where we're going to be using for a basis for our oil so whether that's melted or not if you just made it and it still melted you you don't really need to melt it anymore but we're gonna go ahead and put that in a heat safe dish that you can put into a double boiler you could use like a canning jar there and we're not gonna actually boil the water we're just barely keeping it just under the it's gonna board just with a little bubble start to go and like I said you could also use cannabis infused coconut oil if you would rather use that instead of infusing the cocoa butter so it's up to you which one of those you infuse or you could infuse both if you want a really really strong but it being so this is not something edible it probably is a waste to try to make it too strong because you're not really going for the THC and you might also use a strong CBD strain or another kind of strain for this depending on your needs for this kind of lotion ok we're also going to take the shea butter and we're taking the other light oil that we're using in this case we're using olive oil a light olive oil and we're combining all of the other ingredients except for the essential oils into our double boiler or into our heat proof dish inside of a hot water bath until it's all melted and once it's all melted and combined you can take that and switch it into a mixing bowl it's gonna be large enough to use a hand and executed and then at that point you can also as the oil is cooling and cooled off a little bit you can add in your essential oils and in this case it's up to you if you add any oils because you could just leave it as it is and it'll have a slightly chocolaty smell because of the cocoa butter but this part is definitely up to your preferences and also for what you use you're using it for if you're using it as an everyday moisturizer you probably don't want to make it very strong smelling or it's gonna overpower your perfume or cologne or whatever or just be overpowering in general but if you're making it for medicinal purposes you might use a lot of mint or eucalyptus or the things that would give it that minty or that medicinal feel and now you're going to put it in the refrigerator for just a few minutes until the bowl gets cold or whatever and you start to see that it's just beginning to thicken a little bit so just when the the viscosity starts to thicken some and that's when you're gonna do this step here and that is to take your hand mixer on high and just keep mixing and mixing as you're whipping in air it's gonna turn lighter and lighter and you do that for three or four minutes until it quits turning lighter and by that time it'll be finished and then you put it back in the refrigerator to harden and then at that point you could also pour it into a containers because it'd be a lot easier while it's still a liquid and then after it hardens and sets in refrigerator you bring it out of the refrigerator at at room temperature it becomes a very soft subtle lotion that you can rub into your skin very easily it really has no real expiration date as long as you keep it sealed keep it out of the light and it's great for pain relief as well it helped me with my psoriasis on the bottom of my foot with a moisture so check that out also check out higher beings this is a new project I'm really excited about and if you're really interested you could help us support that by checking out Andy gogo I'll put links in the description and on the screen here so please check that out it's a new scripted comedy series that we're looking forward to trying out here at Roth house Studios but we need your help I hope you enjoyed this episode on how to make pain relief lotion with cannabis if you did please hit the like button and subscribe to roughhouse Studios for more cannabis culture videos made just for you this is matt from ruff house studios thank you for watching [Music]", "FymCTaaSMDY": "my name is Willie Christie and we're in the kitchen at civilized HQ down here in Venice Beach California we're in the kitchen today because we're going to make some DIY topicals this is going to be an infused topical infused with cannabis obviously doing topicals yourself gives you the freedom to choose you know the quality of flour you want the ratio of THC the CBD you want or other cannabinoids if they're present the scent you like the medium you like you may be vegan you may not want beeswax in your products so this just gives you all the control for the topical we're making today you're gonna need coconut oil shea butter flour cheesecloth a container to put it in and a stove and an oven Toodee carb and to infuse the oil with step one is going to be decarboxylate in your flour what decarboxylated does is it activates all the cannabinoids in the flour if you've ever eaten just raw flour you'll know that you don't get high from it it doesn't have the same effect as inedible versus when you cook it in a brownie per se that's when the psychoactivity starts happening and essentially all that does is remove a co2 molecule from the THCA and it becomes THC so today I've got some Henry's original ritual flour it's CBD flour which I really appreciate around 2530 dollars for this eight it's got 500 milligrams of CBD in there so let's get started so in order to decarboxylate your flour you're going to grind it up and put it in the oven I've got 3.5 grams here I think that's a good start for today you can do more you can do less just do your thing so here we're grinding up the flour this just increases the surface area it helps all the heat reach all the areas of a bud we've got our pile of flour we're just going to spread out a little bit we're gonna try our best to preserve the terpenes by cooking it at a lower temperature we're at 250 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes so now we're putting it in the oven we've got our timer set and we'll check back in in 20 minutes all right so we've got our decarboxylated flour and the next step is putting that into our coconut oil so we got a cup of coconut oil we're gonna start simmering this we're gonna melt the coconut oil and start simmering the flour into it so right now I'm just getting the coconut oil down melting it so it's a liquid the last thing you want to do is burn off any cannabinoids keeping temperatures low and a very low slow simmer is gonna make sure that your cannabinoids are retained and chillin inside of the coconut oil because not only will it be weaker if not completely inactive it'll smell bad it'll taste bad if you're gonna eat it much more to the consistency that I like that's smooth smooth liquid so now that our coconut oil is melted it's clear and it's liquid and its pretty and it smells good we're gonna put our decarboxylated flour into the coconut oil you ready and this this is where the magic happens this is maybe the most important step this is the easiest step to mess up if you let any of this get too hot it's gonna be you're gonna be starting over which nobody wants to do so what I'm doing is just carefully monitoring this a little bit of movement is good that means that he is moving things around but as soon as you see bubbles or smoke or anything like that then it's too hot so patience is key we're gonna start the timer again for 20 minutes and we're just gonna simmer this it's been 20 minutes on the stove I've turned the heat off and we've got ourselves a hot hot little hot little pot of pot alright so the next step we're going to put the cheesecloth over this bowl in order to pour our cannabis in there or cannabis oil and all this cheesecloth is going to do is catch the flower and so we'll just be left with infused coconut oil [Music] so putting on these gloves really lets you get the rest of this oil squeeze out it's gonna be warm it's definitely warm but the gloves help and you're just gonna squeeze that little bit of oil out all right so we've got our coconut oil in our Bowl and our next step is going to be adding the essential oils and adding the shea butter to thicken it up and make it more of a topical I'm not one to put pure coconut oil on my skin some of you might so you can really just stop at this step if you just want to smell like weed and coconut oil these next couple steps are just to kind of make it more for your mom or more for your own personal touch or say you don't want to walk around smelling like a toasted cannabis plant so I'm adding our shea butter in there now so I am now going to put some essential oil in here hopefully that's too much because I love this smell yeah that smells good so I'm just gonna separate these into different jars one of my favorite things about using cannabis flower especially prepackaged cannabis flower is you can use the jar again this is what I'm going to store the topically [Music] very DIY usually you would want to use a funnel or a baster or maybe a pot with a lip that you can pour but you know you work with what you got okay so we've got three different jars they're all the same right now and if you're happy with how it smells if you just want to do one scent for yourself then that's it you're just gonna put these in the fridge and let them chill and once they're cool it's just as just like any other topical but today I'm just adding some more little lips so I've got some Jasmine essential oil put a couple drops and let's see if it's beautiful I think some bergamot oil would be real nice and this one one two three four stir it these little babies up make sure that oil is evenly distributed well the only thing left to do is cool it down here we are four little jars yeah that's it folks we've got our DIY topicals if you're already getting flour at a dispensary if you already live at home if you already cook for yourself it's really not too extreme to be able to put those two together and make yourself a nice little topical or lotion you can add whatever else you want aloe vera gel vitamin E anything else it's the choice is yours as as we say here your body your choice", "L0UpRHIowog": "[Music] hi welcome to Diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular subscriber thank you so much and welcome back I really appreciate your support it does mean the world to me and it's growing and growing I'm so excited I like Wow but anyway so today I'm going to show you two how to do a topical for pain relief using an infused coconut oil and some hocus pocus and to know some essential oils and that put together and this stuff works amazing I use it all the time now I absolutely love it I have a rare genetic disorder called ehlers-danlos syndrome and it's a connective tissue disorder which my body doesn't produce collagen so as my tendons and ligaments stretch out they don't go back so all of my joints are very very loose and although my muscles are constantly sore because they're constantly fighting to hold my joints in place so yeah it's a whole thing but anyway so I've used this and it has been great for inflammation my shoulders and everything so I really wanted to show you how to do it and I hope you do get the sigh of relief from it as well so um I don't think I have anything else to go there I'm gonna get into the as I normally do I'm gonna get into the ingredients and then the directions on how to do it alright well thank you for joining me so these are bombs that I made up earlier so this one is like a bomb like a waxy bomb and this one when we whip it chill it and whip it and multiply it it ends up a lighter or a lighter feel and a lighter texture so it all depends on your preference on what you what you like on your skin I tend to use both so what you're going to need for this is two tablespoons of your infused coconut oil 2 ounces of cocoa butter and you want it to be unrep yer 100% pure unrefined cocoa butter so you don't want anything done to it you want to pure unrefined same thing with the shea butter it's going to be 1 ounce of shea butter and you're use all-natural raw unrefined two tablespoons of all natural beeswax pellets and then we're going to get into our essential oils so for tumeric which is great for the anti-inflammatory as well and so tumeric you can get in a tincture which I've got here you can use it in its spice form but if you use it in its spice form it will be kind of gritty you can also get it in an essential oil unfortunately don't have the essential oil and you can also get it in capsules and it is still powdered form but it's really really fine so I like using this because you really don't feel it at all so that's what I use versus the versus the spice itself then the essential oils that I like to use and I put a list of the description of exactly what each of them do and you can choose which one's work best for you you can eliminate on any other choice you can just pick a few or all but I like this combination I found it works awesome for for inflammation so I've got the tumeric tincture I like I use spearmint eucalyptus lemongrass tea tree frankincense vetiver and lavender and the other thing you want to use is what's called a carrier oil and you could use grapeseed oil sweet almond oil castor oil I think avocado oil I believe is another one and what carrier oils do is you're gonna add your essential oils into the carrier oil before we add it in into our mixture and the reason is is essential oils can be very harsh on the skin and the first time I made it I figured well all this stuff's oily why do I need to add that so I just did it without it and it did I found it made me very itchy but when I add it to the grapeseed oil which they call as a carrier oil for them you I found that there I didn't have any itching at all so that is now what I do so I'll go over all those steps just a moment and then just for your equipment you're just gonna need a double boiler and you just want to use the potty Bowl that you're gonna be keep your stuff in and a spatula or a wooden spoon and also tapioca starch in is an option for you if you would like it helps to make it not so greasy so if you don't like a greasy feeling on your bombs or creams then you can looking at in the tapioca which I really like so depending on how much you can bury again it's I use about a quarter of a cup but again you can test it out and see what feels better for your skin oops yes I'm crushing all right so I'm just gonna get all this cleaned up and we'll put all of our ingredients together alright so the first thing you just set up your double boiler add your water it's important to make sure that the water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you can put that in and you're gonna set your heat to medium to medium-low higher higher to the medium side and we're gonna add in our two tablespoons of our infused coconut oil our two ounces of pure unrefined cocoa butter one ounce of shea butter and our two tablespoons of wax pellets beeswax pellets I use pure organic and you're gonna just kind of mix that in and wait for that to start melting and yeah it's not a whole lot to it so we're just gonna I said let that melt and have everything come together now it's very important do not turn up your heat you want to do it slowly it is very easy to burn any one of these components so you definitely want to melt it slowly over that medium-low heat as it begins to melt you just want to continue to mix periodically mix things so that you're bringing the heated stuff from the bottom up to the to the top and distributing the warm over the coal getting everything melted a little bit quicker and then while our little mixture a little concoction here is melting we can get our essential oils ready okay so you're gonna start with two tablespoons of your carrier oil whichever you decided I use grapeseed the grapeseed oil it's a good neutral good for all skin types it absorbs easily into the skin and yeah but as I said you can find maybe one that works better for your skin if you've got skin issues or yeah the sensitivity or things like that you may find one of the other ones that work better for you so you're gonna add two tablespoons of that and so it said this is my concoction you guys can said kind of do what works better for you this is what I put together that I said that I found really works great for inflammation and a little as well as a lot of my friends have tried it and it has worked really great so I use about one milliliter of the tumeric tincture and then I use one of the capsules of the 3050 milligrams of tumeric the one nice thing about using the capsules is you know exactly how much you're using you just open that up put that in and then I use spearmint as I said if you look in the description you'll find a full explanation to each the essential oils as to why I use them and I use about 20 drops of spearmint and eucalyptus is really good for your inflammation as well and muscle pain and I use about 30 drops of this and if anyone's really actually counting and there's a comment about oh there was 32 I don't want to hear it and lemongrass is awesome plus it smells really nice and again I use about 30 drops of this and then I use tea tree and the reason for the tea tree is it acts as a nice ant is an antiseptic so it takes care of any issues on your skin as well so it is it it helps like I said if it's got any kind of open lose or blemishes or things like that it will help us with that as well and being an antiseptic and I used about 15 drops of this and then ten drops of frankincense whoops that comes out quick stop's expensive too and the vet vetiver now this stuff is really really sick so it doesn't come out of the dropper we got to be very careful well I have to be careful most other people don't and I'm gonna use about ten drops of this and another good one for our skin although I don't like it I don't add it because I hate the smell of lavender but lavender is a great option as well it's a very relaxing and soothing for the muscles but as I said I don't like it don't really find much for me personally I'd anyway again personal option I hate the smell of lavender and then we're just gonna mix all those together now that all your butters and oils are melted here you're just gonna turn your heat down to low and you're just gonna leave it on for a bow we're gonna leave it on for about 20 minutes this is just to make sure everything comes up to the exact same temperature and everything is fully blended and melted together okay I apologize sorry my Stoner gapping move here the tumeric capsule if you use the capsules do not put it into the essential oils so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna just strain that out you're gonna use the capsule put the capsule into the into your shea butter and cocoa butter mixture so I'm just gonna fix that up here by watch it go straighter stop putting a piece of cheesecloth I doubled it up and applauding it into a small strainer all this stuff is very expensive so I don't want to waste it so now this isn't going to hurt the anything I'm just removing the chunks in there that we don't really want in a cream and then I'm going to add the capsule into the end of the oil okay so I'm going to add the tumeric capsule into the shea butter and cocoa butter and our beeswax that's where it's supposed to go and you just want to get a whisk a little whisk if you've got one and just whisk that in alright so our mixture has been sitting on the warm on the hot water there for about 20 minutes you're just gonna take it off and you're gonna let it sit on the counter until it cools down a little bit we don't want to add the essential oils when it's really hot because that will it'll burn off on the essential parts of the essential oils so we want to let that cool down a little bit before we're gonna add in the oils for about 5-10 minutes just check the bottom of your bowl if it's just warm to the touch then we're good but if it still feels hot wait a little bit so that feels good so now we're going to take a Nadder and add in our essential oils and you're gonna get a whisk and we're gonna whisk that in alright so here you got some options if you just want a waxy balm you can go ahead and pour it into your containers like this if you would like to take away some of the grease enos of it you can add in the tapioca starch so I'm gonna add in a quarter cup and you're gonna whisk that in again the tapioca is optional I like it though it makes it feel a lot nicer you just use a spatula to get anything off the sides I just continue to whisk whisk that until it is all known all all smooth sorry you want it nice and smooth like that so as I said if you just want to have a bomb then you can go ahead and pour it into your containers I'm gonna do a little bit of both I'm gonna do poor part one so the poor one is a bomb and then show you how to emulsify and make it a lighter texture so I'm just gonna pour the liquid just doesn't do it I'm just doing a bomb and I pour that let that set up and now you're just gonna let these you're gonna let this sit on the counter until it partially solidifies so we're going to wait for it to solidify about halfway and then we're going to start the beating process now this will solidify fairly quickly because of all of what the Watts that we have in it but less wax you use the longer it's going to take to to solidify now you can put it into the refrigerator to assist with it but it'll go fairly quickly like I said right now because we've got the wax up quite a bit of wax in there but if you do want to speed up the process you can definitely put it in the fridge for about three to five minutes but don't forget about it all right so you want your bomb now to be like this so you see how it's partially solidified here on the sides it's kind of solid but in the middle we're still liquidy and you're gonna get your hand mixer or blender or whisk you can use whoops and we are going to continue to mix this until it is all one homogeneous uniform factory [Music] all right so I'm just gonna let this sit again and let it solidify around the edges again and we're gonna repeat the process and each time we do you're gonna see the the product keep getting lighter and lighter all right so it's sort of quite a bit more on the sides there during your mixing process you can always test your bond to see how it feels and make sure that you like it for your texture so it's gonna be a lot more solid once it solidifies and sets however you want to see what it's actually gonna feel like just take a little bit rub it on the back of your hand and see how that feels so first it'll be a greasy L feel greasy but that tapioca you'll notice it'll start to nod not feel it and then you just want to work it in so it may be a little bit yellow on the skin but as you work it in that yellow will go away okay so I would just put it back into the freezer for about two minutes and I'm going to continue the process all right so you can see now that our pain balm is all one uniform texture we whatever we pull off the size is the exact same we're not getting any separation wax or anything like that and that's how you know that is fully blended there and it's gonna make a nice light bomb for you so now we're ready to pour it into our containers I just want to smack them down so they're nice and fun get out any air bubbles and that's it you can let them sit out on this counter for a couple of hours to fully set or you can put them into the fridge or the freezer to quicken that up and I'm gonna put these into the fridge probably for about a half an hour and then we'll all come back and we'll test it out right so my pain bombs here have set up and this was the one that I did just as wax and I didn't whip it up there and you can see it's darker my lighting is a little bit tough here to see it's pretty bright and then this one's a lot lighter so I said you can it'll just give you a little bit different texture totally up to you it's just a preference thing you're not gonna get any different benefits either way so we're just gonna give it a try here you see so you see how it goes on a little bit yellow and then you just work it in and there you go then you can see that grease enos it was first there at tapioca that's what takes that away so it just feels really nice on your skin as well and that's it so now you can make your own pain bombs at home without caught us thinking absolutely well not gonna lie it's a little bit expensive if you go with all those essential oils I highly recommend doing research on buying them your local if you go to your local health food store it's gonna cost you an absolute fortune I do recommend Amazon has great prices on essential oils a couple of things with regards to essential oils make sure that they are 100% essential oils and that they are pure that the other is that they're actually essential oils because you will also see essential oil fragrances and that is just extracting the fragrances from your different your different herbs and roots and same things so you want to make sure it's essential oils 100% pure and that's about all I can say with regards to that if you have any questions at all as always don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll always get back to you if you have anything else any suggestions or anything I'd love to hear from you other than that I hope you enjoyed the video and you have a wonderful rest of your day thanks for watching [Music]", "wA5wg8JqoDw": "[Music] welcome back to torpy eyes in today's video i'm going to show you how i make skin cream that has thc and cbd in it this cream is amazing for sore muscles dry skin sunburns and any other type of skin irritation that you might have [Music] this mixture of products is pretty simple but does amazing job for the body all these items can be found at a store nearby you're going to need coconut oil aloe vera gel and skin cream i have a lot of muscle pain and dry skin so this mix of products is fast acting and doesn't leave my skin greasy the first step in this process is to infuse your coconut oil with the thc and cbd this can be done in a few different ways i found it to be easiest using a slow cooker you can do it on your stove top using a double boiler if you don't have access to a slow cooker i picked up this slow cooker at walmart for about 15 coconut oil is a great product to use because it's all natural and has little to no order it's one of the best binding agents for cannabis both cannabis and coconut oil are really good for treating inflammation to infuse the coconut oil with thc and cbd you measure out the amount of oil you want to make then measure out how strong you want your final product to be for my mix i want about a half milligram per one milliliter of final product i'll leave my mix amount in the description below simply put the coconut oil into the slow cooker then add one cup of water the water is added to create a volume for the slow cooker so you don't burn the product then add your thc or cbd you can use just thc or just cb or combine them both just like me it's all personal preference i grew the harley quinn vx4 strain a little while back it's a one-to-one ratio strain which gave me both thc and cbd [Music] i leave the coconut oil in the slow cooker on low for three to four hours then it's time to separate the oil from the canops and water i use multiple layers of chew cloth and a fine metal strainer be sure to use a heat resistant container because the oil is pretty hot i always go with a collab [Music] me once you have the oil in the glass bowl i put it into the fridge overnight this not only lets the coconut oil to get hard but it also separates the oil and water you can remove the hard coconut oil out of the bowl and then drain the water out since i use ice water hash instead of cannabis flour you see my coconut oil didn't get much color to it usually when you use bud you'll get a very green end result now that we have our coconut oil infused with the thc and cbd we can go ahead and mix everything else together for the cream i use a cream that i prefer any cream will do though this one also has vitamin e in it and doesn't leave my skin greasy so that's why i chose it [Music] as for the aloe vera gel this is great for reducing pain and soreness reducing the healing time of burns and it also contains vitamin a and c [Music] since our coconut oil is hard we're gonna have to warm it up a bit so it's easier to measure out i just put it into the microwave for a few seconds once i've measured it out to the proper amount i put it into the blender's container and place it back into the fridge for 15 minutes this is to thicken it up since our other two ingredients are a bit thicker than the oil for this mix i used 200 milliliters of the coconut oil and 300 milliliters of the aloe vera gel you can use all-natural rear from a plant but it may not last as long i've never used the plant form so i'm not 100 sure [Music] time to add the lotion this container of lotion is 220 milliliters so i use the entire thing [Music] i'm using a ninja blender i set it on low and let it mix for one minute i take it out of the blender shake it around by hand then put it on low again for another minute if you want you can add essential oils to the mix but i like mine as odorless as possible i like to reuse the lotion container that it came in and also any editor i put into a tupperware [Music] container

look for me personally on Instagram I don't have a business channel yet however I have my own a moist person videos on there most importantly guys if you are watching this video please take a second to like and subscribe to the channel I'm constantly doing product video product demo videos and when I do when I launch a video you'll get an email notification that way you'll have first dibs at the products when they come in today I am so excited I finally got in my company's DVD saw this is hemp remedies reliefs of what makes this sub different than the majority of the other sobs on the market is the other sobs made by the big manufacturers have about fifty milligrams sometimes 100 milligrams of CBD in a two ounce jar now those are excellent products I sold many of them so I always say in my videos I was one of the first in the industry I've been in the business since 2013 prior to that I had a medical marijuana company so I've been around for a long time I have also been the sole CBD provider to numerous patient groups so I've have a lot of interaction with people and how the products work the sobs that were on the market prior to this fifty maybe a hundred milligrams of CBD many great products they were all made with the same starting oil all of these manufacturers used the same starting oil to make their products that was imported in from the Netherlands it's quality oil guys non-gmo organic pesticide free organically grown I've seen I used to sell it by the kilo I've seen labs on every single batch while the stalk and stem oil is great oil what you're not getting is the terpenoid profiles minor cannabinoid profiles as well that you find in the flower of the plant and that's because importation rules would not allow them to use the flower so everything was made with the stalk in stem oil which again same CBD and the stalkin stem is the same CVD that's in the flower you just didn't get that big minor turpenoid or minor cannabinoid and turpenoid profiles that you would find in flower oil so you don't get the entourage effect in Turkey an interplay this is my new Saab I am starting it out at five I have it at 500 and 1000 milligrams of CBD in a two ounce jar way stronger way more much more CBD in these products than you would find in the other manufacturers and it's true whole plant so that means that the stalk and stem what I was still used which is excellent Oriole it has all of the fats and healthy oils that you find in the plant that's very good for you but it's also got oil from the flower as well so you get the terpene or clay you get all the terpenes in there the minor cannabinoids much more relief much higher quality product so I'm very excited about this and to bring those guys to you it's going to be on the website now I am waiting for labels to be finalized and shipped to me until then I will be shipping it out without labels with a CoA stating what's in the product right from the lab yeah very excited about those guys I also have a texture that's in a 2 ounce bottle that's whole plant it's got no glycerin Zoar any type of additives to it it's in a coconut oil base the flavorings natural orange made from distilled oranges and I also have them lavender from distilled lavender plants so everything is all-natural the textures go 500 milligrams all the way up to 5000 and I have a vioient made the same way it's in a coconut oil base so there's no polyethylene glycol and a vegetable glycerin all natural flavors from either distilled oranges or lavender so I'm excited about that that should be on the website in the next couple of days and of course I made the world's first legal CBD CBD dad back in 2014 called early I have that out right now at 800 milligrams per gram or 1 ml serving whole plant pesticide free organically grew and just like all the other products and I have the new wax crumble got a sample of that right here this is just mind-blowing stuff it's a true wax crumble from whole plant oil CBD on

grateful if you shared any of these videos on your Facebook page Facebook is not allowing me to run sponsor two ads again so that's super appreciated and keep your eyes peeled for my next video", "y2tgvFXbYL4": "[Music] uh [Music] nice [Music]", "5KflhpfYzvQ": "your testimonials on your website these things run the gamut you know you have it treating sports injuries chronic back pain cancer radiation burns acne you're talking about circulatory issues you know especially for the for the folks out there tell us the science how do these oils and lotions work you know especially for such a wide variety of issues so my understanding of it which is limited because there hasn't been enough studies yet and I can't wait to learn more about how these actually work but my understanding of it is that the cannabinoids respond to your peripheral nervous system your you have an endocannabinoid system which we as humans have this yeah every human has an endocannabinoid system and it's kind of a regulatory homeostasis system and there's two kinds of receptors there's cb1 receptors which are in your brain and those are the ones that mostly respond to THC and that will give you these psychedelic or a psychoactive you know experience and then you've got the cb2 receptors which are found in your peripheral nervous system and they deal with you injure yourself or you if you have pain they will interact with either your own natural endocannabinoids that your body produces or cannabinoids from cannabis so the topical seem to work with responding to the cb2 receptors in your peripheral nervous system the THC doesn't act actually go into the blood I'm pretty sure I've done like a bunch of drug tests on yeah at least for now is that you're not going to fail a drug test you're going to feel psychoactive effects yeah and so people typically don't feel any sort of psychoactive effect it doesn't seem to get into your blood system it just seems to interact with these cb2 receptors so dealing with the issue right where you put the SAP or the topical on the skin and these cb2 receptors will help the healing response and will help bring your body back to homeostasis once they connect you know with the cannabinoids", "3vrcTHZakaw": "yes yes brothers and sisters out there how are we doing how are we doing yes yes it's me it's me it's the it's justin how are we doing out there we've got a little bit of a review for you people today it's a special one um the ninja's been out and about and um she's managed to get me one of these um i did take one of these on one of my earlier reviews it wasn't like this it was somebody's homemade one that they did um it didn't look like this at all the one i had was flat so obviously let me just show you a bit closer so this is obviously uh the millions rope or rope s milligrams okay so it's quite a high dosage um it's certainly the highest dosage i've had in a sweet up till now there's warnings all over it which is really good so you know the packaging is fantastic it is just like a normal commercial suite you'd have to be careful with this obviously if you had children in the ace or anything like that you'd have to make sure this was really really away from them it does say 18 plus on it it is quite clear that there's cannabis in it let me just read it for you so you know so for um medicinal use only or medical use only keep out a reach of children and and animals so yeah if you've got a dog or a cat they might eat it so yeah it says tear and share uk net weight 52 grams um this is the strawberry flavor so very very nice ingredients organic cane sugar corn syrup gelatin citric acid calories extract full strength that's what i was looking for um color red yellow yellow white beeswax and vegetable oil so yeah there's nothing in there which really sort of alarms me to be fair see all seems pretty kosher um g magic sweet so there you go guys if you've seen them well you must have seen them because at the minute um we get sort of offered more sweets than anything um it's obviously overtaking the market quite a bit at the minute and i would say looking at these products now would tell you that you are getting really really really close to legalization now just look at it look at how it's packaged like say you would not know that or distinguish that from a normal suite right you just wouldn't right so that to me tells me that the cogs are moving they're in movement right first of all i think we're better on [ __ ] bombs right so cheers people one laugh um i'm gonna be obviously making this video which will be the eating video the taste test we'll call it so we'll do the taste test on this video and then obviously after about 60 minutes it says 60 minutes on there which i know that's about right um obviously we'll have a look at the effects and see what it does so um it says there's eight there's eight um servings there um obviously i've got quite a high tolerance so i'm going to take about six servings all in one day all right cheers which would literally be the most of my i've taken in a suite although i took the fifo the other day which is fight a thousand milligrams that's a different catch [Music] [Music] still on the cheese don't judge me for it it's the only flavor i can get in a minute we have had a bit of star dog as well so um but yeah it is it's going a little bit scarce in a minute let's say we're getting more sweets than anything so which is good i'm fine with that give the lungs a little break for a little while right then we'll pop that out for a minute but as you guys know cheers right i think it's about time to uh crack this sweet open that okay so 800 milligrams here we go let's have a look at it first what's it look like can you get it out just [Music] i assume the millions aren't medicated oh rocky now look so basically in a nutshell it's just squishy obviously what's medicated is the jelly in the middle by the look of it so yeah well then let's just stop [ __ ] about josh let's just get it down here it says it's strawberry but it's green [Music] but you can taste the cannabis huh [Music] oh my god we really taste the calorie [Music] stuff i didn't get that taste from the other it's strawberry because there's millions yeah if you see millions if a strawberry but the strawberry's masking oh i can taste it now [Music] you know when you get cannabis in your mouth like fecal or calories oil it burns your mind for a little bit you know i'm getting that almost at the back of my mouth [Music] i mean i wonder if there is an accurate dose [Music] cheers [ __ ] struggling this is breakfast [Music] [Music] [Music] a little bit [Music] i mean what i like about it more than anything is a lot of these sweets they actually mask the taste of the cannabis so it's like has it got anything in it hasn't it got anything i know damn well this has got something in it because i could taste it it's very very strong [Music] oh mate [Music] you're not having it's mine [Music] people [Applause] we'll see how strong this really is i mean i think the peach rings that i did a review on i think they were 400 milligrams and the other edible ones like the the um sour bright crawlers they were 300 milligrams in a packet so 600 milligrams i should really if i had a whole one i think i'd probably be on my back but maybe i'll do a whole one next time we'll see well 600 milligrams [Music] oh dear it's very very strong tasting i did not expect it to taste um as strong as it does in cannabis and it's um it's really really overpowering like i say the other one i had did not i can taste the fika or whatever it is cannabis oil in this it's right in the back of my mouth and it's overpowering but that's good because i know that it's [ __ ] loaded it knows it's loaded [Music] that much a little bit [Music] [Music] wow [Music] that's the only thing with these reviews [Music] looked completely different than the last one i had well the last one i was more flat out it was more like a belt it was more like a belt basically whereas that was like a rope um well it is like a rope you can see it quite clearly it's like a rope so but yeah six doses in one go [ __ ] hardcore you know me and i say if i get a good effect off here i'll get a whole one i'll do a hole in one go one night and see what that's like so oh really it's burning it's burning i know that's not a good advertisement for it but it just it has to if it's got cannabis in it it's gonna have some sort of effect when you eat it you've got to be able to taste it like that it's very very strong what's in that so i would say just i know you can't go by it but just by the taste alone i would say that that was probably a pretty accurate dose either that or they've got some serious cannabis [ __ ] flavoring put into it to make it taste like that which i doubt very very very much so i mean it says it takes um 60 minutes on there we know that edibles can take anywhere from like you know i mean 45 minutes to hour and after it's for the effect so the time is now five past 11 of the so we'll call it 11 o'clock as i started eating it probably five minutes ago because i was chewing it like [ __ ] as you saw um so yeah we'll go from there really we'll see what happens at five past twelve and see what i'm like i'll probably be hunting burgers down by that type well yeah let's get another pipe on the go people so yeah i hope you're all well hope everyone's in a good positive mood love the lovers [ __ ] the haters people yes yes one love here we go [ __ ] cheers fun time please join me smoke up choke up roll up you know where we go from here no mess of the bay we just smoke weed and we get [ __ ] higher yes yes let's do it cheers nice nice people nice nice chest [Music] [Music] hey cheers people peace one love to all of you and have a fantastic day you'll see me really soon anyway because i'll be making another video in an hour's time so um yeah i'll see you really really soon i hope you get a good [ __ ] giggle out of what's going to be coming next because i do tend to go off a little bit while i've added some edibles so peace of my love guys see you really really soon one love cheers for watching", "b5IMYHzYfd0": "disa no marijuana continue to unfold and for one little boy with a rare skin disorder it's been a near miracle well as 13 first reported last May his family was really in the dark they were desperately seeking some answers well now Darcy Spirit shows us how they are seeing the lights all thanks to cannabis cream for Carter gray that is the sound of relief I just got an oil up ahead a massage from mom that means so much more we first met Carter a year ago he suffers from lamellar ichthyosis a rare skin disorder with no cure that causes dark scales where dead skin cells don't flake off despite corrective surgery Carter's skin is so tight he can't even shut his eyes he's forced to spend most of his time inside but his family is hoping this it's a miracle plan that's what it is just might change that it showed us from the first time that we used it thought it was worth continuing to use when we first brought you Carter's story his parents were dealing with industrial sized vats of coconut oil and making some progress but nothing like what's contained in these small jars creams made from cannabis oil an extract of marijuana how would you describe your reaction when you realized you'd found something that worked I cried oh haha a lot I still cry I still I'll be in the bathtub just scrubbing his back and the scales just fall right off into the bathtub Carter's grandma makes the creams in her kitchen giving her grandson a gift no doctor could completely clear like soft as a newborn take a look at these before and after photos of Carter's back and head no scarring no sign that there was ever even any buildup there at all a dermatologist told them there is nothing on the market that I could prescribe you that would give you better results than what you're getting so how does it work dr. Scott Jacobson says cannabis taps into the nature of our own bodies the endocannabinoid system is found throughout the body in the brain in the immune system in the nervous system as well as in the skin actually skin cells have cannabinoid receptors in them and so putting them on topically you're going to get that action directly where it's needed dr. Jacobson also says cannabis is known to reduce inflammation he's gonna do two for Carter and his family you get oh it's a giant leap forward relieved relieved and eager to find out more about what we can well we can do since our first report Carter story has gone international we have a lot more about his journey on ktnv calm Darcy Spears 13 Action News Carter wandering the district I'm", "QKaETKN8Qvc": "now to our new serious prescription free pain relief one in five Americans suffer from chronic pain many are now using CBD for relief google reports six and a half million searches for information in just one month and Becky Worley visited a CBD dispensary to take a closer look Melissa McCarthy reportedly uses it on her feet Gronk says it's changed his life for the first time in more than a decade I am pain free CBD lotions you rub on your skin to reduce pain the idea is that by rubbing it on it's absorbed through the skin and it could impact joint or muscle pain just ask athlete ally Stoddart I played rugby for 15 years I play soccer now I got a lot of pain Ally a cannabis health and wellness consultant says she prefers CBD the non psychoactive part of the cannabis plant to over-the-counter painkillers I weighed a couple of minutes and literally it just kind of eases away but amidst the endorsements and hype what are you actually buying and where you can buy CBD creams online but to be honest it's confusing the dosages are all over the place so I head to the havahart dispensary in Oakland California where they can explain what's being offered plus whether it's intentional or just ironic this legal marijuana dispensary is directly across the street from the Oakland Police Department co-owner Josh chase shows me the products they sell we pretty much offer every single type of CBD that one could find in any form what's really interesting to me is how few claims these products make and that may be because the FDA forbids medical claims for products we're rigorous studies haven't been done was really up to the consumers to up to the patients to educate themselves and make sure that the products that they're purchasing are of safe quality or from a reputable source but keep in mind if you do shop in a dispensary do you take credit cards so we make sure that we do everything by the book by the city and state's law and everything is cash so this is something you want to try do your homework and bring cash for Good Morning America Becky Worley Oakland California good thing to remember I thought I Thank You Becky dr. Jenn Ashton is here for more will do viewer questions today and the first one comes from Adria from New Jersey let's take a look hi dr. Ashton I've heard a lot of people using CBD oil for things like stress anxiety muscle soreness but I'm wondering how does it actually work could they be making it up Thanks great question that is a great question and right now it's really about what we know and what we don't know the bulk of the pain literature in peer-reviewed data comes out of Israel and Canada but everyone is researching this and I think it's based on this understanding George of this endocannabinoid system and if you look at the wall we have at least two receptors that are called cannabinoid receptors one heavily concentrated in the brain that's related to the perception of pain cb2 receptors located all over the body and the confusion here with respect to pain is that THC which is the psychoactive component of cannabis yes it fits into that cb1 receptor but khat CBD also fits in does not give you a psychoactive effect that is really important but it there is data that it can help you see a lot of the prices say no THC exactly okay we have another question coming in on Twitter this is from Susan she says I've seen 300 600 1200 and 2,000 milligrams how do I know what does to try and what do we know about the dosing here we see the different ones here yeah wild wild west George and here's the thing in in terms of official recommendations so far the only group that has guidelines out is the Arthritis Foundation their recommendation is to start with as few milligrams as possible under the tongue twice a day if you're not seeing an effect over days and weeks increase its slowly and if you're noticing any unwanted side effects obviously stop and talk to your provider the concept here is start low and go slow and it's a lot of trial and error it's not one side and this is not a beer question it's my question I guess is there any any concern about dependency there not as much dependency but you always have to take into account risks when you talk about pharmacology if you're getting a good effect you have to be on the lookout of any unwanted negative effects and right now those risks are low but as always talk to your provider if you are using any of these projects and

"zYFmmX2MxZQ": "Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from\nSpineCare in St. Joseph, MI. In this video we\u2019re going to ask: can CBD\nOil really help with relieving sciatica? Is it effective, and strong enough to actually\ntackle the pain? Or is it all smoke and mirrors and too good\nto be true? Let\u2019s find out! Before we start, though, I want to say in\nfull disclosure that I\u2019m not benefiting from or promoting any product or brand of\nCBD oil. This video is just my personal thoughts on\nthe matter that I wanted to share. If you\u2019ve ever suffered from sciatica, you\nknow how much of a nightmare it can be. It pretty much makes almost every daily activity\nuncomfortable and inconvenient. For many suffers, they rely on over-the-counter\npainkillers to make it through the day. And in more severe cases, pain management\nthrough opioid pain medications, steroids, and injections may be prescribed. It\u2019s no secret that the opioid epidemic\nis real, and many people have reservations about taking something that has a high risk\nof side-effects, including addiction. That\u2019s why the appeal of CBD is growing,\nsince it offers the potential for effective pain relief on top of being natural, non-habit\nforming, and having little to no side-effects. No doubt, CBD use is also growing steadily,\nand is being used for treating conditions such as anxiety, insomnia, chronic pain, and\nmuch more. So let\u2019s take a look at how CBD may help\nrelieve sciatica pain, and start by going over what exactly CBD oil is and where it\ncomes from. CBD, or cannabidiol, is commonly known as\nhemp oil. It is a form of cannabis, which includes the\nwell known marijuana plant. Cannabis contains a number of different compounds,\neach with different effects on the body and mind. The two main active ingredients are Tetrahydrocannabinol,\nor THC, and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is the part that produces the characteristic\n\u2018high\u2019 of marijuana, while CBD is associated with therapeutic qualities and is not psychoactive. Producers of CBD have developed cannabis strains\nthat have virtually no THC, primarily hemp plants. The oil produced from these hemp plants contain\nless than 0.3% THC, which means it is not intoxicating and DOES NOT have any mind-altering\nproperties. Due to that, CBD oil is federally legal in\nevery state and does not require a prescription. I want to note, though, it is also not regulated\nby the FDA and is considered a supplement. Next, let\u2019s move on to some key aspects\nof sciatica. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with sciatica, especially\nits causes and symptoms, and want to know more, I\u2019m going to provide a link in this\nvideo\u2019s description to another video I\u2019ve done that goes over it in more detail. So check it out after watching this video\nto learn more. Sciatica is pain that travels, or radiates,\nalong the path of the sciatic nerve. This large nerve begins in your lower back\nand forks into two (left and right) to travel from the buttocks, into the legs and feet. Sciatica has a couple main causes, with the\nmost common being a lumbar herniated disc that presses onto and pinches a nearby nerve. The other is due to spinal stenosis, which\nis when the spinal canal (where the nerves travel through) narrow and close off, again\npinching nearby nerves. The sciatic nerve is very sensitive, and when\nit becomes compressed or irritated by one of the reasons above, it may cause symptoms\nlike mild to debilitating pain, tingling, or numbness into the areas it travels. One of the things that makes sciatica pain\ndifficult to treat is that it is often a combination of two different kinds of pain, nociceptive\nand neuropathic. Nociceptive pain is caused when nerves are\nreacting to tissue damage, which sends signals to the central nervous system (your brain)\nthat something has gone wrong. Neuropathic pain is when the nerves themselves\nare damaged, usually through compression causing inflammation and irritation. So what is it about CBD that makes it potentially\neffective in taking on sciatica pain? It\u2019s this: CBD stimulates a part of the\nbrain called the endocannabinoid system, a system responsible for communicating \"good\nand bad signals\" throughout your body. When CBD stimulates this system, it can change\na bad signal to a good one, which may have the ability to alleviate both neuropathic\nand nociceptive pain, as well as helping to reduce inflammation. Currently, though, studies on cannabis, including\nboth CBD and THC, are still in the early stages. I could not find one definitive study directly\nlinking CBD use and pain management of sciatica. However, the process in which CBD works is very\npromising and could be an all-natural alternative to opioid drugs and other painkillers. I can say though, that CBD oil WILL NOT cure\nany underlying issue causing sciatica, such as spinal stenosis or a herniated disc. So please do not take it as a substitute for\ngetting the proper care you need from a licensed healthcare professional! For those sciatica sufferers that have tried\nCBD oil, please leave your experiences and results in the comments section below, all\nof us would like to hear from you! Also, if you have any other comments or questions,\nplease feel free to leave them and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks for watching!", "fejytAIWC_g": "hey I wanted to do a review on penat ryx and Charlotte's webs hemp infused Bahman which one worked for me so I've been dealing with a lot of chronic pain issues and I just wanted to do like kind of like my take so after using this product and it's almost all gone for a solid couple of months actually maybe like two months or w-mint three in terms of pain relief it smells really nice so it's not like like we agents have this or we call this like white flour or something like that and it's really abrasive to the eyes it's really drying on your skin but it feels amazing just because the menthol on this is is intense and so I will douse myself with this before but it was really drying like I said and really abrasive to other people too like they could smell it immediately in your leg oh you're an old Asian grandma and on a 32 year old young lady so I opted for this first so this is called penetrations and this is well reviewed on Amazon and I would have to say what I was using it for is like my shoulder I have a little like shoulder impingement cuz I sleep on my side and things get pinched that way I've tried so many different ways on how to sleep but I've found a different solution this is always like things like this things like this they're always just little band-aids that help you very short-term in terms of pain relief and it's not even pain relief it's kind of like just a distraction it's not really addressing the source of your pain it's a it's a nice distraction so when you're you know when you're trying to work or whatever and you've got an ache in your neck or whatever and you have this burning cool sensation it distracts you from I think the pain I don't that's just my take on it I know it's not solving the problem but anyway this seemed to I guess be something different other than those types of products because it's an inflammation formula so if you have chronic pain it's probably because the the area or the joint or the muscle is inflamed and so no amount of stretching or like working out is really going to help you because it's still inflamed it's in a state of emergency basically so in order for you to like for myself like my knee for example or my shoulder or this like chronic muscle that was underneath my shoulder blade and it's really hard to get to gets really tight and it would cause actually migraines a lot and I would use this and you see I've run through this this container and it was just okay and I really didn't see any difference I think it was a lot better in terms of yes calming down the tissue than this guy but again if I wasn't gonna follow through like this is kind of like taking it's a topical like I guess an ibuprofen an anti-inflammatory that doesn't have to go through your liver to calm down the inflammation of the area or the affected area but if you don't follow through after calming down the inflamed area it stays weak or it stays unconditioned so for me for this example I was putting this and yes it was helping the inflammation and for me to not feel any pain but I wasn't doing anything to make sure that I wasn't going to keep that chronic injury there so I needed to do something physical where I could train those muscles or the muscles around it to activate and that way that one muscle wasn't doing all the work you know and I'm saying so there's a process right so if you're in pain and the area's inflamed yes these things in my experience do work but I went through a whole container worth and didn't realize like there's a second process to that which is to do something physical which trains that muscle not to be weak anymore because that's that's usually why you're in pain is because something is out of balance something is weak and this particular muscle that's always tied are always aching it's compensating for the rest of your weakness you're weak so that's that so I'm basically all out and on my journey of pain relief I also stumbled across things like CBD oil now I'm just about done with this guy and I was doing this is my second bottle full bottle like this and this is a 30 milliliters so one fluid ounce very small and their recommended dosage is one drop in the morning one drop at night or two two drops to full droppers okay and shake well before using and it tastes really good it tastes like minty chocolate stuff so it's in my experience it was kind of mouth drying always kind of got a cotton mouth feel I don't take it anymore I'm just about done but I haven't even touched this in a couple of weeks and I was trying to take this for like anxiety or oh yeah like if I have this pain here if I just take it will it just handle all the things in my body I don't know I can't really say if this works or not because at the same time I was also practicing yoga which to me in my example the whole shoulder blade thing the knee thing the hip thing the only thing that's really been I feel helping is yes these like step one little baby step one and then step two which is a big step which is to start training start conditioning those muscles so that you stop staying in this crappy injured in flame state that brings me to this okay so this is fairly new maybe about two to three weeks the use of this this is the 1.5 ounce soothing scent hemp infused balm from Charlotte's Web I love this smell it smells really good at submit it's like a minty my settlement enos doesn't burn your eyes when you apply it close to your face unless you put it like right here so I usually use this because I'm still getting that shoulder impingement not as bad as I used to used to wake up with headaches but yeah definitely using this in tandem with my yoga has been I'm seeing I'm seeing a lot more progress and a lot more strengthen and how I'm gauging that is just by doing regular everyday tasks so going up and down the stairs seeing if I could jog for like a little jaunt from the kitchen to the to the living room if I got excited about something or to run to the restroom like I'm that's how I'm gauging my progress and before I couldn't do that especially when I had done when I had injured my knee and so I've been applying this pretty regularly to my knee and before when I was doing yoga whenever I knelt down on to my knee onto the kneecap it was very painful and so I would just kind of find ways around it in terms of the yoga like still doing downward dog still doing forward fold still doing everything that I could you know it was really just the ones where I had my kneecap on the floor so I've been applying this directly to it and I've only started doing that for probably the last two weeks because for some reason you just I don't know when you're in an injured state you don't really think of all the ways you think of I don't know that's just been my experience and and that's been a transformation in my mind when you are chronically injured and maybe you have many things wrong with you it's kind of hard to keep track it's kind of hard to keep up with all of your issues but I encourage you to think of your body as a full system and so if your knee hurts it's not just about your knee it's about your hip it's about your quads about your hamstrings about your calves I always forget about my calves is about your ankles so that your your body's a whole system and so this has enabled me to I feel been very effective anti-inflammatory I'm not taking advil or ibuprofen for anything really the only thing that I really take ibuprofen for is if I have a feel of massive headache coming on and maybe I can prevent a migraine and then I'll maybe I'll take some or if I'm you know I have cramps or something that's the only reason why I would take that so I'm trying to minimize as much drugs as possible that I'm taking into my body and just doing these topical things that you just rub and they smell so good too and it is very I in my experience effective that I feel in my body as an anti-inflammatory agent which is pretty cool so and they and I think they make that distinction you know this has 450 milligrams of hemp extract and I've seen it go as far as to like a thousand milligrams and I'm like whew maybe that will like make it make my healing even faster because um right now with the yoga and I've been doing yoga for a good 45 days I think that's a good estimate maybe 50 days pretty regularly pretty like maybe I've missed two days and then I just did it the next day or something like that and that's given me the strength to go and do deadlifting I'm now lifting again when I was completely invalid for like a good three months or something when I when I injured my knee so that's been my experience with this this and this um so yeah not taking recap not taking this anymore I feel the yoga has replaced what I have seeked out in not gonna buy this anymore this is about 20 bucks I think and I think it and I think it does work when I was using it it's just that you need to follow through you can't just put it on to be like why am I not better yet you have to follow through physically emotionally mentally all the things I like this a lot better just because it's a little bit cheaper and and I feel like it lasts longer too cuz this is more like a this is more like a cream and this is more like a wax and like I can both they had a very similar scent this one like very kind of minty yeah mm-hmm they both smell really good I like both of them this one's just a little bit cheaper but it takes forever to get to you so maybe this is a better option I don't know it'll just kind of depend on my mood when when I go to refill this one but this I feel like it's lasting Mia quite a bit so I'll just put three of my fingers in here rub it on I'll do it before and after a workout or like when I remember to or if I'm particularly feeling little stabs of pain in my knee or in my neck and stuff and I just feel better and I've been using this for maybe good three months or so so that's been my experience any specific questions I'd love to you know answer your questions in the comments and maybe you know it'll work for you too and like I said these things are just temporary fixes and they and make you feel a little bit better for the time being but you have to follow through with all the things and try to think of your body as a as a whole system you know not even just your body like your mental state like are you do you really want to get better are you using your chronic illness as an excuse for not living I know that so yeah thanks

for attending my webinar on the efficacy of high CBD low THC for better patient outcomes in medical marijuana treatment programs at the end of this presentation there is a YouTube video for you to watch on CBD THC just click on the far left of your screen today's learning objectives are understanding CBD THC ratios in medical marijuana and using high CBD low THC cannabis products to treat disease processes there are at least a hundred and thirteen cannabinoids and this webinar is going to address two of them that work together to provide our bodies with synergy that's high CBD low THC strains of marijuana and how they help patients who use them CBD and THC interact with each other and by using them together patients may find that the effects of THC are lessened but prolonged there are many patients who just cannot tolerate the effects of THC while there are many others who smoke THC in order to relax another factor to consider is the way in which marijuana is consumed such as smoking tinctures edibles and topicals cannabinoids are better absorbed by the body when ingested on a full stomach CBD is intrinsically safe and there is no way to tell if you have had enough as with THC you would just be too high combining CBD and THC causes a reduction in the psychoactive effects of THC CBD will also help to lessen the sedative and appetite appetite inducing effects this is known as the entourage effect where both compounds work best when they're used together these two molecules are a perfect complement to each other in January of this year the medical value of cannabis was recognized by the world who health organization the therapeutic potentials of cannabis and cannabinoids has been acknowledged for the first time since 1954 by this group they have proposed new international scheduling moving towards efforts to increase the potential for countries to provide legal safe access for medical use of cannabis and its research the organization accepted the public's comments on the scheduling of marijuana until March 14th of this year I of course posted my thoughts on the website and implored them to seriously consider removing marijuana as a schedule 1 drug cannabidiol or CBD is a component of the anibus plant that may have enormous therapeutic potential although it doesn't make people feel high like THC CBD is causing quite a buzz among scientists health professionals and medical marijuana patients who are using CBD products to treat a wide variety of conditions including chronic pain cancer Crohn's diabetes rheumatoid arthritis PTSD cardiovascular disease anxiety and antibiotic resistant infections multiple sclerosis schizophrenia and more academic research centers around the world are currently studying effects of CBD on these and other ailments scientists refer to CBD as a promiscuous compound because it confers therapeutic benefits in many different ways while tapping into how we function physiologically and biologically on a deep level extensive preclinical research and some clinical studies have shown that CBD have strong antioxidant anti-inflammatory anticonvulsant antidepressant antipsychotic antitumoral and neuro protective qualities cannabidiol appears to change gene expression and may be helpful in removing beta amyloid plaque which is the hallmark of Alzheimer's from brain cells what is THC CBD and THC are the power couple of cannabis therapeutics they appear to work best together for example CBD is believed to boost th C's pain-killing and anti-cancer properties CBD can also lessen the side effects of too much THC including anxiety and rapid heartbeat relaxing but not intoxicating is how some people describe CBD rich cannabis products CBD and THC both appear to stimulate neurogenesis the creation of new brain cells and adult mammals which may prove helpful for stroke and Parkinson's patients products made from industrial hemp that contain little or no THC are currently being market widely but recent scientific studies suggest that the products made from hemp or synthetic CBD maybe less effective therapeutically than cannabis based medicines because they lack critically secondary cannabinoids and other medicinal compounds that interact with CBD and THC to enhance their therapeutic benefits scientists call this the entourage effect numerous cannabis compounds have medicinal attributes but the therapeutic impact of the whole plant cannabis seems to be greater than the sum of its parts it still seems that patients are looking for the most part the high THC low CBD products but I feel as a nurse that they would be better suited to choose the high CBD low THC products for medicinal purposes it just seems like the high CBD has more benefits for most medical patients CBD binds with CBD receptors in the body and helps to regulate appetite pain management and immune system function such as inflammation Harlequin sweet and sour widow Stephen Hawking Kush ac/dc canna tonic and Pennywise are some of the most popular and common strains of high CBD flour it is not so much that CBD makes you feel good but that it makes you not feel bad and since it's a cap cannabinoid coming from the cannabis plant it is often confused with THC which is a psychoactive compound and people expect to feel high from it it's imperative that we educate patients as well as the public to the fact that being high as they say on cannabis cannot be compared to being intoxicated on alcohol or to the ill effects of most pharmaceuticals such as opiates benzodiazepines antipsychotics and antidepressants with a CBD high you won't feel sedated or groggy for most people it takes about 20 minutes to feel the effects of CBD when taken on an empty stomach if taking on a full stomach it's about an hour there are many studies that find inflammation as the main contributing factor in problems of the brain such as anxiety brain fog depression autism a DD and ADHD CBD oil is proving to be an effective treatment for social anxiety and is naturally calming side effects from cannabis are dose dependent high CBD low THC therapy should always start with low doses increasing slowly so that the patient can find their individual dose and unwanted effects can be avoided CBD also interacts with THC by taking CBD and THC together individuals may find that the effects of THC are tempered but prolonged slightly some people can hardly tolerate any THC the wide range of reaction to THC rich cannabis may be influenced by genetic factors that may be one of the reasons why some people find THC rich cannabis to be unpleasant while hundreds of millions smoked it to relax this genetic variant exists among 20% of people in the European and Middle Eastern population of Caucasians meaning one in five or THC averse less than 10 percent of Africans have this genetic variant and among Asians it's less than 5% how does CBD benefit the human body CBD shows promise for helping to subdue the symptoms of anxiety which most of us about 30% suffer from it produces effects via molecular molecular pathways CBD enhances activation of serotonin to impede disorders such as anxiety it has been found to be a natural anxiety calmer and works very well in the treatment of social anxiety in addition to fighting inflammation in the body CBD oil may reduce anxiety by directly affecting the brain studies have found that CBD actually lowers activity in the amygdala and increases prefrontal cortex activation to parts of the brain involved in anxiety is also evidence that CBD is able to activate new neurons in the hippocampus this accent activates CBD 1 receptors which has a positive balancing impact on gaba and glutamate levels associated with reducing anxiety doctors often advise people with chronic anxiety to avoid cannabis as THC can trigger or amplify feelings of anxiousness and paranoia which is true I think for a lot of people that paranoia is definitely a side effect of a high THC product however authors of a review from neuro therapeutics found that CBD may help to reduce anxiety in people with certain related disorders according to the review CBD may reduce anxiety related behaviors and people with conditions such as PTSD general anxiety disorder panic disorder social anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder the authors noted that current treatments for these disorders can lead to additional symptoms and side effects which can cause some people to stop taking them no further definitive evidence currently leaked CBD to adverse effects and the authors called for further studies of the compound as a treatment for anxiety anxiety and depression or pathologies affect human beings and may aspects of life including social life productivity and health CBD is a compound of the cannabis plant with great psychiatric potential including use as an antidepressant studies involving animal models performing a variety of experiments on the above-mentioned disorder such as the forced swimming test the elevated plus maze and the global conflict test suggest the CBD exhibited an anti-anxiety and antidepressant effect in the animal models discussed experiments with CBD demonstrated non activation of neuroreceptor cb1 and cb2 PTSD or post-traumatic stress disorder is a psychological ailment that is beginning to gain the attention of CBD research PTSD exhibits and individuals who have experienced trauma and/or abuse in their lifetime the disorder is most noteworthy and military veterans and accident survivors CBD has proven beneficial in relation to PTSD as it reportedly helps curb manifestations of both depression and anxiety without the debilitating side effects of pharmaceuticals CBDs effectiveness concerning PTSD is evident in the fact that states like Arizona are now recognizing PTSD as an ailment that warrants legal access to medical marijuana CBD has the ability to lower cortisol levels at slow down muscle growth the reason body builders need to work regularly to maintain continued growing their form is because our bodies do not grow muscles naturally in fact our endocrine system produces catabolic hormones such as cortisol which break down muscle mass in order to use the amino acids for other functions to counter this dilemma someone who wishes to build muscle would have to take catabolic supplements and this is where CBD comes into play studies show that cannabidiol can lower the number of catabolic hormones in the human body meaning that muscle game won't be lost so quickly and it makes it easier to gain muscle mass quicker keep in mind that CBD should not be taken with caffeine at least not for this purpose caffeine promotes the production of catabolic hormone so it would only counter the effects of CBD many medical patients tell us that marijuana helps their pain neuropathic pain also known as nerve pain is a unique type of pain that is caused by injured dysfunction or irritated nerves the pain tends to be chronic and severe with no known cure or remedy the individual is left to try numerous strategies to try to find something that works some of the most common sources of neuropathy include diabetes injury cancer infections alcoholism and autoimmune disorders have been human clinical trials that support benefits of THC and CBD for nerve pain there have been fewer studies examining just CBD in an animal study researchers found that oral supplementation of CBD led to improvements in neuropathic pain in rats back pain is one of the most common forms of both acute and chronic pain acute back pain tends to call be caused by an injury such as a fall or by lifting something heavy chronic back pain is that which lasts more than three months and is often caused by a ruptured or bulging disc author itis osteoporosis scoliosis or nerve pain some back pain is partly caused by inflammation and numerous preclinical animal studies have found benefits of CBD for inflammation three possible reduction in both nerve and inflammatory pain CBD may help relieve back pain the main mechanism by which CBD is thought to help mediate pain is by reducing inflammation largely by blocking inflammatory mediators it is also believed to potentiate glycan receptors which help to regulate pain at the spinal level this suppresses both neuropathic and inflammatory pain CBD has been found to exhibit enhancements in treating pain both when used on its own and when used in combination with THC when used alone CBD is largely best for inflammatory pain such as that caused by arthritis or injuries in one animal study on arthritis pain it was found that the topical application of CVD led to a reduction in inflammation and pain another animal study found that CBD helps to reduce neuropathic pain through the suppression of chronic inflammation CBD does not directly bind to the receptors found in the endocannabinoid system so rather works to modulate the effects of endocannabinoids found naturally in our bodies as well as working as a cb-one antagonist when searching for the best cannabis strains for pain relief you will first want to consider how much THC and CBD is found in the stream generally you will find most relief from a string that has large quantities of both CBD and THC with a high CBD THC ratio this is because CBD can help to mediate the side effects of THC while also providing additional anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties some researchers have found that CBD may prove to combat cancer authors of a review published in the British Journal of clinical pharmacology found evidence that CBD significantly helped to prevent the spread of cancer the researchers also noted that the compound tends to suppress the growth of cancer cells and promote their destruction they pointed out that CBD has low levels of toxicity and they called for further research in its potential as an accompaniment to standard cancer treatments type 1 diabetes results from inflammation that occurs when the immune system attacks cells in the pancreas research published in 2016 found that CBD may ease this inflammation in the pancreas this may be the first step in finding a CBD based treatment for type 1 diabetes a paper presented the same year in Lisbon Portugal suggests that CBD may reduce inflammation and protect against the delay or development of type 1 diabetes initial research published in the Journal of Alzheimer's disease found CBD was able to prevent the development of social recognition deficit in its participants this means that CBD could help people in the early stages of Alzheimer's keep the ability to recognize the faces of the people that they know this is the first evidence that CBD may slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease across the board it would appear as though CBD is a natural wakefulness promoting compound because of this it seems smart to recommend to take your CBD supplement or full-spectrum hep extract supplement in the morning so as to keep you alert all day and not to interfere with falling asleep interesting enough when subjects do this it appears that not only do they stay alert and awake throughout the day but they also fall asleep at night more quickly without any additional sleep aid and stay asleep longer this would appear to be because CBD is known to modulate the microglia activation of the inflammatory cycle keeping your body in a less inflamed state and lowering your stress in a review of studies done on chronic pain patients the reviewer found adequate evidence to correlate CBD oil consumption with improving multiple sleep biomarkers including sleep onset which is basically how quickly someone falls asleep the study also saw repeating incidents of lower dream recall and CBD subjects which is very interesting it's difficult to point to a mechanism here since very little is known about the nature of dreams in the field of neuroscience however this does point to the idea that dream recall may be regulated by the endocannabinoid system to some degree the same study also saw a decrease in insomnia symptoms among subjects it appears as though CBD is positively correlated with improving sleep patterns but funny enough not actually by making you sleepy as it is a wakefulness promoting agent and not a sedative like THC in fact it appears to promote sleep improvement due to the fact that it can lower stress levels as a powerful antioxidant where it benefits controlling free radicals in induced inflammation are well-documented this is great news as you can consume your CBD supplements in the morning to keep you stress-free and relaxed but focused throughout the day and then you may fall asleep more quickly and stay asleep longer throughout the night using high CB low THC to help quitting smoking some promising evidence suggests that CBD may help people quit smoking cigarettes a pilot study published in addictive behaviors found that smokers who used inhalers containing CBD smoked fewer cigarettes than usual and had no further cravings for nicotine a similar review published in neuro therapeutics found that CBD may be a promising treatment for people with opioid addiction disorders the researchers noted that CBD reduced some symptoms associated with substance use disorders these included anxiety related symptoms pain and insomnia more research is necessary but these findings suggest that CBD may help to prevent or even reduce withdrawal symptoms children with autism spectrum disorder seek significant improvement in symptoms and less reliance on other medications after treatment with tecum ohlins ever deagle medical cannabis as confirmed by a new study published in scientific reports the two-year study followed 188 children with an average age of 13 diagnosed with ASD the patients were treated with tecum \u00f6hlins high CBD low THC medical cannabis strains which have been specifically cultivated and shown to provide symptom relief for ASD and related conditions with minimal psychoactive effect at the study's outset the most common patient symptoms were restlessness rage attacks and agitation after six months of daily cannabis treatment with at tecum olan's clinics in israel 80 point 1 percent of the patients reported improvement of their symptoms with only with 30 point one percent reporting significant improvements other key findings included of the 27 patients who had epilepsy 24 reported improved or disappearance of symptoms 34 point four percent of patients decreased other medications and 20 percent of patients stop using anti-psychotic medication autism is a leading condition of concern worldwide so this study couldn't have come at a better time says dr. Annabelle manola PhD who is tecum olam scientific director this data showed that autism patients can improve their overall quality of life utilizing a high CBD low THC strain and most importantly that young users can safely and effectively benefit from medical cannabis with the study cannabis is shown to be an effective choice for parents looking for the safest and most neuroprotective treatment the side-effects to cannabis treatment were minimal the FDA recently approved epidemics as a medication for children with refractory Caeser disorders and the DEA classified at the dialects sched as a Schedule v substance on September of 2018 epidemics would surely command a lot of off-label attention if not for the potent price tag and just as surely a huge unregulated market for hemp derived CBD isolate will continue to flourish in a tenuous legal environment an already massive consumer demand for CB products has far outpaced the gathering of clinical data on cannabinoid interactions with pharmaceuticals for pain cancer autism heart disease and many other chronic ailments concerning the product that the fda approved to treat two types of epilepsy researchers noticed the following adverse effects in clinical trials liver problems symptoms related to central nervous system such as irritability and lethargy reduced appetite gastrointestinal problems infections rashes and other sensitivity reactions reduce urination and breathing problems the patient information leaflet notes that there is a risk of worsening depression or suicidal thoughts it is important to monitor anyone who is using this drugs for signs of mood changes research suggests that a person taking the product is unlikely to form a dependency the long-standing Berry to research is a Schedule one status of cannabis a category reserved for dangerous substances with no medical value according to federal law but the paucity of federally sanctioned clinical research a consequence of cannabis prohibition should not be an excuse for physicians or patients to shun non-lethal cannabinoid therapies which show promise for a wide range of conditions when drugs do not have FDA approval it can be difficult to know whether a product contains a safe or effective level of CBD unapproved products may not have the properties or content stated on the package it is important to note that researchers have linked marijuana use during pregnancy to impairments in the fetal development of neurons regular use among teens is also associated with concerning memory behavior and intelligence CBD is just one of the many cannabinoids found in marijuana and it is not psychoactive smoking cannabis is not the same as using CBD oil and using CBD oil was not the same as smoking cannabis a person can use CBD oil in different ways to relieve various symptoms if a doctor prescribes it it's important to follow their instructions CBD products come in many forms some can be mixed into different foods or drinks and taken with a pipette or dropper others are available in capsules or as a thick paste to be massaged into the skin some products are available as sprays to be administered under the tongue recommended dosages vary between individuals and depend on factors such as body weight the concentration of the products and the health issue the studies done on CBD oil have a pretty wide dose range anywhere from a few milligrams to hundreds of milligrams it's suggested to start at the lower end around 10 milligrams and slowly increase over a few weeks or months to see what works for you some people also do well with splitting the dosage throughout the day instead of taking the dose all at once it is always a good idea to talk with your prescribing doctor if you are on any medications CBD is generally very safe but there are some pharmaceutical medications it could potentially interact with an increase or decrease the pharmaceutical drugs effectiveness some CBD manufacturers have come under government scrutiny for wild and defensible claims such as that CBD is a cure-all for cancer we need more research but CBD may prove to be an option for managing anxiety insomnia and chronic pain without sufficient high quality evidence in human studies we can't pinpoint effective doses and because CBD is currently mostly available as an unregulated supplement it's difficult to know exactly what you are getting if you decide to try CBD check with your doctor if for no other reason than to make sure it won't affect other medications that you're taking using CBD THC compounds in concert has been shown to help mitigate side-effects and enhance efficacy with CBD + THC showing more benefit for some conditions and THC alone studies have confirmed that CBD helps to counteract some of the sedative high feeling anxiety and rapid heartbeat that's associated with THC consumption it also has been found to extend the half-life of the THC which may help to extend the pain relieving benefits this has allowed the use of higher doses of THC in clinical trials for the treatment of pain caused by multiple sclerosis peripheral neuropathy intractable cancer pain and rheumatoid arthritis when used in concert a greater efficacy in treating these types of pain has been observed you may be wondering what is the ideal balance a ratio of CBD and THC every strain of Bud that you purchased at a dispensary will be labeled with its THC and CBD content and that's helpful when choosing a strain for pain relief thus far based on the observations regarding the ride spread use of cannabis flour and full spectrum cannabis oil it does not appear that there have been many problems because of cannabinoid drug reactions to the extent that there have been problematic drug interactions with cannabinoids these have involved high doses of CBD isolates not cannabis in general even though THC is an intoxicant and CBD is not the fact that people tend to use much higher doses of pure CBD makes it much riskier player in the metabolic drug interactions 10 milligrams of THC in a cannabis product is a hefty dose for a naive patient and sufficiently psychoactive for the occasional recreational user 10 milligrams of THC combined with equal amounts of CBD in a sativex tincture hits the energies exploit spot in clinical trials there are moderate doses compared to the amount of single molecule CBD administer to epileptic children in clinical trials up to 50 milligrams per kilogram with CBD doses as high as 2,000 milligrams not uncommon among patients who obtain CBD isolates from internet storefronts and other unregulated sources THC has its own built in guardrails consume too much and you'll know you've hit your limit with CBD there are no guardrails no dysphoric feedback loop that says you've had enough CBD is intrinsically safe but when extracting from the plant and concentrated as an isolate high doses are necessary for therapeutic efficacy unlike whole plant CBD rich extracts which have a broader therapeutic window and are effective at lower doses in a single molecule CBD drug interactions are much more likely with high dose CBD therapy than other forms of cannabis consumption physicians and patients should be concerned about this given the current regulatory regime with privileges CBD isolates over artisanal plant-derived multi-component formulations the legality CBD is a cannabinoid derived from the cannabis plant cannabis is legal for either medicinal or recreational use in use in some American states other states have approved the use of CBD oil as a hemp product but not the general use of medical marijuana some state and federal laws differ and current marijuana and CBD legislation in the United States can be confusing even in states where marijuana is legal there is an ever-changing number of states that do not necessarily consider marijuana to be legal but have laws directly related to CBD oil the following information is accurate as as of May 2018 but the laws change frequently however state legislators usually approve the use of CBD oil at various concentrations to treat a range of epileptic conditions a full list of states that have CBD specific laws is available different states also require different levels of prescriptions to possess and use CBD oil in Missouri for example a person can use CBD of a particular composition if they can show that three other treatment options have failed to treat their epilepsy they can provide information about safe CBD sausage sources and local laws surrounding uses anyone considering CBD oil should speak with a local healthcare provider it's also research your local state laws most states require a prescription my own state of Delaware has a medical marijuana program that currently has close to 7,000 patients thank you so much for watching my webinar on high CBD low THC product efficacy for better patient outcomes in medical marijuana programs I'm Ruth betrayin from Wyoming Delaware I have worked as a nurse for the past 13 years where I come face-to-face with various disease processes daily I'm a member of the American cannabis Nurses Association Delaware normal and the Delaware cannabis advocacy Network I have been an advocate for marijuana since 1975 and I've lobbied at state and national levels for the past couple of years we hope to legalize recreational cannabis here in Delaware this year the legislators in my state decide the fate of marijuana so the only way to make change is to speak to them personally 61% of Delaware again support legalization of recreational cannabis I am by no means an expert on this topic but I recently worked in one of the medical marijuana dispensaries here in Delaware and I know of the pain and suffering the patient's endure for years before they finally get their doctor to agree that marijuana could help it's my hope that patients everywhere are able to utilize marijuana as a first line of defense in their medical treatment instead of it being a last resort I'd like to give a shout out to Jay and Riley mendler of Riley sunshine and thank them for all the hard work and dedication and their continued support of pediatric medical cannabis worldwide I'd also like to thank Delaware Normal and the Delaware cannabis advocacy Network for the continued work towards legalization I'm going to close with the video done by a friend of mine Tommy Lyons he is a veteran who lives in Maryland and he's a medical marijuana patient thank you for watching hey everybody my name is Tommy Lyons and I'm a good friend of Ruth wanted to come on here today and talk to you about why I use CBD products from the cannabis plant specifically I'd like to state that I'm not representing any industry and I'm a registered and approved msec patient which means I have safe access to cannabis in Maryland I'm a service-connected disabled veteran and I use cannabis to offset various symptoms that come along with that I find that the CBD really helps target the symptoms from PTSD major depressive disorder and it helps me just kind of regain my calm I enjoy ac/dc I'm smoker and ac/dc is great it is very high in CBD and almost next to nothing in THC what that does for me is just give me a clear slate just makes me feel alright no high really but I'm not it's hard to say the word high anymore because it does different things for everybody but what we're finding is that the one thing it's doing across the board is providing an increase in quality of life and that's why I like cannabis and CBD it is important to use THC with the CBD to create what's called the entourage effect that was explained to me by a good friend of mine the old buddy old pal bill that CBD Rides and THC drives so you're in the car you've got THC and CBD working together CBD is kind of navigating telling the THC where to go and then the THC is like mmm just kind of takes off and then it's like a little bit too much so the CBD is like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa come back here come back here get back to the speed limit so if you ever have too much THC for any reason use some CBD the CBD teamsters the drops that you put under your tongue that's a great way to medicate people are finding that to be very effective as a source to get the CBD into their system I usually recommend a ten to one texture which is ten part CBD and one part THC when it comes to THC and CBD in regard to dosing they're called Colorado doses ten milligrams of THC is one Colorado dose one milligram of CBD is one Colorado dose you can have as much CBD as you can intake you can't have too much CBD which is great you can't have too much THC or any other cannabinoid for that fact but the more you intake of certain cannabinoids the more potential you have for psychotropic psychedelic effects that you might not be looking for if you're looking for medicinal relief in regard to anxiety stress depression cancer looking for tumor reduction looking for symptom relief with HIV ADEs gastrointestinal issues post reconstructive surgery or any kind of surgery for that matter there are bombs THC and CBD bombs that are great for spot application for example if you're having elbow pain rub it right on the elbow there are compounds that are transdermally ingested so those are same things bomb and if you're having spot pain then you rub it on that and then you always rub it on your wrist where the skin is really thin and Venus because the compounds can either be spot application by themselves for spot application with transdermal properties so when it's transdermal and you rub it on the thin part of the skin it's gonna go full bloodstream which is going to give you a better chance for relief and fighting symptoms I've had a great opportunity to learn about cannabis I work as a dispensary technician at nature's care and wellness I'm also a patient consultant so I've worked with I have 3,000 patients that come into the store and I've gotten an opportunity to work with most of them and what we do is come up with plans in regard to how we can help figure this out come together get on a med excuse me get on a medical regimen and then find relief and it's working people keep coming back I've been working with people for over a year now and it works so it's really great to see people coming back people getting relief people's scams coming back clear people are kicking opiates I mean from going going from 280 milligrams a day down to nothing cannabis it's not just about the THC and CBD either there are many cannabinoids there are over 200 identified cannabinoids there are also terpenes which is the flavor and scent there's tart beans and everything stripping's and oranges tomatoes it's all over the place it's plant-based wellness and bringing these things together in an effort to find wellness as possible so it's great there are our CBD vapes CBD heavy vapes that are cannabis for example some strains that are really good are penny wise hardly sue tsunami harley quinn ac/dc shark shock blue dream blue dream is my favorite I've been using blue dream as my meds when I smoke they're the prettiest CBD buds I've ever seen and I mention that because I get relief when I open the bag smell it you know I take the milk out or break it open and just looking at it just makes me go I love that that's one thing about cannabis that you're not gonna get from any kind of prescription medication you're never gonna open up a bottle of pills and be like no it's just it's not like that there are capsules that you can ingest to get CBD and THC into your system there's also RS o which is Rick Simpson oil another good strain what CBD is a ray of sunshine and I've seen that in RSO tubes with a thousand milligrams total cannabinoids 600 milligrams CBD and 200 milligrams THC which is an amazing ratio because that's not going to get you too high but it is gonna get you some serious medicinal relief especially during the day the best way to consume that is called front lining it's a term that I coined basically dry out the inside of your gum with a paper towel have your meds ready pull the paper towel out so it's dry line the gums with the oil it's viscous and then let it sit there before you know it it's full blood streams called sublingual ingestion and it's really helping people alright everybody thank you so much for watching my video if there's anything I can do to help please let Ruth know and I'd be happy to follow up again my name is Tommy cannabis saves lives and that's what it's all about have a great day Thank You Ruth for that informative presentation I'd also like immigrants for making today's educational webcast possible as a final reminder our speaker will follow up with any questions you've submitted via email that's all for now thank you for joining us and we'll see you next time", "GRriQ4OysuE": "that cannabis lovers beyond the Vespa smoking the best buds and today my buddy is Daisy and for this special weed Wednesday we're talking which i think is an important subject yep so I decided to bring my favorite top school on the show and Daisy brought her Oh taco as well yeah what she made yeah yeah so for people who don't know topicals articles are cannabis infused creams lotions balms gels you know that bath salts that softens are you put it on your where you have the most pain so are this inflammation directly on that and headaches as well totally I have heard that topicals have helped with eczema yeah psoriasis and with anecdotal evidence from so many people thousands of people who can prove that this is actually a treatment that works for them and what's really cool though topicals is that you get that therapeutic cannabis relief without that cerebral hive non-intoxicating and so is generally teach seeing them yeah you know you don't get that like you'll get stone from getting its down exactly just let direct area that you put that topic along how it works is that the cannabinoids and turbines right on the surface your skin penetrates and it does bind to see bt receptors but it doesn't go into your bloodstream which i think is like what a lot of people are looking for in the middle of the day at work you know if you have a desk job yeah if you have adjust your neck kinko then in front of computer like this on it yeah just around all the time so like that it's yeah it's really lovely daisy has had lots of experience talk tool she actually has some fibromyalgia and it really does but we were talking about this earlier from and you're saying like the nine points that you get hit with and even like under the knee just left yeah so issue yeah so far grow I would say like probably eighty percent of my life is spent in some form of pain some days is really bad whatever yeah but chuckles that cannabis in general like really help with all of that right that's a great way to get some relief and I like about what topicals - thanks about I said 30 to 45 minutes to kick in Chris depending on what's in your topical as well so many different variations you can get so many different benefit like even these two are like me different like different ways of infusing the cannabis into them right so there's so many different ways that you know like maybe an olive oil is gonna get down deeper and also I know that like terpenes and stuff that are in those will actually help them penetrate deeper yeah yeah area filena you can find carry off I'll intervene and black pepper and cinnamon and terpenes really mesh well with the can her cannabinoids - entourage effect you really get that synergistic effect today I wanted to show off the one that I use I actually got this from the headquarters here in Victoria BC the ingredients in this is coconut oil peppermint spearmint leaf cloves which clothes are found in human dr. bean and that's an anti-inflammatory turkey yeah as well as the black pepper eukaryote filing that one's anti-inflammatory as well as an anti analgesic red seaweed in this wintergreen oil honey bees wax now I really like this one is every the peppermint and spearmint in it that cooling effect so if I want like a gnarly hike worked out really hard that day it's like that's exactly what you need a cold one see what other people talk opposed to is they're like you know they can be used for any purpose like we said they can be used like a casual height like the bengay or something yeah they can be used for like really serious like you know like series migraine pain yeah headaches okay you can actually just rub him directly where you're feeling pain that's where it's gonna penetrate and really I mean like I said I always have mine on me so it's like a co-worker's a thing complains but a headaches and I'm like no try some of this I do not have a deal yeah but but ya know people love it like people are always just amazed yeah people have that idea that you have to smoke or eat we to get that benefit of the pain relievers that yeah you have to kind of get that psychoactive high yeah thing is people you don't and I think that's like what a lot of people are looking for so if I personally like the psychoactive cerebral I yea recommended if you're not looking for that high but yeah tell me a bit about the one that you have here yeah all right this is from big temples actually sorry BC as well the super grade I used to work there on infection made this batch a little bit ago and yeah there's all kinds of stuff in this instead of the more typical way of infusing it we used cannabis leaf oil so it's like olive oil infused with cannabis which is cool that's got some vitamin E it's as mucolytics the eucalyptus also kind of has that cooling effect then you're gonna get peppermint and stuff like that it does have a little bit of peppermint wintergreen as well some lavender some cinnamon which as you said that and inflammatory Antion is what it's all about boom it is I think it uh when I found this out I just my mind was blown it's pretty actually I was little little terpene in it and that was like the calming more like you Florrick effect to it really strong instantly I smell cinnamon yeah the cinnamon is over that's what I smell yeah [Music] yeah and so like there is my bulletin to you but it's actually actually people at this that gives like cool that's cool I love that we brought two different ones kind of show people that there's something out there for everybody and like I said you don't gotta just get like the lotions or gels yeah bombs my friend sports the bomb around ya the bombs are really good too you know able to dry lips yeah anything like that it's kind of dry in here someone never tried any with olive oil let me try some like lotus flower it just has some lotus flower it smells so good here I'll put the lid back on but let me go on take them dude we have a lot of pain central kind of around this back of the neck area a little bit yeah awesome broken bones brains menstrual cramp oh yeah very good for mr. right is pain as well yeah this really yeah touches babes with all that direct pain [Music] and you found some anecdotal reports here we are crew yes and we both ground on two different types of tacos yes coconut oil bees yeah coconut oil pretty different textures as well but pretty much do anything yeah and we're gonna make one super lavender actually made a bunch of lovely stuff last year at some point and oh yeah oh yeah hmmm Ireland I wonder if every minute I pick out just recycling like tingly effect okay reminds me tiger balm no we've done but are you yeah I actually have my tiger balm ultra and I will mix it in some lines see with these topical is just to give that like extra spice you don't really cares a lot of people don't like that piercing of cool yeah somewhere everybody yeah yeah but my tiger balm ultra you can make your own that's the exciting part yeah of course you can buy some from this stores and stuff but don't be sure to go online I've seen and read a lot of amazing recipes and it's always gonna be natural and medicinal healthy for your body and things all Avoyelles lavender exactly really take it yeah just like they have yes up before you try your own just like our beautiful Daisy has and it like it's pretty [ __ ] up honestly once you get the basics down you can toss anything you want in it of course yeah but yeah anything you want you want like a jalapeno and I have jalapenos in there get some spray yeah actually like the cooling exactly you can I would like to know what kind of infused tacos you guys have done is there anything that you would recommend you think it's like it weird spice or weird ingredient that really you thought helped and more people should know let us know we're open to more ideas here yeah yeah a lot of Monday Mary Jane videos telling baby we actually did a really cool string called Nakayama which was made by my friend Angela Devine and it was a really good outdoor honestly yeah exactly I would love to have you on a prayer we'd review sometime and yeah those are always my favorite every Monday people and if you want to stay updated on all the different segments reviews that we have in store feel free to pause like us on graeme to subscribe the absolutely love that website every word of it yeah but it is an amazing platform for a Canada yeah and then you got you - oh the topical talk so I guess what we're getting at is go get yourself some topical if you're a bit iffy on em I swear it's only gonna benefit your life be a believer but it's also a pretty good way of getting someone into the cannabis industry a little bit like maybe a grandma who is someone that you know is probably still a little wary of something like this is a great you know if for them maybe Vegas cream for you Miami what was all the ingredients scratched up just and then later on when they rant about I wanna buy more than you're like see I told you you could have all the therapeutic effects and no hi that's what topicals are for and I'm really glad that today's episode was revolving all around that got spread the word and also I want to keep your interest but she go make it home so cannot wait to read your guys's ideas like different things to try things yeah me did you make some fun topicals yeah oh if you want to learn a little more of a beautiful Daisy here check out our Instagram bug dot lady Daisy yeah I get a kick out of course the one is later day today go check it out so thank you so much for tuning in everybody thanks for all the support we are the best buds smoking the best buds so go grab your best buds and go smoke some buds thank you coming on thank you for tuning in till next time", "K7EcpMo7oWg": "[Music] well thank you very much for introduction it's a really a pleasure to be here so thank you to Steve gerecke and the organizers for having me in Oslo today it's really a pleasure to be here so I come from the University of Bath and these are the Roman bars this isn't my office I wish it was maybe one of these days but we're famous in bar for the Roman ruins and this morning in terms of the talks you've heard I think there's been a really clear message from both talks that cannabis products have changed dramatically especially over the last five to ten years one of the things that's really interested me is how changes in these products might impact on the health of the user and especially when we think about young people the other thing that's changed is that the science of the cannabis plant has really taken great steps forward and so when we think about cannabis it's not just one drug it's a plant that contains many different drugs and so when we think about the science of cannabis and cannabinoids this could lead us to new innovations for treatment of harm reduction so there are many names here this is for good reason this is not just my work this is a group effort so I'm very thankful to my colleagues who've worked with me on these projects the work I'm presenting in this talk was funded by the Medical Research Council and the Society for the study of addiction I've never accepted any money from industry and I have no conflicts of interest to declare so briefly this is a structure of my talk I'll start by talking about the cannabis plant in cannabinoids I'll then go into the health effects of high potency cannabis products leading on from that I'll talk about potential harm reduction strategies that you might find useful when engaging with young people and finally I'll talk about CBD as a potential treatment for cannabis problems so the cannabis plan really is a fascinating plant it produces at least 144 cannabinoids and a cannabinoid is a chemical that acts on the endocannabinoid system which all mammals have I'll get to more of that later but the main - of interest are THC Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol and CBD or cannabidiol our both THC and CBD are produced alongside the rest of the cannabinoids in these glandular trichomes so you can see in this figure on the bottom you can see a bulbous cell head this is a glandular trichomes and so this is where we see cannabinoids are produced in the plant and it's important to think about cannabinoids from the plants perspective and the reason that they're produced is is for reasons of defense so both THC and CBD you can protect the cannabis plant against the effects of UV light so essentially it's almost like a sunscreen for the cannabis plant these cannabinoids are protecting them the other thing is that these trichomes they have sticky secretions and so if an insect was to crawl on on one of these trichomes it would get stuck and it would die so so there's a two-fold protection mechanism both UV light and also the stickiness of these these trichomes and for this reason because they are very protective we see them in the most important part of the cannabis plant which is these flowering tops of the female plants reproductive organs and this is important because when we think about cannabis products what people typically do unsurprisingly is that they take the cannabis flowers from female plants this is a cannabis that young people use and also when we try to extract cannabis preparations to make them more potent we're looking really at these trichomes and we're looking can we make cannabis extraction more efficient and it's very much based on where cannabinoids are produced within these cells one of the unwell than one of the other interesting things about the cannabis plant and THC and CBD is that we see three main types of cannabis based on how much of each of these they produce so most cannabis used recreationally is of the THC dominant form you can see this here on the left and so these plants produce just THC they don't produce any any CBD at all just a very small amount and not not surprisingly this kind of cannabis is more intoxicating and so people tend to use this it's more profitable and it makes sense of people to use this form of cannabis for recreational use you can also have the mixed THC CBD strains these are quite a good strain in terms of safety because they produce modest amount of THC and also modest amounts of CBD so sometimes you will see this kind of cannabis recreationally and sometimes a medicinal forms of cannabis and finally you have CBD dominant cannabis and this produces lots of CBD and a small amount of THC so it's very rare to see this for recreational purposes because it won't be intoxicating but at the same time this is a kind of cannabis plant that's used to extract CBD preparations that you might see in the high street so for example CBD oils these still have some THC in them that's a risk of these products as you can see from this graph there is still some THC but in general cannabis falls into these free main themes an important take-home message is that if your plant is producing a lot of CBD it can't produce much THC in vice versa it's a rate limiting factor so you can't produce lots of THC and lots of CBD at the same time but we're also very interested in in humans and in terms of the effects on the brain and mental health and I mentioned previously that all mammals have an endocannabinoid system this is very important for modulating lots of bodily processes but especially I'm going to talk about psychiatric processes today so what you can see from this figure on the right is an image of the brain with regions showing high levels of cannabinoid receptors and so you can see the areas that have the darker blue those are the regions that have a higher density of cannabinoids type 1 receptors these include the hippocampus which is very much involved in learning and memory as we heard from jonathan earlier nobody takes THD to improve their cognition that we don't get any THC for chess players there's a good reason for this it really impairs your memory it also impairs your planning which is partly controlled by the prefrontal cortex you can see here is very densely innervated by cannabinoid type 1 receptors and we also see regions which were involved in reward and emotions such as the basolateral amygdala and it can account for the dependence inducing effects of cannabis as well as its effects on emotion and now we're just looking at THC and CBD in terms of the effects they produce these dose-dependent and THC most reliably produces intoxicating effects so we know that people become stoned or high and often they enjoy this so this is a rewarding and toxic heating effect but at the same time sometimes people do experience anxiety and psychotic like symptoms especially from high doses so if you've been as to THC in the lab you robustly see these anxiety and psychotic like effects that then dissipate after the experiment is finished one of the other things is both humans and non-human animals will self administer THC its dependence forming and this is one of the major harms of cannabis uses the dependence warming effects of THC now looking to CBD is very contrasting to THC CBD is not intoxicating at typical doses you have to use a very very high dose to get intoxicating effects and that never happens with the doses that people consume in real life one of the interesting things about CBD is that it could potentially reduce anxiety there is some experimental studies showing this and for psych for psychosis there are two positive clinical trials showing that CBD could reduce psychotic symptoms so in terms of psychiatric drug development CBD has been very interesting another fields where it's been very interesting is severe childhood epilepsy syndromes and in terms of addiction there's some experimental and preclinical work showing that CBD could be ant addictive so very contrasting effects of THC and CBD overall and when we think about cannabis the most common form typically is herbal cannabis and there are two main forms so the seeded herbal cannabis is a very traditional form of cannabis you don't see very much in Europe today and this is typically outdoor grown and it involves cannabis plants which you include a combination of females and males and so we're taking the flowers from the female plants but what's happened is that the males have actually fertilized those female plants and produce seeds as a result when the female produces seeds it produces less THC so as as a result this seeded her what cannabis has quite a low concentration of THC approximately six percent more common now is is sense Emilia where in Spanish means without seeds and so here we have the female plant separated from the male's this allows them to produce more THC or CBD if that's a preferential cannabinoid and other interventions such as indoor growing and UV light could increase the cannabinoid symphysis and since amelia is typically around 15 percent THC it can get to around 20 25 percent THC as well so much higher overall cannabis resin is is very is very important for the European cannabis market and there are many different ways you can make it but essentially the most common is the saving method and here you have your herb or cannabis material it's broken up and what you want to do is to loosen those trichomes and get these trichomes you want to keep the THC but to lose the herbal plant material so what you do is you get a very fine mesh and this is just the right size such that the trichomes will fall through and you'll collect them below and the herbal cannabis material will stay on top so you can see what happens the the trichome heads fall off from the body and then they'll fall through your screen and what you'll be left with is this loose material which is sometimes called kief and these are just the trichomes on their own and this is sometimes sold as an as a product by itself more commonly it's it's pressed and when it's compressed it can produce cannabis resin which ranges quite a lot in THC concentrations typically five to 20 percent THC over time people have developed new methods to extract trichomes and there have been innovations here one method is using a combination of cold water and agitation and the reason this works is that it makes those trichomes very very brittle and so you have icy water and a food mixer here this dislodges the trichomes separates them in a more efficient way but essentially it follows the same process because you're using a sieve to separate out those trichomes from the plant material called water hash or ice extraction and what you're left with is a kind of this product that's much higher in THC concentration so you might have around 30 percent THC using this method and concentrates have been a very important part of legal markets in Washington State and other legal cannabis markets in the USA one of the first and most widely known was butane hash oil this is actually very easy but very dangerous to make in at home so what you need is essentially a glass tube and within this glass tube you can place your ground herbal cannabis and you pack it tight and that's that's the starting point you can then go to a store and buy a kind of butane okay and so you push the butane free and what this does is it collects the trichomes and then you can drain the material onto this tray below and this contains a combination of the butane and the cannabinoids so the next stage is to purge the solution which removes in theory and the butane and then what you're left with finally is a very highly potent product such as shatter at around 80 percent THC and there are three major concerns with this kind of product the first is the obvious one in that you have a much higher concentration of THC and potentially greater dose the second is that you're using butane in a potentially dangerous illicit environment and there's a big risk of explosion and so where I'm from in the UK there were a string of explosions in 2006 some involving death when you looked at the buildings that we use to make this the whole buildings are blown apart so this at large scales can be a very very dangerous dangerous process and and the final risk is that you do get residue solvent material so when we use butane there's a risk of inhaling residue solvent when we produce medicinal products we have very strict regulations for for these residues but actually as you'd expect one produced in an illicit environment there's no regulation there so there's a risk of these another thing is that with the concentrate process you're extracting that cannabinoids directly from inside the cell and so this is much more efficient than simply dislodging the cell and this this can explain why we see much higher concentrations for the concentrates when compared to the cannabis resin since then there have been more innovations especially in the USA in terms of safer methods of extraction one being co2 that can produce similar concentrations I'm using more sophisticated equipment another development has been rosin which is is a very interesting product because this is this is very easy to produce using only hair straighteners and parchment paper so it's very easy to produce using household materials and it's not a dangerous process essentially it uses a combination of heat and pressure and by doing so you get a very efficient extraction process this is a very valuable product in a new legal markets because it can carry the distinctive taste and smell of herbal cannabis which is often missing from cannabis resin so so rosin is is potentially a new trend that might emerge further and also distillation is taking things to the maximum in terms of almost 100% THC and these products look very different because in fact they can be a clear crystal and so when when regulators find a seizure of of this product they think it might be crack cocaine or methamphetamine in fact it is is THC and this is a very rare product but some vendors in the USA is selling these products now now I present an overview of lots of different products this is a summary of changes in the USA based on from Mahmood our Solly's lab in mississippi and so over the course of ten years we saw an increase from 9 to 17 percent THC across all of these products if we break it down by product there as you can expect much higher tough concentrations for those concentrates but overall an increase in all kind of its products and it's largely driven by an increase in the prevalence of cents Amelia cannabis and the other thing that happened was that the THC to CBD ratio rose considerably so so from 23 to 1 to 100 and 4 to 1 so the concentration of CBD wasn't very high to start with it's getting even lower relative to THC ok so I've given you a brief overview of the changes in cannabis products and in THC and CBD concentrations now I'm going to go into the health effects of these changes this was a study we conducted in in the UK some time ago we were very interested in the use of these different products and since Amelia which in the UK is often called skunk and you often across different countries you have different names for these products but I'm going to use the term cents Amelia here and in the UK at the time this sense Amelia was a high THC product we also had seeded herb or cannabis which has low THC and we had hashish or cannabis resin which was low THC at that time in the UK and we were very interested in how use of these different products affected the user and so for this sample we found people who had experience of using all three of these types in the last year is what you often find is that some people prefer to use a specific type while others prefer a different type and if you compare them they might they might have other differences and so we were really interested in people who used all three types and comparing their level of use what you can see on this graph is people's choices when when selecting which kind of cannabis had each of these attributes which includes a combination of negative effects positive effects and fairly neutral characteristics so if we look at the high THC form sense Emilia you can see unanimously this was the kind of cannabis that impaired people memory the most so over 80% for this it also made them the most paranoid so in terms of negative effects a high THC form of cannabis was very very pronounced at the same time these people said that it gave them the best high it was also the most available and their preferred type and so these data I think give perspective to the consumer in that they can recognize that a drug can have benefits as well as harms and I think when we discuss cannabis with young people it's important to recognize that there may be benefits and there may be harms and understanding that in getting the balance right in terms of a message that that can help them so the real the real aim of this study was to look at dependency and we use the severity of dependence scale which is a standard screening instrument for looking at dependency to a range of drugs and what we found was that the more days people use cents Amelia every month the more dependent they were there is a very clear relationship where by increased use was related to increased dependency but in fact for the low THC forms of cannabis we didn't see this relationship at all so it doesn't matter for the low potency forms based on this study how much you use you don't have that risk but for the high THC form you do have this increased risk with use and the other important finding from the study was that younger people were more vulnerable so the relationship between a high THC cannabis and dependency was stronger as age decreased and this relates potentially to the role of the endocannabinoid system in neuro development so we know that adolescents may be especially vulnerable to the effects of cannabis and so high THC forms particularly could be harmful during adolescence so that was a cross-sectional study but of course cannabis has been changing over time and we were very interested in these changes so you can see these two panels show data from the EMC DDA who wanted to drug use across Europe and you can see on the left this was an analysis I did for EMC DDA based on concentrations of THC in cannabis resin so you can see there's this dramatic increase in in THC over time across Europe and at the same time when we're thinking about addiction as we've heard from from an Lin's presentation earlier there's been an increase in treatment seeking for cannabis problems and you can see that on the right panel here so these are all countries across across Europe we can see cannabis is shown in red and treatment demand for cannabis is increased and actually superseded opioids as a primary reason for first-time treatment entrants and so we were scratching our heads and thinking I'm gonna say is there something happening here could it be that the increase in THC could be at least partially responsible for the increased in treatment seeking and this was the hypothesis were very interested in testing so in order to do so we found the highest quality monitoring data in in the world which is actually conducted in the Netherlands the reason it's the highest quality is because they use randomised sampling from coffee shops and there's a real advantage to this because when we look at cannabis seized from the police we know that that happens in a biased way so the kind of person who gets stopped and searched for their cannabis well the kind of person who gets intercepted at the border might not be a typical consumer you might have larger quantities of cannabis different profiles of users and you might have more samples in particular regions in different years so you don't have a really good estimate of the THC concentration but what they've been doing at the trim boss Institute is over over 16 years they've been visiting a random selection of coffee shops across the country and testing these kind of its products using this random method for THC concentrations and in order to look at cannabis treatment we use national treatment data so all new cannabis admissions first time cannabis admissions presenting with in this region during the same time period and when we when we fit these two datasets together what we saw was a in the Netherlands there was quite an interesting profile of change shown in red here characterized by a rapid increase in THC between 2000 and 2004 followed by a subsequent decline so then decreasing up to 2015 and we saw a very similar profile of change for the cannabis treatment data so in terms of clinical treatment among there was a huge increase and this also decreased after a short delay this was best fit by a five-year time lag which is within the reason of within the region of how THC might affect the trajectory from initial use to seeking treatment of following severe dependency of course these are observational data and they do not apply cause and effect but they are consistent with the hypothesis that THC increases could contribute to increased treatment demand okay so now I'm going to move on to psychosis which is a very controversial topic especially in the UK and I'm not sure what people's views are here but I'll tell you about some recent data that we collected with colleagues at King's College London and across across Europe and Brazil so this was a study published earlier this year and it looked at first episode psychosis and control patients across 11 sites in Europe and Brazil so is a very large and widespread study he used a case control design to look at patterns of cannabis use in the first episode patients and the controls and the main aim was to look at weather patterns of cannabis use were related to the risk of psychosis and we looked at patterns of daily use so so how frequently were people using and also the cut the kind of product used so using data from the EMC DDA we were able to look at THC concentrations in each of these countries and then the second part was to look at population measures of cannabis use in controls and see if these predicted the incidence of psychosis at these sites so what you can see from this graph here is the risk of psychosis according to level of cannabis use so on the y-axis you can see this is yds ratio and right at the left the odds ratio for never using cannabis is one so this is all relative to never use so when this increases it shows an increased risk of psychosis when compared to never using at all and if you if you look at the graph you can see that there are green bars and red bars the difference between these is that the red bars were adjusted for several confounders but you can see that overall the estimates are quite similar to the green bars so I don't suggest that you look at difference between those in too much detail the main message from this figure is that as the frequency and the potency increased so did the risk of psychosis and so you can see if you were using cannabis rarely you didn't experience an increase risk at all so using kind of it's rarely in terms of risk of psychosis was was relatively safe according to the study the real risk came among the daily users as you heard from Jonathan Calkins talked earlier this is really the level of use that becomes problematic and that we should pay attention to and so you can see the final two graphs on the right the daily users who were using a lower potency cannabis actually had a relatively low risk of psychosis when compared to never users but for those who use daily and above 10% THC it was approximately 5 holid higher so so this suggests that increasing frequency in potency make might confer greater risk of psychosis and then the second part of this study was making use of these sites we had across Europe and Brazil and looking at the prevalence of high potency cannabis use shown here in green saree shown in in blue and you could also see the adjusted incidence of psychosis across sites shown in red and what you can see is that there is a correlation between how how frequently you see people using on the high potency forms of cannabis across these sites and how many people come forward the first episode psychosis clinics with this disorder so it's really the sites such as London which is where I used to work and Amsterdam and Paris these are really the main risky areas in terms of both high prevalence of high potency cannabis use and also the adjusted incidents of psychosis now as I said this is a very controversial topic and it's an area of active debate so in terms of causality there has been some mixed evidence based on a study by Suzy gage there is some evidence that cannabis nation initiation can cause psychosis risk but also that the reverse could be true so people who have a psychosis risk and more likely to initiate cannabis use so with these data it's important to bear that in mind at the same time before educating youth the association is there it's very strong and so it's an important message to convey so in the next part of the talk I'm going to focus briefly on harm reduction and some excellent guidelines which have been developed by Benedict Fisher so these came out of of Canada and they're officially endorsed by Health Canada and I'm not sure if anyone's seen these before but I recommend that you do look at them so there are ten recommendations which are evidence-based these were based on a systematic review published in a prestigious Journal and they're neatly summarized in this table here so these are the kind of recommendations you might give to young people if if they if they're abstinent that's the ideal outcome so the number one recommendation is that the best way to avoid the health consequences of cannabis its abstinence that's what we should aim for but if people do continue to use they might reduce our harm by adopting some of these strategies whether or not they listen is is another question but these tools may be helpful for at least some individuals now if we think about the kind of topics I've spoken about one one of the recommendations is to identify and choose lower risk products and this specifically as products with a low THC concentration or low THC to CBD ratio and another recommendation is to limit or reduce how much you use but one thing that's missing from this is recommendations based on quantity reviews so for example where I'm from in the UK the only kind of kind of is available is the high THC form and so I might try to avoid that type of cannabis but actually I can't and so if I if I still wanted to use cannabis how could I use that form of cannabis more safely and that's something that's missing in these recommendations if we think about alcohol harm reduction there's a lot more progress in this field it's it's not surprising so these are some estimates I got please correct me if I'm wrong so in Norway as far as I could tell at the size of a standard Dean it was 12 grams and recommendations where that men should have no more than 21 standard drinks per week and for women 14 standard drinks per week these are quite similar to the UK guidelines we used to have now we've made men and women the same at 14 units but here what we have is the size of a standard unit which is established in grams it's very precise and we also have quantitative quantitative recommendations to say if you're using alcohol within a week this is approximately how much you should drink don't exceed that avoiding might be at risk of harm with cannabis we're not we're not there yet so one of the things that I've been trying to develop is the idea of a standard THC unit based on a fixed quantity of THC which could for example be 5 milligrams of THC and as you'll have heard from Jonathan's talk this is the cup the amount of cannabis the people used to consume a long time ago nowadays are consumed you much more as we've seen kind of its products have changed remarkably and there are many different products as you can see here the aim would be that a standard unit could apply across all of these products but there are severe challenges with this one is that it's very difficult to implement standard units in illicit markets another is that people administer cannabis in different ways so we know that if you inhale cannabis you have a very rapid onset of effects followed by rapid dissipation of effects whereas if people eat cannabis which is very common now in certain certain regions and forbidden medicinal use as well what we see there is a slower onset of effects and they're slower dissipation so very very different in terms of the time effect profile and another thing is that the cannabis plant as I said it contains many other cannabinoids and it's not just a case of THC so as the science progresses we might see new developments in terms of ways to reduce arm okay so finally I'm going to talk about CBD and this is really building on the idea that other aspects of the cannabis plant could be helpful for harm reduction or treatment and these are data from a clinical trial that's just being completed and it's not published yet I'm very excited to share these data with you today so going back to cannabis and cannabinoids as possible the cannabis plant could contain both the cause of addiction in terms of THC but also potentially a cure for addiction in terms of CBD and its anti addiction effects alongside potential mental health benefits for anxiety and psychosis one of the other things we see in over the years is that CBD can influence the effects of THC and this is a systematic review we've recently published on experimental studies where we had a fixed concentration of THC administered and then in one of those conditions they received CBD and we're saying does CBD influence that effect and having researched this area for many years I can tell you that the findings are quite mixed we've had some really encouraging findings but not for all studies but overall the most common finding was that CBD reduce the effects of THC so that there might be a role of CBD in terms of harm reduction potentially by reducing some of the negative effects it doesn't tend to reduce intoxication but it might reduce the psychotic like effects and anxiety and potentially having effects on emotion and reward one of the studies that we did some time ago was looking at a specific cognitive process related to addiction so so my job come can I kind of interesting tasks to do as part of my job one of those is to take pictures of drugs and then to take pictures of things that look like drugs but aren't drugs so you can see here this is a carefully controlled set of images one contains cannabis and one contains some neutral items and so the aim is that if somebody who doesn't use cannabis looks at these they shouldn't be particularly interested in over them somebody uses cannabis on a daily basis so I find their attention drawn to that kind of mist image and they can't look away and this is something we see across drugs of abuse it's a very common process called attention of and it's also related to those increased cognitions and craving related to a drug people can't stop thinking about them and in this task we were measuring people's tendency to fixate on the cannabis images and what we expect to see is that people whose kind of it's daily they show an attentional bias towards this kind of askew but what we were interested in is whether CBD might affect this this typical process in the daily users so what you can see here from the data is that people who had low CBD in their cannabis showed the typical attentional bias this is shown in in the left with the red bar so they had an attentional bias greater than zero so they were fixating on those kind of images as we expect them to but those people who had high CBD in their cannabis they showed the opposite effects there they're actually looking away from the cannabis they were looking towards a neutral cues which might be indicative of some kind of treatment response well you're so so looking at people's explicit ratings of how pleasant these cues were were that the CBD cannabis made the images less explicitly Pleasant and this was a pilot study with some really exciting findings based on a small sample size showing that CBD may reduce tobacco smoking so on the left you could see that people treated with placebo over the course of one week didn't reduce their tobacco smoking at all but those treated with CBD showed a reduction in tobacco use and we know that cannabis is very often co-administered of tobacco especially in Europe so this was important in terms of cannabis treatment so we were really interested to test whether CBD could reduce cannabis use but this was the first study to do this and so we had very limited information about the dose we know based on other fields such as anxiety there's an inverted u dose response curve where by having a dose that's too low or too high we'll miss the effects and you need to get the dose just right in the middle so we tested a range of doses so use this adaptive design consisting of placebo and the free doses of CBD 200 408 and milligrams or people had a dsm-5 cannabis use disorder and they all received motivational interviewing as part of this so everyone received a psychological intervention and to skip this section but I'll let you know that the primary outcome is kind of issues measured by biological and self-report measures so what we did at an early stage was that we showed that 200 milligrams was not going to be an effective dose for reducing cannabis use so we dropped it and we continued randomizing to placebo and the higher two doses of CBD and our sample were predominantly in their mid twenties male and with a severe cannabis use disorder had a very high retention in treatment 94% completed treatment and what you can see here is that for urinary THC there was a forty five percent reduction in cannabis use compared to placebo and that's shown by a high concentration of these dots in a placebo side of the graph when compared to THC so overall CBD reduced cannabis use according to urinary measures we also saw a similar effect for 800 milligrams CBD so so all of these data points are moving away from that central line showing reduced kind of issues in those treated with CBD at 800 milligrams but in terms of days absent from cannabis we saw the same profile here we wanted CBD to increase days abstinent and we saw more days absent in the CBD group compared to placebo for 400 milligrams so approximately 2.2 times more likely to be abstinent on a typical day when compared to placebo and we saw a similar effect slightly smaller for the 800 milligrams again more likely to be absent on a typical day when compared to placebo and I would go through these graphs in more time but I'm aware that time is running out so I'm going to skip through these in terms of safety we saw 94% of people completed treatment no one dropped out due to the effects of CBD and the rate of adverse events was low with no severe adverse events and in terms of secondary outcomes we saw some benefits of cannabis withdrawal symptoms and for tobacco use we actually saw poor asleep quality in the CBD groups which we think was due to the reduction in cannabis use and withdrawal in terms of sleep and some benefits in terms of depression and anxiety no changes in our core use so in conclusion high potency cannabis products carry a greater risk of addiction and psychosis based on the data represented and lower risk I'd lines currently encourage people who do continue to use cannabis to choose a lower THC or lower THC CBD ratio products in future it may be that standard THC units could inform guidelines by providing quantitative recommendations and importantly if these units we use to inform pricing so minimum unit pricing we know it's very effective for reducing alcohol consumption this could be a way in combination with reduced availability to reduce consumption in the heaviest consumers CBD is another cannabinoid that shows really interesting medicinal effects it's been shown to influence the effects of THC across some studies and it may have potential for treating addiction and mental health disorders in this preliminary study we found that CBD was more effective than placebo at reducing cannabis use so maybe that THC is the cause and CBD could be a potential cure for some people in terms of cannabis use disorders but this is a preliminary preliminary study and it's a dose finding trial so further evidence is needed to inform these effect size estimates and to generate robust suggestions of what can be used in clinical practice thank you very much [Applause] [Music]", "1WWvL2HXpkk": "hi everybody Salima here yoga therapist and this is the second of our two-part series or four part series on CBD which is the non psychoactive part of the cannabis plant and the healing benefits that you can gain from that I want to start today with a showing you some products these are topical creams and these creams come in regular strength and extra strength and then I also have a CBD cooling stick so I want to show you some options for healing if you have joint or muscle pain particularly arthritis or if you have sore muscles from your workouts or any other thing you twisted your ankles or a carpal tunnel syndrome for example anything where your joints or your muscles have been affected and you're looking for a non-prescription and non-medicated type of cream or non-pharmaceutical I should say this is plant medicine and I'm going to just simply show you how this is used this is extra strength and the extra strength comes in a little container like this and and really speaking you just apply it like any other cream if I have a little bit of soreness around my joints so I'm gonna take this extra strength and rub it in and generally speaking I feel the relief in about 15 minutes or so and I like to do this in the morning first thing in the morning and then I also do this at the end of the day just before I'm getting into bed you could apply to three times a day in order to feel the soothing effect over the course of the entire day it depends on your schedule depends on how often you want to use the cream but this one works really well you can see that it's not very greasy it's not - it's easy to absorb into the skin and if goes on really nice and there's no scent on this at all so this is an option if you've got joint or muscle pain this is an extra strength CBD cream healing balm so that you can heal topically the other option if you're experiencing inflammation so let's say you have an injury and it's a it's a it's a pain that feels inflamed so there's a bruise it's feeling warm to the touch the other option is to take cooling stick and so this cooling stick you apply it it's in the shape of a deodorant and you take the stick cover off roll it up a little bit and then apply this to your skin and you'll feel a cooling relief almost immediately and then this one also includes a little bit of the smell of peppermint so using regular essential oils this has a cooling effect and also a great way to work through any topical pain so the option is here rather than to go for something from the pharmacy or from the drugstore is to take mother nature's course first is to apply a little bit of plant medicine notice how it feels this I've seen also my clients use if they've experienced some tenderness or soreness after they've done a yoga class and they come out and they have applied some of this cream and in to great effect so I wanted to share that option with you if you're looking to purchase some of these you can click the link below and you'll have access to all of the different products that are available and remember this is CBD so there's no psychoactive effect you won't feel hi this is on your skin and a great way to leverage what we know about plant medicine is that it works very intuitively with your everyone has a different kind of healing benefit and it might just be the next best thing for you happy to help and if you have any questions please leave that here underneath the video and subscribe and like

can hear me thank you for that uh wonderful introduction alana it's my pleasure to be here um it was very comprehensive that's uh the introduction i'm not sure how much else i need to see but um just to reiterate i am an internal medicine specialist and i am very interested in the medical cannabis space um one of the reasons um that i got involved with this with this area was because i had my patients um or i explored the the cannabis uh with my patients and found that there was some profound benefits but there was a big lack of data and so the clinics um that i have worked and founded um with is a multi-disciplinary clinic and we are data-driven so our goals are to look at the data to collect the data and to better understand what cannabis can be used for and that's what i'm hoping to share with you today because parkinso disease is one of those diseases that there isn't just one thing that parkinson's patients suffer from there's a host of things and the current standard of treatment isn't if i could be honest and frank isn't great um and so um a lot of patients are seeking um other alternatives and that's what i'm hoping to be able to share and shed some light into uh today because i think cannabis does have a role okay so um as uh a summary of what we're going to talk about um we'll talk about a general overview of some parkinson's theory uh we'll look at the cannabis uh overview and then we'll go to some frequently asked questions okay so uh parkinson's disease right and so um when you look at the causes of parkinson's disease this is just a summary for what i think many of the attendees here probably already know there is things like um you know there's a genetic component to it um like michael j fox there's environmental causes you know listed here some pesticides and carbon monoxide there's this very interesting um thought that's going out right now about this gut brain connection whereby a lot of the gut microbiome actually causes influence to our mind and how we think and it can lead to some um to some changes that cause parkinsonian like uh symptoms then there are you know risk factors like age and a family history males are more likely to get parkinson's than females environmental exposures and then essentially what happens in parkinson's is that you get this breakdown of the nerve cells um and it's mostly the dopamine releasing nerve cells which is why things like the the standard of treatment is like cinnamon or carbidopa which tries to replace the the dopamine and the idea is that some of the symptoms of parkinson's and you'll see as we go through the theory that not all of them can be explained with just dopamine-releasing cells which is why that cinnamon only addresses some of the symptoms of parkinson's so this was a theory that was proposed that i really really liked and it talks about parkinson in stages um and so most people don't re most people when they think about parkinson's disease they think of you know things like the cardinal symptoms which is the bretokinesia which is a slowing of the movements you know or the pill rolling tremor um or they look a bit flat in terms of how they look right or they start tripping um but that you'll see here actually is kind of a later uh a later stage usually in the stage three right so but parkinson's disease may start as early as stage one and this is why i like this because there are subtle features of parkinson's that may um that may be um present before what people think like ah you must have parkinson's or they they start noticing the pill rolling tremor and that's when people start screening for it so when you look at it you know the in the first steps of parkinson's um or the first stage you lose things that are more non-specific so you get less spell you get things like you get constipated and that's as you go up from the brain stem up to the higher levels of the brain okay so just to give everyone here an idea or a review this this is our brain here and you'll see that um the lower parts of the brain are what's called the the more rudimentary parts this is like for you know your breathing center um and what differentiates us as humans is more the upper brain which is our complex thinking and our critical thinking so this stuff down here in the brain stem you know the the green and the whatever stage one it's sort of a yellow green um that's sort of the the primitive centers in our brain okay and so that's where you get things like constipation and smell and then as you move up you start to affect some of the substantia [ __ ] which is um which is where you usually um cause problems um and that's when you start getting symptoms like okay you get these odd pains that really you know you really can't necessarily pinpoint you get some mood just mood issues um fluctuating mood this is where people start noticing sleep right and so sleep is is um one of the things that's really affected in in patients with parkinson's right and you'll see here that you can imagine that when patients present in stage one or stage two it's rather difficult to say that yeah this person has uh parkinson's because these could be from lots of different things right sinus issues poor sleep could be from stress you know mood can also be from stress so it's not until you get to stage three that people start noticing things like okay you're moving slowly you're getting more rigid you're getting some freezing and then that's when you get the pill rolling tremor and then when you look back you start seeing that oh yeah i had all these other symptoms too but what's interesting also is that parkinson's doesn't stop at stage three right and so as you move up into stage four stage five stage six you start affecting other things that actually become more significant right so as you move up you get more emotional problems that's when you start getting more long-term problems and as you can follow this arrow up the brain as it goes up higher and higher you start getting more and more of the um of the areas in the brain uh that makes us unique as humans okay so the critical thinking the memory um the planning the executive planning and so this is parkinson's and i think it's really nice um overview um so just as a very general review all that i really wanted to show here was these are the cardinal symptoms of parkinson's these are like what people think of as classic but this is not all that parkinson patients deal with right because there's a lot of mood issues in parkinson's patients that may go under appreciated there's psychotic uh things that people can start to hallucinate and then there's cognitive like the dysfunction of thinking fatigue is a big thing you know we don't treat very well sleep disturbance is also probably related to fatigue and all of this is just trying to say that if we look at parkinson's we have to look beyond the pill rolling tremor or just the tremor we have to look beyond that we have to look beyond just the rigidity because there's so much more in terms of what affects our park a patient who deals with parkinson's um their quality of life what affects their quality of life pain is also a big one and so here more features you know you can look at them i'm sure that uh for the guests here or the attendees here who suffer from parkinson's they don't necessarily need to read this list because it's something that they already experience in their lives or in the lives of their loved ones so now let's go to uh cannabis so very briefly let's just talk about what like cannabis overview okay so cannabis is a plant this is a plant um there's two different types there's actually three different types of cannabis there's sativa indica and rudoralis root oralis doesn't really have any medicinal properties so i've left it out for the most part in the can sativa are more historical the way that canada has been growing because most of our products are hybrids and it just you know for the most part with the only thing i want to tell you about sativa and indica because you will experience this or you will come across this if you are looking at cannabis treatment is that the cbd or the thc okay which are your cannabinoids that you find in sativa and indica are exactly the same so that was one thing that i never quite realized when i first got into this into this field which is you know cbd if you get it from sativa sativa or cbd if you get it from indica is exactly the same same with the thc they're chemically the same what differs in the sativa and in the indica plants are mostly the terpenes okay which i'll talk about and the minor cannabinoids okay so um cannabinoids are these unique molecules um they're actually not necessarily only found in cannabis they can be found in other plants but for the most part they're found in cannabis um that that um affect the the the host usually through the endocannabinoid system cbd thc are the most predominant of the cannabinoids okay terpenes um are these other uh molecules that are found within the cannabis plant that essentially gives it the fragrance so you know when you smell the cannabis you can smell that's the terpenes but they also have medicinal properties um and in actual fact um terpenes are usually from other plants okay so like spices have terpenes like parsley has terpene and then they've just bred into the cannabis um out in the wild okay but again the only thing i want to mention here is terpenes by themselves have a have medicinal properties and when you combine terpenes with the cannabinoids there's some thought that they may act more synergistically together all right so how can you these are the these are the ways that you can take cannabis i'm going to talk about how cannabis can be used in parkinson's but just generally how can you take what are the methods of consumption or modes of consumption so you know the most common that most people think of is smoking okay this in our clinic is the least favored why is it the least favorite a it's hard to control what you actually get because you're smoking the entire joint for instance um and you may be trading a benefit for uh a long-term um side effect or not a long-term side effect but a long-term problem okay so like why would you get pain control and then get lung problems like why why do that when there's another way to take it if you are you know there's some good things about it because if you do smoke or vaporize it's it has a faster onset but it also comes off less it also wears off quicker if you're going to smoke though try to use a water a bong because it has a water filter on it vaporize is the other way that i think most people may see out in you know in the public and this one you can use usually is you have a dried flower and you put it into a vaporizer it heats it up and you know under different uh temperatures or or boiling points you can you can vaporize the cannabinoids and you inhale it this one you know there's probably some benefit to it uh because it's again very fast onset so if you're in pain you can you can get a you can you can take a puff of the vaporized uh product and you can get effect within usually about five or ten minutes but it also doesn't last that long it usually lasts for about an hour or two the most common in our clinic is usually in the oral route so either a sublingual buccal or a or a capsule okay and so usually you can use you know you hold it for 45 to 60 seconds underneath your tongue the big things to note here is that when you're taking an oral route whether it's underneath the tongue or an edible like like a capsule it can take up to two hours uh to onset okay edibles include capsules and and um with fixed doses and also edibles can include um uh baked foods or like cookies we usually for medical uh don't use uh edibles like gummies because again you you oftentimes trade one problem for another like these high sugary cookies or high sugary gummy bears um and so it has only a little bit of of cbd or thc in it uh mostly cbd and then you take all that sugar in and then there's topical that's coming out on the market um soon or it's there's some products already out on the market i think this has a lot of this has a lot of potential for localized pain um so how can cannabis help in parkinson's this is not just how can cannabis help in general but this is remember this my talk is specific for parkinson's patients how can it help so there are four really four main areas that we in our clinic have seen it having benefits okay so in sleep in pain in the tremor and in anxiety or mood disorders so what does the data show this is the truth about cannabis so is cannabis a miracle drug that cures everything okay so obviously the answer is is no right um is cannabis a real medication now normally in my powerpoint slide these would come up one at a time but in this in this way it just all pops up at the same time so um i sort of give away my answers right away but yes it's a real drug and here's what it can it can help for and we have we have really good emerging evidence that it's useful in things like pain in poor sleep in tremors anxiety and ptsd seizures um and inflammation okay so here's the stats here's what it looks like this is this is real life data from our from my clinic okay so this is for pain specifically for pain you can see here okay that of these people the predominant people had some improvement right in pain and this is all comers of pain right most of them can you imagine three like maybe a third of the patients had a significant improvement in their pain so you're talking like at least a 75 reduction and when you look at the dose it's an average of 25 to 50 milligrams per day 76 of our patients had an improvement within the first month this is actually improving as we get more data and we can be a bit more aggressive in our dosing um 82 right 82 had some improvement at the three-month mark right and the reason for this is because we can we can titrate the or or help the patients adjust their medications or their their um their yeah their medication um as we see them in follow-up and you look at this the average pain and this is pain again all cameras not just parkinson's patients so all comer pain their average pain that they said that they quantified was 7.4 out of 10 so it's pretty significant pain 7.4 out of 10 is pretty significant and the pain reduced by almost 48 by almost half okay so this goes down to about three point eight okay and again fourteen percent of patients improved by more than eighty percent when you look at these numbers this is this is comparable to the opiates okay except that we know that opiates have other issues like addiction um dr lim we have a question if you are up first something um there's a question here are there any issues with interactions with other parkinson's disease medications great question so and i'm going to touch on that a little later but i will answer it as well now the answer is is that cannabis does or cbd and thc they do interact or they can interact with medications now specifically to parkinson medications the answer is it depends because parkinson's medications like i like i had mentioned earlier isn't just one thing will it interfere with cinematic dance or carbidova the answer is no but will it interfere with some of the other antipsychotics or antidepressants that you may be con on as well the answer is yes will it be uh will it interfere with or interact with benzodiazepines which some parkinson's patients are on for instance for sleep the answer is yes and so it's important and we've realized this to have a team manage your care okay so you know i'll be the first to admit even with all my training i am not a drug expert okay um you know there's just too much to know but pharmacists i mean that's their job they are drug experts so that's why we have clinical pharmacists on our team to review all of our patients to make sure that there are no drug interactions so kind of a long-winded way to answer it but yes the answer the short answer is yes it can interfere with parkinson's drugs or inner interact we do have another one here does the dose include thc so yes so these doses are 25 to 50 milligrams of cbd okay i should have been more clear here sorry 25 to 50 milligrams of cbd and there is a little bit of thc and usually the doses of our thc are in the one to two milligrams and the reason for the thc is mostly mostly because none of the none of the cbd that we get in canada is hemp derived which means that there is always some amount of thc in our cbd now i will say that actually this may be a good thing because thc is really it's often needed for cbd to act better or to be more effective so a little bit of thc with more cbd actually is better but this is a cbd only dose this is just for cbd okay so let's look at the tremor so this one we don't have as much data and you can see that the numbers aren't very much but there are there is some improvement okay and so some improvement in our in our uh in our tremor patients uh just because the reason that our numbers aren't very high is most of the patients who are being referred to our clinic is for pain and anxiety and so um again most people experience some improvement and again a significant improvement in tremors um and the dose again about 25 milligrams per day is on average what these patients were uh had effect on so what about insomnia more data right so this is for people uh who have trouble sleeping average dose 26 milligrams per day again of cbd thc also has a huge benefit but we use it more cautiously especially in our parkinson patients because there is a risk of of uh hallucinations with with uh with or uh hallucinations or cognitive issues with um with thc and so we tend to use it cautiously i will tell the attendees here that cbd actually counters the effects of thc so if you have a predominant cbd like let's say you're on 50 milligrams a day of cbd adding say 5 or 10 milligrams of thc is not the same effect as going on no cbd and just taking 5 or 10 milligrams of thc okay so cbd actually directly counteracts the effects of thc and so you can see here that cannabis in both cbd and thc together can be hugely um [Music] effective at treating insomnia right so again you look i mean you know yes a significant number of people didn't find any benefit that's okay right but a great majority of people had significant improvement okay 83 at three months and then anxiety all right so when you look at anxiety um also a lot of people improve okay so 87 over three months average dose about 27 milligrams this is again predominantly cbd not very much thc at all because we know that long-term consequences of thc actually may worsen depression and anxiety um so this is uh you know the point that i'm showing this is really just to show everyone that you know the clinic is a data driven and b we are having data right um you can see here that not very many people get worse right all of these things very little people get worse and so it's safe and it's potentially very effective okay so um are there risks to taking cannabis and the answer is is yes right so there are side effects to cannabis thc i usually break them down into two thc is what we're mostly you know what we hear in the public um that's the stuff that makes people high it make you know so obviously it's side effect or not necessarily a side effect to some people who want it right it makes them high it makes them drowsy this is why it can be helpful in people with insomnia it can make people have um balance issues so they feel a little bit unsteady on their feet which can again we use this cautiously in parkinson patients because parkinson's patients tend to have stability and mobility issues already so we use this cautiously it can lead to dizziness again the same reason that we use it consciously because we don't want to make any of the the uh mobility issue in parkinson's patients even worse palpitations uh dry mouth um [Music] and so uh again and these things right hallucinations and worsening of anxiety and so we use thc very strategically and very cautiously in our parkinson's patients and usually only when there are on much larger doses of cbd so what's the side effects of cbd you know quite literally not very much there are some patients of ours who who report some loose stools or diarrhea i'm actually more convinced from a clinical standpoint that the loose stool and diarrhea is not so much from the cbd itself but rather the oil so the oil that we're using is an mct oil so um a medium chain triglyceride and some people you know if you take oil it's a bit it gives people kind of makes people a little bit gassy and gives people loose stools and i think that's probably more of what the what the issues are from rather than from the cbd but it's it is something that we notice um some people if they take it for insomnia some people get the the reverse they feel like they're totally energized that's rare but we've seen it um and there are some people who develop some lightheadedness or dizziness but we think in our clinic it's probably more to do with the fact that our cbd here in canada always contains some thc and there are some people who are just very sensitive to thc addictions is there an addictions risk so thc there is an addictions risk but you can see it is extremely small so just to show you uh on the line so this line up here is nicotine we know that nicotine is one of the most addictive drugs out there so this is smoking this is why smokers have a really hard time stopping and then you look here this black is alcohol okay we know that our societies have problems with alcohol consumption but for the most part most people don't get addicted to alcohol but you can see that it's got a significant cocaine is actually right up there not that addictive cocaine just as much as alcohol but you look at thc and look at it and this is a logarithmic scale so this is this is like this is orders of magnitude smaller and so you see that it's not a zero right but it's really small okay is there any addictions raised to cbd the answer is long-term we don't know but it doesn't look like it from a clinical standpoint um there are no there's no uh documented withdrawal symptoms so if you stop people are always worried okay if i stop my medication do i get worse in actual fact we found some really remarkable things with cbd whereby as we escalate the doses of cbd and our patients respond what actually they can do is once they reach a clinical response they stay there for like three months and then some of them for financial reasons usually they stop or they don't take it as often and they realize actually that the benefits are still there and so it's not something that i can necessarily explain except for maybe physiologically your body up regulates the receptors and it gets more efficient at this but i have patients who for instance take cbd for pain and after three months you know they would take it every day or twice a day and then after three months they would take it once every third day or you know once a week or twice a week so it's really very surprising with good control and then there are some um there are some studies out there that suggest okay maybe cbd actually can help with other addictions like you know for cocaine addiction or opiate addiction um i have a couple questions here of course sorry to interject again um is cdb obtained by prescription only yes so right here yeah so it's going to be right here so the answer is no um you don't you don't have to get um cbd through a prescription now i will say this though i'd like to think you know we're two years from the legalization of cannabis in canada and yet despite that believe it or not there is still a lot of grey market stores out there they're decreasing but they're still there and a lot of them have fled to online so i have still believe it or not there are patients of mine who order cbd because a friend told them to order from the site and the site is an unregulated site sorry an unregulated product site they're not they're not health canada approved and so they're selling gray market products and you know the fact of the matter is when i ask my patients it's the same price as the regulator product so i'm not really sure why one would go besides the fact that one may not unders may not realize that that's a great market site and so the best thing to do is if you're looking for it um you know go to a government regulated retail store you can go on the bc website and find out which stores are uh have a license and you can also find out which companies are are licensed through the bcbc government website um so hopefully that answers that question do you want to ask the next question alana first before i go into this sure some really good questions here a couple more can you recommend some strains brands where to buy doctors who we can talk to do you see patients yourself and prescribe cannabis it's a great question and i'm going to answer all of those as we go through i i promise okay um the next one is actually about cbd so maybe you want to answer that one cbd cbd isolate versus full spectrum cbd great question great question so cbd isolates are some companies out there that um that will sell you a cbd isolate um and so the the evidence for the difference between the two isn't great but i can tell you that clinically and from a theoretical and physiologic standpoint full spectrum is probably better and the reason is is that full spectrum allows more synergy so there's this phenomenon called the entourage effect that suggests that in combination the minor cannabinoids or all the cannabinoids act together and the terpenes to provide a more complete response rather than a single pointed response also there is some ancillary evidence to suggest that cbd isolates may not act as well because you'll need higher doses so for instance there's a there's a product on the market for seizures called epidialex epidialex is uh used in the treatment of childhood seizures that's all that it's really approved for certain childhood sweeteners and it's 99 cbd now you know you talk to the company and they'll say that it's a full spectrum but the fact is is that it's 99 cbd so it's actually really close to an iceland um even though it has the other things now if you look at the doses of epidialex for treatment of seizures you're looking at between 800 to 1500 milligrams that's a lot so if anybody has ever purchased cbd you'll know that a usual standard 40 ml bottle of 25 milligrams that's usually a standard is a thousand milligrams and so when you look at the epidiolex to treat childhood seizures you're looking at consuming one entire bottle twice a day right so it's a lot um and so it's a bit anecdotal so i can't don't go don't quote me saying that isolates are are not as effective because we don't know but based on all the information out there and try to gather everything um and putting it all together my sis my my opinion my medical opinion only is that the full spectrum is more efficacious or acts more or acts better or more effectively than the isolates and one more question yes um perhaps you can comment on this uh my doctor and neurologist told me there is no real proof that cbd works well that's so so i can say that unfortunately a lot of my colleagues continue to say things like this when it's not true and i've been trying to single-handedly speak to all of my colleagues across bc and across canada about this first of all um you know if they ever say things like that you can tell them about the phase three trial for the epidialettes that i just mentioned so that's medical cannabis epidialex is the is the cbd uh for childhood seizures that has phase three trials so um to not get too technical phase 3 trials where you get this randomized double-blind control trials is the gold standard for evidence and there is phase 3 trials for epidialex in childhood seizures and so there is lots of emerging evidence to say that cbd is useful a lot of the neurologists and a lot of the gps they just they say that because they don't know and so what i've been trying to say is that instead of saying no why don't we co-manage the patient through for instance through perceive md and then we can all learn together right and so that's what we'll be doing so for instance a lot of the um a lot of the physicians the ep the neurologists who did epilepsy at vancouver general hospital they didn't know anything about medical cannabis but their patients were all on it so what did they do is that we work now directly with them so we see all of their patients who are on medical cannabis uh or who are on cannabis and also happen to have epilepsy so now we share their patients and we manage the cannabis side and they manage the epilepsy side they're the pharmaceutical epilepsy side and we work together as a team so i think that that's a much better approach than saying nope there's no evidence don't go and try it okay so if that's all uh for now i'm gonna answer some of those other questions that were asked um but here so i think this is one of the questions i was asked should i just go get my canvas from a store and just try it out myself right because everything is legal i can just go to the store now i will tell you this going to the store and getting it from a medical uh prescription exactly the same product okay i don't want you to think that the store has sub has um has products that are inferior to the medical realm it's not it's exactly the same so you say okay well why don't i just go to the store to buy it well there's a few reasons one is that it's always better to get a medical practitioner involved if you're really trying to treat a medical problem right that's my fee that's my that's my stance on everything i mean if you have diabetes and you're trying to treat diabetes with your diet you should really try to employ the the help of a dietician so that you can do it properly and so that's one thing the second is that um in the medical route you you can get uh compassion pricing so if your income is below a certain level a lot of like perceive md for instance can help you register with uh with a producer that can get you a discount whereas if you go to a retail shop they're not going to give you any discount you just pay a retail price the third is in regards to pricing as well when you get a medical document for your for your cannabis um you can write it off on your taxes because now you get a medical prescription it becomes a medical um uh it's prescribed by by a physician so it becomes a medical expense so you can write it off on your taxes and some of the third party plans um are covering it okay um so those are the reasons the the and and you know it's it's here as well so the no medical supervision do you really want to just go and buy from a retail store and then try to dose it yourself you know if you're getting side effects who do you ask if there's drug interactions which we already know there are who do you go to right so those are the reasons that i usually give patients say hey like why would you go try to do this on your own when you clearly have um you know a medical condition for it why don't you employ um the services of of a practitioner now i will also say right now that all of our services are free okay so i don't want people to go out there and say well i would employ a medical service but if i could afford it but i don't have any money all of our services are covered under msp so as long as you are you know you you have provincial coverage you will not pay anything to get our services i mean obviously you'll have to pay for the product because we don't control that but our services you know you see a pharmacist you see a nurse you see a doctor all free how much is a cost this is another one of those questions that i always get okay so in general it's about i would say on average about nine or ten cents per milligram so if you're on 50 milligrams a day you're you're about five dollars okay um and a capsule they've come and come down in price about the same so you know if you're on 20 milligrams a day for instance you're spending two dollars a day okay so in a month that's about sixty dollars a thousand milligram bottle is about ninety dollars and depending on how how much your dosing is right um some people can get away with ours we have some patients who use 90 dollars every two months and some patients who use 90 every 20 days okay um and so you can see that again there are there are benefits right if you're spending you know 145 or 135 dollars a month it's you know and you and you'll be eligible for for instance compassion pricing and you get 20 percent off or 15 off and you get a tax deductible i mean it adds up right um this is the question that was asked okay so how do you get to be seen so we uh you can just have your gp refer to us okay um and i can give alana all of the referral information we can we even have a referral sheet that the physician just fills out and signs and then sends to us so we are a referral only clinic but again we are 100 covered by msp um we require referral either from a gp or your neurologist or any other doctor and what's the benefits of seeing us well you see a pharmacist to make sure that there are no drug interactions that we need to be careful about you see a nurse that can help with your intake and answer any questions you see a doctor who can also help and then you see an educator or a coach that can help you that can help you register with a licensed producer help you register for compassion pricing uh help you find help you place your first order and then you know once you get your product and it comes for instance in a bottle and you look at it and you're like i have no idea how to take this the educator can walk you through like okay this is how you take it and now we're doing everything virtually so you could just do it from the comfort of your home we use um a virtual care platform called ollo health that we can you know connect with you on by video or by phone and then we can help you through and this is what we help you with right okay so dosing side effects drug interactions education so that's it so this is the this is the uh the uh website for um perceive md this is our phone number in case you want to call us um yeah or you could just email us okay and again alana i'll give elena the whole package of what we need what you need to get a hold of us um some more questions here um can i ask for a prescription from my family doctor absolutely so yes any doctor can can fill out a prescription if your family physician or your physician is not has never prescribed cannabis before i can tell you that they're probably going to say no and the reason they're going to say no is because to prescribe cannabis is not the same as prescribing any other drug it's really health canada has really bungled it up and it's and it's quite it's it's not necessarily complicated but it's very different than their usual practice and so um yeah but if they've prescribed it by all means yes they can prescribe it and if you want they can send it over to us and then we can we can take that medical document and submit it on your behalf and help you and you know so you can use any part of our service right so if you say okay i only want to use your educator service you can have your family doctor um send us the medical document and we can we can send it to one of the licensed producers on your behalf and we can help you educate and we can help you apply for compassion pricing all that stuff that i suspect their office wouldn't want or wouldn't necessarily offer you and i'm not sure about this question if i'm reading it properly do you take pt from usa and cost i'm not sure what the pt means products maybe do we take products from the usa uh maybe guest 879 can you elaborate patient patient maybe oh do we take patients from the u.s um maybe maybe that's what it's saying so we can we can take private patients um [Music] yes uh and we can uh but it would have to be private paid because they wouldn't be they would no longer fall under the bc uh provincial coverage if you're from out of province we it would have to be private pay again mostly because the provinces don't have an agreement with each other for medical cannabis and for virtual if you're from the us it becomes a challenge because then we have to we have to um recommend the product that you have to go look for in the us which doesn't sound hard but the difference between canada and the us is in terms of regulations so um in canada the the federal government and health canada has mandated that all the licensed producers be uh regulated which means that they control you know things like dosing there has to be certain uh criteria for quality and for consistency of the label so if it says like 25 milligrams per mil that there is about 25 milligrams per mil in there so it's like accurate packaging in the u.s those regulations don't exist which means that the package can be anything and it could be completely different what's inside the package and so it's unfortunate which means that in the u.s you could have a much more variable response all right thank you um another question does cannabis help with dopamine levels the answer is no so cbd can affect things like your serotonin and your dopamine and your norepinephrine receptors but cannabis in and of itself does not increase your dopamine okay so now that's not to say that the it doesn't help with the parkinson tremor okay so you just remember that the parkinson tremor is there because of dopamine uh nerve cells have died or have been injured and they therefore can't act on subsequent uh nerves so it's like one nerve here that's dopamine releasing that acts on this nerve and this stops working so this nerve doesn't work normally okay but this nerve can be regulated directly by cbd okay so for instance if it's a hyperactive nerve it can be attenuated so it's less active just like dopamine would but it's not dopamine whereas cinnamon and the other dopamine agonist actually go in and give the body more dopamine which does the same thing to this to this nerve okay so it's called the different nerve okay and can we get a free consultation an initial consultation yes like i mentioned everything is free except for the products again we i don't control that but the whole assessment um this whole thing about perceive mb is free if we get referred to perceive is the consultation virtual yes yes we have moved to virtual for covid and also to better serve our patients um and also we realize that a lot of our patients they have mobility issues so being seen at home is better um yeah so for those reasons we've decided to go completely virtual um i don't see any more questions in the chat box but i have a question of course um so you know i think many neurologists might be cautious in recommending cannabis use and do you think this has something to do with the concern about the hallucinogenic effects or do you attribute it to something else and is there a high risk for hallucinogenic effects uh for people with pd or or does it just vary from person to person it's a good question so uh off the bat it definitely varies from person to person but the issue really how with neurologists or actually any physician who doesn't consider or won't consider recommending or or trying cannabis is really their own biases and no matter what i think sometimes um people may forget that physicians are human so they're just as human as anybody else we're we're not superheroes which is to say that there is inherent like we live our lives and we still get biased by things around us so you know if people or physicians have uh a son or a daughter who got addicted to cannabis or a friend's friend who got addicted to cannabis or they deal with addictions medicine themselves and they see people addicted to cannabis that they would say no this is not a drug but my argument for uh to that would be the opiates look at the opiate crisis that we're in right now okay it's a terrible crisis people die more people die from opioid overdose than from kovit but i would challenge any person to undergo major surgery without opiates no one would do it it's inhumane okay so the point being that cannabis just because cannabis has been abused it doesn't mean that it has no medicinal benefits because it does and so the problem is is that people tend to bring their own biases into their practice because we're just human and there isn't great there isn't great evidence yet but i can tell you that lots of things that we do in medicine don't have great evidence okay i'm sure that i'll uh some people here i'm certain of it must have been given gabapentin as a prescription drug in the past now i would challenge any of you to ask your physicians to show you what the evidence for gabapentin is and i can tell you that it's quite bad same with the opiates not great evidence for chronic pain use but we do it same with surgeries most surgeries have no good evidence that they work but we do it what i'm trying to say is i'm not saying that surgery is bad or that the opinion is i'm just organ pendant is bad or that opiates are bad i'm just trying to say that there are lots of things in medicine that we do that doesn't have great evidence because we learned over time that it works okay when your appendix bursts and we have to go remove it there's no evidence for that right no one did a trial to say okay if we didn't remove it versus if we did remove it do you die because you wouldn't be able to do that study but surgeons will remove that appendix that's all that's all i really have to say about that sure that's understandable you know i think that oh sorry just one other thing i just wanted to say because there was another point that you made there um that i didn't answer which is the other thing this is that most physicians think of cannabis as thc and so yes and i already mentioned it i am very cautious about giving my cannabis patients thc okay about giving my pd patients thc because a if they already have imbalance issue or dizziness at baseline and i gave them a whole bunch of thc and it just made it worse they're gonna fall and they're gonna break a hip and i'm gonna make them worse so for sure do i want my parkinson's patients high no usually not right but there are some instances actually when the disease is so debilitating that maybe getting a little escape from the reality of the terminal illness is actually a benefit but cbd on the other hand isn't doesn't have these issues right and so that's the problem is that a lot of the people when they when you ask them with medical cannabis they think oh you're going to smoke it and you're going to be thc it's really very far from what we do at the clinic yeah i was just going to say yeah that's understandable on the one hand despite its legalization for sure there is some stigma that is still attached to it and perhaps a misunderstanding between cbd and thc so i think when people think of marijuana they think of being high which is really attributed to thc um and a couple more questions here as well does cannabis help with stiffness so the rigidity i'm pro i think that question is probably referring to the rigidity that parkinson's patients feel where it's almost like things get stuck and the answer is is maybe and i don't know the answer necessarily because we don't we don't have good evidence for it and the reason that i say is maybe is because when you physiologically what causes the stiffness or the rigidity in parkinson's patients it's actually not to do with their muscles it's to do with their nerves okay it's the damage in their nerves that cause the sort of cog wheeling okay and that cog wheeling is if you can fix the nerves um the with cbd you can i guess theoretically or physiologically improve that rigidity now if it's strictly a muscle rigidity because there are some rigidity or stiffness from the muscles itself i don't know right there is some suggestion though that cbd is anti-inflammatory so if it's from inflammation then the answer is maybe it does help um but yeah i don't know the answer for sure okay great another question if my doctor or neurologist refuses to refer what do we do so you know if you try um and you really can't get referred uh we can you know we recommend usually like a walk-in clinic okay um to get a referral and if you really can't we have a no refusal policy all right and perhaps you can comment on this comment my mom was on gabapentin for years and it didn't do anything yes i saw that comment actually it's uh it's like what i said right the elements were kevin pence and it just sort of made me laugh when i saw it because uh i know lots of people like this and um and this is exactly one of those things we give things in medicine all the time based on what someone else may have told us and we've never really looked up the evidence and there's no evidence for it that's why gabapentin doesn't do anything does cbd help with pain yes and so that's why i put the slide up again to show you that it does help with pain your own you're looking at almost a 50 reduction and this is a really good question here how about patients already having hallucinations yes great question so in patients already having hallucinations i would certainly um opt for minimal thc which means that again like another reason not to just go to the to the retail store to get this different companies have varying amounts of thc in them so even though the bottle may say let's say 25 milligrams per ml of cbd the amount of thc in there is varies from accompanying the company some people have like 0.8 or 0.4 milligrams per mill and some people go all the way up to one or two milligrams per mil of thc and so if someone already has hallucinations our team would be very certain um to make sure we choose a product for the patient that has the lowest amount of thc in it um and this and and just mostly cbd uh and the cbd can actually potentially help with some of the hallucinations we have time for a couple more questions do you have patients who take is that patient yes so there are yes so i mean you know we've seen i want to say probably like 2700 patients now so you can imagine that we've seen just about every drug out there in terms of combination uh and so yes we have many patients on quotations it's a pretty common drug um and that's why our pharmacists work directly with the patient and the physician to make sure that okay if we're gonna start and there's a potential interaction these are what to look out for and that's why we see our patients regularly in follow-up so unlike you know some other clinics you know that may say okay here's your prescription for six months go away we make sure that we see we see our patients regularly because i mean it's a journey it's a journey that we go along with the patient okay and one more question here what would be or two more questions what would be the best time of the day to take cbd so there's no real best time to take cbd um it really depends so there are some patients that we have for instance that have predominantly insomnia issues and so we tell them to take it at night you know a few hours before they sleep but there are but but sometimes and it lasts the whole day the next day so it really depends on the person and that's something something that we usually try to help the patients figure out um usually the oral oil or capsule lasts for about eight to twelve hours okay and so you know it depends if you're trying to to help with the tremors in the daytime you may take you know twice a day in the daytime and at night or if you're mostly for tremors and it only bothers you in the daytime maybe you're just taking a daytime and not at night all right and what does oh sorry does thc build up or accumulate in your body so the answer is yes thc and cbd probably do accumulate um they're very lipophilic so they do probably stay in fat um but does that mean that you get addicted or does that mean that you actually get tolerant um and the answer is is we don't know there's some suggestion in the literature when you look at the addiction studies that um that people who use like a lot and i'm talking like a lot like 5 grams 5 to 10 grams a day that they do get withdrawal symptoms but 5 to 10 grams a day is is a i can't i mean for a lot of people they may not realize how much that is but that's an astronomical amount okay i think we have time for one last question here um uh two more questions then and i think that we can wrap it up here um i love that you guys have these really great questions thank you it makes for a better presentation i agree when we have that dialogue um how do we decrease drowsiness in the morning when taken at night for insomnia good question so you can either try to take it earlier in the evening so that its effects are not lasting as long so for instance if you're taking it two hours before bedtime and then you're finding it that it does help you sleep but in the morning when you get up it's you still feel drowsy or a bit groggy for a remaining two hours then you may push the dose back uh to take it two hours earlier at night or you can reduce the dose and the last question if using cbd should i stay away from alcohol i mean in general unless one is consuming a copious amount of alcohol probably not i mean if you're drinking you know one to two glasses of wine for instance a day is fine you know if you're drinking you know half a bottle of wine a day then that's a problem but it's not really a problem so much with the cbd because they tend not to necessarily interact it's more problem with the alcohol consumption and the fact that you're going to get drowsy okay great i think we can wrap things up now uh it's a little past two o'clock dr lam i want to thank you so much for taking the time out of your busy schedule to deliver such an informative presentation for our pd community it really was great and i also want to thank everyone for your great questions um and i'm happy to pass along that information that dr lim um was saying if you send me was that the referral form yeah i'll send you a referral form and some information that they can provide that patients can provide their their family doctors and you can look online as well um both on perceive md and concord medical center you know we're in the transition phase right now but i'll send you both information sure and then i can uh email it to the registrants today so thank you so much and have a great afternoon my pleasure thank you everyone thanks bye-bye bye you", "KGWNCeuuYnw": "I have had chronic pain for the last ten plus years and I've tried pretty much everything that Western medicine has to offer the main cause of my pain is enemy tree osis basically my vagina in abdomen area lower back all of that good stuff hurt all the time but to be honest no surgery amount of yoga prescription pill anything that I've tried has helped me as much as CBD has all the products that I'm going to show you today are very high in CBD and have low to no THC so that I can go about my day without being stoned out of my gourd these are the products that I use every day the first one are these premium gel caps it's just 25 milligrams of CBD they helped me so much with getting an appetite because one of my biggest symptoms with endometriosis is constantly feeling sick to my stomach nauseous never wanting to eat next up I have this paper pen from select CBD the reason I really like select is because they have peppermint flavor that for me helps me a lot like I said I'm nauseous a lot so getting this like quick ingestion with a little peppermint flare where I don't have to have the oil in my mouth is like all I can ask for this is called mad ritual it's just a little balm that I use specifically on my abdomen and lower back it doesn't feel as heavy as other bombs and some lotions that I've tried either like and you don't need to use very much of it which is great because some of these bombs can be pretty pricey these are called basic suppositories so it's a CBD suppository if you don't know what a suppository is it's like this little thing of CBD that I put directly into my vagina so it goes right to the problem area during my period or when I'm having a particularly bad in Demetrios this flare this is kind of specific to endometriosis but I had to include them because half the population has periods this is a lotion that I loved from sagely it's just it's called relief in recovery which is why I started trying it because anything that says relief I really like what I love about sagely products is that they smell very natural and they have pretty good ingredients in them and they also go on non greasy very white and they smell nice so it's kind of like you're just putting on like your daily lotion but you're getting pain relief or benefits from it this is another good option for anti-inflammatory lotion this is a really great option for just a day to day especially if you're like me and you're like typing or on your phone all the time I use this a lot on my wrist to kind of help relieve this is just a simple basic CBD tincture I don't really like tinctures because I don't like putting oil directly into my mouth I'm just it's a weird texture thing for me so this one I mix with a drink and do it that way this has taken me a couple of years to figure out what works for me and unfortunately with CBD it is a lot of trial and error but for me all of that trial and error has been a hundred percent worth it because now I use it every day I really look forward to the day when CBD is as commonly used as aspirin because I I truly believe in it and I truly believe in its effects and I think it could help a lot of people", "ZL_j5dyk1Q8": "and to share with you the value of incorporating topicals into your medicine cabinet we feel that cannabis topicals and saves are generally underutilized they can be really effective for pain inflammation and skin conditions and the great thing is they're not psychoactive now personally I've used topicals a lot for sunspots and small skin cancers and I've had excellent outcomes there is plenty of documentation of people who've used them effectively for arthritis for joint pain and others use them for skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis sometimes you're going to find that topicals are blended with other herbs oils or products that can really help amplify their effect for a specific purpose here are some things to know about topical use a game psychoactivity is not an issue as the cannabinoids don't enter the bloodstream now they're not magical creams that aren't always work wonders upon initial use consistency is the key so I recommend using them multiple times a day and see if they work for you now it's also best to apply topicals at times of the day when you're not moving around a lot or sweating before bed is a great time and throughout the day when perhaps you're at your desk or just not running around let's look at a few simple topical products now there's really no surprises here what you would expect from any cream or therapeutic topical it's really not a huge difference with cannabis okay now with topicals it's hard to tell exactly how much of specific ingredient is in the topical itself obviously a cannabis topical will contain some cannabis or a lot of cannabis the labels should tell you if there's any other herbs or additives within the topical itself a lot of the time they'll use an oil as a base obviously some producers do choose to combine cannabis with other herbs or plants within a topical er south now we know that a lot of plants are good for medical use and depending on the specific intent of a product they could choose to combine it with an array of different plants whether it's for nerve pain inflammation or an array of other specific uses so just pay attention to the labels and start to educate yourself about both what cannabis is good for for you as well as potentially other herbs is also now let's get acquainted with this topical here notice first of all that they put it in a dark container this helps protect it from the Sun and one thing that I like to do it being acquainted with any product really but especially a Savoie topical is to first just simply smell it our smell is a really powerful sense that we have and it can help inform us about what our body likes about what it about what it doesn't like for example and cannabis actually I can smell it it has a distinct smell okay so you can sometimes even tell how concentrated this topical is with cannabis or smell other products within it now when applying can start liberally but the great thing about topicals is that really there's no psychoactivity you can't overdose you can't really overdo it but I like to start still with topicals start low and kind of go slow up in terms of the application just to gauge how effective they are so I have a chronic injury in my wrist from some impact from a martial art so I'm just gonna rub it on I like to rub it on my joints particularly but you can use it for any array of uses sometimes it can be very effective verts in conditions like psoriasis and eczema and dry skin that's really great inflammation like in my case or pain pain in joints or other areas some people use it like my colleague Chris for cancer for skin cancer and it can actually help with that topical application as well so I'm just rubbing it in smoothly if it's really thick you can combine it with another oil that's fine as well any other lipid-based product you can just combine it with whether you like the smell of it or anything so feel free to experiment and combine it with some other products you may use therapeutically and topically okay do as much research as you can we recommend this with any product that you take but it's really harder to go wrong with topicals and they are very safe so enjoy it enjoy your senses and just see how it affective is for your symptoms and condition", "qFPNyuv3pbM": "Welcome back to another video this week I wanted to show you guys how to make your own cannabis lotion So it is a two-part process. I will leave how to make cannabutter in the description box below so you can go look at that video after or before and Super simple to make it's really nice for inflammation, pain it's a lotion it's not a salve there's a lot of videos out there in that say lotion but it's a salve so a lotion is 75% water and 25% oil so it goes on nice and That goes on like a lotion it absorbs nicely and yeah, so we'll get into the video right now So here is the infused coconut oil. I will leave a Description of that in the box below and so what you'll need is 2 x 8 ounce containers. It does make 16 ounces And you'll need two heat safe measuring cups. Preferably larger ones at least one large one you want to be mixing in that one and you'll need two thermometers and a hand blender Rubbing alcohol is super important when you're making a lotion because of contamination. So you want to just Sanitize anything that comes in contact with your lotion including your thermometers forks of the blender The bowl itself, spoons just cover ground so you avoid any sort of bacterial growth And so here is the oil things. We will be using the cannabutter (cannabis butter) I'm setting it to ounces So you'll want to keep the temperature to 70 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes, and this just ensures that The oils have properly melted, it reduces contamination and it helps to emulsify. So keep track of the time and a temperature I'm just pouring the oil into the water, but you could pour the water into the oil I'll be using the blender here Just follow the instructions on that and it will be mixing here for a good two minutes on two minutes off two minutes on For a good like 10 minutes and here the consistency has turned into a lotion it is really nice and creamy and So at this point you could try using a funnel. I tried just I sort of mix it a bit too much in a way and not thick so Here, I'm just using my own piping bag. Well a makeshift one and I will be squeezing it into the containers And so the squeeze bottles are the way to go because it reduces contamination That is it on how to make your own cannabis lotion. It's really easy to make it is a two-step process So I will link the video in the description box below and I will link it here As well if you want to learn how to make that I'm pretty good for different types of things I mean, it's just a generally a nice moisturizer for your body, but you can use it on inflammation If you have like any sort of eczema or psoriasis, I personally have psoriasis Scalp psoriasis and it's going on my forearm, but I've noticed that it actually helps with the itchiness. It seems to tame down the inflammation It's good for pain neuropathy pain sore muscle so really broad spectrum use Yeah, it absorbs really nicely the lotion There we go it doesn't go on really greasy it absorbs really nicely The last lotion that I made was specifically for dry hands. So if you do have dry hands like me Check that out really nice video for that. So I hope you guys have a good day And I will see you guys in the next video. Okay.

for recreational and medical purposes there are over 500 chemicals in the marijuana plant but the most commonly known ones being Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol or THC and cannabidiol or CBD the legality of cannabis differs per country many countries have adopted decriminalization laws to make possessions easier while other countries enforce stricter punishments the countries that have legalized are Canada Georgia South Africa arrghh way and eleven of the United States more areas have legalized the medical use even with the rise and acceptance and usage within the recent years there are so many common misconceptions with the two most well-known being that marijuana is a gateway drug and that it kills brain cells in a 2017 study it was found that 123 million Americans use marijuana while 5.3 use heroin assuming that all heroin users were pot smokers this would result in a value of 4.3% showing a weak correlation thus undefined not biological but more sociological furthermore there is no evidence to support the claim that marijuana has neurotoxic effects however it has been shown to cause short-term memory loss similar to that of drinking alcohol the studies in these regards have been inconclusive with some showing detrimental effects while others show protection against damages caused by Alzheimer's and Parkinson's medical marijuana is the use of the cannabis plant or its compounds to treat diseases and conditions it has been shown to be effective in a host of illnesses and in particular chronic pain and fiber the Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that 50 million Americans suffer from some form of chronic pain this condition is characterized that pain that lasts three to six months or more and has effects on everyday life and mental health a 20-17 study in the Journal of Health Affairs found that the majority are sixty two percent of medical marijuana usages are for chronic pain and these conditions have substantial or conclusive evidence of cannabis being an effective treatment Friday myalgia is defined as widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue insomnia memory loss and mood swings in fibromyalgia the brain intensifies the signals resulting in a greater perception of pain although idiopathic in nature it can be onset by genetics infections of trauma or stress with symptoms increasing over time cannabis works through blocking spinal peripheral and gastrointestinal mechanisms that promote pain in blocking these sensors the perception of pain is decreased or halted they use the underlying biological and physiological pathways to disrupt pain relieving symptoms although most studies focus on marijuana and the effects of pain relief as a whole there are a few that looks specifically at fibromyalgia and a 2011 study it was found that 43 percent of patients reported strong pain relief 43 percent mild pain relief and the remaining seven no changes in the 2014 study by the National Pain Foundation it was found that 62 percent reported cannabis is very effective 33 is helpful and five percent sever had absolutely no effects a 2018 study published in The Lancet showed that cannabis was effective in both lowering pain levels and weaning off other medications another 2018 study published in the Journal of Clinical Rheumatology showed that cannabis had significant favorable outcomes in all tested categories I wish I had received this treatment when I was first diagnosed I returned to who I was before and I regained my health are some of the testimonials there are many other treatments that can be used in the case of chronic pain among them non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs opioids epidural steroid injections sympathetic blockers over-the-counter prescriptions and therapy the other most used treatment method is opioids which are a group of medications derived from the opium poppy they're controversial showing a variety of positive and negative effects the positive effects of opioids are attributed to you fork feeling relieving the sensory and emotional aspects of pain however the negative effects of addiction reinforcement and dependency also persist the CDC and 2016 created 12 guidelines to make opioids safer three notable recommendations are non opioid therapy is preferred clinicians should prescribe the lowest dosage and status of the patient

pain relief topical this episode of canna basics is brought to you by the roughhouse studios smoke shop save 10% on vaporizers raw rowing papers and accessories and much more with the code canna basics a truffle studios.com let's get started here's what you're gonna need you need some 99% isopropyl alcohol we're putting is about 1215 milliliters you also need some fresh cannabis flowers we're using about 50 grams of fresh harvested flowers you need some fresh to ruffle hours commonly called hells bells about to medium flowers [Music] you also need some rue de also known as common room it's an aromatic herbal plant you need about 15 grams of that and you're also going to need some camphor tablets you need six quarter ounce squares or one and a half blocks camphor tablets are available at

screen it'll also be helpful if you have a mortar and pestle and also have large mason jar with a lid now the first step is going to be to manicure and to chop your fresh cannabis I like to destem the buds and use the fresh soft flower portion of the buds and the smaller leaves some pain relief strains that would be excellent for this is Charlotte's Web and Harlequin among many others [Music] using a chef's knife to chop the cannabis makes it very easy to chop the marijuana into very small bits you want to stop short of chopping the cannabis into a pace so it's still easy to collect it from the cutting board and once you have a choppa scoop it all up and put it into the large sealable jar I find that a 64-ounce wide mouth mason jar is perfect for the amount of cannabis that we're using in this recipe today next we would do the same thing that we did with the cannabis to the Rue de plana rue de otherwise known as common rule or herb of grace is an ornamental plant and herb which is recommended by the person who provided this classic home remedy recipe it's used as an arthritis pain reliever much like the cannabis remove the large stems if you want and then chop the root of fine once you have it chopped we're going to put it into the jar with the rest of the canvas next up we need to mash our doctoral or hels belles flour into a paste but first gently press out any of the water that may be collecting with a paper towel a datura is a poisonous plant so do not ingest this or get it into your eyes however the FDA has recognized the medicinal uses of the torah' recently because of the presence of certain chemical compounds now find it's helpful to use a mortar and pestle in doing this but you could also use the back of a spoon into a shallow pan or a plate however you achieve it you need to mash the to medium size flowers into a paste then add about 250 milliliters of alcohol to wash the mortar and pestle and to make sure that he rats all of the datura paste into the jar along with the rinsing alcohol [Music] now add the remaining amount of alcohol needed to fill the jar to about twelve hundred and fifty milliliters now we need to chop or crumble four cubes of camphor blocks until almost powdered then carefully scoop it up and add it into the alcohol mixture into the jar now add the two remaining kaffir tablets into the mixture hold without crumbling them up these two whole ones will help us make an aggregate when we shake and will also help release the cap for a little more slowly as it dissolves into the plant extracts now make sure that you put the lid on the jar and tighten it very securely because now we need to shake vigorously for several minutes now the better you shake the better and faster this process will complete in the long run so stay with it as long as you can the mixture will begin to take on a greenish tint but we still have a while to go because now we let it sit for several days in a cool dark place and shaking it again periodically after several days five to seven days at least the mixture will darken and the green color will saturate into a neon green color after several days the topical is ready to use but you can continue with these optional steps to make it more refined and easy to use product so now you can strain it very carefully through an unbleached coffee filter to remove any of the plant materials this will make it easier if you follow the next step now the product is ready to funnel into a spray or roll-on container so that when you need it you can easily roll or spray it onto the affected areas this top pool can be used as needed on the skin do not ingest it because it will make you very sick also keep it well away from your eyes and children but it is a great for

getting them out of the ground if you're going to use roots you want to make sure you clean them really good these are there's just the main roots i didn't take any of the uh the uh the strings it was just too hard to get out of the ground oh my gosh it took me forever to get this out but these are nice uh thicker roots that i can uh def i'll definitely use um i will be close to the video on uh what i do with them um i make sobs and i uh actually eat them i use it in uh with coconut oil and i put in my coffee every single day except saturday and sunday which uh i give my body a break but it does amazing things and i will share that with you so don't throw away your roots keep them bad boys they got to be uh dried hung up and dried and then i'll cut it off bro that good stuff is all right happy growing everybody since uh you have now washed and dried your roots they need to be really washed and dried and if you have grown organically if you've been using salt-based um nutrients i probably wouldn't do this if you're going to put this on your body or in your body you you want organic roots are filters for your plant and basically it's in your soil it's bringing up in into your roots so make sure that uh you are organically based what i do is i break my roots down i've got me uh these fisca big o clipper dills but basically you just cut your your roots down into the smallest pieces you can get and then what i'll do is i'll put mine in this uh mortar and pulse stone granite whatever it is and try to get this as powdery as possible so you're going to have all sizes um whatever you have if you have a little um ninja food processor thing that'll work too but you want to get it as fine and as powdery as you could possibly do i don't know these words um the words uh the scientific chemicals that i'm going to put up on the screen so you can see it but one is for protecting your liver and the other is um a cancer killer and what this cancer killer does it sends a signal to the to the cancer cell tells it to commit suicide it um hypothesis i think is what um what it causes and that's like say if you have a a tadpole when a tadpole turns into a frog it sends a positive this chemical to the tail to tell it to die and then that's how the frog will lose its tail basically does the same thing to a cancer cell cancer cells don't have the trigger that tells it when it's damaged to kill itself it just doesn't do that so what this does will do that i am not a doctor i i can't tell you um i don't want to tell you you know eat this stuff um how i do it is uh you need get a get from you know talk to your doctor if you're if you're in a situation where you got cancer or something i don't want it to ruin anything like say i i can only tell you what i've been doing um i put it in in coconut oil and then uh once it's extracted out i pour that coconut oil into a little jar i take take a teaspoon every day in my coffee except for saturday and sunday which i give my body a rest so i work i have it in my coffee i just put a scoop in there and then you need a creamer of some type like a powder creamer that it'll attach to easier for your body absorb if you're going to use in sauce i take that same um coconut oil and i will put it into my assab bomb making process um like i said i'll put the chemicals up what we're looking trying to extract out of there um i they're crazy words so um two ounces or two ounces of this you want to cut this up in two cups worth into your i put it in a crock pot your own crock pot here along with about four or five cups of water two cups of organic coconut oil um i like the organic um i don't think it makes too much of a difference it's just the carrier but i like coconut oil it uh it hardens up um if you put it once this is done you're going to cook this thing for 12 to 18 hours i go 24 you make sure you replace the water as it you know evaporates out simmers out but you want to um the oil will stay and that's what's going to collect all your uh your chemicals that we're looking for um like say i'm really after two um but you know we don't know what the uh what the other ones do um but for solves and stuff it's absolutely wonderful it's great stuff don't throw them out keep your roots so you're chopping them up roots coming off they're going to be all sizes i break them down and i got some big ones small ones i'm going to use this to grind it up and then put it in my coconut oil and i say i'm gonna do it for 24 hours i will put those chemicals up so you know what they are if you have any

drugs are hidden in plain sight being a big issue for parents and Peter the biggest danger is that they're far more pwned than anything parents may have seen or even tried when they were young so to help your kids we're gonna help you spot them at a quick glance you might not recognize it what does this look like to you ketchup pills that looks like marijuana syrup the final answer is correct Kush syrup found in the car of Miami Dolphins player and Collier County sold in a medical marijuana dispensary in California but not untouchable for kids in South West Florida pretty much everything through online channels you can figure out a way together Steven hill helps kids with substance abuse at Sal's care he says teens will try something like Co syrup just because it's new but I just think it's a different way to do it different and possibly more dangerous syrup has a thousand milligrams of THC the active principle of marijuana per bottle and if taken all at once 10 to 20 times what you're typically going against smoking a joy the side effects would be palpable a lot of times very erratic hallucinations and you can also get psychosis on a temporary basis so the the judgment and your behaviors are definitely impacted grown-ups don't know Lesley Robinson is founder of Street chicks and recovery which runs a marijuana adolescent prevention program in Lee County middle schools she also produces videos helping educate kids about some of the side effects of marijuana in products like Co syrup and it's so potent you're gonna be able to tell your child is high she says the best way for parents to spot these drugs is to pay attention to the new products on the market educate yourself on the other forms besides the bag and the smell the Collier County Sheriff's Office

relieving salve so or a cream or a balm it's super easy to do at home and I'm going to show you how to do it right now my name is Andrea I'm a cannabis wellness coach for moms I help moms who are really struggling with just how tough life can be sometimes after you have kids and you had no idea it was gonna be that rough and you know that there's a better life but you're not like entirely sure how to get there that's where I come in I help you use cannabis exactly the way that you need to for your day in your life and I walk you through a bunch of other wellness practices that you can implement so that when you graduate my program you're living a much much better life than you are now that's the point so if that sounds like it would float your boat reach out to me at Rubio cannabis calm alright so I didn't talk about what we need today so first of all we have our half cup of cannabis oil that we did last time you can see that it's not liquid it's our live in Canada and it's cold here already so it solidifies so 1/2 a cup of your infused oil and then these are the basics you can go nuts on scythes and add like a whole bunch of different oils and combinations of things I went to my cannabis coach colleague who is the bomb making this stuff I he doesn't like 9,000 times a day and then we also have somebody in our group who makes this stuff for a living so I asked them how to do it like this most simple and easy way to say you and me all the googling so here we go this is cacao butter or cocoa butter I think people say it both ways it's basically the oil that they get from the cocoa bean and it feels amazing I was just playing around with that this is beeswax and this is shea butter so you can get those just out of your local health food store I'm sure amazon also sells them you're also need a tablespoon or if you're fancy then I prefer to use a scale because it's really actually hard to get a table actually gonna add it to my income I stopped today because this is for somebody else and I don't know if you want to smell like peppermint but you can add all those oils as well and then you're gonna need a double boiler or I think I'm just gonna do it right in here so I'm gonna get set up in the kitchen and we'll see you there all right so we're ready to go I have my infused oil the coconut oil that I just warmed up in the microwave I'm just gonna try to infuse it right in here but it's not gonna work and then I've created a double boiler here so that just means that you have a little bit of water in the bottom so that it reaches the bottom of the second pan and you put the second pin in and then pour your ingredients in and the reason that we do a double boiler is so that you don't you don't want to burn your oil you don't wanna get your oil to the point where it's smoking because that's bad so I'm just gonna add in my infuse my cannabis infused oil and then I ended up really having to shave the beeswax because it was so hard so this is beeswax here on top and then the shea butter and the cocoa butter the cacao butter so you put this all together this takes a little while you want to put it over like don't put a rolling boil on it or anything and when this all combines together then you're done so I'm gonna let this melt away and I'll show you what it's like at the end and just so you know I'll have all the instructions for this as well in a link down below not sure if I remember to tell you but there's an ounce or two tablespoons of each of the three other ingredients that we added in here so but that links down below so make sure you grab that so that you don't need to watch the video every time you want to make this okay so everything has melted all together you can see that the liquid like you can see through the liquid now so I'm just gonna pour it back into my mason jar I happen to have one of these for canning which makes this a whole bunch easier there we go this takes about a half an hour to set up so obviously we wait because it's gonna be quite warm and then you can apply this topically which means apply it to your skin so if you had sore hands or a sore back or sore knees this would be perfect for it there's absolutely no way for the THC in here to get you high at all so there's no worry about that and because this is a one-to-one straight it has CBD and THC in it then it will help with pain on both friends and inflammation so yeah this is gonna set up and I'm gonna send it off to the client and see what he thinks and we'll go from there thanks so much for watching this week's video I post new videos every Saturday I'd love if you subscribed and hit like if you liked it and if there's anything else that you would like to learn about please let me know and I just wanted to show you the final product it's quite creamy as you can see and when you wrap it on it takes a little bit to rub into your skin but it feels fantastic because of all the great additives that we added into it and then it absorbs quite well so I'm excited to pass this on to my client and see if it will help with his back pain if you have any questions please just reach out and I can answer them in the chat Thanks", "TsRh2eqB9Rc": "[Music] medical cannabis is legal in many places in the united states and can be used to treat everything from depression to insomnia and now some dementia patients are self-medicating with cbd products without proper evidence of what the impact may be the researchers are now playing catch-up just beginning to study the possibility and efficacy of a cannabis drug for people with a spectrum of cognitive impairment issues recently researchers at king's college london are trying to use cannabis as a better alternative to antipsychotic medications that are currently used to treat aggression in patients with dementia but often come with dangerous side effects what are the differences between the two better known compounds in cannabis thc and cbd does the difference even matter thc is the main psychoactive component while cbd is primarily a relaxant thc is more potent than cbd producing the same effects with a lower dosage while the legality of thc usage is divided across state lines cbd is largely legal while thc causes temporary side effects such as slower reaction times and memory loss cbd is predominantly free of any of these effects at present researchers are trying to repurpose a cannabis drug named satifx which is an oral spray license in the u.s and the uk the drug which contains both thc and cbd was originally used for treating patients with multiple sclerosis and is now being repurposed to help treat dementia it attempts to target symptoms of agitation and aggression seen in patients with dementia the drug is designed to be a safer alternative and perhaps more effective treatment for dementia currently there's a scarcity of pharmacological treatments and some of them are rather damaging and dangerous especially in the long term so they would prescribe off-label antipsychotics for more severe cases of agitation in terms of side effects satisfaction is a relatively innocuous substance when compared to other antipsychotics it has common side effects such as increased dizziness dry mouth and risk of increased falls particularly in an elderly population even though it still has some side effects it's already a licensed drug that had gone through rigorous and objective clinical trials we already have much better awareness of what the psychological risks are overall speaking the cannabis drug with thc and cbd has therapeutic potential in a behavioral sense it may increase drowsiness which is similar to a calm and relaxed feeling but we still have to wait for the results to know whether cannabis is effective for treating dementia you", "LY7jFb4xTsc": "Vanessa our pastry expert is going to show us how to make a perfect infused cream known as style because Nonna is such a pioneer in the cannabis cooking world I wanted to make her pastry cream what we have is two cups milk quarter teaspoon salt four tablespoons of cornstarch 115 grams of sugar we're going to take the cornstarch and we're going to swap it into the sugar a healthy pinch of salt going into the corn stretch whisk it together so we get a nice even blend we're in a separate commit you can either use two full egg I like a really rich deluxe taste pastry cream so I use four egg yolks instead of two whole eggs either work you're just going to districts get a different consistency for the pastry cream so we're going to take our four egg yolks we're going to take the sugar in the cornstarch and we're going to make mix it into the edges we have two cups of milk I'm just going to put it in a saucepan together with the vanilla beans so we're going to heat it up and so it's going to mix those vanilla beans in and pop it on the stove hot hot cream we're just going to slowly ladle some pastry came in to the eggs and what that does is the eggs slowly cooks evenly and you get a nice smooth put it and then we'll put it back into the saucepan and cook it until it boils we just want these like big bubbles like that so this is done we're going to put this through a clip just kind of make sure that if there are lumps in there we're taking them out so put it in there and you see the flecks of vanilla how pretty that is we're not done yet we're going to cool this down and then we'll add our weed butter to it you want to stir this every once in a while to make sure you don't get a film on the top of it as it cools down last step of our cannabis pastry cream so you got to put the canvases we have some note of style cannabutter that we made some scratch and we're going to add it to our pastry cream to give it that little extra kick [Music] this is where our pastry cream that looks really good put it in a pastry bag [Music] Thank You cream done [Music]", "JRqt7DCQnIs": "when you sort of create a robust healthy human then you know you can tolerate more of these things that doesn't mean you should holler you should force yourself to tolerate them but right you know in many of the people that we work with you know cutting out alcohol altogether to begin with is very important but then adding some of that back in can certainly have benefits for multiple reasons can we talk about CBD and THC we both live in states where that's legal now yeah and I can tell you I first started doing CBD oil last year and just to help out with with sleep I've heard people talk about you know it's good for back pain and all this other stuff and I found the curcumin is actually way way better for back pain than the CBD oil was for me although I haven't tried the lotions and stuff like that but then also THC and edibles especially like the OL spray or like a vape pen before going to bed I found that that helps me out a little bit with sleep if I'm if I'm struggling with sleep so I know there are obvious upsides and downsides I like to get some opinions on this we asked some data we don't even need it and we were we were actually talking about this over breakfast that's the kind of guys that we are yeah so the interesting thing is that CBD on its own based on the data that's available should not help with sleep so basically when they've looked at it and they've given people CBD alone or CBD plus THC the CBD alone can actually cause alertness and it may be to do with how CBD and THC affect cortisol metabolism there's some other stuff of it you know the the signal the ways they signal you know so some people may sleep worse if they take CBD and but when you add THC then people seem to sleep better so there's like a there's a synergism there however I can say for personal experience that I've tried CBD alone before bed and it certainly seems to help it certainly does seem to help me sleep and why that is I actually I actually don't know I don't have a study to say this is why I think there's the you know there's gonna be an interaction with all the other things that are going on in the gut CBD has certainly been shown or you know to improve got information got health I don't think that's an issue for me but that's particularly animal studies and now it's been translated CBD is now being used for in cancer therapies and for epileptics and they're starting to use it in people with inflammatory bowel disease so can certainly have a number of benefits I haven't tried the CBD plus THD THC was more of a thing I did in my teenage years but but have both been shown potentially to help with sleep the the potential downsides are obviously then can interfere with cool summers harbors and all this other stuff so if it's not causing it if it's not causing you benefit then you know there's no there's potential downsides for taking it so I mean we do think you know particularly for people you know heavy marijuana users there is some risk of mental health issues if that's coming from THC or other things you know of is obviously the the strength the concentration of THC in marijuana has increased dramatically over the last few decades so there's there's multiple factors that play there if you're taking 10 milligrams of THC with 30 milligrams of CBD before bed you know you're probably well under that that risk first hold but there are studies that show that it interferes with hormone metabolism called slow metabolism so it's just it's at the moment is kind of a try it out and see if it benefits you but equally you know we roll back to our continuous message which is why aren't you sleeping in the first place right you don't want to medicate yourself to sleep you want to find out what it is it's causing your poor sleep in the first place similar to the melatonin in the apple meadow that can help but but that is a band-aid off the band-aid that you not having enough melatonin because you're exposing yourself to bright lights at night all you know it's something like that right and so I think the micro dose with are the few times where I've done edibles where I get a like oh I can't do anything else besides eat potato chips today I just I don't like the feeling and so I I tend to I tend to avoid avoid that but I also have found that the mental health thing so I have the mental health problems running my family my dad was schizophrenic my brother was schizophrenic killed himself and so I know like that's the reason I won't do psilocybin and other things because there's a potential for you know even though I think I'm well past the age at this point where those symptoms would present themselves I do notice that the couple times where I've tried that an edible that is like Oh like this is too much the next day I it's like the roller coaster there you can't have the high without the low sort of thing and the entire next day I'm just like oh wait I should be happy right now but I cannot be happy this is a thing this is a story for anything that you take to try and change the way your brain functions but what we usually say is there's no biological free lunch right you can't ask your brain to do something which you wouldn't normally do and then expect it to be completely normal after so nootropics are a classic example you know you take these compounds are supposed to increase brain cognitive function various brain functions but it might increase function in one area but it makes you less good in another area and then so maybe well I will do I'll take a nootropic usually book the only time I do is before a podcast yeah and I know in afternoons I all I have this brush yeah yeah there is a nootropic crash for me I thought maybe I was unique in that because I've never heard anyone else talk about it but no I'm certain if experience the same and there are some some nootropics that are basically just like the kitchen sink everything's in there and this sort of light switches everything on you definitely notice a difference but then you gotta come down later so I often liken it to taking MDMA where your lights switch everything on you feel great and then you know a few hours later you have this you have this big come down and it's not the same for everybody again it's something that you have to experiment with yourself but but you know again we go back to why isn't your brain functioning as you would like it to why do you feel the need to take something to enhance your brain function are there other things you could be fixing and therefore you don't need to take that it's propak in the first place you know that's always where we're gonna go back to and then if you know occasionally you need to try something like that you just need to be aware they're asking your body or brain to do something you wouldn't normally do you might gonna you're gonna pay for it later yeah from either the THC thing is not to a point where it's or at least that I feel there's any sort of psychoactive effect it it's it's like micro dosing that's like one or two milligram sort of thing and the thing that helps me with is with the sleep is it prolongs the the period where I stay asleep another thing that has really helped me and I I've had to get really sort of diligent about it and I screw up still all the time water I drink a lot of water during the day but I stop at 5:00 p.m. I stop drinking liquids of 5:00 and that way I don't feel compelled to get up at 3:30 a.m. to pee which but sometimes when that happens I get up at 3:30 a.m. and I'm like I'm up I can't get back to sleep now and so I found those two things for me in the water is probably way more helpful than the THC to be honest with you so just something to think about any other words about THC no it's not something that really interested me on the c-word site about the stuff that's free like sunshine I'm very excited about where as yeah sunshine deficiency can definitely cause insomnia so like you can fix that first before having to buy a supplement we so we the one reason why we talk about CBD is because again it might help with people with inflamed guts and we see a lot of those so we know a lot of people who feel they've benefitted from taking you for some see yeah so that's an interesting thing that you bought up recently is that maybe you have some problem that's stopping you from sleeping and then you take another thing that makes that first problem worse and maybe introduces another problem but the net effect is still positive and so your sleep does get better yeah you", "xRxbQaITUFM": "[Music] hey

"BxgS-rYe3CY": "hello how are you doing today perfect and how may I help you I think I have the very thing you're looking for what kind of CBD product we have a lot here this is a CBD only dispensary oh you had a car accident and how's your back well I am sorry to hear that um thankfully I think we have the thing that will help you out I would recommend to you a tropical South yes I think that it would work best for you you just apply it to the skin you rub it on smooth it over and it should alleviate some muscle pain that you're experiencing it's an anti-inflammatory CBD is and there is different types that you can get and by the way these are frog song farm items and I have been buying from them for a very long time it is a small family farm located in Oregon um near Woodburn and it is just really great they produce and extract their own hemp and CBD and I recommend you giving these products a try what do you think perfect so and they are free of pesticides which is wonderful so the first product I have here is a tropical South that contains 500 milligrams of CBD this might be a bit strong for you considering that you're not someone who uses CBD very often there is mild side effects if you just take a lot of CBD um it could include drowsiness or a dry mouth a little blood pressure but nothing it's quite uncommon and it's also very mild so just so you know in advance okay so I would recommend this cell for you but instead of the 500 milligram we have a 250 milligram and there's Xie butter inside of this coconut oil Aragon oil sweet almond oil beeswax activation time is 5 minutes oh yes yes um CBD is fine to be used on that so you just have to be aware of the proper dosage and be aware of the weight of your pet so do you have to definitely take that into consideration before applying for the intake yes that is a very common question to non-intoxicating the anti-inflammatory antioxidant rich and supportive plant base so those are important things to keep noted before try I mean it may help with sleep conditions anxiety arthritis neurological health definitely worth a try again I would recommend the 250 for you what do you want to do is take a little bit you don't have to take too much because this is very rich in essential oils comments you just really need a little bit it's actually I might have put a little too much there put some back when you rub on like this we're ever needed yes CVT is legal um it was federally legalized in 2018 but it was partially legal in 2014 so another factory that's why it's such a big thing recently as you can see going to store such as new seasons old foods yeah it's a very common it is the next big thing would you like to try some okay yeah here you go give it a go and let me know what you think okay activation time is five minutes so you will feel it in no time there you go excellent okay so another item that I would love to recommend to you is a tincture it is designed to be held under the tongue before swallowing it's just more effective that way however if the consistency or taste is unbearable you can just put some in your food or drink or whatever you wish to do and yeah that's perfectly fine as well and this is the 750 milligrams CBD so this one's a very potent for your situation and socially being someone who's new to CBD I might recommend the lower dose so there's another tincture that has the last CBD unit and I think that one would work perfectly for you yes so yes it is he concluded free so what you do is you shake this and you fill the dropper you can fill it to the point 75 line and I mean you couldn't really use unless on this if you want you know that's perfectly fine I usually use like this much at the point 5 or the 0.25 and you know just use a little bit do you work in real time I think that tinctures really really do a great job when it comes to insomnia or anxiety I think that it does a wonderful job tackling that problem only said something but I've experienced um I like to take some before I go to sleep I think for your condition and the back pain I would recommend a cell for you there's also one other product that I want to show you it is a new product that just came out it is called - the body balm ultra and it is a different consistency from the south is it dries faster and it has a less greasy ER feel compared to the south and it has a little bit of a scent so if you're someone who isn't a big fan of sense roller to get a sense I would maybe recommend itself and really do that's which you prefer so have some of this tincture if you'd like I'm just gonna set it right over here and the next item here which I mentioned earlier activation time is five minutes this also has 500 milligrams of CBD if the two selves they're called a rabbit um the first one that I showed is 500 milligrams of CBD and the second one has 250 those are the two options you have and I'm the tincture again I have the seven so this one might be a little strong for you right now but I think you can start with the 250 rugged and I think after that this might work really well for you since this is less greasy and it dries a lot faster okay as you can see over here it's it's more liquidy there's more watery type of substance consistency what it does smell really nice it's not too strong you know it's it's much lighter than a perfume it's like a natural essential oil kind of smell which I can handle being someone who is quite sensitive to scents and perfumes and clothes and such so yes that one is pretty great again it's a new items so definitely check it out I'm gonna place this right here give it a little give it a go and yeah do you have any other questions okay perfect and which one would you like to purchase today excellent okay so I will put that in a bag I'm glad you decided to go with me nothing 250 so I think sure I think that you made a great decision yeah do you have to let me know helps me I like to rub this on my tummy from time to time it really helps with my cramps cramping pains are just pains and shadow makes it a lot more manageable and I hope that this really uses up the pain in your back yeah just gonna put some on right now if you want back there I notice you have been putting them on your hands so it only takes five minutes again that's pretty fast and the tincture is pretty fast as well just remember to shake it and put it underneath your tongue or if not you're putting food or um the drink yeah probably a drink like juice yes okay well there you are um I hope you have a lovely day and I will see you next time yes let me know what you think of the Frog song farm products I think that they're fabulous fantastic and they've just really helped me so I hope that they help you too okay goodbye", "FXnJBr6xswE": "[Reporter: Ioanna Remelioutis] [Man] We're going to listen to some music OK. [ \u266a Shania Twain - Forever And For Always \u266a ] You remember that song? [Reporter] Their wedding song seems to calm her. Seems to reach Karen Walker in that far away place dementia has taken her [ \u266a \u266a ] [Reporter] Mike Walker is willing to try\nanything to soothe his wife. From music to marijuana. [ \u266a \u266a ] [Mike] You just can't give up on somebody. You gotta try whatever, you know whatever means are out there. I mean she still gets her outbursts but not near what it used to be, I know that. Like -- it was a lot more severe over there for quite a while. [Reporter] The agitation has improved since Karen started taking 20 milligrams of cannabis oil twice a day. The dose is part of a study looking at how medical marijuana can help improve the quality of life for seniors... [Nurse] HAve some milk Karen. [Reporter] dealing with issues like chronic\npain and cognitive decline. [Mike ] Well, like I say -- [Reporter]  Mike has seen a difference. [Mike] I find her more aware. Like before, if I took my phone out she grabbed it and threw it across the floor. Like, I had her holding the phone. Like holding the phone with music on it. And then I'd show her pictures of her grandkids. And she'd put a big smile on. Like she's more coherent. Kiss? [Reporter] Families like him, eager to explore the potential benefits of marijuana prompted the study. [Nurse] Go get him one of the comfy seats. [Reporter] The goal: to back anecdotes with evidence. [Man] Now, has anyone heard about CBD or cannabidiol? [Reporter] The groundwork to enroll people in the study began last summer with information sessions at dozens of seniors residences, like this one in Ottawa To dispel any stigma. [Man] Part of this education is really to demystify what medical cannabis is. In cannabis there's actually over a 120 different cannabinoids and the CBD actually doesn't in cause psychoactivity it doesn't make you high -- [Reporter] David Greb is with Canopy Growth, the weed company providing the marijuana for the study. [Greb] A lot of seniors struggle with three key areas; pain, mood and sleep. And the potential for cannabis to address a lot of the issues around aging is really the potential biggest population that could see benefit. But it's also a population that hasn't been exposed to a lot of the education around cannabis. [Reporter] Greb tells the group the active ingredient in weed can be transformative. As in the case of an elderly woman who almost gave up playing the piano [Greb] -- and unfortunately she got osteoarthritis in her hands and she could no longer play piano. So she started using medical cannabis and within about two months she was able to fully start playing piano again and now she stood up and said, \"I\nfeel like a child again.\" \"I can play for hours on end again.\" And I hear these stories over and over and over. [ \u266a \u266a ] [Reporter] Neva Carmen is that success story. [Carmen] It's been a standing joke in my family my grandson just thinks it's wonderful. \"I have to tell my friends my 90-year-old grandmother's taking marijuana,\" he says. [Laughs] [ \u266a \u266a ] [Reporter] Her arthritis was so bad she was ready to give away her piano. When her grandson suggested marijuana, she was skeptical. [Carmen] When I'd sit down at the piano I'd get so mad because I just couldn't stand it, you know. So I went on the cannabis and I was on it about six weeks and I began to think, \n\"Hmm, this feels pretty good,\" you know. Not having the pain I was in and my hands weren't swelling up. [ \u266a \u266a ] [Reporter] Since then, Neva is back at it. Playing regularly for her fellow residents and enjoying the moment. [Carmen] It is experimental, we don't still don't know what its gonna do to us but at 90, who cares? [Laughs] You can't do any more harm that's already been done. [Reporter] So you're a convert? Definitely. Definitely. [ \u266a \u266a ] [Woman] Well, I think it's exciting I think it's wonderful to know that there is something that's available to improve this resident's quality of life. And I'm excited at the opportunity for more information so that we can say, \"Yes, this is something we can use.\" But we need to know how safe and effective it is. [Reporter] Dr. Rhonda Collins works for Rivera Homes, a network of seniors residences. Collins is identifying people suitable for the trial. She says so far the results have\nbeen mixed. [Collins] Personally, in my practice I have seen people have amazing responses to cannabis. I've seen people have zero responses and I've also people have seen people have negative responses. So that's why it's so important to me that rather than have a few scattered stories from across different sites we have some rather robust evidence. [ \u266a \u266a ] I'm at the end of my book. [Applause] [Reporter] The evidence is especially critical in such a vulnerable population. There are concerns around how medical marijuana interacts with other medications. How it metabolizes in older people and potential side effects, like dizziness,\ncan be especially dangerous for people prone to falling. For Mike, the last few years have been a struggle. He just wants to provide his wife with some comfort. Ultimately, what do you want from this study? What do you what are you hoping for? That's a question in itself, what are you hoping for? You're hoping for a miracle, to have a fix but I'm not saying no but you got a choice. If I can't fix her, at least give her a better\nquality of life so she can relax. It's all you can hope for. [Reporter] And right now he's found that bit of hope. And however untested it still is, he's holding on to it. Ioanna Roumeliotis, CBC News Mississauga. OK, so there's a fair amount of research going into answering a great number of\nquestions about cannabis use and older people but where exactly do we stand now\ncan it work is it safe dr. Samir Sinha the director of geriatrics at me on\nSinai joining us right now and you have people coming to you asking this very\nquestion absolutely yeah no many of my patients are now asking about it and\nsaying could this be a solution for me and so what do you tell them well you\nknow it depends on what they're looking for because I say to them right now\nthere isn't a lot of great evidence out there to say that it's actually a great\ntreatment for everything under the Sun there's some mounting evidence saying\nthey could be helpful specific areas of pain management pain is where there's\nthe most promise you think there's there's the most promise at the moment\nbut again what I found is that of all of my patients who've actually tried this\nyou know there are some who have compelling anecdotes like it helped with\nthose behaviors related to dementia for example or it helped with their pain but\nI'd say the vast majority of my patients who tried it have said either it had no\nbenefit whatsoever or they actually say that they actually felt a lot of side\neffects like dizziness and nausea and doesn't make great news stories about\nmiracles right but it's actually it's telling us that while there's compelling\nanecdotes we don't really know exactly in who would it best be useful and so if\nsomeone were to come to you though and say look you know I I'm in pain and and\nI'm not waiting for more research I just want to try it is there a reason that\nyou would dissuade them from doing so I mean are there red flags well I mean Oh\nfor patients who might be on a lot of complicated medications or they might\nactually have very complex health issues I might be worried that this could\ncreate where there's a lot of unknowns more problems you know then then\nbenefits but you know if one of my patients said I want to try this what do\nyou think you know it's not an inexpensive venture to go and get a\nprescription and buy the oils or buy the edibles or whatever the case is but what\nI want them to do is work with a professional who knows how to prescribe\ncannabis and can understand what their particular issues are to see if they can\nfind something that might work for them that's their best chance of potentially\ngetting benefit but again we're still we still need more research to figure out\nwhere it can be useful doctor steno interesting stuff Thanks thank you", "Vq_H5tW7_gE": "at least one child is in the hospital tonight after accidentally eating candy infused with THC the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana now the candy was unknowingly handed out to more than 60 families at a food bank at the First Baptist Church in Roy this morning the church partners with the Utah Food Bank Fox 13 Sydney Glenn is in Roy tonight Sydney what are police saying about this well let's ask them ourselves right now I am live with sergeant Gwen and they are responding right the second you can see all of the officers behind me talk to me about the latest several children accidentally ingested this candy today yes a little after 3 o'clock this afternoon we were notified that a five year old girl was in the hospital for a THC overdose and we learned that the candy she ingested was provided to them through a Food Bank donation center here in Roy and so what you're seeing now was our officers are actively reaching out I believe it's 72 different families to make contact with them to ensure that we can recover as much as we can make sure those children who have ingested are seeking medical attention so you said to me earlier five children and told so far you have confirmed have ingested there's two of them in the hospital how successful have you been in reaching out to those families so we're looking at reaching out to 72 families and I think so far we've contacted I believe it's 44 families and we haven't been notified of any new victims probably within the last couple of hours let's talk about this huge response that you have right now for something that has never happened here before it's never happened here before and I can say probably for the first time in my career here we've actually called out half the department for an incident such as this you know and it's just a mistake and this is what it turns into you guys learned so far well we've learned so far that we need to be able to respond to these with haste to make sure that no other children are injured or two maybe notify those who aren't aware of what's in their donation that they need to be looking through them probably more carefully to ensure that this doesn't continue and we unfortunately have a bunch of volunteers who are trying to do a good thing and unfortunately this is what a yeah such an unfortunate situation I also spoke with the Utah Food Bank earlier today the CEO says she's just absolutely horrified about what happened the president and CEO of the Utah Food Bank said they were absolutely horrified that this product went out she went on to say she can easily see how volunteers would not have known what to look for a spokesperson for the agency said the THC candy donation came through a bulk commercial donation the CEO of the Utah Food Bank expressed her apologies and said they are changing their procedures to make sure this never happens again so if you are one of those people that did get that THC infused nerds rope you're asked to call the Roy City Police Department if your child has ingested that you should call the Utah poison control we have all those phone numbers for you on our website Fox 13 now calm for now live at the Roy City Police Department Sydney Glenn Fox 13 News Utah", "clLoixOZx2Q": "hi everybody my name is jaime brambila my company name is heat cbd and grace health and wellness they're two separate companies heat cbd manufactures cbd products and great self-enrollment is a practice dedicated to teaching interested patients about the clinical use of cannabinoids so in august of 2018 my wife nicole was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer we learned that the cancer had eaten through her four five and six vertebrae and that she would require eight hours final surgery to correct it the metastases was the only thing holding her neck up when we got to memorial sloan kettering in new york the doctors had explained that her standard of care most likely would include six rounds of chemo radiation and many surgeries to remove the tumor masses so the outlook was looking very grim and but nonetheless we we wanted to go through it full force so the ironic thing is that well before this we started in the cannabis field with the delivery service in california where we were working with patients that were afflicted with critical ailments everything from epilepsy to autism ms and cancer we made the decision to focus on the medical rather than the recreational doing part from the responsibility from the people looking for alternative therapies so after nicole's diagnosis we decided to go full force into understanding uh the monster that cancer is and how [Music] and so we never i never expected uh the outcome of nicole's case um but you know we decided to make this a positive journey and that was nicole's request so that's what we did so the presentation today is going to be about raising awareness and raising awareness about this is successful implementation of natural and plant-based medicines used with standard of care for metastatic breast cancers so we know uh what we know about cannabinoid streptains in the ketogenic diet is that when they're used with traditional standards of care they're positive additions and so um why are they positive digits well they they work synergistically to improve the patient outcome so these compounds uh offer a cytotoxic effect as well as a palliative effect and the more well-researched effect is the palliative effect which will which we'll discover um later on the presentation we will explain in current detail what science understands about uh the effects of these compounds so a little bit of background uh story so cannabinoids exert cytotoxic and p and palliative effects uh by means of physiological modulation through the endocannabinoid system and our bodies are naturally able to produce endocannabinoids which interact with receptor sites within the endocannabinoid system and the purpose for this system is to create the state of homeostasis so all the all the functions that the endocannabinoid system produces it are still unknown and but what we've discovered so far is that this system is intricately tight almost every bodily function that we have silas simon and cylosine come from um magic mushrooms and if anybody is familiar with that uh these compounds are in the class of psychedelics known as tryptamines and these compounds are agonists of the 5h25ht serotonin receptor group which are g protein coupled receptors and that means that the the receptor sites are anchored to the cell membrane so what we important thing to keep in mind is that gpcrs or g-protein-coupled receptors have been identified to perform a phenomenon called heterodymerization or crosstalk and that basically means that when there's a similarly structured receptor one receptor gets activated by an agonist and another one that is similarly structured gets activated as well without the use of the ligand so ketogenic or low carb high fat diets these have been studied for their effects in our metabolism and what what they've been the researchers but they've been able to identify is that ketone bodies are produced in the liver and our bodies are able to use them instead of using glucose as fuel so this has a profound effect on our physiology especially in our cell metabolism anti-cancer mechanisms of action of cannabinoids psilocybin and ketogenic low-carb high-fat diets so in this presentation we're going to review is what current science understands as to the aforementioned compounds i will briefly explain the anti-proliferative anti-invasive and anti-metastatic mechanisms of each adjunct therapy as well as the palliative effects so we're going to start off with the first uh hallmark of cancer and that's proliferation what we understand about proliferation is that it hap it comes after the cell is mutated it's the first significant stage of a cancer cell progression and this is when cells start to divide and reproduce to start forming the tumor mass one of the very important things to keep in mind here in proliferation research is a protein called akt also known as protein kinase b and it's one of the most studied molecular mechanisms of uh because of its effectual potential effects of on apoptosis so the inhibition of akt protein uh initiates a signaling pathway that activates autophagy and this internal leads to programmed sultan also known as apoptosis so in other words keep uh important thing to keep in mind here is that if you turn off akt the cancer cell dies so how do we know uh cannabinoids exert antiproliferative effects well in pre-clinical studies uh cannabinoids uh have been studied for their pre their pro-episodic effects the specific mechanisms of how cannabinoids exert all these effects on cancer cells are still unknown because the system is just too complex there are many receptor sites and many lightings uh involved in endocannabinoid system function and with a recent study from the technion institute of israel done on identifying the heterogeneity and complexity of cannabis extracts as tumor agents we can see an example of that so the more well-known mechanisms of action though research from the completence university of madrid they published the one of the most significant papers on this subject uh it showed that activation of cannabinoid receptors triggers a signaling cascade that causes cell apoptosis and it's done through stimulation of endoplasmic reticulum which creates uh ceramide accumulation in the cell so that that's that's the route on which uh can happen how can ambulance turn off akt and then in another study that was published in a later day from the same university we can see that the pro-apoptotic effects are specific to erbb2-positive breast cancer cells which we know are the her2 new positive breast cancers so here we're going to show a slide uh just so you guys can see the the route the signaling wrap and here we can see that er stress is activated by the cannabinoid receptors that air stress uh activates a process called the noble ceramide the the nova synthesis ceremony and that activates uh something called p8 which eventually activates something called trip3 which eventually uh activates ckt and starts the process of autophagy and apoptosis so what do we know are the anti-proliferative effects of psilocybin the tryptamines uh such as cytosine psilocybin have the 19 have been observed to have strong and medium-high immunomodulatory anti-inflammatory and potentially pro-apoptotic effects that may cause the inhibition of akt and if any and if anybody of you are familiar with the signaling cascades called mitogen activated protein kinase or nuclear factor kappa b these are signaling cascades that regulate cell proliferation cell differentiation and survival and normal cells so what they've discovered uh on tryptamines is that in lab models the when serotonin receptors are activated they also mediate heterodimerization and they and that's the coordinated crosstalk that we went over uh before so this happens between map case uh including p38 me kkk1 erk and pa3 kinase akht signaling pathways as well as nfkb and so this leads to an intricate fine-tuning of inflammatory responses by changes of cell signaling and we speculate that that's how akt is turned off by tryptomines and in the next slide i show an example of how um that heterodymerization that crosstalk happens when uh the five ht receptors are activated and this just kind of shows the the signaling cascade that happens in between so the second hallmark of cancer is hypoxia and one of the important things to identify here is an inducible factor called hif1 and basically what they've discovered what research has discovered is that when areas of severe oxygen deprivation arise this is called hypoxia and this happens in invasive tumors after hypoxia happens uh there's there's a signal that occurs by creating f1 that stimulates angiogenesis and angiogenesis is an important part of uh cell progression because that's basically when vascular tissue starts growing into the tumor cell mass and lymphatic tissue and that's how eventually this the cancer cells uh escape to metastasize so the next slide just shows a depiction of how hypoxia occurs and how the blood vessels start growing into the tumor mass to eventually form the metastases so there are many studies that show that cannabinoids actually block heph1 and in pre-clinical studies the activation of what the activation of cannabinoids in cancer cells cannabinoid receptors and cancer cells has shown to down regulate the expression of several pathways including v egf itself and hypoxia inducible factor f1 so the anti-angiogenic effects of psilocybin and cylistine uh cytosine is assumed to be a metabolite of psilocybin and it's assumed because the pharmacology of psilocybin is not yet well understood either but we know that this belongs to a class of psychedelics called tryptamines and in pre-clinical studies uh tryptamines have shown to have positive and strong effects on our physiology including immunomodulation anti-inflammation anti-tumor effects and these also include blocking hif1 through sigma 1 receptor activation so tryptamines activate sigma 1 and that's how if one is blocked in the cancer cell so now we reach the third hallmark of uh cancer progression and this is uh metastases and this is the final stage of um when a cancer i guess falls out of control uh the important mechanism here to keep in mind is id1 and what we've understood about uh breast cancers that express this mechanism this this agent id1 is that in breast cancers mammary epithelial cells expressing id1 are unable to differentiate they acquire the ability to proliferate and they invade the extracellular matrix so id1 is an important regulator of breast cancer progression that's why we're focusing on it today and so cannabinoids block id1 and out of all the agilent therapies that we're discussing today the one that counters iv1 uh that's been discovered so far is cannabidiol which is a cannabinoid that has a low toxicity profile and it down regulates id1 by modulating erk and reactive oxygen species pathways which eventually leads to id1 down regulation so i don't know if you guys noticed but i didn't touch on the ketogenic diets and the first two hallmarks of cancer and that's because um ketogenic diets work on on a route uh on themselves um they're separate from the routes that cytocyberan or cannabinoids connector and what we know about these diets is that they've been recently proposed as adjuvant therapies for cancer treatments because they target an effect called the warburg effect and that's basically an effect that describes that cancer cells predominantly utilize glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation phosphorylation sorry to produce atp and atp is very important for cell functioning some cancer cells lack the ability to metabolize ketone bodies because of mitochondrial dysfunction and also the enzymes that that help break down the ketone bodies so the rationale is providing the rationale in providing a fat rich low carbohydrate diet in cancer therapies to reduce circulating glucose levels and induce ketosis so the cancer cells are starved the normal cells adapt their metabolism to use ketones and so another important part of this is that ketosis therapy also reduces insulin insulin like growth factor which is also important for cell progression so what what are the effects the palliative effects that we know about so we know that these compounds have been recognized as effective palliative tools when used in conjunction with the usual standards of care the results are that symptoms are greatly reduced and in our anecdotal experience we've seen this uh time and time again with patients that are able to choose this and that happens it's important to stress this point because uh even though with cannabis uh half of the country uh has already legalized the medical use silas simon on the other hand is only legal in two counties in our country so hopefully we'll be able to change some minds today so that we can change that as well i'm going to go through some examples of how these compounds are good palliative tools and so many studies have shown the efficacy of psilocybin in cancer patients as agents to decrease the symptoms of depression caused by the side effects of standard of care so many studies have identified that students have established that simon and other psychedelics have uh very little physiological safety concerns but we still need to do more research to figure out what the psychological repercussions would be um so in john in one of the one of these studies that came from johns hopkins university they analyzed 51 patients that were diagnosed with advanced stages of cancer and what they found was that high doses of psilocybin produce a significant decrease in depression general anxiety and anxiety towards death it also produced an increase in quality of life and optimism and the important the important thing here or the uh thing that that is that creates the most impact is that after this these therapies were administered the result persisted even after um six months after the um the therapy was administered so cannabinoids we know that cannabinoids are safe and effective relative tools um people that have attended these symposiums have probably heard all about that and they have very good effects including an um antimatter effect uh antidepressant uh anti pain and the ability to induce uh sleep um i just briefly covered those just just to talk talk to them talk to you guys about them but what i want to what i want to emphasize on is the synergistic effect that these produce with standard of care and in recent lab studies from the completency university of madrid in collaboration with zelda therapeutics we've found that when we combine cannabinoids and estrogen receptor targeted therapies for example cis cisplatin or lapatinib in a petri dish uh what it shows is a positive additional antiproliferative response in cell cultures so the safety and efficacy of the ketogenic diets uh well these strongly depend on the type of tumor that is being treated in the genotype uh in involved so the information having a little mix up with my science so what we know uh so far about these uh therapies we don't have a lot of uh data on these because so far there's been just very little clinical data uh and single case studies that show the results of what this could do there hasn't been uh extensive randomized uh clinical studies yet but from the little information that we have we can we can see that these these therapies don't have evidence of interaction with standard care this most of the research conducted on these has been conducted on glioblastoma patients but there's also been recent studies that have found that patients with breast cancer equally benefit from these so the following study that i'm going to present is the case study that um captures my my wife's story and i'm going to briefly go through that uh just to explain what we did with her okay so i'll briefly go through this so protocols that were that were used uh we used standard of care she went through treatment every four weeks uh since the time of diagnosis to uh january of 2019 final diagnosis was august 2018 so she would take an infusion of taxation and herceptin progenitor and herceptin are the targeted therapies texas here's the chemotherapy uh we can see that she did a ketogenic diet in addition to supplements borage omega oils those are precursors to endocannabinoids you know pertinent adjuvants if they can be used uh vitamin b12 glucosamine pea which is a ligand of cannabinoid receptors and pre probiotic uh supplements and those we know now that work in conjunction with the endocannabinoid system so the doses that we administered of cannabis oil um they're relatively high and we can see that during several during different stages we the amounts of cannabis oil that we were dosing every day would fluctuate and that's because uh we you know through trial and error and through our method we were exploring with different uh cannabis strains and these were all whole plant uh cannabis extracts we can see that the use of psilocybin she had so she she had two heroic um sessions with psilocybin one happened in november 2018 the other one january 2019 right before she went for the pet scan that determined that she didn't have metastatic disease anymore and then here we can see the images right we can see the images of when the cancer was initially diagnosed and we can see the mass in the center and then this is the pets underneath that that's the pet ct scan that showed no evidence of metastatic disease and we can see clearly that the mass has shrunk significantly so what are the results so so she was diagnosed in september uh september 2018 the end of august uh so by october 2018 50 of the mass was visibly reduced uh her doctor could visibly see that 50 of the mass was reduced by october january 2019 uh pet ct scan confirmed no evidence of residual cancer or recurrent disease and that persisted today so in breast cancer patients tarsus mom is one of the best and most recent advances in the treatment of her2 positive breast cancer and although this strategy has been very successful the statistics show that about 75 percent of the patients with erbb2 over expressing tumors do not respond to tarstuza map and the ones that do respond which is almost 15 eventually develop metastases so this is why there's a need a tremendous need to develop novel therapeutic approaches so that we can improve patient survival in these patient populations there are many important benefits to initiating observational clinical trials to test these therapies but so far little attention has been given to do so and with correct research and proper clinical protocols minor side effects that can occur can be managed and accurate doses can be studied so that we can deliver proper therapeutic benefit so now now we're going to talk about the economic viability of producing an observation clinical trial using cannabis oil in contrast to the cost and time frame to produce a cancer drug so we went we went through an exercise using nicole's case study as an example um and we used the parameters from the case study the amount of oil that she took and the time frame and we went into weed maps we took a little survey to figure out what a gram of oil uh could cost and so two grams of oil is what we considered for you know a clinical trial to prove whether or not these these therapies have have these effects and what we came up with is that so we did a rough estimate and the cost on a daily basis for uh for a patient using this this therapy can range from sixty two dollars per day to a hundred a 120 per day and so considering the five months that this cost um can range between ninety three hundred dollars and eighteen thousand four hundred dollars roughly so now now we're going to observe a study that was published in the journal of american medical association and jama in september of 2017 and it analyzed the investment and return of 10 different cancer drugs that were recently brought to market from separate developers so what this study concluded was that the average time frame to develop a cancer drug was 7.3 years that's a considerable amount of time the median cost uh the medium r d cost and they broke it down into three categories because there are three uh you know categories um in the in the drug development uh pipeline right so novel or self-originating drugs those are drugs that discover uh new novel uh targets and cancer cells those um the medium r d cholesterol is 899 million dollars uh next in class which is uh a step above the science of what we currently understand so these are drugs that develop the science that we currently know a little bit better and those the medium r d cost is 473.3 million dollars and then we have acquired drugs on the low side of the totem pole which those cost 328.1 million dollars so that's the r d cost now all together and we know that r d plays a big role in price for drugs uh the median cost to bring a cancer drug to market was 648 million dollars and obviously this is this is an immediate estimate um there was a lot of uh range in in between those numbers so with all this with all this that we know if we can convince our lawmakers and medical professionals to give the described therapies the recognition they deserve and facilitate regulatory and financial conditions to research the true medical potential of these compounds we can assume that these results would impact lowering of cancer drug costs lowering of research and development cost increasing quality of life of standard of care and the increase of quality of life through pre and post cancer treatments for patients and with that i want to just uh thank the team uh at the end of this presentation for all the hard work that we did together um bringing this case study um to to light and uh here in the picture we have dr sulak lindsey myself caroline and tom my wife uh next to tom there so thank you guys", "e6dD81GhgiI": "welcome back to the demystifying medicine youtube channel today we will be discussing cannabis and parkinson's disease parkinson's disease also known as pd is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder studies have tried to find a cause for pd either genetic or environmental but none have been confirmed the disease is characterized by a loss of dopamine producing neurons in the substantia negra which is an area of the brain responsible for movement this means that the cells in the brain that create dopamine are no longer doing so the death of these neurons causes loss of motor control because dopamine is important for relaying messages to plan muscle movements this leads to the motor symptoms of pd including tremors muscle rigidity and bradykinesia which means slowness of movement there are some non-motor symptoms of the disease as well including anxiety depression and trouble sleeping the risk of developing pd increases with age especially above the age of 60. the prevalence of pd in the us was 680 000 in 2010 and was projected to be 930 000 in 2020 with the prevalence of this disease continually increasing there's a need for new treatment options and cannabis could be a potential treatment for pd cannabis is a drug illicit in some parts of the world that has both psychoactive and therapeutic effects it is an umbrella term that is given to various preparations of the plant cannabis sativa and has other common names such as marijuana weed and pot cannabis contains many compounds known as cannabinoids cannabinoids are chemical substances that bind to cannabinoid receptors in the body this can be visualized as a key which is the cannabinoid fitting into a lock which is the receptor the most common cannabinoids present in cannabis are thc and cbd cannabinoids due to differences in their chemical properties can have varying effects in the body thc is accountable for the psychoactive effects of cannabis and produces the high sensation cbd works to control or reduce some of the psychoactive effects of thc such as anxiety specifically thc and cbd work in the endocannabinoid system in our body which affects different parts of the central nervous system along with cellular communication which is why changes in the system can be linked to parkinson's disease currently the most common medication prescribed for pd is levodopa also known as l-dopa when aldopa reaches the brain it is converted into dopamine and therefore compensates for the decrease in dopamine due to pd however research has shown that some patients fail to respond to treatment with l-dopa furthermore the drug has been associated with adverse side effects and motor complications over time including involuntary movements called dyskinesias in the last decade there has been an increased focus on investigating the therapeutic potential of cbd in treating neurodegenerative disorders such as pd most human clinical trials have been concentrated on the non-motor symptoms of the disease including anxiety depression and trouble sleeping with results indicating that cbd is successful in treating many of these symptoms although less research has focused on the effects of cbd on motor symptoms a 2004 study using a survey aimed to evaluate the experiences of parkinson's patients using cannabis to help treat their disease the results of this study showed that bradykinesia was the symptom most improved by cannabis followed by muscle rigidity and tremors research has focused on various pathways in which cbd could treat the motor symptoms of pd a 2014 study using a mouse model made it an important discovery regarding the gpr6 receptor gpr6 is a receptor that is predominantly expressed in the brain and is molecularly similar to the cannabinoid receptors this study showed that a deficiency of the gpr-6 receptor in a mouse model of parkinson's disease led to an increase in dopamine concentration in the brain furthermore it led to reduced dyskinesia caused by treatment with l-dopa although this has yet to be tested in humans mice are accurate and commonly used animal models for human disease using the results found in the study in 2017 a research team tested the effects of cannabinoids on the gpr6 receptor their results showed that cbd acts as an inverse agonist to the gpr6 receptor this means that cbd binds to gpr6 decreasing the activity of the receptor and therefore leading to an increase in dopamine this research has identified cbd as a potential therapy for treating the motor symptoms of pd without the negative side effects caused by aldoba although these findings are very promising more research needs to be done on the topic with more clinical trials to show the effects of cbd in humans with pd now that we've discussed the effects of cannabis in the body let's review physicians perspectives on treatment of pd with medical marijuana animal investigations support suggestions of improvement in bradykinesia and tremors but this is unsubstantiated in human studies some patients have reported that marijuana diminishes some motor non-motor cognitive and or mood symptoms of pd 18 studies investigated medical practitioners perspectives on this none of these studies presented results that outright rejected the clinical usefulness of medical cannabis in a separate study physicians were asked to indicate the degree to which the use of cannabis is evidence-based for various symptoms of pd 87 of physicians felt that the literature supported the use of cannabis for nausea 60 for anxiety and 86 for pain responses were divided with regard to motor symptoms in fact only 36 percent of physicians believed cannabis could help parkinson's patients with tremors and 35 for symptoms like dyskinesia researchers need to clarify the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy with cannabis products or medical marijuana will remain largely without scientific endorsement research has to document the full benefits risks and clinical applications of marijuana as a treatment for patients with pd medical practitioners attribute a self-perceived lack of knowledge as a significant barrier to approval a study conducted by edelstein at al revealed that 95 of participants had no formal education about medical marijuana 84.6 reported being unprepared to answer clients questions that were cannabis related medical practitioners also raised issues about the potential for recreational misuse diversion into illicit channels the risk of drug drug interactions driving under the influence of cannabis and the potential risks associated with uncontrolled supply finally rey's concern for the health of individual patients was mostly focused around psychiatric adverse effects more than 10 million people worldwide are living with pd and the incidence of parkinson's only increases with age when such a large portion of the population has an incurable disease it is essential that we explore every possible therapy to help improve their quality of life medical cannabis is a promising therapy for pd and requires further research to investigate its potential as a new and exciting treatment for the disease thank you so much for watching also remember to subscribe to the demystifying

subscribers on YouTube that's right a thousand of you awesome people subscribe to my youtube channel thank you everybody who Tunes in and watches my videos and shares them and likes them in comments I really appreciate that holy [ __ ] so to celebrate a thousand subscribers I'm gonna stick to the theme of a thousand and what I've got here is a 1-1 gram snake of some shadow I've stretched out here so we're gonna do a 1 gram damp of some of this grape star shatter if I can get it to focus I picked this up earlier from the hem Center really cool dispensary and this is about who cares what percent 66% but we've got a 1 gram dam which is a thousand milligrams of concentrate and then I also have a thousand milligrams of edibles that we're gonna take today so a 1 gram Babb and a thousand milligrams of edibles do you think that you can handle this what I've got here is the let's get it to focus I have the Colorado cannabis oil capsules and there's four capsules in here and there are a total of 350 milligrams through the whole bottle and they actually make these words four capsules and it's a thousand milligrams but I couldn't find that so these are just I guess less filled and the capsules but let me give you a breakdown we're looking at okay so each capsule is about 93 milligrams of THC and it is full spectrum or RSO so there are other cannabinoids and there's really good stuff I've had this many times before and it's actually my favorite edible so this whole bottle is 372 milligrams of THC and it's not like it's full there's only four little capsules in here and we're actually gonna take we're gonna take three of these which should be just over a thousand milligrams it'll actually be about 1100 milligrams so I'm excited and then I'm gonna try to stream on Twitch after this so this is for a thousand subs on YouTube but you know I stream every night on Twitch if you don't sub to my twitch channel like twitch that TV slash coupons check that [ __ ] out I'm probably live right now if you're watching this and I'm probably not on my thousand milligrams and one gram that but maybe we hit some milestones again I'll do it check out my twitch check out my other social media we have links in the description below follow my Instagram my Twitter sup to the subreddit check out the Facebook I don't know check out all that stuff join the discord that's the good one let's take some of the capsules first maybe like a half now and half after cuz like what if the dev just wrecks me I can I can't continue let's give it a go so this is 350 milligrams for four of these and they're just little capsules and I guess this is the same size for all of them so if you get the higher dose which ones they just they fill more but they have more of the liquid in it early oil so let's go for it let's take a nap now [Music] just little GHC capsules I kappapa movement in this or above okay so that's four of them I think and honestly guys I mentioned it before this is my absolute favorite edible I hate if I want to take a thousand milligrams I usually hate a thousand to get high if I want to take it it's like several brownies or like a fuckload of gummies you know what I mean I'm not trying to eat like a [ __ ] eight ounce bag of gummies to get a thousand milligrams I'd rather just like pop a few capsules and this is actually these are the low dose not like a pop four and get a thousand milligrams some of them are even more potent so I need to look out for those they're hard to find and they're kind of pricey well that's half of it down it's about 550 milligrams of THC here was 1100 for the capsules overall so we have half of that down and let's fire up the let's fire up the nail here we're gonna do this on quartz banger I got the pearls in there hopefully hoping I can get the time right I don't do a lot of dabs on this lately so I'm hoping I get the time right but if not I'm down for four reheats and whatnot we were just gonna milk this a one-gram dab is like it can be a million different things a hundred people could do a a 1 gram them and everybody consumes a different amount so there's different amounts of waste or whatever so I'm just gonna try to go pretty hot minimal waste but you know how it is let's let's see we got here [Music] we got a nice big old Glover here let's see how it looks [Music] oh that's thick [Music] not

from the pan and how our sweaty boy and I still have to take 500 more milligrams so I'm gonna stream after this good luck [Music] well at least a DAB was good I can do like a little sample of it or anything before once that was really harsh oh god that would have sucked it's really good it's got some [ __ ] shadow recently I did that over pride Oh try one more read on here and now we're gonna take the other [Music] oh I'm sledding oh I'm gonna sit here to see my parking the door blows just sweat it out [Music] let's get actually what boy read on that I'm not [ __ ] around I'm done but I'm

"Sfpk2w-wGNY": "this is always a joy to talk about first of all dementia because it's very close to my heart in terms of taking care of dementia patients but I'm a geriatrician so I take care of older adults and if you want to consider what my specialties are it's in long-term care dementia and end-of-life or hospice and palliative care the buck stops with me I always say is unfortunately my patients die my goal is the best quality of life all right for the duration of their life the best part and the best quality of care so I also run a geriatric fellowship program training young physicians to become geriatric physicians for all of you in here and my advice and certainly when I'm in the training process I'm training them so that they know me and how to take care of me when I get older because I'm kind of picky but also I would recommend that geriatric medicine is a lot different than primary care medicine that's internal medicine or family medicine the whole principles are quite different and actually if you look back at what's happening in our primary care medicine you see the changes that might be occurring more of a holistic approach more of a team approach more of a shared decision-making and also planning for advanced directives in terms of advanced care planning so to speak what happens if I get this this or that as I get older dealing with dementia and the primary emphasis on this particular talk is is what can we do with regards to patients who have behavioral issues with dementia patients and it's marijuana possibly a role in terms of how we might look at alternative ways how we manage these behaviors in addition there's a lot of confusion before that's all right there's a lot of confusion as far as what the hell is marijuana and I would guarantee you that if I go around I bet you I might get 10 or 15 different answers of what marijuana is and then if I bring up the term cannabis what's cannabis okay so I hate to say this but much like I had to do is I have to learn some basics so I'm going to go over some basics so that when you see something advertised CBD oil is being advertised on every street corner that you can buy it here what is it that I'm getting because then what's the difference between marijuana and CBD oil or is there a difference I don't know so so I'm going to go into some basics and then I'm going to talk to you about some of the studies with regards to the use of marijuana where we stand with regards the use of that some of the positive pros and cons if you will of it and then switch into where do we stand with regards to the use in dementia or Alzheimer's dementia before I start I want to ask how many of you are caregivers or have experience with patients who have dementia good a good portion so you'll be definitely interested in where we stand with regards to the use of cannabis if you will in our patients who have dementia the first slide up here is I have geriatrics and polypharmacy good and bad news is we're living longer the bad news is is that we have more medical problems as we grow older and therefore usually that means that we're on a lot of medicines so in Doc's particularly our specialists like to prescribe a lot of medicines because they say you can't live without them I'm on the other side and the other side of that is is that I'm looking at people who are on these drugs but are having adverse effects of those meds and you know what a lot of the drugs that we use have what they call black box warnings that means that you could die from them so it's a constant balance if you will in terms of always assessing the benefit versus the risk overall and all of us as healthcare providers is do no harm alright that's easier said than done okay and you'll see why maybe as we go on so let's take a look the next slide is the problem behaviors are very common the most consistent abnormality that you're going to see over the course of dementia the course of dementia varies anywhere Alzheimer's dementia between eight to ten years but it goes anywhere from three years to twenty years all right so you can see the differences in terms of life span and now there are multiple types of dementia has anything in in this world it gets more complicated so we're finding different forms each of these different forms have a different we'll say memory effects if you will and other neurological deficits that we really have to be a student of to pick them up because it really does mean our this is this particular type more prone to behaviors versus not and if so how do we differentiate that and how are we going to adjust our medications okay and the behaviors are characterized for any of you that are involved in taking care of some dementia patients agitation verbal and aggressive behave behaviors all right and what does that mean hitting patients are hitting slapping biting kicking anybody have experience with their patients on that okay that's disturbing re or the good old yelling and screaming help me help me help me help me shut up well yeah all right and you just want to say that but these are all problems and they're difficult to manage and by the way how we manage them is different starting off by I want to say that the thing is a significant thing is is that there are serious complications that can be associated with that I can walk up to you and I could say you know you're a son of a [ __ ] all right and you're gonna slap me alright how dare you say that to me so number one patient may get hurt the other resident may get hurt and if somebody's trying to do a activities of daily living cleaning them changing them whatever it is they may get agitated they made kick and scratch is this comment yes it's very common okay and the question comes up is what do you do about it okay when the problem is is that the treatment options are very limited I can go through a list of about four different medicine medical medication groups and we've tried them all and each of them are associated with complications all right some more serious than not some of them as I said that can even result in death the more common drugs that have been used all right are now have the black box warning saying that you could die from this from sudden cardiac death that's only a minor not a minor complication but that's only one of the many complications that are associated with taking these medicines next slide please so possible solution can the use of cannabis be a benefit to assist in the management of these behaviors next slide so first thing is what is cannabis and what is marijuana so I'm gonna go through some basics and just so we all understand that and hopefully bring it home in terms of what we're looking at when we're trying to evaluate the benefit versus the risk of using marijuana or cannabis all right in our patients so next slide so the cannabis plants which are oftentimes said the marijuana plant so they use them interchangeably but it really is a cannabis plant alright and originally they were from East Asia but now as we all know they're cultivated throughout the whole world so everybody's growing marijuana all right original use was Industrial fiber seed oil hemp seed oil for example hemp seeds for recreational purses purposes religious and spiritual purposes to elevate the mood and lastly now more recently with the medication that we're looking at in terms of is this an appropriate type of medicine you actually have three different strains the most common ones there's probably several ones listed seva sativa the indica strain and one that we don't hear much about is this third strain which a true Dallas ruderalis and this Teva notoriously that strain so if you have a plant that's high or of this de Teva strain its where really most of the marijuana in quote marijuana as we can't say it which is invigorating uplifting okay and activating if you will makes you feel good as opposed to the indica stre which is more sedating relaxing sleep makes you sleep better okay there's characteristic and where CBD comes from okay so the next slide so the two main varieties that we see from coming from these plants and I'll start by saying there's a term that they use is of final phyto cannabinoids alright and we'll just use cannabinoids in general it's a technical term I realize that but the reason I'm using that is phyto means that there are the naturally occurring which is where marijuana comes from literally and then the endocannabinoids and guess what there in our brain we have marijuana going in our brain let's call it cannabis as opposed to marijuana all right so it's kind of tricky we'll get to that a little bit more so marijuana has a high THC content psychoactive intoxicating this is what we traditionally see on the streets and everybody's taking it particularly for all those medical problems that it's interesting how the young people have more medical problems than the older people when it comes to use of marijuana it's kind of interesting all right and then hemp all right which is basically CBD content in what we're seeing the CBD oils and different products from CBD that we're seeing on the market all right it's not psychoactive it's not intoxicating and again this is where most of the uses was in for industrial use again hemp seed hemp oil now the amazing thing is is that this last thing these are chemicals that circulate or that are fun in this plant there are four hundred approximately four hundred and eighty different chemicals that are in our marijuana plant hey and second of all of those known there's about 65 that have some chemical structure that are related to the endocannabinoids which are the ones that are circulating in our brain okay so it's a plant and you say well you know where should we really be dealing with this but how many of you familiar everybody's familiar with penicillin where did it come from it comes from a mold okay so it's be surprising how many things we might get up natural products that may be a benefit to us that we don't know about the problem is we need to study it and decide what is appropriate what isn't appropriate so some of the terms that you may hear marijuana the main ingredient in that is THC and that mostly comes from the flowers all right in the leaves of the plant when you get down to the stalks the plants this is where hemp is derived from from the stems and the stalks then you have terpenes and terpenoids and science interesting is it but how many Herot of aromatherapy all right everybody's heard of Roma therapy that's basically terpenoids it's a it's a class of chemicals that gives us scent all right I was recently in Amsterdam and it's like on every other corner is either a coffee shop which is literally a marijuana shop as opposed to a cafe which is a coffee shop or a head's shop all right which is all marijuana and it was kind of interesting because I went in there and they say well this is a lemon flavor this is a strawberry favor this is a caramel flavor I mean how many flavors do you have but nonetheless this is basically what they're talking about the terpenoids end up making the the smell and that they have very as medicinal effects such as lavender for example is relaxing to help you go to sleep so theoretically the terpenoids have some contribution to the effects of marijuana and then you have hash and hashish which is basically an extracted cannabis product composed of compressed purified preparations of stock resin gland and hashish is oftentimes the drug that they refer to which is the resident of the cannabis plant this is something that normally is smoked a lot so for some of the younger people this is probably old hat in here am i right now I'm looking I'm looking around for the younger nobody's even acknowledged he met alright and then lastly and this is where I got to keep in mind for those that are growing marijuana plants if you take a marijuana plant and you just crush it up put everything in it that's what you're going to get and you're gonna smoke it but you don't know what's in it and that's a real problem in a sense you don't know if it's got a lot of THC you don't know if it's got byproducts that are dangerous for you so and that's why buying street marihuana is really a raise as a concern in terms of what you're getting in that product okay so it's very variable therapeutic effect I don't know if you know but the recent statistics since marijuana has been legalized the number of ER visits associated with acute psychotic reactions related to that have gone up significantly okay so the only point is to point out some of the concerns that you have with what you're getting and and what effect it's going to have on you and the concerns that we all have and so if I has a geriatric doc is going to be prescribing a medicine for you or your loved one my concern is am i doing more harm am I going to create some problems okay so as I mentioned predominate temp is predominantly CBD this is normally what we're getting when we go and get some CBD all right has a lower concentration of THC it is the only legalized form of cannabis that can be prescribed without a prescription you know in order to get marijuana you have to have a medical marijuana card in order to get CBD you really don't now the good news is that it recently has been reclassified I think it's reclassified in thirty states Arizona is one of them so let me go back and just talk about when I talk about a Schedule one schedule to schedule one is no currently accepted medical use and the highest potential for abuse where do the opiates come they come in schedule two proven medical benefit all right but a high risk for abuse and that's why we have the open opioid crisis schedule 5 is medications with a low quantities of narcotics and low potential for abuse now I put robitussin does everybody know robitussin dm has everybody taking it you know that's a drug as central nervous side effects alright theoretically and the doses that we get or give you're probably not going to get much but actually so CBD has gone from a scheduled one all the way down to a Schedule five that's good news okay however the criteria must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration it can't have a content higher than 0.3 and that's vary from state to state some people will say 0.1% all right marijuana still scheduled as get Road ones rug so it's still not legal can be purchased without obtaining the medication of a marijuana card and the federal law keep in mind here's the difference a federal law it's still illegal CBD is still illegal some of you may have seen the news where the lady was arrested getting on an airplane she had CBD cream or oil or point mint of some sort and she was arrested it's under the airports are under federal jurisdiction therefore it's theoretically illegal and I want to mention that because from the standpoint of myself and treating this I have to be careful I mean if I do it in a federally regulated facility am I breaking the law and the question come and I don't want to get arrested not yet I mean you know I just got back one more just real quick gee oh that's I wanted to say so you really have to be careful federal law still has that Seabee oil and other cannabis cannibal dials are listening to schedule a and the newest drug which is mostly CBD is epi epi Leah Dix I don't know if you've heard about this but this is the medicine that now has been approved for seizures and young kids and really thought to be a benefit the studies look promising and there's a couple of new drugs that are coming out soon and ou allude to them as we go on next slide please so these are the benefits all right potential benefits all right keep in mind that CBD is a non psychoactive and there are very few side effects we've already talked about the pediatric seizures epidural ox is mine anxiety nausea vomiting inflammatory conditions paying Alzheimer's dementia Parkinson's disease but actually studied more in Parkinson's disease in an Alzheimer's dementia alright but so these are some of the potential benefits and now if these are benefits why aren't we looking at them more closely and try to determine you know what are these benefits and are there any potential side effects next slide on the other hand THC I'll talk a little bit more about the ratios THC is activating and a CBD counteracts that activation by cousin and relaxing so if you combine the two has thought that you may potentiate the effect of the eventual effective of any of the symptoms that you are treating on the other hand the CBD counteracts you just don't want to give the THC to you know having everybody sort of activated if you will that's what you're trying to suppress particularly in patients who have a cognitive impairment alright but pain is probably the biggest area where we're talking about and this is arthritic pain as well as what they call neuropathic pain or peripheral neuropathies opioid modulation we're gonna get to that a little bit more and I'm gonna tell you a little bit about how I think that there is some positive things coming out of the use of the marijuana that we're seeing in dealing with anxiety insomnia and spasticity the spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis so there is a new drug that's going to be coming out soon if any day is going to be approved for the use in patients who have must multiple sclerosis and has an appetite stimulant and I'm a little bit more or less disappointed in the one that we currently have we have a drug called Marinol and I think it's very expensive I've used it I think it's worthless drug and I unfortunately people still ask if we can take it and I usually say no because it is expensive and Medicare does not pay for it next slide so these are the synthetic cannabinoids which are Marinol is the drug that I talked about with regards to appetite stimulant epi dialogue which is for the pediatric seizures salty Beck says is the one that's now going to be produced it's almost there for spasticity with multiple sclerosis very positive outcome but good studies are eight that have shown the benefit and that's what really we need and then you have that naturally-occurring canna at cannabinoids which are marijuana in the derivatives and then now over-the-counter CBD as you as I mentioned you know I need any prescription you don't need anything you can walk in and you get CBD a buy it bottom line it's pretty expensive so bear with me again we're using CBD is it a benefit and I'll give you my own personal experience as a physician prescribing it for some of my patients next slide as you might guess we all know that smoking and vaping are big things I do want to tell you that I did bring along some brownies for you when you leave so I hope you had enjoy the rest of your day and just enjoy all right these are very common my wife just got some but I see quite a few people in terms of using this and rubbing it on our thrity joints I'm gonna say it's probably 50/50 and keep in mind you always have to think in terms of placebo something soft on your on your arthritic pain might make you feel better but it isn't really truly doing anything for the inflammation then the tinctures and oils this is what we are more or less using in our studies because it's easy for the patients to take the problem with the Edible is it's highly variable of how much marijuana if you will is in that particular cookie that you're taking and now you know in alcoholic beverages as well as soft drinks they are now putting CBD in those drinks and lastly transdermal patches and suppositories hopefully we don't have to get to that point to use those next slide so what is some relationship between plant cannabis all right the phyto cannabinoids all right and the endocannabinoid cannabinoids come yeah all right next slide all right so there is an endocannabinoid system in our brain and it consists of it's a biological system is composed of a lot of cannabinoids that are moving around in the brain okay all right and they actually ask as neurotransmitters I like this short order neurotransmitter transmitters basically what I'm saying is I say if you feel depressed okay the cannabinoids will have an increased secretion of those they'll hook onto the cannabinoid receptors and maybe counteract the depression so that makes sense to you you follow me so it's a chemical that attaches on or the chemical itself that's going to cause a reaction that's the same mechanism as all the other drugs that we use by the way right how many of you heard of serotonin okay so serotonin same thing okay basically the same thing and look how much we've studied with serotonin all right dopamine another one these are all chemicals that circulating the brain and have our neurotransmitters that create some kind of a reaction where they hook on to a receptor okay so the two that we know of now and there are many all right just what two AG and you don't have to know this but but these are mostly fun in the brain and then Ananda mind is the other one which is fun in higher concentrations of the body now the reason I say that is that they're all over the place so you have certain ones that are predominantly in the brain and certain ones that are predominantly in the bloodstream circulating in the body okay now they are also broken down and I maybe this is a little too technical but CBD and THC work a little bit differently CBD attacks this enzyme which breaks down cannabinoids okay and you don't want to do that I'm going to just say if you use Parkinson's disease you have dopamine and you have an absence of dopamine that gives you the Parkinson's symptoms so the question comes up is you don't want to take something that might be a benefit for you and decrease that okay on the other hand THC acts directly on the receptors alright and if it gives you more of a prolonged effect alright for whatever that endpoint is on the receptor depends on what system is in if it's in the system of the hypothalamus for example it may improve your appetite okay if it's in another system may help your memory if you will alright so there's different different mechanisms we just don't know enough about them yet next slide then these are the receptors cb1 receptors which are found mostly in the brain and spinal cord and then these they're concentrated in the brain regions associated with that behavior so again I mentioned the hypothalamus and maybe if we're gonna stimulate the appetite for example and just using that again cannabinoids you give them and they're going to stimulate the appetite you hear that the rationale behind the thinking behind is there a benefit for appetite stimulant and then the cb2 receptors found in a peripheral nervous system now this is where the anti-inflammatory approach comes in so it works on the immune system and it creates an anti-inflammatory so if you have arthritis theoretically all right it's going to make the arthritis feel less inflamed if you will as an anti-inflammatory drug and I don't know if as we get older the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs these of the advils and that person and a whole host of medicines that we take for our arthritis but as we get older there are more complications associated with it so for all practical purposes they almost become contraindicated in our older patients again what alternatives do we have for managing pain okay then I won't go into that x5 so let's take a look these are the things that internally in our own brain that they may be affecting appetite metabolism pain sleep mood movement it goes all the way down all right now the reason I say that our our older patients but better yet dementia patients have trouble with the appetite they may not eat they have pain that they can't describe so we don't know whether they have or have not pain but the older you get more likely you're gonna have arthritic pain sleep insomnia is a common problem people have sleep disorders all right and mood so it waxes in wane sometimes or more activated other times are more sleepy so we really have to deal with that but remember they also are involved in our basic functions our everyday living okay next slide so the latest term that's coming out is are there individuals which have a lower amount that are necessary to maintain good health vitality and well-being all right so this is called an end and kinetic cannabinoid deficiency and is there a syndrome that occurs now let me give you just a rough maybe guesstimate because it is being used how many people are familiar with fibromyalgia okay everybody okay good all right that's it's so about depressed effect aches all over okay do you think maybe it could be that there's a cannabinoid which affects all of these areas that that our patients complain of with fibromyalgia it's being tried so far there are no definitive results but I noticed that they are using it more and more and people who have fibromyalgia with the Hope Center because there is no good treatment so far all right there's a lot of treatment that's out there question is note I said good treatment so it's always possible to look into this so it raises the question is why are we looking at this if we look at dopamine deficiency serotonin deficiency why are we looking at the cannabinoid deficiency there's occurs in the brain next slide so and why is there more need this is certainly the reason why there's a need for more studies next slide ok I'll start off by saying is there a plus side all right to the use of marijuana that's been described we talked about all the symptoms and symptoms that are associated with it okay I feel hi that might be kids that are good a lot of these others were not sure of but we still use it with the hopes that we're gonna feel better have a good time sometimes it's the difference between taking an alcoholic beverage as well as a puff of marijuana that the trade-off is you're gonna feel better maybe with both which one has the least amount of side effects there are those what argue marijuana has the least amount of side effects I'm not going to go there but let's let's go studies have shown that that there is a reduction in prescription medicine so let's take a look at that a very important slide next slide so changes associated with state having a medical marijuana law in numbers of Medicaid prescriptions for drugs used to treat condition with medical marijuana look at this anxiety depression Lacombe a-- nausea pain psychosis seizures sleep the only ones spasticity quite sure why that fell out to be quite frank with you but the bottom line is so there are some studies that that you can look at CMS the Medicare Medicaid data and come up with there's less there's a reduction in the use of medications for each of these next one even more important okay in consideration of the opioid epidemic all right we have now look at over here this is every number of daily doses filled with the prescription drugs annually per physician in states with medical marijuana law by condition categorize category studied compared to the average number in states without a law look at the difference and and the one I point to is paying okay now we're in an opioid crisis no I don't want to say that we're gonna trade an opioid crisis for a marijuana crisis all right but the point being is as a river really need to look at this very very closely because we are in an opioid crisis and the question is do we have an alternative all right in terms of particularly going through withdrawal and some of the other medicines that we give to our patients who are addicted to opioids so that's a very important statistic I thought and perhaps a benefit that we need to look into a little bit more now as you know there's also on the other side in States who have legalized marijuana there's an increased incidence of motor vehicle accidents alright so a lot of negative things that obviously is quoted in the newspapers and you can quote it either way for those probe those anti marijuana use my concern is is that we just need more studies in order to make sure that we know what we're doing next thing next slide so this gives you an idea of the different studies if you take a look at the number of studies all right these are controlled studies 28 for paying 28 for nausea vomitting 14 for multiple sclerosis and if you take a look at the patients now the point is in order to have an adequate research study you really have to have large numbers and what's problem is is that if you go all the way down and looking here sleep disorder psychosis anxiety disorders alright there are very few studies you're really looking at them here and this is from 2:15 2015 now this was a meta-analysis so basically the Cochran study what they usually do is they look at all these studies that are put together all right that have been done on marijuana and they try to analyze whether they've been good studies or bad studies in this case they just looked to see if there were studies but take a look at these numbers I mean for twenty four glaucoma is something that wherever it is there's only a few six six studies for glaucoma and yet that's being billed as something that you can use marijuana for glaucoma and for eggs sleep disorders all right which are very common not only in our patients with dementia but in our older population in general so you could see there aren't many studies next slide so pain management since that is it so again here was again another Cochran study where they looked at all these different studies now note a lot of these with cannabinoid and with THC and the others are usually with pharmaceutical companies but if you really take a look all those dots are squares that are on the right side all right show that that favors the use of marijuana all right those on the opposite side know and negative I didn't go into each of these studies to see whether they were good studies bad studies whatever they may be I'm gonna point out some problems that we have with our dementia patients in terms of doing studies and how effective they are and the problems we have on judging whether or not they are really truly an improvement or not and I'll go into that a little bit later but the consensus is is that they probably do help in pain so let's take a look at that and can we find something the pharmaceutical industry is trying to produce an fda-approved drug alright which will have the combination of THC and CBD and to try to see whether or not it's effective or not and hopefully like some of the other drugs will get that passed so that you are able to take that whether you're it's federally regulated or not that you will be able to take that as a drug next slide don't go too far with this but I will tell you this all right and much as I talked about serotonin and dopamine alright there is some consider in some of the bay science is that maybe this is marijuana as neuroprotective now one of the things is with regards to marijuana they say it creates apathy all right over a long term used chronic use but we don't know what that chronic use is so the question is a little bit okay or is too much not okay so we don't know the answer to that so the bottom line is that but they it may be neuroprotective now again I don't want to go into this but I will solve it but much as I talked about serotonin dopamine and cannabinoids alright with dementia acetylcholine goes down alright and the drugs that we have available increase the acetylcholine alright and that improves memory that's just a very simple simplistic version of what happens in Alzheimer's dementia but THC competes competitively inhibits cholinesterase inhibitor all right that's what breaks down acetylcholine so and that's how the mechanism of these new drugs work is they they destroy the enzyme that destroys acetylcholine are you all following me on that I mean is that okay you got okay so I'm trying so that is one mechanism the other is is there's a still a theory that that this is an anti inflammatory process so we're looking at drugs perhaps that would be anti inflammatory in nature one of the drugs that promoted that maybe we don't even you don't even know about is is the statins are anti inflammatory and a lot of the benefits of the statins are from its anti-inflammatory effects so the question comes up is this is somewhat like an antioxidant and actually there's some pretty good studies with our diet that we take which is high in antioxidants is a good diet is one of the factors that you can be on to delay the onset and progression of Alzheimer's dementia so I mean we can do a lot of this on our own the question comes up is is there an effect on from the will comb cannabinoids for right now in terms of perhaps delaying the onset or improving dementia in our patients this we don't know not looking into that now but there are some studies next day next time so these are the drugs now in in dementia studies that have been and I'm gonna kind of go over these a little bit quickly but Marinol is the only drug that has been approved and for appetite stimulant that's predominantly its effect we've used that and it supposedly causes decreased agitation I'm just going to tell you right now I think it's worthless I think it's an expensive drug that has very little effect and I don't prescribe it because it's not covered by Medicare first of all you have to pay for it I just don't think it's of any benefit so most of the studies that came out are really using low dose everybody's concerned with THC and for justifiable reasons it makes you high so if I have an agitated patient with dementia do I want to give them a drug that's going to make them more agitated okay so what they did is they they gave low dose of THC alright and and it didn't appear more beneficial than placebos in a small study only 58 patients received this and they received a relatively small dose of THC over a period of time did not have CBD in it so the question comes up or it may have had a little but mostly it was THC study so then they went to a little bit higher doses using cannabis oil and in 11 patients no I want to tell you again love and patience means nothing how many of people have heard of prevacid gonna have a scent I know even if you're taking it I'm gonna tell you it's a waste of money but alright the point being is is that the studies that we're done are absolutely ridiculous and how they have marketed that I think is really pathetic because they are making tons and tons of medicine on this drug it's not a drug you can get over the counter but I think it's actually like $60.00 a month something like that and I just think it's a shame it's it's we're a vulnerable society and we don't want to get dementia so if somebody advertises this drug no harm but you're paying $60 a month if you're on a limited income that's a lot of money okay plain and simply but these were done on hospitalized patients now the NPI is one of the tests that is good for monitoring behaviors in dementia patients and in non dimensions okay but mostly in dementia patients now these were patients who are hospitalized so we just say when a hospitalized patients is high with dementia is hospitalized there are 18 other different things that can be going on the most common which is delirium so we don't know if it helped of delirium or the dementia they seem to say that it was improved and maybe it's a drug that we should look at as opposed to some of the more toxic drugs that we use in hospitalized patients who develop delirium maybe we should look into them the Cochrane review all right basically found no evidence that cannabinoids are effective in reducing symptoms so that basically saying is all the studies it's inconclusive that there is any benefit that doesn't mean that they're abnormal next slide I like to study that recently came on it's a study from Sweden and it came out in this past in April of two night 2019 and they did and the reason I liked this study is because this is along the studies that we're doing in in our dementia units okay they were in a dementia directed care facilities and Jen mentioned to you that that I work out of a facility called Silverado and it's a dementia directed care assisted living facility all patients with dementia it's a prospective study so we're kind of starting with a baseline all right but anyway they did ten female patients I have no idea why they only included female patients as opposed to male patients with severe behavioral problems and they were given larger than previous doses of cannabis and here's this ratio CBD and THC so if you're gonna give larger doses of THC you want to counterbalance that with CBD now the question comes up is are we negating the effects of THC by giving the CBD or what nobody knows this answer okay we don't know this answer but they did monitor the behaviors and the results there was a 40% improvement and behavior scales and they used a decrease of psychotropic medicines now I will tell you here if I have somebody on psychotropic medicines alright and then I decrease their medicine you know they're more alert more active and so what are we dealing with we're dealing with the excess disability associated with these medicines so the idea is it was at the marijuana or was it us just decrease into medication okay improving up daily care and improvement in direct contact so if you're a zombie on mantra medicine and I take you off the medicine and all of a sudden you're communicating to me I'm just saying this is some of the difficulties that we have in studying this it's just not an easy thing to study however the relief there was no adverse side-effects which is great and there was relief was persistent after two months off the medicines and by the way when we take patients off medicines oftentimes they get better and stay better with or without marijuana so it is tricky next slide this is the Arizona study that we're talking about now first of all I wanted to talk about some of the problems we have encountered with regards to beginning this study and doing this study we're in the process of it now but you have to get a marijuana card and from Arizona the state of Arizona the question comes up is if you have a patient who has dimension no longer capable of making their own healthcare decisions then does the caregiver be responsible for getting a card but basically now the consensus is is that both the caregiver as well as the patient have to get a card now this entails now take a ninety-year-old with dementia who has had dementia for eight years do you think they have a driver's license do you think they have a recent photo huh yeah you hope not that's right so my point being is it's really hard to get this information and it becomes costly I don't know if any of you know what the cost of staying in a a dementia directed care facility I mean it's anywhere from 5,000 to 8,000 and and continually going up okay that's a lot of expenses now you throw an other expense on we are actually we need two cards we're gonna get the medicine for for free so you need to necessary offer me information and the left doesn't know the right to be quite frank with you as far as what the actual law is so and and there's still a lot of confusion and I hear different things and the other concern is liability issues all right facility will maybe not wanting to take an effective side effects now we're doing I want to consider this as a pilot study and not at what they call an institutional review board study which is much more scientific but I want to get some preliminary data then go and get a random randomized controlled study that would allow me to have more teeth in this so we're at this point we're using anywhere from 15 to 20 20 patients and keep in mind I don't know that I could get this done in a federal facility so a skilled nursing facility that's under the regulations of federal regulations I'm not quite sure I can do that and as I mentioned the liability concerns at this point though I'm at least glad that they have legalized marijuana medicinal marijuana in Arizona that allows me at least to opened the door and start these studies yes well you have to go through a Medicare I'm sorry I'm a marijuana prescriber usually all right so I'm a medical marijuana prescriber and so I can it's okay to order it I put my name I fill out a form that your PCP can do that also it's very easy to get a medication marijuana card rather so but for this in this particular study I'm the primary care physician for the most part and if I'm not I will get it through the primary care physician of whoever's the physician for the Alzheimer patient that's not not a patient of mine next fine all right so this is our study anywhere from 10 to 15 to 20 we have approximately 15 patients that are signed up about a 16 week trial we're using the cannabis oil that's been shown to be the best route for patients who have dementia with a 2 to run CBD to THC all right now the other thing I wanted to mention is if you're going to get THC it has to be quantify alright because if I get THC from you and you and you from a particular company it's liable to be a different mo I don't know the amount okay and that's one of the problems when particularly when you buy stuff in the street or on the market wherever you're going you don't know how much you're getting and that's a real problem okay and we're gonna gradually increase these doses every two to four weeks and see what kind of a Reese we are we're going to follow alright with a washout period of time much like the previous study and see whether or not we've done some benefit with this but again all those things that we talked about is it am I where I want to get as the initial start this on initial patience with behaviors before they are on the more serious and more toxic drugs alright we haven't got that far yet but hopefully that would be the initial drug that we might try and I'd like to try that rather than seeing patients on multiple medications alright so we're gonna use the appropriate scales we're gonna have nursing observation which sometimes can be really subjective as opposed to objective go looking at drug reduction including the use of breakthrough medications obviously looking for the adverse reactions and making sure that is there some reversion back to the original behaviors after we stop the marijuana okay next slide break from medicine is I order as needed medicine so if you really get agitated while I'm getting your behaviors under control I'll have them give you some medicine to calm you down during that period of time while I'm working on a broader perspective of getting your behaviors under control our philosophy has always start low so rather than starting high and knocking the patient out I would rather start slow and go slowly but occasionally a little bit may not be enough and you may need some breakthrough medicine okay okay everybody so the side effects perhaps one of the more common ones is increased anxiety associated with tachycardia and that's the THC that's what you get when you take marijuana okay you get a little bit more anxious alright some people all right that's one side effects of too much THC elevation of a blood pressure tachycardia decreased concentration sleepiness so then you get the CBD that might be kicking in headaches dizziness paranoia and hallucinations I mean most of our patients who have to mention behaviors are have hallucinations or paranoia and they have delusions so we don't want to make those worse and the number one factor that we have to look at for this is the drug drug interaction okay I've had a negative success not good success in fact I think I've made situations worse by combining marijuana with anti-psychotic drugs that bothers me it makes me very hesitant first slide do no harm all right so am i doing more harm or less harm and I hate to say this I don't know what the hell I'm doing with the marijuana I mean I really know because we don't have any studies so but this is the biggest concern I go back to the dopamine serotonin and now the cannabinoids in the brain and we're messing with chemicals in the brain so do we know what we're doing and where are we going with that so that's a my biggest concern offhand next slide so where do we stand at this particular you know I guess I've not had positive experiences using marijuana there are those that have had positive experiences now the other effect is is it a placebo effect too so I'm taking medicine but patients don't know so you want to anticipate that you take that placebo component placebo is where you give them something that's not really a medicine and you in a lot of our drugs that are tested are placebo and and and the drug you'd be surprised how many people respond to the placebo a good 20 30 percent respond to placebo and some studies much higher by the way and particularly the drugs that we use are anti-psychotic drugs by the way that we use we need better clarification of the current regulations regarding the use of marijuana and then we need more liberalization of the laws alive for more research you know we've tried for years to do research projects with marijuana but you have to go they need to be federally improved and it's illegal so you can't you can't get a study with marijuana because it's federally against the law and this needs to be changed I mean you can prevent whatever you want to do but let's studies be done so we have a better idea of what's going on so we have a lot of potential but we're not there yet next slide so our goal is provide the best quality of life our patients comes in all walks of life in all degrees of chronic disease all right and so we always need to be looking for ways that we can improve on the health and again here's the case of take you providing the best quality of life as opposed to giving medicines that are going to give you a poor quality of life it's a balancing act it's difficult there is no magic answer all right but this is what ultimately we're looking at and so the next slide so be careful what we wish everybody in this room that came to this lecture I'm sure is saying I hope marijuana is perhaps an answer that we can use in conjunction with making our patients feel a little bit better okay number one on the list by the way it's an industry all right and they are expanding in leaps and bounds and what do you think there's much money being invested in made in its success all right we are a vulnerable population okay and looking for instant relief we always have been will always be and I don't blame us but at the same time we can be exploited and I think I'm throwing the words of caution out and we're not sure yet of the short and long term you hear this constantly over and over we don't know what the short term we don't know what the long term effects are all right so basically we really need to be studying a little bit more before we jump on the bandwagon because you're seeing it on the internet you're seeing it advertised you're seeing it everywhere take this but there's a lot of people making a lot of money it's expensive it's very expensive all right probably more than your routine meds that you take that are prescribed by the doctors and in reality it's not covered by Medicare so and the last slide is what we're really doing is looking to provide that quality of care and quality of life that we want happy patients all of us should you know be in a good place when we're dying death is inevitable and my goal at least is to see that you are in the most comfortable place with the best quality of life and best quality of care not always easy to do but we work hard and that's where geriatrics and hospice Doc's are really important in trying to provide that so with that I'll stop and thank you and any questions we'll open it up to questions [Applause]", "fqNfGj8jwFY": "arthritis is a very potentially debilitating condition it affects millions of Canadians and there's actually a lot of different forms of arthritis the most common form that most of us think of when we hear the word arthritis is osteoarthritis and so that is typically the wear and tear that most people eventually especially if they live long enough will experience on their joints and that can be arthritis of the shoulders the knees the hands and that's just your general wear and tear and what people who experience this type of arthritis what they usually complain of is that sometimes they have a mild amount of stiffness but as the day gets on and they start to use those joints the inflammation starts to get worse and the pain starts to get worse another form of arthritis though that a lot of people don't typically talk about is inflammatory arthritis and so you can consider this as a slightly more severe form of arthritis where in addition to the inflammation it's actually your immune system is kind of attacking your joints regardless if you have osteoarthritis or inflammatory arthritis one of the main goals is managing pain and so when it comes to pain management you're stuck with anti-inflammatories which are your advils or your naproxen of the world tylenol or opioid painkillers and sometimes steroid injections work but if you have multiple joints it's hard to inject steroids all over the body nonetheless cannabinoids have become extremely popular and the arthritis society here in Canada they mentioned that almost one in two of their members reports using cannabis for arthritis it's typically osteoarthritis that patients are using cannabis for but what we're seeing in the clinic is that this is a huge burden to society and a huge number of referrals coming in come for arthritis a lot of the patients will use high CBDs typically and what they become back and report is that their joints feel a little bit more fluid they're having a reduction in the nation and they feel like their functioning has improved some patients will use a little bit more THC but it's usually in the evening where the pain will affect their ability to sleep so they'll use a little bit more THC and that will help them sleep and sleep is really important to managing your mental health and if you're in a chronic stress state then your pain is also going to be worse the next day we were actually the first health charity to have focused call on medical cannabis to understand what impact it has on arthritis patients but coupled with that if something is being used as a medicine we think that it should be treated as such so things like it needs to be taken in the context of a health care provider making sure that it's monitored properly but also people should have access to medical cannabis the same way they have access to their other medications so right now people actually can only obtain medical cannabis through mail order as one example which could be challenging unlike other medications you would pay tax on medical cannabis which is not something that we expect or is true for any other medication so their number of things that we think that if something is being used properly as a medicine it should be treated as such and we also know that many people who are authorized to use medical cannabis are actually taking it for arthritis so in that context we've heard a lot from arthritis patients about what medical cannabis the impact that it has on their disease most importantly we want to make sure that at the arthritis society we're trying to speak on behalf of patients and patient experiences and for something that's been authorized for almost twenty years now we hope that people can have access to medical cannabis in the way that they should but you know really emphasizing that there is so much to learn and we don't want to jump to conclusions but we want to make sure that we're paying close attention to medical cannabis and giving it the

"is used widely in textiles medicine and food but what is the difference between it and marijuana here to answer that question please welcome medical doctor and health coach dr. Elaine chin and naturopathic doctor and I mean my goodness we're hearing CBD THC we're hearing it all the time so it's nice for us to just sit down and get a definition of the difference between hemp and marijuana so I'll start with you doc what's the difference well definitely it's all confusing because you've got common names and then you've got scientific names so cannabis is a scientific name and marijuana and hemp is what we call common names okay so I think let's just leave it that because we're not doing biology 101 today okay and both of these plants or all these cannabis plants produce a combination of THC or CBD and they're the active ingredients that we get the stimulation or the relaxation effects okay so there's a difference though between the CBD and the THC and what would that difference be well one is what we call psychoactive such as the tea tea and one would say CBD is generally the one that's not addictive and is calming and you'd never get really high on that you wouldn't okay but you might from the THC you technically you do let's talk about how hemp impacts our bodies and I'm gonna throw this one to you Elizabeth great so as Elaine mentioned both the hemp and the cannabis the marijuana they all contain cannabinoids so you've got your THC and hemp it's very low less than 0.3% so there's none of the psychoactive effects your body also makes its own set of cannabinoids to bind to your brain and to different receptors in your body so they have the effect of regulating hormones and of maintaining overall body balance or homeostasis okay so if people are concerned with things like nausea inflammation chronic pain then hemp can be a really great solution that doesn't have any other psychoactive effects okay interesting so I actually I got you took a swab from me dr. Chynn just the cheek swab and it was you know it was very easy in order to give me an exam and to test me to see what the impact would be of CBD right CBD and THC okay so we got my exam results everybody and they were incredibly boring what did it say and we're being truthful here yeah I've got the right here she's boring because she's normal yeah yeah it's like cannot be normal metabolizer normal metabolizer average average and average this would have killed me in grade six what that fundamentally means is that if I gave you a dose regardless of it's a THC CBD combination or one or just the other for different reasons I would give you the normal standard dose and I would expect a normal metabolism rate and a normal effect rate of how you break down your THC or CBD okay and then we also looked at the psychoactive our anxiety side effect risk factors for you yeah you don't have it yeah and equally important you don't have the effects of a THC dependency risk factor the reason why you would administer or take part in an exam like that would be in order to see how you're going to take on and metabolize it something like CBD or th there's a lot of patients are wondering this is right for me so now we're gonna bring slides into this conversation to say if you're not sure let's look at your genetic predispositions and we also in our office measures something called neurotransmitters which are your brain chemicals okay is the impact of THC and CBD so we'll know what to give you more or less of okay do you have is there such thing as like an average dose that you would start out with if someone had average results yes so most prescribing physicians will start at the lowest dose and titrate you up just to be careful another thing worth mentioning is the the form that you take it in so if you're taking it sublingually under your tongue or in your mouth you're absorbing up to up to a hundred percent more than if you're taking it orally and you're actually ingesting or eating it the potency in eating something is vastly reduced so the four makes it each difference so what are the main benefits do you think Elizabeth like why would people turn to a CBD or a THC or hemp products yeah the main benefits are I mean all the cannabinoids have different profiles and so the product that you're getting is dependent upon the cannabinoid and also another class of molecules called terpenes upon the profile of those but the main benefits are they're anti-inflammatory they could help with sleep with mood with brain conditions those are the big ones and also gut health nausea you know cachexia or difficulty with weight loss around cancer there's all kinds of benefits and more being released as the data comes out any warnings that people should be aware of before they decide that they want to go pursue this as a you know as a remedy i would say go to a physician that prescribes cannabis rather than just go to a recreational snoring like wing it right make sure you with a doctor they know what they're doing they've done this before yeah and I understand a lot of people are saying well my family doctor is dismissing it it's only because I think they haven't got that time yet to kind of do the research do the information so but some of it is prescribing anything else we should know give it a go if traditional medical drugs aren't working for you okay good that's good information thank you for clarifying a lot of that for us both of you", "oKQGYOtTPeo": "[Music] and now for this one like the title says I'm going to be using a crock-pot I'm going to do maybe a cup maybe a little more of the coconut oil and a half ounce of the decarboxylated cannabis we're going to throw it in the crock-pot below and we're gonna let it sit in there for about four to five hours go ahead and strain it through the cheesecloth basic simple straightforward take that half ounce of flour throw it in the oven 240 degrees for 40 minutes grab a smoke if you'd like forty minutes later that should be looking a nice golden-brown perfect just about ready let's go ahead and turn our crock-pot on to low using organic unrefined coconut oil eight ounces add the half ounce of the decarboxylated cannabis stir and cover leave on low for 3 to 5 hours I did four hours stir occasionally double layer the cheesecloth for a finer strain squeeze or press it to make sure you get all that oil out infusion complete overall in terms of the process I'm liking this method the best it's nice you don't have to worry about keeping an eye on the flame if you have a gas stove top like me even an electric range you still got to keep an eye because it might get too hot and you don't want to burn anything that ease of the crock-pot I am feeling and I'm excited to use this coconut oil and some nice gummies you know I love doing it in a smoothie I'll do a video about that even though it's really simple just to show you how I do it let your imagination run wild throw

and welcome to wustream bringing willamette to you for today's presentation dr daniel nicolai will discuss the effects of marijuana on the brain dr nikolai was born and raised in oregonian he completed his general psychiatry residency at oregon health and science university and then went on to become a child and adolescent psychiatry fellow at the university of colorado denver before returning home training in those two states we can only imagine how many of his patients used marijuana in fact seeing so much marijuana use in his clinical practice is what sparked his interest in the effect that this drug has on the brain he has given several talks on the subject at community health centers advocacy groups schools and he even testified before a colorado congressional committee on marijuana legislation he just completed his training in forensic psychiatry at ohsu last summer and has elected to continue working there as a member of the faculty thanks for joining us today dr nikolai i'll turn the presentation over to you hi thanks for that introduction and i'm very excited to be here with you all to talk about a subject that i find fascinating and that's you know cannabis and it's in fact its effect on the brain and i have a lot of material to get through so i'm going to dive right in to go yep there goes so i have no financial disclosures to make no conflicts of interest i would like to mention though i i do work at ohsu as a faculty member but i'm not here representing oregon health and science university i'm here talking about my own research my own interests and my own expertise not representing my institution so here's what we're going to talk about today i'm going to talk a little bit about how marijuana is researched or how it's not researched and how other drugs are researched we're going to talk about the epidemiology of marijuana mainly who's using it and how much we're going to explore how marijuana consumption has evolved it's changed a lot over the past few decades we're gonna look at of course the name of the talk how cannabis and marijuana affect the developing brain at key areas of development and then we'll talk about some of the evidence-based uses for medical cannabis what we do with it and what the research shows it can and cannot do so how is marijuana researched so this is not how marijuana is researched this is how a typical pharmaceutical drug is researched and brought to market there's four phases of clinical trials that a medication has to go through to become fda approved and stay fda approved so before a drug even enters these phases uh you have to do you know kind of design the drug test it on animals kind of get your best sense of if it's working if it's safe and then you move on to phase one and that's where you take a handful of volunteers that are young and healthy you give them small amounts of the drug and you watch them 24 hours a day and make sure that it's safe and you're only looking for safety at this point is the drug safe so most of the time in fact the drugs are safe 70 past this test then you go on to phase two and this is where we start kind of giving more doses of the medication of the drug to you know research subjects human research subjects volunteers and now we're looking you know is it efficacious does this drug work you know if it's supposed to lower the blood pressure does it actually lower the blood pressure and this is a tougher task to pass right only about one third make it through both phase um one and phase two so most drugs don't make it past phase two if you make it past phase two and do pretty well you go on to phase three and drug companies are reluctant to go to this phase because it costs a lot of money you know it costs about a billion dollars to bring a drug to market and a lot of it is in phase three this is where you do huge studies thousands of human subjects usually multiple sites all over the country often all over the world they take years to complete we when you hear you know that a drug works in 30 minutes or less or something like that that's based on this research once they pass phase three and show that it's effective and it's safe they can request approval approval from the fda and start you know prescribe doctors can start prescribing it to the masses and they can start advertising it and such however the drug companies aren't out of the woods yet there's phase four clinical trials where they have to um make sure it's safe for side effects sometimes they have to add additional warnings and investigate you know potential side effects that the medication is causing and then um sometimes a drug gets pulled from the market altogether because they find out it's not safe after the fact so drugs go through a lot of tests and a lot of research before they're brought to market now for marijuana we haven't done any of that and the reason for that is on this slide so medications if they have a potential for abuse or addiction they get classified by the drug enforcement agency so they get placed on a schedule so you see schedule one medications are illegal to prescribe right because they have no medicinal qualities and a lot of potential for abuse independence so drugs in this category heroin lsd this is acid ecstasy kod and you see marijuana right there you go down to schedule two and these are pretty tightly controlled um so these are like you know the big pain pills like oxycontin vicodin the stimulants like adderall and ritalin and i thought this was interesting methamphetamine is a schedule two medication so i cannot prescribe marijuana but i can prescribe methamphetamine and the first time i gave this talk i went ahead and looked this up like gosh is that on the formula can i prescribe methamphetamine that is so bizarre and here it is right now so kids six or older with adhd a very common diagnosis can't be prescribed methamphetamine legally i doubt any drug companies actually make this drug i've never seen it prescribed and even simple obesity if you're 12 years or older you can be prescribed methamphetamine can you imagine taking your maybe husky 12 year old into the doctor who's having trouble focusing and he's like oh he's overweight and has adhd let's get that kid some meth it's um a bizarre thing how some of these medications are scheduled through the dea all right on to epidemiology um and of course uh if you guys can guess who this is i played with the effects to make it a little bit tough but i think a lot of you can probably still see that this is barack obama allegedly it wasn't photoshopped so i'm going to talk about who uses marijuana and how much i'm going to start with some national data there's two kind of big national surveys they do this is from the 2018 national survey by samsa which is um the big government agency that funds substance abuse and mental health uh resources so i'm gonna go through a lot of charts a lot of figures i really just want to drive home the highlights and so this slide you know people aged 12 or older a lot of them use marijuana right 43.5 million people which is about 16 of the population and of course this is a national survey so it considers you know marijuana an illegal drug and marijuana dwarfs use of any other illegal drug by far as you can see all right and how many have used in the past year and what age grew so this is people aged uh 12 and older and you see they break it down the blue line here is 18 to 25 year olds and you will see that as a theme that 18 to 25 year olds are the most or the group that uses marijuana the most and if you look here kids age 12 to 17 is the gray line that is quite similar to just adults 26 and older the yellow line so kids and adults outside that 18 to 25 year old range are using marijuana at about the same rate so this is pastor marijuana initiates so who what age are people starting marijuana or trying it for the first time and this is probably one slide where it's not the 18 to 25 year olds it's the 12 17 year olds it's the teenagers and even kids are a little bit younger is when most people start marijuana it's kind of starting to collapse here a little but still it's mostly the 12 to 17 year olds so and now i'm going to talk about another trend which is that people aren't perceiving marijuana as um as dangerous so they kind of surveyed you know do you think this is you know a harmful thing to do smoke marijuana on a weekly basis that's the red line you can see most people said no and this is um for youth this is age 12 to 17 about 40 percent of people thought that marijuana uh smoking marijuana weekly was a bad thing to do um and you can see other drugs are higher cocaine heroin you know frequent alcohol and cigarette use you go to adults age 18 to 25 and you see this line gets cut in half so about half as many people age 18 to 25 see smoking marijuana as a problem compared to those that are younger i'll flip it back so 12 to 17 year olds about 40 that red line there and then about 20 or less for 18 to 25 year olds and this is people who have developed marijuana use disorder so that's you know there's 11 criteria to get diagnosed with the substance use disorder it's things like spending too much money on marijuana spending too much time trying to get it it causes you problems in your life but you still keep doing it etc etc you build up a tolerance you suffer withdrawal when you stop using it suddenly um and you can see again 18 to 25 year olds um about six percent of them marijuana use disorder all right it wouldn't be a bunch of charts and graphs without a good old venn diagram so you see the big blue circle here these are youths age 12 17 who had a major depressive episode so lots of youth have major depressive episodes for lots of reasons why the blue dot is the big one the yellow circle here is youths who had a substance use disorder and this isn't specific to marijuana um but this is kind of the data that was available and you can see a big chunk of this yellow circle has had a major depressive episode right 40 of it so if i have a kid comes in who you know uses marijuana heavy to the point where it's a problem that's a substance use disorder and he's at high risk he or she's at high risk of having a major depressive episode there's a big overlap there all right and these graphs kind of get confusing but so this is age 12-17 and you can see you know about 32 percent of youths had a major depressive episode and you know used illicit drugs about 14 of youths did not have a major depressive episode but use drugs and you can see kind of with all these substance use most of them have had major depressive episodes so people who use drugs tend to have major depressive episodes um you know in this age group and this trend is true also for adults age 18 or older right the red one here is no mental illness the dark blue one is any mental illness and then the biggest one in about every group is serious mental illness so adults with serious mental illnesses to use marijuana at higher rates and this is where i get in my soapbox and talk about the need for better substance use treatment right about 15 of 18 to 25 year olds need substance to use treatment again this is not specific to marijuana it's a substance use in general and here's the people who actually enroll in substance use treatment right 2 so we need 15 and we have two percent so people don't have access to treatment it's it's very unfortunate all right let's switch over to data from good old state of oregon so this is you know the olcc oregon liquor commission tracks how much revenue is brought in by um the cannabis dispensaries and um so you can see this is you know sold per month so about 60 million dollars we've grown um 60 million dollars per month of sales and you can see it's just skyrocketed over the years and even more so if you're looking at units sold this is the cost of marijuana over time so we're making more and more money and selling it cheaper in the industry um right the price is cut in half and this is for a usable marijuana which is kind of the dried flour that you smoke the bud essentially all right so daily marijuana use in teens and this is a dif this is national data again and this is from a different you know kind of survey they do every year called the monitoring the future survey so you can see eighth graders that went from point seven to one point three percent almost doubled in the course of one year and that's you know daily use not kids have used at all but eighth graders who are using marijuana on a daily basis tenth graders that also took a pretty significant jump to almost 5 in 2019 now if you look at daily use of marijuana people are using it more than they ever have before so back in the 1990s a typical kind of like pothead or stoner would smoke a joint on saturday and sunday and that was um you know what we'd consider a pothead back then and marijuana back then it's laughable now it was about four percent thc and that was pretty strong stuff back then it tend to average more around two or three percent um so you know you have a couple joints saturday and sunday that comes out to about 4.6 milligrams of thc consumed you know on a daily basis on you know up for a seven day week now this is data a few years old in the state of washington the typically daily user smokes are consumed marijuana multiple times per day and average thc is about 20 i imagine it's it's higher now especially for daily users i'll have some slides to show on that later and so that was about 1.3 grams per day of 20 thc was the statistic a few years ago so that comes out to about 260 milligrams of thc consumed each and every day so went from 4.6 daily back in the 90s to now or even a couple years ago 260 milligrams so i'll do the math for you that's an increase of about 60 fold so to put that in other terms if you think of caffeine you know caffeine is not harmful in small amounts you have a cup of coffee every day there's even some research that shows that people who do that live a little bit longer than people who don't drink coffee um right so that's about 150 milligrams of caffeine per day is a vendi cappuccino at starbucks you increase that by 60 fold that's 9 000 milligrams of caffeine if you just said hey i'm gonna alter concentrated stuff i'm gonna take this more right it's natural no harm um that's a lethal dose of caffeine that's enough drug to kill you so when people say marijuana it's been around for years it's natural that's not necessarily true right it's highly genetically modified it's way more potent than it's ever been it's not organic it's they use pesticides um which is you know the biggest infraction that companies get is for misuse of pesticides or not using them correctly um yeah and if you did the same thing with caffeine that would kill you so we don't really know what this high amount of frequent use of thc does to the brain and so this is kind of a confusing slide this is each line is a different study here so just look at the black one that's the average and this shows the trend that people who use more days per year so those that use every day use more each day right so if you just smoke every once in a while maybe just socially you might just take a couple puffs if you're smoking every day you're often smoking high potency stuff eating it dabbing it whatever doing a lot of it each day so these are the people where the research shows we have some reason for concern that if you're using a lot and you're consuming it every day um your brain can be in trouble and this is the trend that we're seeing more and more people do right marijuana is okay to use it's not harmful so i'm going to use it all day every day and here's kind of that same line they did some fancy math to make a nice smooth line based on their data and you see it's up to 1.75 grams per day the the statistic i gave you on the slide was 1.3 grams per day right and so many people use much much more than that right and then of course vaping is just exploding right this is monthly marijuana vaping you see that almost doubled among high school seniors um in the last year and of course the cigarette companies have not changed uh their ads right here's an old cigarette ad and here's a new um julian or vaping ad and just a little bit on my high horse about vaping that's really exploded we were kind of winning the war on tobacco for many years um teenagers were smoking less and less the rates were going down until vaping and flavor vaping came out and it's just exploded right so you know about 20 to 25 of high school students at various ages um had vaped in the last month according to this survey all right so really the main takeaways i want you guys to get from all those charts and graphs i spent all that time was is that people are using cannabis and marijuana more frequently than ever before they're using formulations that are more powerful and more potent than ever before and they're starting to use it at younger and younger ages right often 12 to 17 which is of concern for me right because i'm a child and analyst and psychiatrist so i talk to kids about this [Music] a lot so what exactly is marijuana so the marijuana plant is down here on the bottom left there are two species of the marijuana there's cannabis sativa and cannabis indica and so the indica is supposed to be the chill one that helps you stay calm they say indica keeps you in the couch and sativa is a more stimulating strain is what people report so the most common way to consume marijuana is to kind of take the leaves you dry them up roll them up and you put this and you smoke it with a flame and a joint this here is called hashish this comes from the middle of the plant and they used to throw this part away because you couldn't really dry it out and smoke it all that well and then they figured out hey there's tons of psychoactive compound in there let's kind of make it into clay make it into oil make it into all these other formulations of it so we're using the whole plant now this up here on the top left is a hemp plant so hemp it's a different species of plant it also contains cbd and thc and there is a law that you can sell hemp products uh as long as they have less than one percent thc in them so when you go to the grocery store and just see there's cbd or even a doggy daycare we used to take my dog sold cbd products those are hemp derived there is kind of a loophole on the law where they can sell cbd derived from hemp without any kind of restrictions like you'd see in the dispensary the cbdc dispensary comes from the marijuana plants all right so how can you do it well you can smoke it in a vape pen you can smoke it in a joint a bong this is what it looks like this was the strongest strain at the dispensary i went to a few years ago when i took pictures about two three years ago you can eat it right and these look delicious i took pictures of the ones that looked the most delicious to me especially the s'mores i'm a sucker for s'mores dark colored cherry always good throw some cbd in there and of course the peanut butter buddha with the fun little cartoon guy here and then something that really took me back to my childhood was the pop rocks right let's throw some marijuana in them and call them pop rocks it is interesting to note that there are a lot of laws that have been passed uh in states that have legalized cannabis that you can't have packaging that's appealing to children right so in my mind all this has to go even the pot rocks right pot roxy you know it's the rocks with an x there's an exclamation point it's brightly colored i mean how are you going to make and package candy that's not appealing to kids it's pretty much impossible and since marijuana has been legalized and edibles have been popular there are more and more reports of kids small kids like ages two three four coming to the emergency department um with cannabis intoxication um that require emergent treatment all right you go and eat it you can drink it put a little pep in your coffee this is a little five hour energy type drink the cocktails look great especially this bloody mary here with the bacon and everything you can put it topically directly on your skin here's tinctures here's kind of a coconut oil infused lotion type thing patches you can put on your skin and then of course there are the concentrated oils and this is a formulation i really want to spend some time talking about this is the most potent and the strongest way to consume cannabis this is called dabbing this is a dab rig and the bud tender told me when i went to visit the dispensary what you do is you take a grain of a drop of the concentrated oil this is about 100 this is pretty much pure thc you take a little drop of that oil or they happen in waxes and other formulations you put it here on the rig heat it up and you smoke it in out the other side i'll show you a little video and one little drop the grain of the rice is more powerful than a joint it it will get you very intoxicated so you can imagine people that haven't done it before or just pour a little bit too much maybe the size of two grains of rice maybe they don't know what kind of rice the butter was talking about and they can get you know very very intoxicated and even psychotic where they lose touch with reality they get paranoid there were some high-profile cases in colorado um when it first became legalized where people kind of consumed too much cannabis and a kid um became psychotic lost touch with reality thought that like aliens were out to get him or something and he jumped off a bridge and died so there is potential harm especially um when you're consuming or dabbing as they call it right so ask your kids indeed and i work with kids and i ask them kind of every time they come this is dad use marijuana if you use some marijuana how much do you use and do you dab do you eat you know and most kids or dabbing these days that i talked to that used marijuana or at least tried it and it it really messes it can really mess you up here's the advertisement for one of the ones at the dispensary i went to so concentrated one little jar can smell like you're in a whole room full of your favorite strain this is for everyone who can't get enough of their favorite strain a concentrate with all the aroma all the flavor and all the effects only far more powerful and they are not false advertising there this is powerful powerful stuff and of course it's getting more and more popular again we're back to data from our good old state of oregon this was somewhere in california are in colorado and washington data and i imagine california too so this again is revenue by thousands of dollars and the different types so the most popular is the usable marijuana flower which is kind of like the dried bud that people smoke that's where dispensaries get most of their money but again look at what has towered into second to clear second place is the concentrates the extracts the dabbing the oils the waxes that are you know oftentimes 100 um thc or close to that and then you can see the edible tinctures here not terribly picking up steam or making that much money and then this nice orange line which is other and i know you guys are wondering dr nikolai what what is other what does that other line mean well let's talk about that so if you're not into any of the other formulations that i've shown you so far they have suppositories these can be placed in the rectum or in the vagina and the blood tender told me that people use these maybe if they have rectal or vaginal cancer and they want to get some marijuana or cbd right to the site of injury and this is a marijuana-soaked tampon for anyone who might be interested in consuming thc that way so i was like man people really love marijuana especially in colorado when i did my training there this was a small mountain town right i had no idea where the next gas station was but i knew dang sure where the closest dispensary was and it was about 100 miles away from this one and also so when kovid uh the governor of colorado issued the shelter-in-place orders for covet a few months ago people flocked to the dispensaries um right big lines no one was wearing masks right you couldn't get them yet businesses weren't set up to socially distance and so they were really worried that people were gonna you know spread covid like this so of course the governor announced immediately okay dispensaries you're an essential business you can stay open people don't need to flock to them right away and then if that's not proof enough that people love cannabis here is a personal lubricant infused with thc so for people that love marijuana so much they want to have sex with it it turns out there's a way to do that and that people are doing it because this is a product for sale all right let's talk about what cannabis does to the brain so there's you know about 100 different cannabinoid compounds or chemicals in the marijuana plant and then hundreds of other chemicals that they've isolated you know around 400 or so it seems like more and more each year and so here's kind of a breakdown of some of the different ones and kind of what we think they do and what might be therapeutic and it is important to note that your brain does have natural endogenous cannabinoids so endogenous is just a fancy word for hormones so kind of as a hormone in your brain there are cannabinoids that bind to the same receptors as thc the plant form of thc and your brain has cannabinoid binding sites throughout it and it's interesting you know a few decades ago we didn't even know this existed in the brain so all the little yellow dots are where um binding sites where thc uh combined or the you know the natural hormone cannabinoids can bind and you can see it affects things like the pleasure reward pathway which is you know highly correlated with addiction it can affect memory coordination i mean pretty much everything in the brain except for vision right your vision kind of stays the same judgment right lots of stuff so your brain is made up of a bunch of neurons so this neurons is how your brain kind of sends signals from one area to the next and this is kind of what they look like obviously they're much smaller than this so signals come from over here i'm assuming you guys can see the mouse i'm hoping that they come from the yellow end they go down the sheath and it's kind of like traveling through a wire in your house so they're they're insulated right so if you had a wire in your house that wasn't insulated it was just a metal wire and you were trying to light a light bulb that wouldn't be very efficient you would lose a lot of energy in heat um and right you can even start a fire or something like that it's just not an efficient way so the neurons in your body need to be insulated they need this insulation to send signals and information um you know so you can move your arm and have a thought that sort of thing from one area of the brain to the next and so it sends it from one to the other neurons and you know the message you know gets propagated and expanded and right each of these neurons send it to 100 more and do 100 more etc so this is kind of what one zoomed in looks like it goes from this end sends the information along this long myelin sheath to the other end and these are kind of fat pads that insulated the schwann cells so um let's talk about thc and cbd so thc is the more psychoactive compound cbd is less psychoactive you will hear people most of the time including physicians say that cbd is not psychoactive that is a misnomer cbd it works on the brain right that's why people take it because they want an effect on the brain drugs and medications that work on the brain are psychoactive it is much less psychoactive than thc but it is still psychoactive thc binds directly to those cannabinoid receptors right little yellow dots on the brain that i showed you a few minutes ago cbd does not bind to those and that is very confusing right a compound called cannabidiol does not bind to the cannabinoid receptors i think sometimes they make this information so hard and confusing so they can charge a lot of money for medical school so cbd has several effects on the brain and there's lots of theories to how it works but it does work on the brain and here are kind of some of the things we're figuring out it does works on serotonin receptors in the brain glycine receptors um fatty acid receptors um it works as a potent antioxidant which i'll talk about a little bit later so we're kind of learning about cbd and figuring out how it works in the brain it's not a direct binder to the site but it works indirectly to increase how your brain uses the natural hormone cannabinoids that are there so when we research cbd in animals here's what we're finding some promise or what we kind of hope it will do so in mice you can order medical mice uh from the store you can call them say hey i want you know 100 mice with anxiety and 100 mice without they can send them to your lab they're all genetically identical and you can experiment on them give them cannabis or other drugs so in rats it seems in mice it seems to um reduce anxiety maybe it reduces some depression-like behaviors um enhances social behaviors which we're hoping to translate to autism and then you know reduce some addictive potential and again this is in mice and so there's a lot of research that we do in mice and then try to do it on humans and we don't get the same effects right only a third of drug trials make it past um one and two right phases one and two so this is a slide i always show and usually there's a doctor in the crowd or something like this but if you can think of a medication any medication that has a lot of uses you know kind of like the pepto-bismol commercial where it's like bobbing upset stomach diarrhea i'm right there's three indications right there um one i think about a lot of is prozac or fluoxetine which um you know depression obsessive compulsive disorder generalized anxiety disorder panic attacks aggression and autism um you know so you probably think about six seven eight uses for it and that's a lot for medication so you can do eight different things if we look at marijuana it has a vast number of indications that um states have legalized it for medically right so this is just a state of organ you can use medical marijuana for cancer glaucoma uh neurological conditions hiv um any condition that causes cachexia which is like wasting syndrome you're you're not eating you're losing weight that sort of thing wasting away severe pain severe nausea seizures and muscle spasms like those seen in multiple sclerosis and then also post-traumatic stress disorder which many states have legalized the use of cannabis for then if you look you know throughout the us i mean the indications are growing more and more and some of them i'm not even sure how they could have an effect right like pancreatitis parkinson's disease alzheimer's disease anorexia i mean it's really turning into a drug that can cure all our all ales even though there's not really research into most of these conditions certainly not the level of research that would be required for any other medication so if we look at you know where there is some research to treat um things from marijuana or marijuana derivatives um there is actually some good uses right so there are some medications that treat nausea that are you know synthetic analogs of thc so they took the compound thc they made a similar compound and bang got it fda approved and it's actually been approved for a while for decades and it it kind of works for nausea and appetite stimulant and that is approved by the fda in um in the united states so for specificity and pain like seen in ms this there's a thc analog that's not available in the us but about 17 other countries including some european ones where they use a synthetic thc uh to treat chronic pain and then recently um they take cbd and pharmaceutical companies purify it and make pharmaceutical grade cbd pills that can use to be treat seizures and that is fda approved in the united states there's some promising research right like cbd looks like it has some anti-inflammatory antioxidant effects that can be beneficial looks like it in certain types of tumors it could have a nice impact and you know some evidence that can be helpful for the symptoms and problems that cause glaucoma and you see i'm a psychiatrist so i live over here in the you know this realm here where there's really not good research showing that cannabis helps these conditions long term what we tend to see is that people in the short term you know they start doing cannabis oh it helps my ptsd and they say that for a couple months if we follow them out however like a year later they're not really any significantly better and a lot of the times they're worse and people that don't turn to cannabis or rely on cannabis as a medication for these psychiatric problems are better off than those who don't and again that's observational research it's not as good as we hope but that's that's the correlation that we see that's the connection that we see and here are just the names of some of the synthetic thcs um right epiduolex is the new cbd that's available i'll just fly through that in the interest of time and here's a little video about a family's experience with medical marijuana that i want to show all right um so yeah there are a lot of people who are very passionate about marijuana and cannabis and or um you know really tell your story this is really life-changing for me most of the cases i've come across that it hasn't had much of an effect a lot of parents get desperate they try cbd oils and they don't really see much improvement and then of course there's these kind of handful of cases that i see mostly in the media um where it's been life-changing and so this is some researchers i met with when i was preparing first time i gave this talk at the university of colorado denver where i did some of my training and they were researching kind of just what we saw there does the not the pharmaceutical grade cannabidiol but the the cannabidiol oils um that you can get at the dispensaries does that help you know reduce seizures and what they were finding was that yes parents would report yes my kids having less seizures since i started taking these oils from the dispensary however when they hook the kids up to the eeg monitors where they put you know all the chords on the brain and measure the brainwave activity and the kids were having the same number of seizures as before they started the um the cannabinoid oils so uh kind of the research hasn't shown that the oils you get from the dispensary are helpful however you get you know parents it's 85 it's life-changing we need to continue it so it's really important to kind of take it case by case especially because there's a lack of good research we don't have big studies on this all right so there's two times in our lives where our brain is really susceptible to marijuana one is when we're developing in the uterus of our mother and the other time is adolescence so i'm going to start with kind of in utero development when you know we're developing fetus so this again is animal research but phonatal is kind of the rat term for prenatal so before you're born you're developing your mom's stomach and this axis here is um how many uh cannabinoid receptors you have in the brain so you can see the two structures here the copis colossum and the fornix have a lot of cbd cb1 binding sites in utero and then those go down over time and then the cerebellum and hippocampus and the teenage years have a lot of binding sites so your brain has the most binding sites for cannabis the prenatal period and the teenage period so you know there's different views on this you'll see in the media this is the stoner mom she has a fairly popular blog she calls herself the booboo kissing classroom volunteering primrose stoned supermom sent it next to you at school pickup and here was um one of her posts about pot and the breastfeeding mom here's a familiar refrain studies on marijuana using mothers and their breast-fed babies are few and far between like pot and pregnancy there are some things people just don't want to touch perhaps decriminalization would have an impact on the availability of studies and we could ditch the archaic anti-reagan bullshit of the 1980s and move into the future or not whatever breastfeeding i'm a fan without totally outing myself i will say that i am somewhat of a closeted hippie so kind of her take on it and is true that there's not really research showing that breast feeding your baby um while smoking marijuana is harmful for the baby but that study also doesn't exist and you can imagine that study will never exist in high quality research because no parent is going to say oh here take my baby give it some cannabis which we do know it enters the breast milk and you know can get into the baby's brain and just tell me if it's good or bad uh you know no ethics committee is going to approve that study it's never going to happen so the labeling and warnings we see on marijuana in the state of oregon right you know you have to be 21 don't let children do it don't operate you know machinery doesn't say anything about pregnant or nursing mothers that should be advised stay away from it alcohol right pregnant women don't do it can cause birth defects tobacco right they have to put this label fetal injury premature birth and low birth weight marijuana has no such label like that in the state of oregon this is the position statement of the american college of obstetrics and gynecologists you know pregnancy doctors ob gyn and you know they kind of say we don't have the data so we say stop using marijuana while you're pregnant and i will say in medical school i was shocked this is the area of medicine that is probably the most conservative any risk that may be over zero percent to an unborn child is unacceptable in this country and this area of medicine right like i've seen don't do hot yoga even though you know there's not really research shane is harmful i've seen doctors recommend you know don't eat sushi don't eat soft cheeses don't eat sandwich meats you know don't jump on a trampoline i mean being pregnant is just a giant list of things not to do because there may be a fraction of a percent chance that it could be harmful to the baby and it's hard to i'm a psychiatrist right it's hard to inspire behavioral change in anyone except when they're pregnant people comply people will do anything you tell them and to say that marijuana which you know there is some research showing that it may be harmful to young infants and pregnant women um and people are kind of ignoring that or saying the research isn't good enough or just um kind of even thinking it's helpful or can be used as medicine during pregnancy or for children it's it it makes me nervous so from research on animal studies uh we know that you know when we give the mother um thc about 10 of it gets into the fetal um you know the blood of the fetus of the developing baby and we know that the endocannabinoid system right that's a natural system in your brain that has receptors and you have hormones that bind to those sites like we talked about earlier those start developing about 16 to 22 days after conception which is about the time um you find out you're pregnant if you're actively tracking if it's a boobs baby which about half of babies are you probably wouldn't even notice that and this kind of fancy terms is pretty much the brain and central nervous system which are developing and have binding sites already for cannabinoid which can be altered by um you know thc and non-natural or non you know brain um cannabinoids that are different than um the ones that your brain naturally makes so from the plant not from within the brain itself so the research on humans of course is flawed one it's illegal to research cannabis because it's a federal crime so we can't get federal money for it and hospitals can lose their federal funding if they research it and when we just look at observational data and kind of see what people are doing you know there's difference in socioeconomic status how much money people make how educated they are you know all the million other things going on in people's lives that we have to try to control for which is difficult in research like this but kind of what we what some correlations we are finding is that you know if if pregnant women use marijuana their kids will have uh more likely to have lower processing speeds and that's kind of a majority part of the measure of iq where it's exactly what it sounds like how quickly you can process information and also lower visual problem solving which is um kind of problem solving anything other than numbers and letters so doing puzzles reading a map um that sort of thing and when we looked at a big meta analysis meta-analysis means um they pool a bunch of other studies together the data to kind of have like one giant pool of information and draw conclusions from that that you know infants that were exposed to cannabis uh in the uterus you know have lower birth weight they were more likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and a higher stillbirth rate right but or in the state of oregon we don't see these warnings on the label and you know i have another slider move but pregnant women are using this more and more you know using cannabis for um like morning sickness and nausea and stuff during pregnancy because they again there's not a lot of research or warning labels and because of the lack of information a lot of people see it as safe all right so let's move on to adolescents teenagers um population that i work with a lot so the brain develops until about the age of 25 and that's kind of the number we've called it for most people that's about the the adult rain i mean the brain develops throughout your life but about 25 you have pretty much an adult brain so as it's developing through those teenage years it's very important to take good care of it what's going on during maturation is what we call pruning and this is a term we stole from gardeners so you can see if i was pruning this little plant here i would cut off cut it here and cut it here because i want the plant to grow up and grow tall so all the nutrients all the energy i want to it to go into making a nice tall plant i don't want these little side things so your brain your neurons do the same thing they make these pathways and when you're you know about 12 to 13 when you're in middle school your brain has more neurons than it ever will and it starts kind of cutting them away it starts pruning right if you if you're kind of learning a second language and doing a lot of you know so you're you speak english and you're trying to learn spanish too those pathways were developed during those years and spanish will probably be your best language other than your primary language throughout your life right if you try to learn a second language at the age of 50 it's going to be a lot harder because that language center in your brain has pruned and the connections have been made and to go back and change that later the brain can do it the brain is pretty amazing but it is much more difficult and with modern technology we can actually see these pathways in the brain which is very exciting this is kind of the new area of research in the brain we used to just look at the structures and kind of measure how big they were and maybe we could see how much blood flow they got which wasn't all that exciting but now we can see these strands and how different parts of the brains are connected and how it sends information from one structure to another right it travels along axons like we talked about earlier and this is kind of like the superhighway of the brain how information is transferred here's a study they did um when i looked at kind of people who started using in their teenage years heavy amounts of cannabis on a regular basis versus people who didn't use cannabis at all so this top one here is people who didn't use cannabis at all and you can see kind of like if you're thinking of this as like a wire nice tight connection can signal and send information efficiently and quickly nice um it's a nice looking connection there if you look down here with the heavy marijuana users it doesn't myelinate it doesn't insulate kind of the the neurons well so it's kind of like a frayed cord here where it doesn't send the information as quickly between these two parts of the brain so kind of with this imaging we can kind of see what it's doing in the brain and the result of that um you know one of the things we we think we know right the research isn't great but that it has an impact on cognition or iq intelligence quotient so this was kind of a neat study that started way back in the 70s um i started with a thousand people and you can see um the total of these numbers is how many participants they left with at the end it was only about 60 so most people dropped out or were lost to follow up which happens a lot with substance use research but you can see the most profound effect here um was the side of the graph so this side is um people that started using marijuana in adolescence and we're still frequently using through the age of 35 right here's their iq as a child and their iq is an adult so it dropped about eight points which is a big drop in iq iq you can see the average here is about 100 um for the average adult and the standard deviation is 15. so you're going to 85 and then when you go down to 70 that's the cutoff for intellectual disability which used to be called a mental retardation so a drop of eight points is you know over half the standard deviations that's a big drop in iq um you can see people who started as kids but kind of gave it up you know maybe had a drop when these lines overlap we can't really stay with confidence that this change is statistically significant um and you see people that wait until adult to smoke marijuana wasn't much of a change um one way or the other so really the people that i worry about are you know they start as kids just teenagers and they smoke a lot throughout adolescence and there's other reasons to be concerned too so right so this is you know people who use cannabis often before they turn age 30 i'm sorry before they turn 17 what do they look like later when they become 30 years old you know they're more likely to suffer from addiction to cannabis right so as we go from left to right these are people that use more and more cannabis so less than monthly monthly or more weekly or more and then daily so daily users are the most likely to be dependent on it again that's not surprising um those that are more likely to use other illegal drugs right and then those that are likely to attempt suicide these are people i see a lot in psychiatric hospitals you know less likely to complete high school less likely to get a degree interestingly in this study there wasn't an increase in depression although other studies do show that correlation and a little bit more likely to be on welfare now your risk of getting cannabis associated psychosis and remember i said psychosis is losing the brain losing touch with reality so you're really paranoid you're worried like aliens are out to get you you're hearing voices that aren't real they're telling you to do things uh kind of losing touch with reality and so you know the more times you've used cannabis the more likely you are to get a psychotic episode um from cannabis intoxication right like once the number hits over 50 it goes to you know close to 30 cases per thousand you know almost doubles um and this is canada use cannabis use that um can lead to schizophrenia and schizophrenia is psychosis the brain loses touch with reality but it's a lifelong disease where your brain is chronically losing touch with reality and you need treatment with antipsychotics which can be nasty medications um and even then sometimes it doesn't get rid of the psychosis all the way it just kind of lowers it dampens it down so you can see um and this one i looked at a specific gene in the body right the akt1 gene and so those that didn't have the gene um you know cannabis didn't really seem to increase the risk of schizophrenia those that had one copy of the gene the same story those had two copies of the gene bang you know seven times more likely to get schizophrenia if they used um cannabis on a regular basis they use it every day so everyone's brain is different some people can smoke high levels of cannabis and it doesn't really seem to have a negative effect on their brain some people smoke it just a couple times and they really lose it and they really can't handle it especially if they dab or use one of the more potent formulations so that's important to talk about with patients that hey everyone's brain is different you might not be able to tolerate it you might most of the kids i see in the hospital as you can imagine can't tolerate it and it's kind of tough to get them to stop and here's another kind of schizophrenia-like psychosis at the age of 26 you know and these are you know did you use cannabis before the age of 18 i'm sorry before the age of 18 years old so if you use cannabis before the age of 18 you were 1.6 times more likely to develop a schizophrenia like psychosis if you started using cannabis before the age of 15 you're four and a half times more likely than the general population to develop schizophrenia like psychosis so one thing i often do is say please please please do not use cannabis for at least a couple years when i have you know 12 13 14 year olds coming into my office i talk about using marijuana if the most i can do is get them to delay it a year or a couple years or at least until they're 18. preferably 25 um i can protect their brain and really ready to make a big impact that's what i try to do um and the effect of high potency cannabis on psychosis right so skunk is um kind of just a term for um a crossbreed that is highly potent cannabis so people that smoke skunk daily right you can see those that develop cannabis 5.4 times more likely than those that have never used cannabis and even using it just on weekends right increases your risk or just even skunk at all right and the low potency ones don't really seem to have any effect at all and someone talk a little bit of research that goes the other way there's not a lot of it but this person was at the national cannabis summit that i attended and he was doing a study in new mexico where he was looking at people with that were addicted to pain pills and had chronic pain and the ones that used cannabis um reported a higher quality of life a better social life they were able to do more activity even with their chronic pain and they reported that they had better concentration um and they also tracked like how many prescriptions they refilled for their you know controlled pain meds and people who smoke cannabis didn't need you know the opiates the morphine that stuff didn't need it as often and a lot of them were even able to get off their their prescription pain killers um the ones that used cannabis so you know he kind of concluded that you know canvas might be a safer and better drug for chronic pain than a lot of the other stuff we have out there we don't have good medications for chronic pain and some of them that do tend to get used are harmful so this is a good i would love this to be a good area of study for cannabis i love better medications for that not to be totally cynical i hope that there will be um more research forthcoming this is the abcd study clever little name where there this is a couple years into the study they took 10 000 kids um you know starting at age 10 and they're going to follow them you know for a decade and they're going to do multiple scans of their brain they're going to ask them how much substances they use how much trauma they've experienced and kind of how well they're functioning and what's going on in their life and we should have a tremendous amount of data from that again we're probably about you know eight or nine years from from getting that data back but uh i'm looking forward to that hopefully come back in ten years and tell you all the stuff uh that's changed or that we've learned at that point so this is my last slide these are my take-home messages there's a growing public perception that cannabis is not harmful and you know usage is increasing animal models tell us that cannabis likely impacts the developing brain during the fetal and adolescent times human research on you know how cannabis affects the brain structure it's flawed um but kind of some of the preliminary stuff is showing that there is cause for concern especially in people who use large amounts starting at a young age and use it frequently um you know there is some good research and studies and even indications for marijuana and seizures chronic pain um not so much research for like ptsd and other psychiatric disorders even though that's you know some of the most common uses for it and there's just a lot of federal barriers they talked about reclassifying the dea classification for cannabis a few years ago and moving it from schedule one to schedule two so that we could research it but that was shot down and i'm not really sure why i don't think anybody really understands why you know cannabis is schedule one and methamphetamine is scheduled to it doesn't make sense to me all right and now i can open it up for questions all right thank you so much dr nikolai for that presentation um we do have a couple questions to start off with um you mentioned that there's you know you gave a lot of data obviously in a short period of time um but you also did sprinkle in some anecdotal observations that you've made um along the way are there any other kind of general kind of overview themes that you might share in terms of you know when you're when you're uh themes you're seeing or the kinds of conversations you're having with your patients um and and maybe you know kind of their general situations or or reactions to you to the conversations you're having with them yeah so there is a lot of variability i mean sometimes there's people that come into my office and say you know i smoke marijuana i do it all the time it really helps when i stop smoking it and before i smoked it i wasn't happy and i am now and i'm doing fine and i'm you know okay that's you and that's your experience and that's fine other people it seems more bizarre i had one patient that checked that came to a psychiatric hospital for feeling suicidal and he was suicidal because he ran out of money to buy marijuana he got about you know five six hundred dollars every month on disability and he spent the entire amount on marijuana because he had to get you know specific strains so that he wouldn't be suicidal so that he could be happy and he was instead of paying rent he was living as a homeless person and spending all of his income on marijuana and you know i asked him the question you know you spend all your money on marijuana and you can't pay your rent and you're homeless you know does this seem like a problem to you and he looked at me like i was crazy and said of course not i need marijuana um i don't need shelter and you know people just really love and rely on this drug and to me that sounded more like an addiction than you know something that was having a positive effect on his life and i will say that so many people use marijuana now but it's hard to tell the effects that it's having so i did um i worked at a clinic in oregon that focused on you know teenagers that were having their first episode of psychosis right are they going to develop schizophrenia this long-term thought disorder where they lose touch with reality and there were a number of cases where you know they didn't really have very many risk factors but they smoked a lot of marijuana and i will say the ones that we could get you know it seemed like their brains couldn't handle marijuana maybe they had that gene you know we weren't able to test for them um with the ones that we could get off get them on medications tend to stabilize and do well and you know the psychosis would go away and they wouldn't develop schizophrenia and the ones that you know just kept smoking and couldn't stop tended to do worse and drop out of treatment and you know be in and out of hospitals and that sort of thing um i guess the final thing i'd say is that dabbing that is a huge part you know please do not dab do not use the concentrated oils on a regular basis that is you know i've had people come in and one kid started dabbing he did it a few times his parents brought him in he was talking to the fireplace and being very odd and he had psychotic symptoms for about a year and we treated him and gave him medications and he was able to go back home and then as soon as he got back home he started using again and turned 21 had easy access to it and kind of disappeared so those are kind of three things i see a lot in my clinical practice right on and it sounds like um you know one of the things you had mentioned earlier were some of the symptoms that you see in terms of elevated depression and things like that and then based on the the answer you were just giving it sounds like some of those trends are kind of correspond with marijuana usage in terms of if if folks are using heavily or used when they were younger that those that those effects would continue but it does sound like in some cases those um you know those symptoms are reversible in some ways i mean number one it sounds like it correlates to some degree when you stop using um but then also there are there may be some other treatments um available as well so i mean i guess part of the question is is it a lost cause when someone you know has already used when they were young or are experiencing some of these depressive issues or symptoms etc yeah so i'd say um it's it's never a lost cause there are i also work at the um oregon state hospital which is where people go that have kind of long-term psychotic symptoms they're dangerous and they can't kind of function in regular society and a lot of those you know so they can be stuck in the state hospital for months or even years and you see a lot of people i mean methamphetamine is a big issue here and people that have done a lot of damage to their brain and after um even kind of sometimes it takes several months or even a year of sobriety we do see brain function come back um you know there's definitely some damage that seems to be permanent but that you know they're at least able to stay in touch with reality kind of you know live on their own be safe that sort of thing um so i'd say it's never too late even if you've had this horrible drug habit for years and years that if you get clean and somewhere your brain has this remarkable ability to recover um and marijuana obviously not doesn't seem to be as damaging to the brain as methamphetamines um one thing with marijuana it really sticks around in the system a long time it takes your body a long time to metabolize it and to get it all out of your body and so that can be tough for people because you have to go through this very long withdrawal period and a lot of cases where you're nauseous and grumpy and having vivid nightmares because you for you know weeks or even months on end because you're withdrawing from cannabis but once you get through that people that used really heavy and were struggling i do see the brain recover and they get better um you know your body repletes its pleasure hormones so that our antidepressants and other medications can be more effective um so i mean everyone's different if cannabis is a problem for you and you can stop it and say yeah it's it's never too late um but again if you can do it um don't smoke throughout your adolescence because that is tough to recover from yeah it seems like those are the two biggest takeaways right if if you don't smoke in your adolescence um and really you know obviously just avoid it in general but it sounds like there's so much development going on in the brain during adolescence and that seems to be when it has such an impact so um you know thanks for explaining that correlation i want to remind viewers while we have a time for a couple more questions if you do have questions you can scroll down with your mouse at the bottom of your zoom screen and there is a q a feature there and it looks like another question just came in actually so let me read that to you do you know anything about using cannabis to sleep i'm unable to sleep without it after using daily for a long period of time yeah so a lot of people report that cannabis kind of has this calming effect on them or can help them sleep and i think the story with cannabis is similar for sleep aids in general which is that sleep aids can be effective for short-term use so if you're kind of going if you're traveling or if you're going through a period where you're stressed and having trouble sleeping that using sleep aids for a couple months can be helpful um or if your sleep schedule is just all wonky and you can't get to sleep that kind of using sleep aids for maybe a couple months to kind of get you sleeping at night and awake during the day can be helpful when we see people just use sleep aids life long right i take a sleep aid every night that's the only way you can sleep um again it's kind of the story we see with a lot it's helpful the first couple months but then after that sleep gets worse again and then it continues to get worse and worse and then people get stuck right i'm taking a sleep aid i've been taking it for years my sleep is terrible um and i i have this habit of being stuck on the sleep aid so that's always a tough challenge too because things generally need to get worse before they get better so you have to stop the sleep aid sleep is going to get even worse but then eventually your brain chemistry will start to normalize and then we can work on proper sleep hygiene and getting you you know good restful sleep so if you're stuck on cannabis you can talk to your doctor about maybe kind of just trying a different sleep aid to get you through the withdrawal when you'll probably have lots of trouble sleeping um if that's kind of your motivation to get off it you can talk to your doctor about trying things like that all right thank you that's i think that's something that is important to remember just if it takes so long for the drug to get out of your system um you know that to have the patience to to wait until your brain is able to normalize before you would um you know then kind of try to to to move in in a different positive direction um i this is a quite this is a personal question for me because i i remember reading it in your introduction about your opportunity to testify in front of the colorado congressional committee and i was just wondering if you could tell us a little bit about that it sounds like a very interesting opportunity yeah so when i was in colorado as part of the legislative committee for the um the psychiatrist organization and the child and adolescent psychiatrist organization there and there was a bill being proposed to legalize um prescribing medical marijuana for autism for kids and adults so me and a couple other physicians testified that we didn't think it was a good idea to legalize marijuana for the treatment of autism that kind of the research wasn't there or at the very least there needed to be additional safety measures put in place um so we talked about that and as you can imagine people are very passionate about this um the dispensaries paid to fly a lot of families out that camped out at the capitol for weeks um there was probably a dozen families that testified how helpful cannabis was for their kids with autism and was life-changing kind of like the video i showed earlier i'm just with autism instead of seizures and um the bill passed through nearly unanimously uh and now autism is uh an indication for um the use of medical cannabis in colorado however our organization we did kind of get some safety measures in place but the you know the diagnosis of autism in kids needs to be confirmed by a physician and another mental health professional and that um you know there was a pediatrician as a member of congress that really wanted the pediatrician the primary care doctor to be made aware that this was going on um so they don't want to interfere with her you know the pediatrician's medications and what they were doing um so yeah it was a really interesting process to go through uh it's you know i'm on the legislative committee with the psychiatrist here and it's you know work i plan to continue excellent excellent one final question uh to to wrap us up this evening um could you talk a little bit about the future kind of where you see things going i mean there's a lot of data that you share tonight that indicates that trends are are are going up in terms of usage um a greater portion of of of kids are are trying or using marijuana regularly the the the percentage of thc is increasing um so you know where do you think we're going from here yeah so i think with recreational use it will continue to increase a little bit longer than i imagined it will plateau um you know i think there's a set of people that are going to try and experiment with drugs and you know you know but also a set of people that really don't have much interest in it um we haven't hit that plateau yet but i i imagine it's coming here in the next few years with the rates of how quickly it's growing in popularity um as it you kind of this amount of powerful and frequent use of marijuana is around longer and we have you know kind of more research and we see what it does i think that will inform us a lot um and inform you know kind of the future youth whether it's something that they can get away with whether it's something safe or whether it's something that can cause um a lot of harm like we suspect it may and then i hope medically that it gets you know rescheduled by the dea so that we can study it and have high quality research from it i think there are you know we can certainly derive pieces of the cannabis plant that seem to have therapeutic targets and can be used as medicine um and it's important for us to be able to research that and prescribe it and use it like a medicine um it's a very odd feeling for me if i want to sign a marijuana card and give it to a patient that um hey go to the dispensary and kind of figure it out there's no dose there's no formulation right i can you know hope they're taking cbd and they're getting and they're just going by and you know dabbing um you know without having to pay taxes because they have a marijuana card um another issue there is that a lot of kids i talk to you know where to get your marijuana oh my friend's 18. he has a marijuana card for anxiety or something like that and he can um buy it for me so i mean cannabis it's everywhere kids are trying it and experimenting with it my hope is that we can get the more reliable information on what it does and doesn't do i think use is gonna continue to increase it's gonna get stronger it's gonna get cheaper um and there's gonna be more and more of it at least for the next couple years well that's the kind of a mixed a mixed out look i'd say right it's it doesn't look great in the short term but some of your uh some of your predictions i really do hope they come true with the ability to do increased research and um and hopefully have the ability to prescribe in a more specific and practical way um for your for your patients well dr nikolai i want to thank you once again for for uh this presentation this evening it was it was very interesting and informative and i hope our audience enjoyed it speaking of our audience i hope that you tune in to wu stream for upcoming content that we will continue to add on a weekly basis and thanks again for joining us tonight thanks again dr nikolai thanks everyone take care [Music] you", "I1vwGRXYy3c": "welcome back to Mayo Clinic radio I'm dr. Tom chives and I'm Tracy McCray recently the US Food and Drug Administration approved a form of medical marijuana for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy and it really seems like we hear more and more about people using marijuana to treat all sorts of medical problems and to help overcome the side effects of some traditional medical treatments 30 states and the District of Columbia currently have laws legalizing medical marijuana in some form here to discuss is internal medicine specialist and addiction expert dr. John Ebert so medical marijuana legitimate for medical use so since we last spoke about this the National Academies of science came out with a report and that report essentially summarizes all the available medical literature looking at the efficacy or the effectiveness of it and the safety of medical cannabis and what they found was that it is very effective for three specific conditions and one of them is spasticity the other one is chronic pain what was that first one it's so spasticity so muscle spasms so some people that have spinal cord injuries or some people who have multiple sclerosis can have incredibly painful spasticity the muscles spontaneously spasm very painful it's like a charley horse but constantly okay right it's effective for that it's effective for nausea and it's effective for chronic pain and specifically neuropathic pain or pain that comes from a nerve so what's interesting about their findings is they didn't have a lot of data that actually supported that it was truly effective for the indication that the new drug approved by the FDA is indicated for which is which is epilepsy or these severe forms of epilepsy there is some existing data but but they didn't have a lot I think it's important for patients who are interested to are interested in exploring this as a methodology to talk to their clinicians and and and really ask the question would it seem like the the condition that I have might be effectively treated by medical cannabis and those clinicians I think need to have that information or there is if that information is available on the internet and can be searched and can be learned so that they can share that with their patients is there some science behind it you know why it works yeah so there's been lots of science in the space which has somewhat been impeded by the fact that under federal law medical cannabis is illegal so there's no research so there is there has been research okay um you can actually and there has and is ongoing research so it is possible to have approval to do research with medical cannabis so there's there's research suggesting that is effective for these conditions so why why does it work well what's interesting about so I certify patients for medical cannabis and when I speak with these patients a lot of them are interested in medical cannabis because they nothing else really seems to have worked and most of the patients that have certified have been for chronic pain they say I want to try something new and I say it might be effective for pain and one of the things that they they really struggle with as some of those preconceived notions about what it is to smoke pot you people are traditionally smoked tied in what it is to use medical cannabis very different experiences so if someone smoked their medical marijuana cigarette for non-medicinal purposes you get a hundred and four different chemicals in there states like Minnesota that we are in now have actually limited their program to two of those chemicals so of the hundred and four possible chemicals that you get when you smoke a joint if you will you only get two of them in Minnesota and those two are tetrahydrocannabinol which is the the molecule that gets people high when they smoke in cannabidiol now we think that the cannabidiol has some very interesting important therapeutic properties it doesn't work like tetrahydrocannabinol but it can actually help with pain as an inflammatory it can actually help with pain to reduce nerve transmission which is how it might be working for seizures and epilepsy that new medication approved by the FDA which I'm not sure if I can mention on the air here or not but that new medication is basically just pure CBD or cannabidiol and most of the states have that as one of the molecules that you can get when you are when you're subscribed or you're approved for medical marijuana in your state so in the state of Minnesota the use of marijuana is illegal but it is legal for medical purposes is that right so so it's a great question so under federal law it is a Schedule one anything derived from cannabis sativa which is the parent plant for cannabis sativa and cannabis indica the two main types of plants we think about as being the source for cannabis cannabis any derivative of cannabis so any extracted molecule from it or any part of the plant is illegal under federal law it's a Schedule one de a medication saying there's no approved use so basically that's where heroin lives and LSD and ecstasy they're all scheduled ones so we can't use it clinically the states have decided based on states rights issues that we as states will approve it for not only medical use but recreational use and the way they've indemnified clinicians like myself or protected them from losing their license is essentially all we do as providers and most of the states are set up this way as we as providers just certify that the patients have a qualifying condition now those qualifying conditions vary by state we have thirteen in Minnesota different states have different ones and some of them have approval for depression and anxiety we don't have depression anxiety for example so it varies by state and some states actually give their providers the opportunity to say it might be helpful for this I'm gonna prove you for this and basically the state then sub contracts with companies who sell the the product through dispensed Suri's so if i came to you and you were convinced that i had chronic pain or particularly if it was neuropathic nerve type pain and eyes and you said okay i'll give you a prescription where would I get it filled and what would it be so a good point so we would never prescribe it we can't prescribe it because no pharmacy dispenses it so I would certify you and say you have chronic pain and I would go into the the the database basically from the Minnesota it's actually run through the Department Health I've actually looked at all the states that have medical cannabis laws and most of them run them through the Department of Health one one state had through the Department of Commerce and so but most are run by the Department of Health so it's not some fly-by-night it's actually the the State Department of Health running these these these these programs so I would certify you for chronic pain and then what would happen is you would get an email saying you're certified and then at least in Minnesota two weeks later if you paid your processing fee you would get a essentially a car to go into the dispensary and you would work with the pharmacist employed by the companies contracted with the states and they would actually recommend products for you to use when we're just about out of time we are yes I know when you came in you said the one thing I need to do is unseat the myth so what myths do you want to set straight so I think there's a lot of preconceived notions among the patients that come in and they say well I don't want to smoke pot and I don't want to do these things and and the grandkids are laughing at me and these sorts of things and it's a very different experience and so I've tried to do two things I try to not use the term marijuana I try to use the term cannabis I think we need to look legitimate it as a therapy I need we we need we need more data but I would legitimize it and patients are worried about addiction there's no there's no data suggesting that it that the at least the products that we are providing in a medicinal manner or addictive there that patients will not become addicted these in fact some of these molecules that we're giving them have actually been used to treat addiction such as cannabidiol Wow well interesting right I guess we've come a long ways we have and we will continue to so you or you think truly for certain conditions marijuana well you don't call it marijuana kanata cannabis cannabis yes is is okay it seems to be effective so yes the data is clear that in some conditions medical cannabis is effective for those treatment of those conditions all right we've been talking about the use of medical marijuana with internal medicine specialists and addiction specialists doctor dr. John Ebert thanks so much for being with us dr. Hebert thanks for having me", "GcLpuOoOS8E": "[Music] it's not uncommon when people come in for them to describe to us that they've been experiencing atypical behavior acting in ways that aren't like themselves and this is not so uncommon with post-traumatic stress disorder [Music] and people with post-traumatic stress symptoms often attempt to take care of their problem on their own people drink they use substances they misuse substances as a way of coping seven to eight percent of the general population each year are affected by post-traumatic stress disorder or ptsd it manifests itself after an individual goes to a shocking stressful or for lack of a better term a traumatic experience leaving an individual in a very disturbed state the disorder can affect people of all ages and is commonly seen in military veterans victims of sexual assault or abuse and even witnesses of terror attacks and natural disasters symptoms of ptsd can begin to overcome an individual three months after the traumatic event and these include flashbacks where you relive the event over and over while even feeling the physical symptoms such as the racing heart and sweating [Music] individuals with ptsd can have difficulty falling asleep difficulty concentrating and can feel socially isolated develop extreme anxiety while also having depression within the brain the hippocampus amygdala and prefrontal cortex are the primary regions that are affected by ptsd while the neurochemicals cortisol and norepinephrine which are responsible for the stress response also tend to show increased activity in ptsd patients imagine the worst possible day of your life now imagine reliving that moment over and over and over and over again and with each passing moment the fear that it may happen again only grows greater for a lot of ptsd patients they only see one solution one effective way to cope with their problem and this leads us to substance abuse in recent years ptsd has been shown to have a link with substance use disorder in which individuals frequently use these substances to cope with their struggles but today we'll be only focusing our attention to one of these drugs cannabis or more commonly known as marijuana so what is cannabis cannabis is a psychoactive drug that can be smoked ate in an edible form and drank in liquid form the psychoactive substance within cannabis is known as thc also known as tetrohydrocannable this is a molecule that is responsible for eliciting the euphoric effects that it is known for cbd is another major component of cannabis however it is not relevant to the studies we will be examining so when canvas is ingested it causes the brain to release dopamine which is the reward chemical for our body and this is the fundamental mechanism by which cannabis affects our brain body and mental state so now we've talked about ptsd and we've talked about cannabis but how do they relate to one another we'll take a look at two studies that examine the effects of cannabis on ptsd does it help or does it hurt the symptoms in a study conducted in 2014 researchers examined 2 276 military veterans who were diagnosed with ptsd their findings were astonishing following an analysis of their symptoms they found that those military veterans that never used cannabis had the lowest level of ptsd symptoms such as depression anxiety and sleeplessness however it is interesting that those who started smoking cannabis following ptsd diagnosis saw a rise in violent behaviors in contrast those who stopped smoking marijuana also saw a decrease in certain ptsd symptoms [Music] in a more recent study conducted in 2020 404 individuals with ptsd were put on a medical marijuana regiment in which they inhaled cannabis these individuals tracked their symptoms on an app for 31 months and had a total of 11 000 responses they tracked symptoms such as intrusive thoughts flashbacks irritability anxiety along with many others after analyzing the results the researchers concluded that there was a 50 percent decrease in all ptsd symptoms immediately after using marijuana like all studies there are some limitations there needs to be more controlled research so we can truly understand the effects this is a new and advancing field and it's necessary to explore all avenues to see how cannabis can improve or deteriorate our mental health now where does this leave us can we say for certain that cannabis cures ptsd definitely not but we can certainly also not rule it out as a potential treatment what we can say though is that for certain individuals cannabis does prove to lessen the severity of their symptoms while for others it may increase them like any medication before taking any course of action it is best to consult your doctor and understand both the possible benefits and the risks this is demystifying medicine presenting ptsd in cannabis help or hurt you", "HBhMEAED2ro": "[Music] [Applause] so we hear a lot of terms there's cannabis cbd thc and hemp is it all marijuana or is there a difference our next insider explains what we have to differentiate is between cannabis or marijuana and hemp as well as cbd and thc so those are the the big ones to differentiate so cannabis is actually a plant that has all these different cannabinoids and it produces two of the most prominent thc and cbd hemp on the other hand it comes from the cannabis species but it does also have the cbd molecule which is cannabidiol and so what's legal in the united states in all 50 states would be cbd from a hemp plant and that would mean it would have also 0.3 percent thc or less and so that's really important because the thc is a psychoactive molecule so hemp is legal you can buy it online many people sell it and it contains cbd which has a lot of medicinal properties however cbd from hemp may be similar to the effect you would get from cbd from cannabis however it does have less than 0.3 percent thc so there's no chance of any psychoactivity there so cbd is cannabidiol cbd thc stands for what for tetrahydrocannabinol and what exactly is that again so that's one of the cannabinoids that causes the psychoactive effect and that's because it binds to that cb1 receptor in our brain but it has a lot of medicinal benefits also so people who are going through chemotherapy for example and suffering from nausea and vomiting or need to increase their appetite thc can be very effective it's also great for pain all different types of pain pain from neuropathy or you know the typical sciatic type of pain muscle spasticity patients with ms or a lot of other chronic musculoskeletal issues and uh very beneficial for insomnia as well what is hemp oil and is there any medicinal benefit there too so so hemp oil does contain cbd the problem with hemp oil is that it's not regulated strict enough and now actually i think today trump may sign the farm bill and the farm bill actually would make hemp completely legal so that it's no longer part of that definition where it's part of that schedule one and so you can get cbd from hemp and it would be very exciting if the farm bill does pass and trump signs that because now they'll be able to regulate what happens because the industry similar to supplements there's not a lot of strict enforcement so people are producing hemp oil selling it and it may not have the proper cannabinoid profile it may have things like mold pesticides lead different things that can be taken up from the soil so it has a lot of benefit and it can be bought online or you know in physicians offices however it should be regulated so that we know that the patients are getting accurate amount of what they need and i was hearing in the news that it looked like it was gonna pass but he was going to sign it it seems like it's going to happen today hopefully i think so today exactly uh let's go over cbd hemp oil we have a graphic if you could walk us through this doctor so in order to be considered hemp oil the cbd has to have the the oil has to have less than 0.3 thc which would mean there wouldn't be any chance of any feeling of being high or psychoactivity it should be third party lab tested which means that you can send it to a lab to check the cannabinoid profile and for any other contaminants and then how it's extracted is important there's ethanol extractions there's co2 extractions and the way i look at cbd is it really is more of a wellness type of supplement and i always tell people it's going to be in our multivitamin because we make a molecule in our body that is very similar to that molecule and as we age we make less and so it's really one of the reasons why we get chronic disease because we're not able to regulate and maintain homeostasis so it's something that people should be taking on a daily basis and then if they have specific symptoms like anxiety or pain or insomnia they can take it in specific doses or specific routes of administration and is cpd hemp or illegal in all 50 states it is it is it is legal okay i want to go over some reasons why you would prescribe cbd and thc we have a few examples that we can show our viewers right now and that would be anti-inflammatory i actually will let you take them because there's a few of them so cbd is a great anti-inflammatory so when dealing with joint inflammation or any type of inflammation in our body cbd can be used instead of things like ibuprofen meloxicam different anti-inflammatories it's also great for anxiety so it's a lot of patients are able to get off their xanax their valium their klonopin by using cbd it's helpful for pain and it's a good analgesic as well as an antioxidant to help with the immune system thc on the other hand actually the united states has a patent saying that it can help with apoptosis which is programmed cell death which means that it can help to shrink tumors it can help decrease metastasis so it has this anti-cancer property and also anti-spasmodic patients who are suffering from spasticity or muscle spasms it will help with that as well it's also effective for pain and again it can help with nausea vomiting stimulating people's appetite and if cbd is not sufficient for sleep thc can be used to help patients suffering from insomnia look at that more than i even dreamed of are patients surprised when they see that so they they just come in and go really they are surprised but what happens is a lot of patients actually come to me because i've had success with their friends or their family and so they are understanding the benefits and they're feeling they're seeing people feel better and so they want to know is this an option for me and by the way president trump did sign the farm bill which legalizes hemp you can find out more on cbd just download the health channel app", "i8ITLj9AHdQ": "hello again everybody and welcome back to your career economists in today's episode we will be making CBD coconut oil but first before we get into today's video if you wouldn't mind please hit that subscribe button for those of you that are new to the channel and if you've already subscribed thank you very much so I'm gonna leave a link to my CBD MCT oil and that's gonna kind of go over the entire deke art process so I'm just gonna run through a really quick today I've already packaged up my biotics flower and I have that right beside me here this is 24 grams of Vioxx flour which came in at 21.1% CBD and this is our bag of flour so I'm just gonna put this in the oven for 30 minutes D carb at 250 degrees okay so while we're waiting for the flour to D carp I'm gonna go over some of the materials you'll need to make the CBD coconut oil first you're going to need coconut oil now I have organic coconut oil just run to the middle nothing crazy I got this larger container at BJ's you can pick it up yourself you always get it on Amazon I like to use organic stuff same thing with my MCT oil it's just if you're going to be putting this kind of stuff into your body you're gonna want it to be organic and we've put all that effort into making our head flour organics so why not just buy some more more organic products the other thing you'll need is you'll need to measure out 2 cups of coconut oil and I'll get into that too but you definitely don't want a measuring cup and of course in today's video we'll we will be featuring the magic butter machine now this recipe can be used without a magic butter machine but for today's purposes we are going to be using a magic butter machine some people use crock pots some people use a bunch of other stuff I just like the magic butter machine because it's just a no mess situation its cleanup is super easy but you can't use another household kitchen gadgets so now we'll wait for the flour and we'll start making the oil okay so our canvas has just D carved in the oven so before we take it out we are going to add the coconut oil to the magic butter machine again if you're using a crock-pot or whatever the recipe is still the same but your device is going to be different so here I've measured out two cups of coconut oil and you're just gonna put it right in try to get as much of it as possible I know coconut oil can be a pain because of its solid texture and you know it melts at like I don't know 75 degrees or something like that so what I like to do too is take the glove and I'll just kind of use that to get the coconut oil off I can always wash the glove all right so that's all the coconut oil now we're going to grab our D carb M flower smells awesome and gonna add it right in make sure you get everything get this out of the way make sure everything's out I'm gonna put this right on lockdown I'm gonna go ahead and plug it in all right and so the magic butter machine recipe typically calls for two hours at 160 degrees but I like to do 160 degrees for four hours I like the longer cook so that's it now we just wait for the machine all right so the magic butter machine is now done it's been four hours and we're going to take the top off here now looks to be pretty nice not a whole lot of mess this time around which is great shake it off a little bit and now we're gonna slide this scoop off the edge let me show you inside here very typical for this machine you just want to scoop off the edge get as much as you can that plant material holds all that CBD all the good stuff that down I put the glove on my right hand and I am going to pour [Applause] he's gonna get all that juice out of there looks really good so now we'll put this off to the side just back up now there's some plant material down there in the bottom so I'm just gonna scoop the rest of this out all right give this one more good squeeze you can see right there just squeezing it get the most you can out of it that looks to be it so we'll put this in our sink and that is it so what I'll do is I'll take the coconut oil I'll put it in these mason jars and I will let it rest it will risa Lydda fie and you can do what you want with it now the great thing about coconut oil is you can add it to your lotion you can cook with it you can use it as a lotion you can pretty much do anything you really want with coconut oil it's kind of a really good way to use CBD but that's today's recipe that's all I have for if you wouldn't mind please hit that subscribe button if you're new here to the channel and you can find us on Instagram and Facebook now those links will be in the description below I'll also put the recipe for this in the description below and until next time thanks for watching", "bAWQzJqxd3k": "THE AREA USED TO BE REGISTERED AS A MEDICAL MARIJUANA SITE.

CANNABIS SOMETIME THIS WEEK.", "pbawJAp7Khk": "cannabis use has been on the rise but one area of cannabis that is not commonly discussed is its effects on mental health so in today's video we will be discussing the effects of cannabis and its association with various mental health disorders in the united states more than 11.8 million young adults reported using marijuana in 2018 and in 2011 there were nearly 456 000 drug-related emergency department visits in the united states where marijuana use was mentioned in their medical records well what is cannabis and what is it made out of cannabis is a well-known drug which is known to alter the mind and body it is also known as pot weed ganja marijuana and many other terms [Music] people either smoke cannabis through a hand-rolled cigarette or through vapors and edibles cannabis is derived from the plant cannabis sativa which contains high amounts of thc this stands for delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol this contains a psychoactive component that makes people feel high the other component of cannabis is cannabidiol which is used to reduce pain and inflammation [Music] now that we know the components of cannabis you must be wondering about its effects on the brain and body [Music] when a person smokes cannabis thc and cbd go into the lungs into the bloodstream once the chemicals are in the bloodstream it is transported throughout the body though the after effects of drugs are experienced at different intensities general effects include increased appetite for food laughter and joy and the ability to hear see smell taste and feel drastically increases [Music] focusing on the short-term effects of cannabis on the brain cannabis creates tiredness difficulty in remembering information concentrating and confusion it can also lead to anxiety fear and reduce the ability of a person to react quickly thus making it dangerous to drive or operate equipment short-term effects also include psychotic episodes including paranoia delusion or even hallucinations however the long-term effects of cannabis use are severe the ability for the brain to remember information concentrate make decisions can significantly decrease as well as the overall iq these effects can be permanent even after cannabis is stopped and can be experienced differently depending on the person especially on age now that we know about the effects of cannabis on the brain let's dive into its effects on the body in the short term cannabis damages blood vessels decreases blood pressure and increases heart rate these can further cause the person to faint become prone to heart conditions or get a heart attack if a person continues to smoke cannabis in the long term they can experience problems with their lungs this can increase their risk of bronchitis lung infections chronic cough or increased buildup of mucus in the throat cannabis can be used for both medicinal and recreational purposes and in canada 330 000 canadians are using marijuana for medical purposes [Music] some pros of medical marijuana is that it's safer to use in opiates it's less addictive it's a great muscle relaxant it's less in tremors and those with parkinson disease it's ease pain in people with multiple sclerosis it's managed nausea and weight loss in people of glaucoma and research has shown promising results for ptsd however you can build a tolerance to medical marijuana causing one to continuously increase their dosage to relieve pain in addition it's not readily available in all countries as every country has different laws regulating its use recreational marijuana usage is controversial in canada it is legal to use and has reduced the black market network of cannabis distribution increasing consumer safety and utilizing taxpayer money for other uses however recreational usage has negative impacts such as its long-lasting effects on the brain and increased risk for mental health issues now let's dive into the age demographics of cannabis usage as shown in this graph we can see that the majority of cannabis users are below the age of 44 with the highest rate of cannabis consumption being in the age group of 25 to 34 and the lowest rate of cannabis consumers above the age of 65. but what's really interesting is that a literature review conducted from the year 2000 to 2017 saw that the highest increase in cannabis use was observed in the older adult population 50 years or older and specifically though 65 years or older had the greatest increase in marijuana use some correlates of cannabis use in the older age group were listed in the study and included being male unmarried having various chronic diseases and psychological stress as well as the use of other substances such as alcohol tobacco and illicit drugs question that often comes to mind when thinking about cannabis usage is how does frequent marijuana use increase the development of mental disorders such as psychosis schizophrenia depression and bipolar disorder and is there even a link between cannabis and these mental health illnesses well for starters cannabis is prevalent in 50 of psychosis cases thc has been linked with causing positive psychosis symptoms and neurocognitive changes by altering the prefrontal cortex and reducing synaptic density in addition psychoactive effects in marijuana varies depending on the amount of thc consumed also it is suggested that endogenous cannabinoids the ones made by our own bodies have protective effects against the psychoactive impacts of thc a study looking at risk factors of psychosis development cannabis users suggest that adolescents between the ages of 15 to 18 had more psychosis episodes compared to control subjects maternal cannabis use or using cannabis while pregnant may also contribute to psychosis in the child during later stages of their life cannabis and schizophrenia a mental disorder where people receive reality through hallucinations delusions and disorganized thinking studies suggest that marijuana exposure might be one factor that interacts with many other factors to become a possible causative agent in schizophrenia however there is not causal relationship between the two similar to psychosis adolescent exposure to cannabis is associated with a higher risk of developing schizophrenia compared to adult cannabis usage overall more research needs to be conducted to examine the complex relationship between cognition cannabis and schizophrenia several longitudinal studies show that cannabis placed individuals at a moderate risk of developing depression unfortunately they were unable to determine if it caused depression also cannabis was associated with increased risk of school dropout and unemployment which may indirectly cause depression thc has psychoactive effects which regulate mood and has been associated with increased anxiety symptoms several studies concluded that cannabis placed individuals at a small risk of developing anxiety however similar to cannabis use and depression there's little evidence to suggest that cannabis causes anxiety several studies show high rates of co-occurrence of cannabis and bipolar disorders cannabis has shown to worsen manic symptoms in those with pre-existing bipolar disorder and might also contribute to the genesis of manic type symptoms in those with no pre-existing bipolar disorder if you or someone you know is addicted to marijuana there are many treatment options available first it's important to educate yourself on the risks and dangers of cannabis see a therapist or join community programs to meet people who are going through similar experiences thanks for watching please make sure to like and share this video and subscribe to the demystifying

LAST WEEK IT WAS ANNOUNCED THE SHORTAGE WILL LAST UNTIL NEXT YEAR. MARIJUANA MEDICATION MEDICAL REPORTER DINA BAIR HAS A WARNING. A NEW STUDY RAISES THE RED FLAG ABOUT CANNABINOID INTERACTING WITH PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS WITH THE RENEWED LEGALIZATION OF RECREATIONAL POT AND THE GROWING POPULARITY OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA. PENN STATE RESEARCHERS SET OUT TO SEE HOW THAT WOULD IMPACT DRUGS AMERICANS WERE ALREADY TAKING. THEY FOUND 57 PROBLEMS. THE REMARKABLE FINDING WAS THAT WE IDENTIFIED 57. DRUGS THAT HAVE A NARROW THERAPEUTIC INDEX AND THAT MEANS THE RANGE OF AFRICA SEE TO TOXICITY IS VERY NARROW AND THE PRESENCE OF CANNABINOIDS CHEMICALS FOUND IN CANNABIS COULD TIP THE SCALE TO THE DARK SIDE WHICH ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS PATIENTS TAKING BLOOD THINNERS LIKE COMMIT IT TURNS OUT THAT IF SOMEONE WERE ON THAT MEDICATION WERE SUDDENLY THE AD THE HIGH DOSE OF CAN AVENUE AID NO MATTER WHAT THE SOURCE THEY'RE AT RISK FOR INTERFERING WITH THE METABOLISM OF THAT. COUMADIN AND HAVE AN ADVERSE REACTION MORE THAN 8 MILLION AMERICANS ARE CURRENTLY TAKING BLOOD THINNERS. AND MANY ARE OLDER SEEKING MEDICAL MARIJUANA FOR PAIN RELIEF OR CBD OIL WITHOUT KNOWING THE COMBINATION COULD BE DISASTROUS WOMEN STATES LEGALIZE RECREATIONAL WHEN THEY RECORD OR THEY LEGALIZE MEDICAL MARIJUANA. WHAT'S NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IS THE FACT THAT IT MAY INTERFERE WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DRUGS OR CARDIAC SOME AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH AN ANESTHETIC CALLED PROPOFOL ANESTHESIOLOGISTS NOTICE THE INTERACTION IN SURGICAL PATIENTS FOLKS THAT ARE HEAVY USERS OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA FORCES TAKE MORE PRO FOOTBALL TO SEDATE HER SURGERY, THE LIST IS LENGTHY INCLUDING BLOOD PRESSURE DEPRESSION, BIRTH CONTROL FIRE OI AND CANCER MEDICATIONS OFFERING GUIDANCE. PENN STATE RESEARCHERS SAY PATIENTS TAKING DOZENS OF DRUG SHOULD BE CLOSELY MONITORED IF THEY USE CANNABINOIDS. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. DOCTORS DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY MAKE MEDICATION DECISIONS PEOPLE DON'T DISCLOSE. WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE USING ILLICIT RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA OR AS YOU SAY CBD OIL THAT THEY CAN GET OVER THE COUNTER OR MEDICAL MARIJUANA THEY DON'T THINK OF THAT AS A MEDICATION NECESSARILY AND I DON'T WANT TO PAINT IT THAT IT'S NECESSARILY A BAD THING IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO MONITOR AND BE CAREFUL THOUGH THEY ARE VERY BIOACTIVE THE VERY BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES THAT GIVE MEDICAL MARIJUANA POWER. ALSO DIMINISH OR ENHANCE THE EFFECTS OF OTHER DRUGS MUCH LIKE A DRUG TO DRUG INTERACTION. BUT EVEN CBD CAN CAUSE AN ISSUE WE'VE SHOWN THAT ALL CBD OILS ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL. AND SO THE FDA FOR INSTANCE JUST HAD TO RECALL A CBD OIL PREPARATION THAT HAD TOO MUCH LEAD IN. SO I WOULD CAUTION PEOPLE AGAINST USING OVER THE COUNTER CBD OIL FOR INSTANCE AND IF THEY ARE USING WHETHER CBD OIL OR RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA JUST DISCLOSED THAT TO YOUR DOCTOR. SO THAT THEY CAN PLAN HOW THEY'RE GOING TO TREAT YOU WITH OTHER MEDICATIONS. THE RESEARCHERS SAY THEY PLAN TO ROUTINELY UPDATE AND ADD TO THE DRUG INTERACTION", "oqLfX6zE0co": "want to get high without the anxiety or paranoia i know just the cannabinoid for you for marijuana morning news i'm brooke burgstahler cannabinoids are chemical compounds found in cannabis by far the most well-known cannabinoid is thc or delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol but lately there's been a lot of hype around delta 8 thc a cannabinoid cousin of delta 9. delta 8 thc is chemically different from delta 9 thc by only a few atomic bonds while delta 9 can exist in cannabis strains in amounts up to 30 to 40 percent delta 8 only exists naturally in fractions of a percent nevertheless companies are stoked on the idea of extracting and concentrating delta 8 for its unique effects word on the street is that delta 8 thc gets you high but to a lesser extent and without the anxiety it's also known for its appetite stimulating analgesic and neuroprotective properties and anti-nausea effects in a 1995 study conducted by dr rafael meshalim eight children with cancer who were being treated with different drugs along with chemotherapy were given delta 8 thc in conjunction with chemo and as a result vomiting was completely prevented with side effects reported as being negligible so obviously delta 8 thc deserves our attention there seem to be both medical and recreational benefits to the cannabinoid are you into delta eight throw those thoughts in the comments and thanks for watching today's marijuana morning news my name is brooke burgstahler i really freaking love you now follow us at big mike and have a beautiful day [Music]", "jzA-nORdJyE": "there was a misconception that CBD is not psychoactive and that people think it's inert and very very very safe and doesn't produce any acute drug effects so we wanted to bring that into laboratory and test that assumption what we found is that oral dosing doesn't produce much in the way of a drug effect or impact drug testing when the substance is pure when it's vaporized though we did see discriminable drug effects they were not THC like so people didn't report getting high but they did feel a subjective change in how they felt mostly positive not really negative and we didn't see anything in the way of impairment of cognitive performance when we added some THC to the mixed we used a cannabis that was high in THC or high in CBD and low in THC we found that people reported modest drug effects again no impairment of cognitive functioning at the doses we tested but you know relatively strong drug effects we also found in this study that acute dosing with that high CBD low THC cannabis could produce a positive drug test in some individuals the other interesting finding from this is that in consistent with other studies that have been done we found that women tended to be more sensitive to the drug effects than men so women reported stronger drug effects overall especially in the vaporization and the high CBD low THC drug conditions and they reported greater ratings of irritation of their throat when they were inhaling the drug this is a stepping stone study so it's a very small study with a single dose given one time so you know obviously from here we there are a number of ways we want to expand on this a number of directions we want to move forward at some point multiple different doses and and different formulations to better replicate all of the products that are on the mark at the moment", "iWF9MmiQUA4": "in this study we treated children with dravet syndrome which is a very serious genetic form of epilepsy that unfortunately has a very high seizure burden and a very high mortality from epilepsy that these children who had not responded to often five or ten other treatments were given cannabidiol or a placebo in addition to their existing medications cannabidiol is the major non psychoactive ingredient in cannabis also known as marijuana so cannabidiol does not produce any high or psychoactive properties and therefore has less potential side effects especially for use in children than a psychoactive compounds such as THC we were in the double-blind placebo-controlled phase of the study and we did that for 14 weeks and we were like totally convinced that she was in a placebo because her seizures didn't change at all and then we were able to roll into the open label extension and the second day that we're in open label and we knew that she was getting the actual drug she went seizure free like completely seizure free for two months which has never happened the main findings of the study were that there was a very statistically significant reduction in the convulsive seizure frequency in patients who are randomized to cannabidiol when compared to patients who are randomized to placebo so the message is that cannabidiol does work in reducing convulsive seizures in children with dravet syndrome my hope for the future is that this study will lead to more similar studies to assess cannabidiol and perhaps products containing both cannabidiol and THC in various forms of epilepsy you", "Xy98wFJdlGw": "breast cancer treatments come many side effects often managed by more medication a law that went into effect on july 1st of this year may give breast cancer patients in the commonwealth another tool in their belt to help with all those additional symptoms reba hollingsworth looks at how virginia's new regulated medical cannabis program will affect breast cancer patients [Music] i felt like i had done everything in my life to try to avoid cancer to say it was a shock is an understatement i had two very young children my daughters were four and two years old and um just i was flawed i didn't think that that i would be a breast cancer patient during treatment bernice o'donnell experienced many common side effects of chemotherapy at the time medical cannabis wasn't legally available with chemo i ended up being nauseous like so many other chemo patients and um to combat that the doctors prescribed anti-nausea medication which was helpful however with chemo you end up having difficulty for me at least um difficulty passing food and then the anti-nut anti-nausea medication made it even more challenging to pass food current day if i had gone through it i would have i would have tried the medical cannabis as of july 1st patients in virginia now have the option of using medical cannabis through virginia's regulated medical cannabis program patients have been able to find relief from the side effects of chemotherapy by using medical cannabis relief for issues like pain nausea loss of appetite and sleep disruption as well as anxiety not to mention pain that may be associated with the cancer itself jen michelle padini of virginia normal says medical cannabis can be an alternative to opiate prescriptions she says data from other states struck a core with legislators in virginia looking for a solution to the opiate crisis it will have the same results here in virginia that we've seen across the country where we're we're seeing a very quickly about a 25 percent reduction in opioid overdose fatalities and increasing up to about 35 percent after just a few years for patients like bernice the extra option is one more way to get through a tough treatment your life is not normal when you're going through treatment but any benefit anything that can make your life that much more comfortable is such a huge plus that it would be worth it to use it right now the first dispensary in the state

reactions within the body the chemical structure of thc that is found in marijuana is what gives you the feeling of being high while the chemical structure of cbd which is also found in marijuana doesn't give you the feeling of being high but affects the body in different less noticeable ways cbd is known to elicit relaxing and soothing effects without the feeling of intoxication that is usually associated with marijuana marijuana and hemp are two types of cannabis plants marijuana contains a high concentration of thc with some cbd this contrasts kemp as hemp is bred to remove the majority of its thc content leaving the plant as only a good source of cbd this means you cannot get high off hemp derived cbd oils but how do we know that cbd is effective in treating anxiety one study outlined an experiment done on 65 men and women that were classified to be obese majority of the participants were in their 20s to 40s in this double-blind experiment some participants were given hemp-derived cbd oil or an olive oil placebo daily for six weeks alongside their normal diet throughout the six weeks the participants were asked about their feelings of stress as well as other factors including their overall well-being anxiety levels and sleep quality participants were also asked to complete physical activity on a regular basis the study found that overall participants who were given hemp-derived cbd were coping better with stress experiencing improved sleep quality and quantity and showed improved pleasure in life amongst many other benefits so how have people been using cbd cbd oils and creams are currently being used topically to reduce pain and inflammation teas coffee blends and even cbd infused beer help with anxiety relieve stress and help with sleep cbd has also been used to help with withdrawal symptoms panic attacks insomnia depression as well as ptsd although there is little to no side effects of cbd use as well as no proven tendencies for abuse or dependence potential cbd is still relatively new on the market cbd studies are still in the preliminary stages as long-term effects are still unknown so please before trying anything new we recommend you speak to your family doctor and inquire about cbd and find what works best for you if you are interested in learning more about the use of cbd research currently being done or the science behind it please refer to the links in the description of this video [Music] you", "3N8QMeIsX2c": "Translator: Rhonda Jacobs\nReviewer: Peter van de Ven What goes through your mind\nwhen I tell you that my 11-year-old twins\nare using marijuana? Do you think to yourselves, \"Oh my god, the drug problem in the U.S.\nis worse than I thought\"? How is it possible that 11-year-olds\nget access to pot? Maybe some of you thought, \"Geez, I wonder what\nmedical condition these kids have.\" The truth of the matter is, most of us don't think about medicine\nwhen we hear the word \"marijuana.\" I admit - I'm embarrassed to admit\nthat up until two years ago I was completely misinformed\nabout marijuana, and I think many\nof our population is today. I remember vividly in sixth grade\nbeing ushered into the auditorium to see a government-sponsored\n\"documentary\" about marijuana. It was the most scary thing\nI'd ever watched. People jumping off buildings,\ncar crashes - it was mayhem. But not once was there\na mention of the possibility that cannabis was useful as medicine. To be honest, in retrospect, I'm a little angry about the propaganda\nthat our government is putting forth; it's even happening today. My big idea worth sharing\nis that medical cannabis can be the healthcare success story\nof our lifetimes but only if we all engage\nin learning the truth and ask our federal government\nto end prohibition of cannabis. I'd like to introduce you\nto my twins, Addison and Cassidy. Believe it or not, today's their birthday. Eleven years ago today,\nonly a mile from here, they were born and came into our lives. Happiest day of my life -\nI love the date too: January 23, 2004. 1, 2, 3, 4. Unfortunately, Addie and Cassie\nsuffer from a very rare genetic disorder called Niemann-Pick Type C . This horrible disease\nis more commonly called, or what we call it,\nis childhood Alzheimer's. Their little brains\nare drowning in cholesterol. They're missing a protein\nthat allows them to process cholesterol both in and out of their brain cells. The cause is neurodegeneration. They can no longer walk,\nand they can no longer talk. We were told the Addie and Cassie\nwould be lucky to see their 12th birthday. (Sniffs) After reeling with\nthis devastating diagnosis, my wife and I dedicated ourselves to finding treatments\nfor our twins in their lifetime. We gave up successful\nhigh tech careers in Silicon Valley, and we became research philanthropists\nraising money for research, and ultimately, we became\nbiotechnology entrepreneurs developing a compound. The compound we found was cyclodextrin, and we found it with an amazing group\nof scientists, researchers and physicians from all over the world,\nincluding right here in Reno. Every week the girls get an infusion. It's eight hours long -\nit goes into their bloodstream, the cyclodextrin. Every other week, like yesterday,\nthe girls go to the hospital and they get a lumbar\npuncture in their spine in order to get the cyclodextrin\nto reach their brains directly. We think that the combination\nof those two routes of administration are slowing down\nthe neurodegenerative progression, and hopefully, maybe even stopping it. Addie and Cassie were\nthe first little pioneers to try this scary treatment. I can tell you as a parent, with no one in front of you\npaving the way, it truly is a scary moment. Thankfully, a couple dozen\nkids around the world, including a few at the NIH, are now engaged\nin further science and research on this experimental treatment. But the treatment doesn't seem\nto help with their seizures. As a result of the neurodegeneration,\nmy kids have seizures almost daily. A couple years ago\nthey were way more than daily, they were many a day. We started giving the kids\ntraditional pharmaceutical medicines for their seizures. And they worked - some of them worked,\nsome of them didn't work, but the big problem was most seizure drugs cause\nyour kids to become zombies. The whole purpose of the drugs is to essentially take away the stress\nor the triggers that cause seizures. We had heard about a father in California\nthat was treating a young son who has intractable seizures,\nseizing constantly, all day long, and he was using cannabis medicine. We became interested. We contacted him;\nwe learned more about the drug. Ultimately, we decided\nto pursue cannabis in earnest. Did you know that the cannabis plant was used as early as 2900 BC\nin China as medicine? Did you know that we in America\nwere using, in the 1800s, for a century, we were using cannabis\nto treat a number of afflictions. Unfortunately, in the early 1900s,\nas you all probably know, cannabis was prohibited and subsequently demonized\nand turned into a war. It's a shame. It truly is a shame. But we became convinced\nthat the oil would work. So we set out to find\na supply of oil, certainly - Cannabis has been legal\nin the great state of Nevada for almost a decade, surely we could just go out\nand buy some oil and give it to our kids. Not true; there was no oil\navailable in our great state. So we set out to do it ourselves. First we got physician approval\nto do the treatment of cannabis, and then we became caregivers, licensed caregivers\nin the state of Nevada, which allows us to cultivate\nand make extractions, oils from the cannabis plant\nto give to our kids. Every day - three times a day -\nthe girls get a little oil, like what you see here. This oil is extracted\nfrom a very special cannabis plant that's high in cannabidiol,\nor CBD as we call it. Unfortunately, this oil, by itself,\ndoesn't even completely, for our children, stop their seizures, so we still use\na small amount of pharmaceutical medicine, but we use less - we've reduced\nthe number of drugs the kids take, and we've reduced the amount of dose\nfrom the few drugs we do give them, and consequently our kids\nare not only having fewer seizures and shorter seizures, they're also bright eyed\nand happy children again, they're no longer little zombies. This was great progress,\nbut I thought to myself, holy cow, there are two million epilepsy or seizure\ndisorder sufferers in the United States, who's going to help those folks, those kids, those adults\nwith these disorders? And at that moment we decided to take what we had learned\nfor our children and turn it into a commercial business\nhere in the state of Nevada, which was just preparing\nto allow that to happen, and as Kylie mentioned,\nwe've endeavored to do so and are now licensed\nto grow, extract and sell, dispense cannabis here in Nevada,\nin the state of Nevada. Someday the federal government\nwill end prohibition. But how many lives\nwill be lost, potentially, or severely affected in the meantime? How many kids with seizures like mine\nwill move their families, will uproot their homes to move to\nColorado or Nevada to get these medicines? How many cancer patients\nwill be denied access to inexpensive and effective medicine to treat the side effects like pain\nand nausea that come with chemotherapy? There is a groundswell of folks like me\nwho understand the potential of cannabis, and I'm grateful for that. The ironic thing is\nsome of my family and friends, including, most particularly,\nmy own mother, are still not convinced. My mother is worried that free access to cannabis\nis actually a threat to society and that perhaps the medicinal value\ndoesn't outweigh that threat. And she sees the medicinal value\nin her grandchildren. The problem, I think, is that, really, we just don't have enough hard evidence\nyet to convince the skeptics. There just isn't enough\nscience and research to back the foundation\nthat the medicine's working, the medicine's effective, that it's useful\nfor large populations of people. That's not to say\nthat research doesn't exist, there's a mountain of evidence\nthat the cannabis plant is useful. But there's not a lot of clinical science,\nhard clinical science to that effect. That's the conundrum;\nthat's the chicken and egg problem. Until the federal prohibition\nof cannabis ends, until we take cannabis\noff the schedule of harmful drugs like LSD and methamphetamines\nthat have no medicinal value, until we remove cannabis from that list, which is insane that\nit's on that list to begin with, until we remove it from that list,\nresearch can't take place. If I came to the University of Nevada,\nReno Medical Center tomorrow with a million dollar grant\nto study cannabis, I would likely not have success. It's not that the scientists\ndon't want to study the plant, it's that they are fearful\nof losing federal funding. It's because they'd\nhave to deal with the DEA and other regulatory agencies\nat the federal level, which is a complex and expensive process. This is one of the many tentacles\nof the prohibition of cannabis that actually prohibits us\nfrom moving forward. My own personal experience with cannabis\nalong with the evidence, the science that I know about, makes me absolutely certain\nwhat I shared with you earlier. Cannabis has the potential to become the big healthcare\nsuccess story of our lifetimes but only if we allow it. Here are Addie and Cassie\nin a more recent picture. For those of you who are still skeptical, perhaps for those of you like my mother who still worry about\nthe societal downside of cannabis, I ask you to look at this picture\nand consider the following: By limiting access to cannabis\nfor parents like myself, you're forcing me to make a decision between the lives\nor well-being of my children and going to jail. How is that a fair or rational\nset of thinking in modern society? Our 16th president,\nthe famous 16th president, had very strong feelings\nabout this subject. He said, \"Prohibition ... goes\nbeyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control\na man's appetite by legislation and makes a crime out of things\nthat aren't crimes ... A prohibition law strikes a blow\nat the very principles upon which our government was founded.\" This was Abraham Lincoln. And he said these words\nbefore we had the experiences we had with alcohol prohibition\nor with cannabis prohibition. Someday the federal government\nwill spend the money on research. Someday the NIH will actually be actively\npursuing cannabis as a treatment. Until that day comes, a large group of us\nhave come together and formed a nonprofit to organize and fund clinical research\nin cannabis in the private sector until we can use\nthe academic institutions. We call the foundation PeopleCann,\nin honor of advocates like myself who over the last several decades\nhave been saying what I'm now saying and whose words I didn't listen to\nuntil my own situation demanded it. Never in her wildest imagination -\nexcuse me - would my wife have thought that today she would\nbe a cannabis advocate. She was also \"misinformed,\"\nlet's say, about the plant until we needed to learn. Neither my wife nor I would ever believe\nthat our young children would become the next generation\nof cannabis advocates. (Exhales) I'd like you to meet them. Please give a birthday welcome\nto my wife Chris - excuse me - and my daughters, Addie and Cassie Hempel. (Applause) Hi. (Applause) Would it be unkind to ask\nif we can sing Happy Birthday?

Jason MacDougall I'm a professor of honestly 0 del University and I also too committee at the arthritis Society so cannabis is my family of hem the hem family and marijuana is pretty much the same thing it's just more of a slang term so we prefer to adhere to the scientific naming of cannabis cannabinoid is a hammock it's found within the plant the cannabis plant and it can also be a chemical that mimics the cannabis plant so it could be man-made or it could be naturally occurring in our bodies so they're actually three different types of cannabinoid there are the fatal cannabinoids which are the ones that are found within the cannabis plant the synthetic cannabinoids which are the man-made chemicals the pharmaceutical preparations and then they're the endocannabinoids which are the naturally occurring cannabis like compounds that a caramel produced in our bodies there were many active Cannabis the two most well known ones are THC and CBD THC stands for tetrahydrocannabinol and that's the psychoactive component of cannabis CBD is cannabidiol and that has been shown to be effective at controlling pain and inflammation and but it doesn't have the psychoactive properties the same way that THC does so medical cannabis is the cannabis that's prescribed by your doctor and could be an either the herbal form either a synthetic form and there's some evidence to show that it can be effective in alleviating arthritis pain as well as inflammation and fatigue different ways of administering cannabis can be either smoked or ingested in oral form baked into cookies or produced in the oil of butters but they're also synthetic cannabinoids that can be taken as a tablet or as a spray underneath the tongue different strains of cannabis different types of cannabis and they vary and the amount of THC and CBD that they contain and it's important to know that because they may have different impacts in various populations of patients we'll just like any drug there are a number of different side effects associated with cannabis and so it may not be appropriate for all arthritis patients so we really really need more research try and understand the safety profile of the different strains of cannabis there's been a lot of experimental evidence to show that cannabis can be effective in treating the pains of arthritis as well as the inflammation and helping with fatigue but we really need more clinical studies to try and understand benefits and potential limitations of using cannabis so further research into medical cannabis is required so we can understand the different subpopulations of patients who may be responsive to medical cannabis we need to find out the effective dose of medical cannabis some of the interactions with other drugs as well as looking at different delivery systems you", "YcGeegDl5lQ": "UNDER UNDER INVESTIGATION.

Cannabis tends to be relatively low in THC\ncompared to its levels of a THC precursor, THCA. Heating the cannabis plant, however, causes\nthe conversion of THCA to THC, which is part of the basis for heating or burning the plant\nfor use. The effects of cannabis may vary depending\non the variety of cannabis plant and its associated levels of THC and other cannabinoids, but\ncommon effects of THC include: euphoria, sedation, stimulation of appetite, impaired cognitive\nfunction, analgesia, and anxiety. THC is thought to exert most of its effects\nby binding to receptors called cannabinoid receptors. There are two known cannabinoid receptors,\nCB1 and CB2---both of which are g-protein coupled receptors. CB1 receptors are found throughout the nervous\nsystem, while CB2 receptors are primarily found on immune cells. THC acts as a partial agonist at cannabinoid\nreceptors, meaning it binds to these receptors and generates a response that\u2019s a fraction\nof what other substances that bind to the receptors can generate. THC interacts with a number of other targets\nas well, but it\u2019s thought that its main psychoactive effects are mediated through\nits action at CB1 receptors. Activation of CB1 receptors is thought to\nlead to the modulation of the release of various neurotransmitters. It\u2019s not fully understood how this translates\ninto the characteristic effects of THC, but the activation of CB1 receptors in different\nareas of the nervous system may partially explain the effects of the drug. CB1 receptors in areas like the cortex and\nhippocampus, for example, may be involved in the perceptual and cognitive effects of\nTHC. CB1 receptors in areas like the basal ganglia and cerebellum may be associated with\nsedation and effects on movement. And CB1 receptors in areas like the spinal cord and\nbrainstem may be linked to analgesic effects.", "ogpQFoqQBuA": ">>> LITERALLY THIS MAN NEEDS NO  INTRODUCTION.

going through chemotherapy however since the law was passed many patients have struggled to access the drug and it seems doctors are reluctant to prescribe it in a moment we're going to be talking to hannah deacon now you remember remember hannah she's been on the show before her son alfie was the first child in the uk to be prescribed cannabis oil we're also talking to neurologist dr mike barnes who's a specialist in medicinal cannabis first though we're going to talk to matt hughes and matt is going to go to the high court to fight the current guidelines this is in a bid to help his son charlie who suffers from a rare form of epilepsy matt good morning to you um tell us about charlie he's three years old um when was he diagnosed with epilepsy and how bad is it so charlie was diagnosed at 10 weeks old with a severe form of epilepsy called infantile spasms or western germans as it's known so being so young the brain is still developing and the basically it's chronic brainwave activity so um it's not in a rhythmical state and that has a detrimental effect on his development as well so obviously through them early years your you know all their little milestones that babies reach charlie wasn't reaching any of them uh so he's now turned three last month uh but his development is that of around a one-year-old um so yeah it's been catastrophic on his development and doctors not always say i think that's and you've got you've got awful sign there unfortunately matt which hopefully somebody can twiddle a knob and reduce the echo that we're hearing here but basically when hannah went through her situation with her son alfie we thought from the home secretary that was the green light and there is this reticence from the governing body on this nice to actually take their mitts off this prescription it's one thing saying yes you can have this but why are doctors afraid to prescribe it essentially everything we're being told is the nice guidelines so we've got now got a nice challenge against noyce in the high court so essentially the guidelines that they've written are so restrictive although they do allow it it's so strict if the doctors don't have the confidence to prescribe um so essentially we're you know we're asking that these they're re-reviewed that you know the guidelines are using modern evidence and new evidence here in the uk and anecdotal evidence as well so nice or relying on randomized control trials um which cannabis doesn't fit into that model um randomized controlled trials are designed to test pharmaceutical uh pharmaceutical medicines cannabis is it's a plant so it doesn't fit that model so i was reading i was reading um that you you have charlie hasn't been prescribed cannabis by the nhs but you have been getting it for him privately since may last year so tell us he was having 120 seizures a day i believe tell us the effect that the cannabis has had on charlie since may last year uh so he started using as you say last year um and initially is he's really alert he's really happy um he come alive so before he was really lethargic and he's suffering some side effects from the the other anti-epileptic medicines and he's just come alive but then we started seeing the seizures reducing um so they've reduced from 120 you know we have weekends where he was seizure free but now you know he's been using it for over a year and it's you know they're no more than 20 a day and the um they're not as severe uh you know they're a lot less um they don't really bother him that much so uh yeah so as a result matt you and i taking the national institute for health and care excellence to court and um and uh they are effectively preventing the nhs from prescribing what you need for your boy let's go to hannah deacon um now on this and your son alfie as ruth said earlier alfie's 98 was the first to get cannabis on nhs prescription probably at the time hannah you thought job done politicians make these big announcements and the public then die down the public go all right that's all sorted then why is it not sorted well you're absolutely right we were very very proud that the law changed on the back of the campaign that we ran with endorphine and actually the reality is is that nothing has changed for people what's crucial to remember is that there are groups of families like matt's family who have been left highly dry by this failure in policy they're having to raise money all the time especially through covid which has been extremely difficult and that's the only thing that's keeping their children safe and out of hospital they're actually not using nhs um funds for looking after the children so this medical cannabis these private descriptions are you know saving their children the law was changed and nhs england said yes you can prescribe as you know doctors can prescribe as any other normal medicine but the hospital trust is saying no you can't describe and nice and other medical bodies are saying no you can't describe because there's not enough evidence so it's just a complete mess and in the middle of it we have very vulnerable people with very sick children who just are desperate to get sorted out the one person that can actually sort this out today and can intervene is matt hancock the health secretary he met with family you've got two hopes of that no hope and bob hope i would say it is so controversial and i want to go hannah i want to go to professor mike barnes to find out why it is so controversial mike you are a consultant neurologist and medical cannabis expert you heard what hannah said quite simply the um the the secretary of state for health he could make this happen we've heard the home secretary before pretending to make this happen and it hasn't happened why do politicians want to run miles away from making a decision on this i find it extraordinary why they do it's a remarkably safe medicine we know that for certain we shouldn't forget that in this country as 1.3 million people use cannabis for medical purposes every day so we know about its safety we know it can work yet for whatever reason nice has come out with a guidance that says we shouldn't use it because they don't think there's enough evidence which is actually nonsense what they've done as matt said earlier is look at it as a pharmaceutical product you can take aspirin and you can compare it against placebos if it works for a headache but you can't do that with a plant so a plant needs assessing of its uh efficacy and its safety in a different way and there's a huge amount of evidence that shows that cannabis medical cannabis can be useful for pain for anxiety and particularly for today for childhood epilepsy that evidence is overwhelming yet they've chosen to ignore it because why do you think that is professor barnes why have they chosen to i mean you're an expert in this field you said the research is there why are they choosing to ignore it i think they're looking at it as a pharmaceutical medicine they're trying to push it down a pharmaceutical route they say there's not enough double-blind trials which means that the patient and the doctor don't know what they're taking and they can assess that properly and that's true we do need more studies i'm not saying there's enough evidence for cannabis but there is plenty of evidence out there and you've got to think of these children have used every possible licensed medication they've been considered for things like diets and surgery and the doctors turned around and said there's nothing more we can do so why in those circumstances were the evidence and the safety don't doctors prescribe cannabis which we know works really well for many people who try it so professor when you weigh up the benefits against the uh concerns and we're talking about the lives of charlie and and alfie there what is your conclusion what would you say to charlie and alfie's parents about what they're doing and how they are finding the results that they are seeing but it doesn't surprise me that the children like alfie uh have made a remarkable improvement on cannabis uh and the important thing about it for any doctor prescribing is whether it's safe and we know that when it's prescribed sensibly by a qualified and knowledgeable doctor then cannabis is remarkably safe it's not the right medicine for everybody we know who to use it for and who not to use it for but for heaven's sake for the children who've tried everything else let's try cannabis see if it helps them describe it sensibly and let's get on and many many of those children will be improved immeasurably matt let's talk about your campaign again against them against nice bringing them to court department of health and social care they're saying at this today they say the decision on whether to prescribe medical cannabis is ultimately one for the clinicians to make now that that obviously is true but it's not happening so so they say well you can if you want so why is it not happening well again it just goes back to the guidelines so charlie you know there's different regulators so you've got the british pediatric neurology association with their guidelines on prescribing cannabis now charlie does meet then those guidelines as do you know hundreds of other children um but they're still not receiving the medicine so ultimately it just goes back to the nice guidelines they're just too restrictive and it doesn't you know cannabis is very new to doctors in the uk and it's new to trust and they just don't have the confidence uh to prescribe until nights then regulatory bodies kind of open up and start allowing hannah one of the things one of the concerns is it's often cited yes but you could be leading these children to being stoned what would you say to that um i would say come and have a look at these children when they've had seizures and they've been in hospital highest kites on pharmaceuticals i've seen my child stoned out of his mind on steroids and global zam and loads of other horrible pharmaceuticals that he used to have to take when he had that hundreds of seizures every week he's not like that now if you use as professor barnes said if you use medical cannabis correctly if you use high cbd and low thc products for children with epilepsy all they do is have happy lives their seizures are reduced my child is a happy little boy who is you know getting so much more out of life and that's why i campaign in this way so you know ardently because it's not fair you know if my child can have this prescription then all these children and what i would say is that these children have been on private prescriptions for 18 months they are the evidence they are showing their doctors every day that their children seizures are reduced that they're not in hospital they're not in intensive care and these doctors are saying well we're not allowed to prescribe and that's the problem trusts have no confidence they are not allowing their doctors to prescribe they are blocking their doctors and this is just unacceptable and as you say we've heard matt hancock's platitudes in the house is common saying oh yes doctors can prescribe it's nonsense it's not true and matt hancock is responsible for this mess he has promised us 18 months ago to sort it out for these families and actually what he's doing he's ignoring us we've written to him we've told him legally how he can help these families and he's ignoring us he can actually set up a fund like david cameron did for the cancer trust um some years ago for cancer treatments he can do that he can help these families but he's choosing not to and he's utterly disgraceful that he's turning his back on these vulnerable people and um last word to you matt how much is it costing you and your family to to provide um charlie who's only three with with cannabis paying it for it privately so initially right at the beginning you know 18 months ago we were looking at 500 pound per bottle um but as time has gone uh the prices have reduced so it's currently 300 pounds uh a month that we're paying yeah professor professor i'm listening to all of this and i'm i'm hearing from the medical authorities that they're worried about the risk what about the risk there is to humans on this and i'm looking at two parents talking about their two children and those children could die at any stage during the day they have multiple fits sometimes over a hundred fits could the risk of cannabis really be worse than the risk of not prescribing them cannabis no cannabis is is remarkably safe we know there are some people who shouldn't be prescribed cannabis those for example with schizophrenia or psychosis but for the great majority of the population it's quite safe to prescribe by responsible doctor who knows and understands cannabis and we shouldn't forget there's more we know about the safety of cannabis than any other medicine in the history of man and the reason for that is 165 million people on this earth use cannabis every day for medical spiritual recreational purposes 165 million people there's not any pharmaceutical product that can be introduced that has that depth of experience and knowledge of its safety profile it's not safe for everyone but it's safe for the great majority and it works for the great majority we must try it thank you for your analysis professor um hannah and matt thank you uh really interesting to hear your story everybody will have an opinion on it but just imagine if you were in their situation of you in the situation of mad and hannah what would you do you", "O2MQENqN9no": "we hear a lot about the benefits of medical marijuana but now one group is focused on a very specific demographic joining us today from elementa marin is sherry mateo thank you so much for joining us today my pleasure and your group is focused on menopausal women and the benefits of medical marijuana why well because medical marijuana can really be a benefit in perimenopause and menopause cannabis can help with things like anti anxiety insomnia it has anti-inflammatory effects so it can help with chronic pain or just even your basic aches and pains that's some of us feel every morning and it can also help get our endocannabinoid system back into balance it has cannabinoids in it cannabinoids are chemicals that are found naturally in the plant we have a system in our bodies called the endocannabinoids system when we're in menopause or perimenopause our hormones are all out of whack the endocannabinoid system is thought to be able to hopefully bring us back into balance even though our hormones are out of balance so what do you say to women who say listen I'm a grandma I don't want to walk around high all the time so there are many different chemicals in the cannabis plant and they have different effects the most famous one is THC that's the one that's psychotropic and that's the one that gets you high but there are other chemicals that are really beneficial to our health one of them that's also really well known now is CBD otherwise known as cannabidiol so for women particularly who don't want to get high they can choose a high CBD compound which will knock at them high at all or if they do want to get some of the benefits from THC because THC is beneficial in other ways than just being psychotropic they can do what we call micro dosing which is taking very small amounts throughout the day just to get your system in balance now do you need a prescription from a doctor or should you get should you work with a doctor before experimenting with this specifically for menopause that's a really excellent question and it's quite frankly a difficult one to answer it would be great if doctors and nurses could give us more advice about the endocannabinoid system but the truth of the matter is this was only discovered in the 1980s and so has not been taught in nursing or medical schools another concern for some especially considering the air quality we're experiencing is inhaling smoke we know that smoke is a carcinogen do folks who use medical marijuana for these purposes need to actually smoke it no absolutely not cannabis is available in so many different forms at this point you can have tinctures you can have edibles you can smoke or you can vape and vaping and smoking are slightly different the reason why people smoke cannabis is because in the raw plant itself THC is not present THC is present in a precursor form it doesn't become THC the psychoactive component until it's heated to a certain temperature so smoking it heats it turns it into the psychoactive component which makes you high so depending upon how the marijuana is used it can either catch you higher or not and remember there are over a hundred cannabinoids in cannabis and each one of them we're just beginning to find the different effects that they can have how interesting well certainly a lot to learn and you guys have a gathering coming up in the Bay Area yes we have gatherings every month and we have them throughout the bay area we have one on November 28th which is Wednesday night at 7 o'clock at neighborly that one is actually in San Francisco and then I have one in Marin and the same night at yoga works Larkspur landing and I'm going to be talking about yoga and meditation and cannabis thank you so much for joining us today we learned a lot about cannabis and medical marijuana thank you so much for your very welcome thank you so much for having me", "2cJle9bsfV8": "Well there's a long history of research looking at the effects of cannabis in Parkinson's Cannabis extract contains lots of chemicals and most of the directed research is focused on two main components which is THC and cannabidiol THC or tetrahydrocannabinol\nis the psychoactive compound so that's the compound that will give you the high\nor the hallucinations and obviously that's not a desired effect! And if you take THC\nin combination with cannabidiol actually that reduces that effect of the\ncannabis to some extent We've been quite interested in the past and looking at the effect of cannabis in Parkinson's We did a study using an extract of THC and\ncannabidiol together in a capsule form to see whether there was any benefit for\ndyskinesia and unfortunately didn't show there was any benefit at all for dyskinesia We asked patients whether they felt better in terms of other symptoms There was a suggestion actually that cannabis extract THC and cannabidiol together might be of benefit for sleep or pain and those are aspects that\nwe're hoping to explore more There are also possible neuroprotective benefits\nof cannabis - in the lab work that we've done we've looked particularly at THC and shown that it has protected nerve cells from dying in our cell\nculture model, and we're hoping to build on that in in animal models. And it seems\nto work on particular pathways which we know are important in Parkinson's - so THC\ncan rescue mitochondria (which are the engine houses of the cell) - protect them\nfrom being damaged and it also influences a pathway which is known as\nthe PGC1 Alpha Pathway which we know is important. The\nwork we've done to date has been in cell culture models.

walked us through how CBD is extracted from a cannabis plant to oil first it goes to a co2 extractor and is further separated with ethanol we're gonna separate the waxes and fats and we don't want in the product from the cannabinoids that we do want to see VD smell then the ethanol is separated in what's called a rotary evaporator that's usually about 75 to 80 percent cannabinoid content so what is this machine this is a white film evaporator we're loading that cannabinoid content that we just got out of the rotary evaporator into here and we're gonna let that content seep down into this jacket right here so you'll get CBD testing it then 90 to 99 percent purity and we'll test it right after this but that's going to be very high quality products and we call it that the money jar and this idea you might have a little bit as well okay for testing just to see can you extract it more from here absolutely her choreography we can extract it and make it isolated to be booty recessive teen performs a series of tests to know what they're making oil this is just a base and we can make into whatever we need to make out of it what you're gonna make creams tinctures who can make pills CBD can also be crystallized this is the crystallized form in the powder form of that no THC in here strictly CBD is testing at 99.9 percent purity then put into a product and shipped out to consumers buying into the CBD trend for today Kristen Dahlgren NBC News Denver you", "WWHzW6PadtU": "welcome to episode 7 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tommy Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist looking looking you just beside the wall Soni in today's episode we're gonna learn how to make rice crispy treat we're gonna use rice krispies but you can use any of these cereals so cool today's episode is sponsored by black-market marijuana support your local ganja preneur a friend with weed is a friend indeed for your edibles you can use Keith's good ol mary-jane BHO or cannabutter if you have we're using cannabis that's the bottom rack did today's recipe only requires a few ingredients we have Rice Krispies cereal a 10 ounce bag of marshmallows you can use either mini marshmallows or regular-sized marshmallows we have some kosher salt some vegetable spray and if you'd like you can use food coloring I could use a little color let's start the recipe we need to find a way to get the weed to the paper [Music] we're gonna start really simple we're gonna turn our stove on to low I'm using my induction cooktop but if you're using the stovetop you just want to make sure you use a heavy bottomed pan and set your temperature on low some people don't like it as cold as I do but I don't care so I've already measured these this is our homemade cannabutter you're gonna use four tablespoons of your butter or a quarter of a cup you want to make sure your butter melts completely before you add the marshmallow make sure to spray your spatula with some vegetable spray that'll ensure that once you add the marshmallows it doesn't stick - looks like our canna butter is already melted we're gonna go ahead and open the marshmallows and put them right in what is this gluttonous monstrosity before me add a 10 ounce bag of mini marshmallows or again regular marshmallows and if you happen to make your own marshmallows it's actually be about 12 ounces or a cup and a half let's go ahead and add these I know it looks like a lot of marshmallows but it definitely is going to melt down you want to make sure to continuously stir this once everything has melted we'll take it off the heat and we'll add the rice krispies cereal the reason why I use mini marshmallows is because I find that they melt a lot quicker than a regular-sized marshmallows you want to continuously stir it so that all the marshmallows melts evenly this is not the kind of thing that you walk away from you want to constantly stir it and watch it to make sure it doesn't burn now once this is completely melted we're going to take it off the stove and we'll add the rice krispies cereal at that time if you wanted to add food coloring you could or if you wanted to add any kind of chocolate chips or sprinkles or something like that you could do it at that time too now once this is done some people like to move the marshmallow mixture into a separate Bowl and mix the rice krispies into it but I've picked a large enough pan where I can just go ahead and add it directly to the pan and I definitely recommend that you want a nice wide pot so that all the rice crispy cereal fits into it and it's just easier to mix the marshmallows have completely melted I'm going to turn this off and pull it away from the heat and you got to say how many marshmallows he can fit into your mouth here we have 6 cups of rice krispies I'm just gonna add it to the marshmallow remember we've removed it off of the heat so we're gonna just put that right in there and to this I'm also going to add a quarter of a teaspoon of kosher salt anytime you make anything sweet or anything really when you add salt it really brings out the flavor in it if you wanted to you could add food coloring as well but I'm not going to whatever those rules aren't real and as you can see some of the Rice Krispies are dry and some of them are getting some of that delicious marshmallow so you really just want to work it let me work it so that all of the Rice Krispies cereal is coated with that yummy cannabutter marshmallow mixture that we made I want to make sure that all of the rice krispies are nice and coated a good indication of that is they kind of have a nice Sheen to it or shine what I see no more shines maybe you didn't hear about it you've been away a long time didn't go up that day and that's how you know that the marshmallow has covered every little last speck and that will have nice adhesion last thing you want to do is have your rice krispies treat fall apart on either no napkins or nothing you do like this you like that so again you can do this with any cereal Froot Loops fruity pebbles even Kashi if you wanted to do a healthier version ain't nobody got time for this so as you can see here everything is very nicely coated and what you want to do here is work fast we're gonna take this away and then we'll get a 9 by 13 pan that we will also spray with vegetable spray and we're going to put all those rice krispies right in there you want a normal size or a big fatty Oh every little inch of this you will really want to give it a nice coating because once the rice krispies is dry it'll make it easier to pop them right out pop pop pop pop now we're just gonna go ahead and sum all of this right in here really the part that gets tricky is putting this into this mold what I usually do is I start off with the spatula and then I will go ahead and spray my hands and press it in to the pan I find it does a better job so here we go all right and if you can see that makes it a lot easier with the [ __ ] dog man you can also do these in the sheet pan if you wanted to make thinner rice krispies and I have a rolling pin that I use and since the sheet pan is a lot flatter I usually just take the rolling pin and just roll it right over what the heck are you talking about these are what they look like when they're completely pressed into the pan and since they're still warm we're gonna decorate them with some sprinkles since it's 4/20 we're gonna go ahead and use purple in green light green sprinkles give it a nice green luminescent look to it and then we're gonna add some purple as well we've allowed the Rice Krispies cereal treats to cool down and what you're gonna do is you're going to either use a knife or I'm actually gonna use an offset spatula a what I want to do is you want to just Anderson it around the edges this should come out pretty easily since we already greased the pan I'm just gonna flip this over the Silpat that I have underneath it has measurements on it which will allow me to cut this fairly precisely fingers crossed oh it's fine that a serrated knife cuts it really smoothly so you want to try to cut them as evenly as possible it doesn't have to be perfect they're gonna taste amazing I wish that I could make a cake made out of rainbows and smiles and we'd all eat happy I finished cutting all the rice krispies treats if you'd like you can put them away by wrapping them individually in plastic wrap and that'll make them last longer in this house they won't last that long I just like to put them on a plate they look so delicious and they're really soft to the touch but they have like a nice stiffness to it well you know what we don't need to put this one on there there's plenty but I just want to show you here we have our delicious rice krispies treat 200 milligrams six of these you have this beautiful sheen from the marshmallow and the can of butter you have this nice denseness from when we pressed all those rice krispies together you still have a little bit of the chewiness and that give yeah Jesus Christ have you ever heard of don't get high on your own supply thank you for joining us for episode 7 of mmm medical edibles we

okay so today I am doing a video on my top 5 CBD creams I've been loving the CBD oil but I am training for a 10k which I know is not a marathon but still I run outside and running on the pavement often hurts my knees so I'm was looking for a solution that I could apply on the you know pain area directly and so CBD cream seemed to fit the bill and actually it worked really well and I'm really glad I tried it so I want to share with you my top 5 today so if after this review you want to try CBD creams as well just click on the link in the video description for the best CBD deals alright so in fifth place I put met Tara's CBD rapid cooling cream these guys are for the cream in two strengths we've got the 250 milligram at $44.99 and the 750 milligrams at 70 799 their cream is a blend of CBD menthol and arnica and that's what provides that rapid cooling effect and really helps with joint and muscle discomfort I just rub it on my knees right after a run and it provides instant relief and usually it lasts for a couple hours and then after that the pain is gone for the day also with this one the menthol smell isn't too strong so you can just apply it after a shower in the morning and head off to work no problem and as with all other matera products these guys are 100% natural and organic they don't contain any THC they are made in the US and they provide the 30-day money-back guarantee in 4th place we have nano crafts cooling sports cream this one is $59.99 for 500 milligram which is great if you need an in-between dosage from Matara this one has a pump dispenser like the matera one so that makes it really easy to dose and apply the cream this one is also made in the US with non-gmo all organic ingredients meaning that it doesn't contain any pesticides herbicides or chemical fertilisers etc and they also provide the 30-day money-back guarantee in third place we have another product from nano crafts it's the muscle and joint bundle so this one is great if you're already convinced and want to take it one step further so this bundle includes the broad spectrum CBD soft gel capsules with curcumin these are packed with 25 milligrams of CBD which is perfect for daily and consistent consumption to make sure that you have a smooth start to your day they also have the broad-spectrum pure CBD drops which are also packed with 25 milligrams of CBD another way to consume CBD if you're out of capsules you can just take a few drops as is there ginger sytrus flavored or you can simply add to a protein shake or a post-workout snack and the third product is the broad spectrum muscle and joint stick that's loaded with 500 milligrams a full spectrum hemp oil that's great for on-the-go application if you're feeling some discomfort you know as you're working out outside and that's usually two hundred and fifty dollars but they're selling it for 195 but again if you want the best prices click the link in the video description it gets updated regularly with the best deals alright moving on to number two which is the ultra relief gel from just CBD just CBD is one of my favorite CBD brands they have a ton of product variety to choose from so the ultra relief gel comes at $59.99 for a thousand milligrams of CBD this one is great if you're looking for big CBD dosage at an affordable price the smell is not overpowering the pump makes it really easy to use and you can really feel the cooling sensation in this one I really recommend it for like intense pains so if anything is keeping you up at night then that's probably a good gel to buy and then in first place I chose the CBD infused pain cream so this one comes at 1199 for a hundred milligrams of CBD that's a really good option for like small pains but is also super affordable if you're just looking to get started or unsure about CBD in general then you might want to you know get started with this one and see how you feel and then just work your way up to a bigger dosage this is also a really good option if you're not comfortable with the oil format it's really easy to use and spread on your area of pain I started to feel the effects about 15 to 20 minutes after I applied the cream after my run and then I was good for the day so I really recommend this cream or any of the five that I listed in this video if you've got any aches and pains or just if you have if you often have pain after an intense workout or just starting to feel the effects of age then I really recommend you to try CBD creams and let me know how it goes in the comments all right if you want the best deals

Angel's anything show thanks for coming on over it's good to see you today is a very special episode because I am gonna go through some items in this beautiful box that was not sent to me I picked it up nobody sent nobody sent anything in the mail but this beautiful box that I procured and I'm just gonna get into with you look I'm not saying if you want to get on my good side you have to help me acquire marijuana cannabis products but look it doesn't hurt I'm totally kidding basically um there's this couple out of Maine that follow my channel I think they may be found me from this jarred jam music festival review I did or something anyway New England fam we sing together especially fish fam or just jam band fam you guys know what to do they started following me on like Facebook I think um and then I started following them on Instagram and I saw that they have this THC CBD confectionary situation going on I picture it like them living on this big piece of land in Maine and just like in their sugar shack like the making of the candies but I don't know and then I shouted him out in my end of your vid I forget exactly what I said there's this really cool couple at watch that live in Maine and they make like CBD [ __ ] candies if you ever want me to review any of those for you on the channel like I'm happy to and they hit me up shortly thereafter saying that they had some stuff that they wanted me to try so I was very excited and also that was happening when I was going through my dry spell like a week ago that you guys saw and it was like it was like water in a desert you know what I got this box instantly I was like wow look at this this effort put in now if you're not hip to the scene you wouldn't know that this is a fish kind of a fish pattern the drummer always wears a dress with the same pattern but that's not even the coolest part looked underneath how cool when I saw how cool the outside of the box was I knew the inside can only cooler and it was now I already ate quite a bit of what was in here so I can't review everything but they wrote a very sweet note in the box which I was very touched by Oh see you the only one is left these are the three two one THC CBD fruit punch now these these are the three two one CBD to THC now I am not sure how many milligrams any of this stuff is but I always just say there was only one way to know you know you throw down the hatch so I'm gonna do one of these because I'm going out a little bit later and I just you know why are you relaxed my life is very stressful mmm you know the candy itself is very delicious I'm tasting a little coconut oil base am I wrong very good not it's like sweet and tasty but not like gross you know nice green apple flavor like I'm not [ __ ] candy connoisseur rouse them and this was tasty too and okay they sent to Wally's lollies they sent to lollipops I ate those as soon as they send them I had one oh my god half an hour later I just felt like there was like a warm wrap around my skull I was like I feel [ __ ] good a minute slowly faded away and I didn't feel tired afterwards I didn't feel tired at all so I said bucket if one was a gun second one's gonna get had that same thing happened oh yeah that's something I noticed with the other candy - it's like you feel high but like everything feels like it just feels like a warm blanket you know it's nice now the store which I didn't even mention the name of the store the store is called High Times confection they're on Instagram I'll link it below check it out even if you just like looking at pictures of delicious weed candy which I'm a fan of if you like to torture yourself because apparently South Dakota is gonna legalize weed before New Hampshire of course I'm a legal cannabis patient so naturally naturally and 21 plus 21 plus ok so this is hemp CBD one to oneself I think you say solve just most like nice lotion I used once I don't know if it's supposed to be like a pain relieving or just like a nice lotion if you guys want to let me know ok so I've saved the best thing for last this is a two to one THC CBD suppository and each depository is 20 milligrams of THC and 10 milligrams of CBD so pretty nice a suppository you don't know goes either up the ass or up the vagina I was thinking this would be fantastic for cramps and then I had a horrible cramps the other day and I got to tell you the last thing I felt like doing was sticking Li hand of a bloodied vagina so I I just was like it was a war zone down there so I stayed away I mean I put a tampon that was about it there was no room for anything else dan and I are doing the float tomorrow night and I thought Oh like the sleep perfect I'll do the suppository I'll go to the float I'll be nice and high and then I'll report back do a little bit of a product review is but I need your help guys I need your help should I put this up the V or the V and I'm gonna post on Instagram now asking you and I'm gonna have you boat and then whatever you vote is what I'll do and this is how you really need to be following my Instagram for this type of content okay it's the next day and the results are in actually the results were very mixed a lot of people said but a lot of people said vag a lot of people said why not both actually that was like the most popular answer so I went with the but for now but then maybe in the future we can drive the vagina okay so anyway we are heading to a float I'm going back to NH folks and I inserted the suppository I don't know it was hard like it wasn't in an actual pill so I like you know I don't know but I washed my hands with soap after so hopefully that's you know I don't want to contaminate the tank okay so I'll let you know how it goes I know you're not supposed to get like super header high more of a body high but this should be perfect for the float so we'll see all right guys we're post float post depository I'm super relaxed no obviously that's partially because of the float but I will say that once I like got into the tank whatever I was really easily able to kind of just slip into a relaxation and fall asleep and it was maybe one of the best naps I've had in the tank since I started floating the suppository insertion like I think I need to get a little more clarity on that I'm assuming I don't put like the actual plastic inside I feel like that'd be a bad idea but I think I need to get a little more precise like with placement and squeeze through technique but I'm gonna do it of the V next time because I think it would be so good for cramps but I'm feeling a super great super relaxed and gonna go home and make another meal delivery kit which you'll be seeing all about that soon so okay guys thank you for watching this episode of and slating show see you next time goodbye a lot of you wanted me to put it in the B some of you wanted me to put it in the B and the rest you wanted me to put it in the BMV I probably will cut some of this out but", "g7bApQhA1H8": "on today's video I'm going to teach you how to make cannabis infused butter or oil in the instant pot so we're gonna talk about why to use an instant pot how to do it I'm gonna give you a quick demonstration as well and then just so you know the instructions for this recipe are printed below so you don't have to write anything down hi my name is Andrea hard I'm a cannabis coach and educator and I post new videos here every Saturday morning I also offer private consultations over the phone in-person workshops around the London Ontario area and online classes from the comfort of your own home okay let's talk about why we use an instant pot well this is the number one advantage the instant pot internal temperature gets to 242 degrees Fahrenheit which is literally perfect for D carving and infusing and it's a nice constant steady temperature so you don't have to worry about fluctuations it also makes it so that it's really not all that smelly at all infusing in your instant pot in a mason jar is way less alerting to your neighbors then doing it say on the stovetop or in a crock pot and it is crazy quick this is why people love the instant pot or any kind of pressure cooker in general is because it makes things really fast the first step in the process is to deke our beer cannabis and that turns your THCA and cbda into THC and CBD which is what you want you don't have to grind it first you're just gonna put it into a mason jar close it up finger tight and put that into a bath in the instant pot where the bath water is about halfway up the jar so if your jars halfway full make sure that the water is halfway up the jar as well and you're gonna set it to 40 minutes on manual then let it release for 10 minutes natural pressure release and then release the rest of it pressure yourself and you have d carb cannabis in a flash you don't have to infuse this cannabis you could just use this d carb cannabis as a sprinkle on top of spaghetti or you could put it into capsules the point is you could use it right now as a ste carb you don't have to infuse but if you want to the instant pot is great for that as well so now you're gonna lightly grind the bud you're not trying to make it into powder you're just trying increase the surface area slightly add in your oil or butter make sure that it's melted first and make sure that there's at least of enough liquid to cover the cannabis that you have in there the more liquid you add the less potent your infusion will be then put that mason jar back in the instant pot and it's a little bath for 40 minutes on manual again ten minutes natural pressure release then open it up and strain it or not and you have cannabis infused oil or butter which is amazing super fast much much faster than any other way as for storage you can keep your your all of your abusers always in a dark and cool place butter should be kept in the fridge or freezer and coconut oil could be kept on the counter or also in the fridge the great thing about infusing cannabis into oil or butter is that it allows the cannabis to last for so much longer it doesn't degrade once it's infused into an infusion as for dosing there's no real precise way to find out exactly what's in your infusion unless you have it lab tested but for the home cook I have a little solution for you so this infusion calculator allows you to put in the information that you know about your cannabis and it will spit out how many milligrams of THC or CBD are in your infusion so I'm going to show that to you now this is at the wake-and-bake website and if you haven't been here before you should definitely check it out it's amazing so if you know the THC percentage of your plant material you can type it in because you have lab tested cannabis if you don't you can go to a site like Leafly and type in the strain name and get a general idea so you type in how many grams that you're gonna be using for my infusion that we're gonna do today I'm doing 14 grams into one cup of oil so I know that with my cannabis I'm gonna have 20 100 grams of THC and not very much of CBD and that in each teaspoon I have about 43 milligrams of THC so that's really helpful for me to have an idea of how potent my infusion is again this is not perfect there's lots and lots of variables to go on there but it's a great starting point and even if you have used the dosing calculator it is still really important that you start low and go slow and be your own guinea pig each infusion that you make might be slightly different and you don't want to have a really bad experience because you're going off of what you think will happen so I encourage you to keep a consumption journal and write down how does it make you feel how did you feel before you took it how long does it last keep all that in mind and that will help you really homey and Nona how potent your infusion is all right so let's get started I have here coconut oil you couldn't view this infuse this into butter or any kind of oil that you wanted but I'm going to use coconut oil this is sunflower lecithin we'll talk about this after this is bendy car and here I have my 14 grams of cannabis I'm gonna put this into its little water back in here again you want to make sure that the water in the pot is at least enough to cover what you have in the dark put the lid on and set the timer for 40 minutes and then walk away I'll see you in a bit as you can see my D carving is done it's already done about 10 minutes of natural pressure release and I'm gonna just let the rest of the pressure out open it up alright so I have some perfectly he D card to cannabis in here super hot careful when you're opening this so um D carbon cannabis will be a little bit browner than when you put it in your don't smell a little bit different once your cannabis is cooled off you're going to grind it up I have a coffee grinder here I have a separate coffee grinder for coffee or that would make for some very interesting morning the great thing about this method is that you can do it all in one meter so you're just gonna put this back in your mason jar then I have a cup of coconut oil that I've warmed up in the microwave first I'm also putting in a teaspoon of sunflower lecithin this helps to emulsify the mixture so that the cannabinoids don't separate from the oil it also helps the cannabinoids to enter your blood-brain barrier a little bit more quickly so it doesn't actually make it more potent but it does help to make it feel like it's working a little bit better however so I'm flower lecithin tastes like crap and you know I really hate it so I only had a teaspoon most people recommend a tablespoon to two tablespoons per cup but I recommend that you start low with that inserts and go slow and see how it goes for you then you just put it back in your jar and shake it up back in the instant pot before another bath of 40 minutes on manual and then we'll be done I've got my infused cannabis oil here you can now strain this using a cheesecloth make sure that you really squeeze the cheesecloth to get all the beautiful camera soil out you can then take that cheesecloth and dunk it in a tea and a pot of chai and then you can have some high chives there's still some medicinal benefit left in even the satchel of spent cannabis material but with this one I'm not even gonna strain it I started to add my unstrained cannabis oils and butters right into my baked goods and nobody seems to notice I'm gonna make this into cannabis infused protein bites and that

feel high if you've noticed your thc tolerance has skyrocketed then you might benefit from the occasional tea break thc the psychoactive and intoxicating compound cannabis is most known for works by affecting cannabinoid type 1 or cb1 receptors in the brain over time too much thc can weaken the cb1 receptors response to thc or reduce the amount of receptors altogether both lead to you needing to ingest more thc to feel desired effects a tolerance break from cannabis is a beautiful way to restore your endocannabinoid system so that when you welcome back mary jane the effects of cannabis can return to their full psychoactive potency and while two weeks is an ideal time frame perhaps try starting off with just a day taking a breather from weed can be difficult not necessarily physically

Canadian researchers say a strain of cannabis could treat and even prevent Kovan 19 when the pandemic hit dr. Igor and Olga Kovalchuk put their efforts into looking at how cannabis could be used to fight Cova 19 they join us this morning from Lethbridge Alberta good to chat with both of you this morning morning good morning so Igor your lab was already testing cannabis I understand strains to combat cancer and inflammation where are you at in your research with kovat 19 right so in the past five years we have developed over 1,500 strains of cannabis and have tested today about 400 and we have actually found around a dozen of cultivars that were able to substantially decrease the expression of the h2 receptor took one that is required by virus to enter ourselves and out of those about two three strains can do it by 75% or more and all go so what would be the next steps here and what made you think that you should make that shift and start to think about kovat 19 well I think we all started thinking about Kovach 19 and when it hit and really disrupted our routines so a lot of scientists like ourselves decided to take a look whether or not something that we already have as Igor said we were already testing cannabis for its biological effects may be helpful so and you know luckily we ended up having some of the very promising strains so right now what's most important for us is to actually find partnerships and develop clinical trials because thus far what we shall we show in the lab and it works in the lab but we have to absolutely have to do a clinical trial to show that it really does translate into clinic that it really works in the scale of clinical trial ego you say the strains you're testing your CBD predominate why does that make a difference in getting a clinical trial up and running faster right so there are many strains that can be active but the main reason is that if you have a psychoactive ingredients like THC in Canada then the dose that you can give is limited so it's limited typically by about 25 milligram of THC day and as I mentioned our strains are predominantly CBD so they have twenty to one ratio to THC so that allows us to give up to 500 milligrams of CBD a day and still be within 25 milligram of THC so that the patients are not or do not feel impaired and it's critically important for patient and for a doctorate 12 although what could be any side effects if any well cannabis is on its own has actually very good safety profile it has been studied its components have been studied very very well separately and so the because again the strains that we are talking about are CBD dominant they have really high levels of CBD and very low levels of psychoactive compound we do not predict there's gonna be any major impairment there of course could be some things like like more positive ones let's say anti-anxiety benefits and some betterment of sleep but those would be not really sight of those actually would be quite beneficial effects that people can sleep and there may be a little bit of improvement of appetite as well so some quality of life aspects may also be improved it's absolutely fascinating we'll be watching very closely your work dr. Igor and Olga Kovalchuk thanks for joining us this morning thank you for your interest thanks for watching if you liked this be sure to subscribe here and you can check out more your morning videos right here", "pAOZ1Z_KFrw": "so we have a regime in Canada where there's actually laws that allow for recreational use as well as for medicinal use and the medicinal side patients have to register and the cannabis use has to be authorized by a physician rise on the recreational side basically anybody can go and buy cannabis at an approved licensed location so you have two regimes which I believe creates some issues when it comes to use on the medical for medical purposes because patients basically have open access to cannabis what we're seeing is that there's this expectation and the patient side that cannabis is going to be this wonderful treatment for their pain and on the science side there isn't the evidence to truly support that and so I feel very strongly that there's a there's a need for well conducted trials to truly evaluate the benefit of cannabis in this setting but it's almost like the horses are out of the barn patients want it and we have to find ways to better educate patients engage them as well as do the research to actually show whether it's going to be helpful or not as health care professionals we are because the scientific evidence isn't there there isn't the knowledge to use cannabis for medical purposes pain management for example in this setting and so we have a large information gap from the perspective of cannabis and its use in the setting which product to use how much THC how much CBD the dose which way and it should be administered so there's a lot of questions that as healthcare professionals we have and yet again I go back to my comment earlier that patients still want to use it so we have to find a way to embedder engage patients so the consultation service at our Center was really the result of clinicians telling us they were having patients ask them about the use of cannabis for medical purposes in the oncology setting and not knowing what to tell them we had developed some expertise within the pharmacy department I basically went to them and said we can do this we refer patients to us we screen patients we try to better understand what the patient expectations are in terms of the use of medical cannabis or cannabis for medical purposes we assess them in terms of their symptoms and then we feel if there's a need for cannabis or that cannabis may be an option once traditional ways of managing that say pain have been exhausted then we lead the patient and the clinician through the process of registering with with the government approved grower choosing the products and then dosing the product helping the patient go through the dosing of the medication to see if it's going to benefit them we also follow the patient to assess whether it's working or whether it's having any side effects so in a nutshell that's the program we're trying to ensure the safe use of cannabis for medical purposes in our patients can stay with the medical the cannabis side I think there are I actually believe there is a role for cannabis in the management about adverse effects of chemotherapy and/or the symptoms that cancer can cause itself there's a tremendous amount of research that needs to be done and that's the exciting part in terms of understanding the underlying mechanisms in terms of side effects and how cannabis can be used to address or to target these underlying mechanisms so we have a research program that we have started looking at very specific adverse effects of chemotherapy that may be immune related and how cannabis can actually modulate the immune system to reduce the side effects for example taxane acute pain syndrome is a is an area that we're very interested in we think that potentially fatigue could be managed by cannabis certainly anxiety seems to be a really important issue with with our patients and we've had some success in managing anxiety with with cannabis in that setting through our consultation service sleep disorders also seem to be at least from our experience and the consultation service seem to be amenable to the use of cannabis as well so I think there's a potential for a broad range of uses once we have the research to prove it", "J42pmHV8ZEk": "Transcriber: Almudena Torrecilla\nReviewer: Rhonda Jacobs When I was 33 years old, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. And like so many who've gone before me, that diagnosis changed my life. It changed the way I look at the world. And it led me to two very common questions that one starts to ask when diagnosed\nwith a life-threathening illness. How did this happen? And what do I do now? Now this isn't a story\nabout self blame. These are just common\nand natural questions that come from many in times like these. I actually found the questions empowering. This is actually a story about how those\ntwo questions led to a realization that I think can help\nto change the conversation around what means to be and stay healthy. So back to my first question: how did this happen? See, (Sigh) I felt like I had done\neverything right. What do I mean by that? Well, if I ask you, what does\nit mean to be healthy, to live a healthy lifestyle? What kind of answers do you get? Regular exercise? Balanced diet? Taking your vitamins? Annual checkups? Limiting toxic exposure to chemicals,\npersonal care products? Well, by all of these\naccounts, I was healthy. I had done the work. So I was angry, and I was frustrated that I'd followed the rules\nand I still found myself sick. Now, I had a friend \nwho a few years earlier had been diagnosed with breast cancer. And when it came to being healthy, she put everyone I know to shame. So I knew she would understand\nhow I was feeling. When we got together, \nshe told me something that would eventually change the way \nI think about health. She told me that her journey \nhad taken her to a place where she believed whole-heartedly  that she had not in fact \nbeen truly healthy. Not at a whole person level because \nshe'd overlooked taking care of herself at the level of her thoughts \nand her emotions. So what she was saying \nhad some subjective merit to me because I can relate to suppressing\nmy own thoughts and emotions maybe in order to please others, or taking on the stress\nof trying to juggle a thousand things. But then the pragmatist in me just wanted to brush that off\nas a little too woo-woo. Then again I had, you know, tackled all of these. And here she was standing\nright in front of me, the picture of health and vitality. So what could it hurt\nto look into this a little further? So down I went through\nrabbit hole number one: mind-body medicine. And for those who of you don't know, mind-body medicine\nstudies how our mind, mood, thoughts and emotion affect our body. So that would be things like \nstress management, stress reduction, like going for a walk in nature, \nunplugging from technology, getting a massage, meditation, (Sigh) mindful breath-work, and thought and belief awareness. So this would be something as simple\nas being more mindful of our thoughts, or something more concrete \nlike cognitive behavioral therapy, where you become actively aware\nof your thoughts and behaviors and then replace them\nwith more positive alternatives that in turn elicit\nmore positive emotions. I also started delving into stories that highlight the mind's ability\nto affect the body. Like the peer-reviewed account\ndocumented by Dr. Klockner in 1959 about a man who he called Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright was diagnosed\nwith terminal cancer and given only days to live. With tumors the size of oranges \nhe had heard or a horse serum that was said to be effective\nagainst cancer and he begged to receive it. His physician, Dr. Philip West,\nreluctantly agreed but was astonished to find\nless than a week later his patient was out of his death bed \nand joking with his nurses. Now, this went on for months until Mr. Wright read a newspaper article stating that the serum was a quack remedy and he suffered an immediate relapse. Now, Dr. West, testing out a hypothesis, said: \"Well, don't believe everything\nyou read in the papers,\" and then he proceeded\nto inject him with what he said was a super-refined, double-strength\nversion of the drug. Really it was water. \nBut again, the tumors melted away. Mr. Wright was the picture of health\nand vitality for another two months until he read what he felt\nwas a definitive report stating that the serum was worthless, \nand he died days later. Now, this is just one of thousands\nand thousands of examples that highlight how the mind\ncan affect the body. And, so I had my anecdotal evidence, which\nincluded the example of my own friend, and I'd like to say that I took\nwhat I learned and put it into practice and lived happily ever after. Of course, that's not what happened. And I don't think I'm alone in that, because many of us hear about how stress\nand emotions can affect our health and how mindfulness meditation\ncan make a difference in our lives and all of that, but many of us also \ndon't do anything about it. I had the stories and the theories, but what I really needed\nwas hard evidence, science to prove that it was true. I mean, we've all grown up\nin a world of, you know, Newtonian, science-based thinking, meaning if we can't see it\nor measure it, then it's not real. So I, like maybe, maybe many of you, didn't start to put these ideas\ninto practice just yet. What I did, and this is now getting into \nthe second of the two questions that I alluded to earlier,\nthe \"What do I do now?\". What I did is I started using\nmedical cannabis at the recommendation\nof my nurse and other patients. And it helped immensely with pain \nand nausea and anxiety and all of the really fun staff\nthat come along with cancer treatment. I also started joining online\nmedical cannabis user communities. And I was in awe at the spectrum of issues\nthat cannabis was helping with. Intractable illnesses that weren't\nresponding to other forms of treatment, like MS, fibromyalgia, PTSD,\nTourette syndrome, IBS, epilepsy, chronic pain, autoimmune\ndiseases ... I could keep going. The list goes on. But I started to wonder, how was it\nthat cannabis was helping with all of these unrelated conditions, because I can't think of another\nmedication out there that would be able to help \nwith so many illnesses. So how did it work? Well, down I went\nthrough rabbit hole number two, and this was a deep hole. In a nutshell, I learned that the reason that cannabis was working \nfor so many different conditions is because it interacts directly with \nour body's own endocannabinoid system. The endocannabinoid system is\na little known but massive bodily system responsible for maintaining homeostasis,\nthat's balance, in the body. It consists of a network of \nneurotransmitters called endocannabinoids as well as receptor sites, the most well-known being the CB1 and CB2\nreceptors, and enzymes. Think of it kind of like\nthe traffic lights of a city, keeping the streets moving smoothly. But if a light goes out anywhere,\nit will cause problems. Congestion, confusion. Cars and people will keep moving, \nbut without the guidance and the rules, the flow just won't be as efficient \nand far more susceptible to accidents. It's actually been called the most\nprolific and integrative system in human health and homeostasis, and even dubbed\nour body's own master system because of its role in maintaining balance\namong all the other systems of the body. Now, this is important because all illness\ncan in fact essentially be boiled down to some sort of imbalance in the body, whether genetically induced or otherwise. Now, if you haven't heard of this system\nbefore, you're not alone. And if you are hearing about it \nfor the first time, you may be wondering why on earth you haven't heard of this\nepically important system until now. And it's partly because it's newly\ndiscovered in around the 1980s, but also partly because\nof the stigma around cannabis, for which the system is named. Because scientists discovered the system when they were trying to answer\nthat same question: \"how does cannabis work?\" So they learned that compounds in the\ncannabis plant called phytocannabinoids actually fit near perfectly\nwith the receptor sites of the endocannabinoid system. So used properly, this plant\ncan help to activate, tone and support the endocannabinoid\nsystem when it's out of balance. So it's a pretty amazing plant. To say I became obsessed with\ncannabis and the endocannabinoid system is an understatement. I buried myself in research papers,\nlectures, courses, certifications, learning everything I could about cannabis as well as ways to keep\nthe endocananbinoid system itself healthy and balanced. Because while it's easy to say, \"wow, look at this amazing\nplant that we have; it's able to help\nwith all these chronic conditions and balance the body,\" and obviously I believe that; I've dedicated part of my life\nto spreading the message that cannabis is medicine. But it's equally important\nto look beyond cannabis as a single cure. Because when you look closer, you'll see\nthat cannabis is an important ally, but it's only part of the puzzle. So, let's use that example again\nas the endocannabinoid system and the traffic lights. Except for in this scenario, cannabis\nis like the friendly police officer that comes in to direct traffic\nwhen the lights are out. So the officer's doing their best, and certainly it's helping to keep traffic\nmoving in a more organized manner, but we still have to figure out\nor at least try to figure out how to fix the lights. So how do we go about fixing the lights? How do we support and heal\nthe endocannabinoid system when it's out of balance? Well, it just so happens\nthat one review study in particular looked at 325 other studies that all focused on what helped\nand hindered the endocannabinoid system by focusing on key\nendocannabinoid health factors, and here's what they learned\ndirectly affect the system. Exercise, and notice I wrote\n\"Pleasurable Exercise\" there - it has to be something\nthat you enjoy doing. Okay? Diet and supplements.\nSo a couple examples that I'll give you. Herbs and spices contain\nsmall amounts of phytocannabinoids, the same compound that cannabis contains. And certain healthy fats can actually\nhelp your body to synthesize its own endocannabinoids. Environmental exposures. So some pesticides will actually\ndownregulate the endocannabinoid system, have a direct effect with it. There are a few others\nI'm going to share with you. But before I do, I just want to bring\nyour attention to a sentence that really jumped out at me\nwhen I was reading this study. It said that the endocannabinoid system represents a microcosm\nof psychoneuroimmunology. And I had to look that last word up. In case some of you don't know,\nI'm going to break it down. Psychoneuroimmunology is the study of the interaction\nbetween the psychological processes, \"the mind,\" and the systems\nof the body, \"the body.\" So really it's just a fancy way of saying\nthat metaphorically speaking, the endocannabinoid system represents\na microcosm of mind-body medicine. So now hopefully you can see\nwhere this is all coming full circle and coming together, I hope. Because here's what else was shown\nto affect the endocannabinoid system: Chronic stress. So they looked at stress from pain as well as stress\nfrom thoughts and emotions, so repeated feelings\nlike anger, guilt, depression - something that is chronic\nmeans more long-term. That was shown to significantly impact\nthe endocannabinoid system. And activities that elicit \nthe relaxation response. So that would be, again,\nkind of that walk in nature or doing some yoga, getting a massage. They consider osteopathic\nmanipulation in that study. So why does this matter? Well, I said before that we live\nin a physical world, so for many of us if we can't see it\nand measure it, then it's not real. I told about how I had heard stories\nabout how the mind can affect the body, but I still didn't give it the same weight\nthat I would give to nutrition and movement and medicine. But when I understood\nthat my own endocannabinoid system, my master system for maintaining\nhealth and homeostasis, required me to start taking care\nof my thoughts, my emotions, my stress, my beliefs, it finally clicked for me. So I want to leave you\nwith a scenario to imagine, an idea of how this information can help\nto change the conversation around health, like I said in the beginning. Imagine if the message that we heard from\nour physicians and public health officials sounded like this: \"Listen, what if I told you that there's\nthis really important bodily system, call it a master system, and if you can keep it functioning well, it can do wonders in allowing your body\nto innately keep itself healthy, heal itself and improve the quality of life for those\nwith biological and genetic illnesses.\" If I told you there was\na system like that, would you want to know\nhow to keep it strong and healthy? And I think most would answer yes to that. And then they would go on to say, \"Great, \nso think of this system like a stool. Each of the legs represents\nall that's required to keep the system functioning well. And here's why we compare it to a stool. Each of those legs is an integral part\nof keeping that stool stable and balanced. If we remove a leg, or even shorten a leg,\nthe whole stool starts to wobble and becomes less efficient,\nless stable, less balanced. So let's design a plan for you\nthat incorporates all of these concepts as part of a healthy lifestyle.\" Imagine. Not only is that proactive,\nbut it's empowering. And I invite all of you to consider\nwhere your stool is wobbling. It's been said that mindfulness could be\nthe next great public health revolution. I believe it's only a matter of time\nbefore mindfulness, stress reduction, thought-belief awareness is every bit\nas important as seeing your doctor, taking your vitamins, eating a balanced\ndiet and getting regular exercise. And maybe the endocannabinoid system\ncan help to catalyze that. It's my hope that the more we understand\nthe ramifications of this master system, the more we'd be willing to develop\na truly integrated approach to whole personal health. Who would have thought\nthat cannabis, the gateway drug, could actually form part of the gateway to\nthe next great public health revolution? Thank you.

I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "9ioJbVyNg08": "[Music] when I talk with people about cannabis they think they know everything about it everyone is familiar with the use of cannabis in medicine and I guess part of you are familiar with the use for other purposes in the last three years I'm managing one of the biggest and most advanced laboratory in the world for cannabis research if there is something I learned in these three years is that I don't know anything and that we are just starting to scratch the beginning of understanding this complex plant people are saying cannabis can kill cancer cells what's the meaning of it does it kill all types of cancers which cannabis in my lab alone I have more than 550 different strains of cannabis which one of them affect which types of cancer the truth we don't know that cannabis can really treat cancer or other diseases yes I assume it can a good friend of mine the head of the pain department in one of the biggest hospitals in Israel told me that when he started to treat with cannabis one of his first patient was an old lady they suffer from pain from chronic pain and nothing else helped her so he started to treat with cannabis and after a few weeks he called her and asked her how she was feeling Oh doctor it's great it's amazing it's totally changes my life he was surprised or weenie that it really eliminates the pain oh no doc for the painting didn't help but now my grandson coming to visit me every evening so how cannabis is affecting us so powerfully on the cannabis flowers there are cells that produce unique compounds these compounds called cannabinoids and these compounds are unique since our body can produce similar compounds actually in our body we have a special and important system called the endocannabinoid system this system regulate relax eat sleep forget and protect all these important processes and cannabis compounds affect our body through this machinery I will give you one example there is two ways to feel hunger one it through our stomach and one through our head when we are not eating for a long time our stomach shrink and we feeling hungry but how many times do we eat even when we are not hungry we're finishing a huge meal we cannot breathe with totally full and then come the dessert it is not your blame it's all the endocannabinoid system believe me using cannabis in medicine it's not something we invent in the last year's did you know that cannabis is one of the ancient plant human being used as a medicine the Chinese use it thousands of years ago as a major medicine the Egyptian use it to treat glaucoma on information till 1937 more than 100 illnesses were treated with cannabis if you will open a medicine book from 1920 and they did it important half year ago you will find out that the whole chapter is dealing with cannabis and illnesses so think about it it's crazy for 5,000 years it was the major medicine for mankind and in the last 80 years it just disappeared so how cannabis came back to the medical arena Charlotte Figi was born in 2006 in Colorado when she was three years old sorry when she was three months old she started to suffer from seizures she had more than 50 seizures a day till she was five years old she already tried every medicine on earth and nothing helped her by then she already lost her ability to walk talk and eat she was about to die when she started to use cannabis it's totally stopped her seizures from fifty seizures a day to one or two seizures a week and then totally eliminated shall not use cannabis with very low amount of THC the only compound that have psychoactive activity in the in the cannabis so actually he didn't made her to feel to be high or stoned but it still eliminate the seizures two months ago a guy came in my lab with a small bottle in his in his hand and asked for my help this guy Daniel told me that his wife had a small car accident four years ago and since then she started to suffer from seizures for a whole year she was in and out the hospital tried to find a medicine to help her to reduce the seizures after one year a friend of Daniel came with an extract that he did from cannabis and when Dania suave started to use it it stopped totally her seizures after 14 months this extract start to run down so Daniel came back to his friend to made a new one unfortunately the new one didn't work at all Daniel's wife used cannabis with low TT in high CBD like shallow but we have hundreds of strange like that every one of them contain different combinations of cannabinoids so actually it's a different medicine how can repeat how can we repeat the treatment for two years Daniel did hundreds of extract and did three months ago bingo he succeed to find the one that reduces wife seizures again when we started in my lab to work with cannabis and to check how its affect cancer we find out that there is a specificity between the types of the cannabis and its ability to attack cancer cells cannabis number one will kill colon cancer but will do no harm to prostate cancer but cannabis number two will do no harm to the colon cancer but will kill the prostate cancer but what are the differences between cannabis number one to cannabis number two what are the differences between the cannabis the Daniels wife is using now to the hundred she tried in the last two years you will be surprised to learn that nobody in the world can give you this answer even though there are over than 100 cannabinoids and a total of over than 500 active compounds in the cannabis we are we are able to identify just fuse them physician prescribed cannabis all over the world but on this prescription there is no specificity to the types of the cannabis not dosage or where was where of administration how can we repeat a success treatment if we don't know what are the compound the active compounds that affect the patient in order to answer part of this question we develop in my lab a unique method to under fight all the active compounds of cannabis today we are not blind anymore on top our basic research in cancer and in in oral disease we are doing we are running the database project in this project today in Israel every cannabis that the patient can get in Israel every time that a girl pick a batch or make an extract it's coming through my lab first and we're doing full identification on the other hand we are following up on the patient and trying to understand which type of cannabis effect which types of disease the idea is to merge these two arms and to say in these 30 strains these 30 strains elevate appetite in 80% of the patient what are the common compounds in these strains that are not existing the strength and not elevate appetite and to this to take to animal model clinical trial to make it evidence base two years ago we started to treat autistic kid very severe autistic kids in Israel with cannabis these kids most of them didn't communicate at all most of them not even in I contact this kid are very violent for themselves and the surroundings sometimes walking with their hand tied some time walking with the helmet on the head because they can knock the head to the wall and team they're fighting these kids getting cannabis with very no amount of THC the only psychoactive compound so they are not stoned or high but still we see a phenomenal result most 78% success with these kids on many parameters the cannabis reduce anxiety in these kids it reduced violence it's improved their sleep think about the child 17 years old they still seven times a night waking up every night with shouting and now he's sleeping all night but even the most incredible thing it's improved in the communication a mother called me and told me that her her son 19 years old kid was hospitalized for four years because his was very violent but two months just two months after he started to get cannabis he was released home because there was nothing to do with him in the hospital anymore when he came home it was an evening so his mother asked him what he wants for dinner and for the first time the first time in his life he looked in her eyes and said in egg this mother told me that you don't understand it's not that my child is normal now he didn't ask scrambled egg with onion but when from the moment he was born I'm reading stories to these kids I'm talking with him I'm asking questions he know what it is an egg he knows what he wants to eat I didn't waste all my life these things changed this family's life two months ago the companies that supply the extract the cannabis extract to these families had the problem with the crop it's a plant it didn't grow well so they had to create to produce an extract with similar strain again high CBD low THC ratio 20 to 1 so similar that this company so that they can say that it's actually as the original one but after few days the dream crashed these kids become violent again one kid went through went through the window when the window was closed and cut his body all over one kid jump on his mother 17 years old kid jump on his mother and beat her in a way that she had to get medical care and father called me less than two weeks ago and told me that his son had such a burst of violence that in order to control him by accident his broke his both hands since we have in our database exactly what these kids got before we were able immediately to identify the changes between the original strain to the strain they are getting now and to direct them to a different company that has similar cannabis to the original one for the first time we were able to help these kids to get the right treatment for the first time we are able to help Daniel's wife to understand what she is getting and to repeat the success treatment I am a scientist I have a laboratory for cancer research in the Technion the Technology Institute of Israel I am NOT a big fan of cannabis and if it was a spinach of petunias was better for me it was much easier but it is cannabis and what I did learn in the last three years that this plant have an enormous potential to treat many illnesses whether we like it or not it is here and it's not going we cannot take it away any more from the kids that have 200 seizures a day and now there are seizure free we cannot take it away anymore the autistic kids that it changed their life and their family's life we cannot take it away anymore from the PTSD patient that for years didn't sleep a whole night and now we can came back to normal life we need to understand that cannabis won't go anywhere it's give hope to many people today it should be another option in the toolbox of the physician to treat the patient it is our responsibility to learn how to use it better and how to precise it it's our responsibility to take it to the next level we the scientist the physician the community oh it to our patients thank you very much [Applause] [Music]", "gVRdnEq4in8": "[Applause] today an alarming breaking news report about vaping it's a new piece of the puzzle that may explain the mysterious vaping injuries we've been covering here on the show from double lung transplants to even death I mean big complications is the culprit black-market THC the chemical in marijuana that gets you high and listen products are being sold to unsuspecting customers that have no idea what they're buying may be lethal senior legal and investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden brings us this as an NBC News exclusive our investigation took us to downtown Los Angeles where in a 12 block radius we saw dozens and dozens of storefronts advertising vaping products we're in pursuit of what black market operators come here for the empty packaging and cartridges that they fill with cheap and often tainted substances sold as legitimate THC products within minutes we score we were able to go in one shop one-stop shopping by these dank VAP containers the packaging and a hundred of the cartridges into which you can put whatever you want there's no ID no tax no nothing and it's counterfeit marijuana babes like these that may be making people sick I do believe that I was given black market stuff and I do believe that had a had an effect on me Fabian says his lungs were slowly beginning to shut down he ended up in the emergency room I couldn't breathe I couldn't talk I really couldn't even move my hands so what is lurking in these black market vapes and are the legal ones even safe no one not even the FDA or the CDC had tested the actual vapor people are sucking into their lungs until now we revealed those results Cynthia joins us what exactly is marijuana vape and how do you compare it to the typical East cigarettes or tobacco baby ok so a step backwards vaping is just taking a liquid of the compound heat it up and then that vapor is what you suck into your lung so if it's nicotine like a Joule which has 80% of the market that's tobacco THC the active ingredient in marijuana it's made into a liquid form and then it's heated up and then you suck that into your so again the cartridge looks like this that's what we were buying that's what we were buying on these are the ones we bought on the street so we bought for a hundred bucks we bought a hundred containers and a hundred of these so if I'm a black-market manufacturer of THC oil I'm in business when you walked into that store yeah what actually transpired what was the conversation like you said I got a hundred bucks when you got for me did you have to sort of lead him along how'd you hook that the fish well the first thing I would say is that we had our choice of dozens and dozens and dozens of stores in downtown Los Angeles all of them selling these kinds of illicit products and so we said hey we want to buy some containers we rolled off a few of the illicit names that are popular dank vapes is one you've got it right here dank vapes it is associated with many of the people who got sick it is not a legitimate brand there is no company called dank vapes so the black market on this which is what's concerning to me seems to be dominant there doesn't seem to be any way of digging taking them out less consumers are unsuspecting well even more insidious there are legitimate brands that aren't contaminated of THC oil that you can buy in states where it's legal and these counterfeiters make boxes and carts that look exactly like those legitimate brands so the consumer has essentially no idea what he or she is going to get so the Mac market operators fill empty cartridges with their own substances and then they're selling them as legitimate tested products but what exactly are they putting in there and is it dangerous Cynthia brought the stuff to a lab to find out if the chemist a flabs in Los Angeles considered one of the top marijuana testing facilities in the world can a safe executives Aaron Riley and Antonio Frazier explain they've come up with a brand new test we wanted to design a system that would be able to provide reproducible results to do something they wish the government would do analyze the vapor produced by illicit THC oil Canas they've tested seven THC cartridges from licensed dispensaries and six from the black-market we come back the shocking results from the lab [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I'm back with NBC News investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden and for the very first time a new lab test is able to tell us exactly what is in the vapor produced by THC oil when you vape what's actually going into your lungs to remind everybody what you tested okay we tested seven legitimate products these are licensed brands from licensed dispensaries and then on the black market we tested six black market these are listen what did the kind of safe lab testing show was in the vapor coming out of it okay there were no contaminants in either the oil we also tested the oil previously either the oil or the vapor here if that was used at the temperature that's recommended we can talk about that let's say that the lowest temperature or lower temperature lower temperature because guess what when you crank the thing up which is what kids do because it makes more vapor Oh carcinogens yeah so not safe anymore not safe anybody know what happened to black market cartridges even when it was turned at the right power setting on the low side okay under the best set of circumstances this stuff is dangerous it's contaminated this is just you're asking for it you vape this stuff you're asking for it well they're stealing your money it's not surprising they would steal your health well what percentage of America is given products that are counterfeit yeah you're asking questions really hard to answer because this is the illicit market the black market it's underground law enforcement is having a really hard time getting a Tanz around this think about it I mean the FDA isn't testing this stuff why it's not legal across the country so the FDA doesn't have the authority to test these brands but you know states are doing the best they can but the best they can it's not good enough in my opinion because we've got a population doesn't appreciate I just the things I've read maybe it's a quarter maybe it's half of all the stuff is counterfeit it's being brought basically from a drug dealer all right the THC oil let's go through exactly what kinds of things were found in your testing by the way it's state of the art and I would applaud you for doing this because our own government is in doing this we've finally got the answers from you well some of the things none of them good carbon monoxide formaldehyde pesticides well we're in the counterfeit stuff the ELISA stuff for rat you find a couple things that surprised you yeah it'll surprise you to cyanide yeah you don't want your kids breathing that stuff you just don't or yourself and vitamin E oil which is a little bit confusing it really sounds healthy but what they want though is the consumer to think it's real THC oil so they mix it with vitamin E oil why they pick that one because the viscosity the thickness is the same as vitamin E oil so these are really crafty dastardly criminals so let's talk a little about vitamin E because I think it's exam it's emblematic of the problem here we all know substances like pesticides and sine are dangerous let me talk about it but vitamin E sounds healthy right but when you inhaled the vapor with vitamin E in it it goes into your lungs right at the high temperature it's converted into an oil to a grease in your body once in a long some say that it coats the Airways and when it does that then coats the Airways it starts an inflammatory reaction making it really hard to breathe the information in the oil get into the tiny little sacs these little sacs alright of your lung they're not hard to treat now the CDC thinks vitamin E is that big culprit behind these marijuana vaping deaths and injuries but we're no unsure and if these black markets your products are being sold like this the question I'm having everybody is what can people do to make sure that they're getting something that's safe well don't buy illicit products buy from a licensed dispensary is one thing I just want to add a little bit to your vitamin E oil here's so the Mayo Clinic as you know did a of testing on 17 patients who had that vaping illness and they discovered that the lungs of those patients looked like someone who'd been exposed to mustard gas so it's why it's important they're only state regulated marijuana dispensaries in states were its legal right to your point the government won't regulate it because it's only in these states so when you look at the country if you're in a red state maybe you're buying marijuana from a legitimate place right if you're in a great state guarantee or not then if it in the red states from Cynthia Stella me is there more of the illegal places illicit places than illegal ones which means you're buying the stuff from drug dealers they're not legitimate sellers I don't see a difference between two groups so you've got another big warning which I wanted to point out which is the temperature warning just make that really clear to folks so when we tested the legal product that didn't have the contaminants that are horrifying the cyanide and other things cranked up higher they produce what the lab told us were carcinogens but you know if your kids are doing it tell them making those big vapor puffs is just not worth it it could be killing them so if you're not buying THC cartridges for a licensed dispensary in states where they're illegal here's the picture again right you're buying them from the drug dealer don't do it and if your vape pen is an adjustable temperature setting don't crank it all the way up because it's dangerous lots of data support in this now use the low power setting Cinthia wonderful reporting thank you very much you can catch Cynthia's reporting on today and NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt and be sure to check out Cynthia's latest report the results of a year-long NBC exclusive investigation where she uncovers an

oz comm I'll be right back [Applause] [Music] be sure to subscribe to my channel so you don't miss anything and remember to check back often to see what's new", "ATDB4zmZKlE": "CBD cannabis oil has attracted a lot of THC the CBD what is CBD CBD has well and truly brought the cannabis plant into the mainstream it's touted as having loads of health benefits and can be found in all sorts boils creams wine teabags sweets you name it and it's been all over the headlines but for something so talked about there's a lot of uncertainty about how it actually sits within the law CBD is a major compound found in the cannabis plant it's thought to affect the receptors in our nervous system and have broad medicinal benefits potentially treating conditions like anxiety insomnia and chronic pain but it won't give you a euphoric high and it's legal pure CBD is legal unlike its counterpart THC which is the other major compound found in cannabis THC produces the psychoactive effects that get you high and it's not legal in the UK but it's difficult to separate CBD from THC fully as they can come from the same plant now it's important to make the distinction here between hemp and marijuana hemp is legal to grow in the UK with a very low percentage of THC marijuana on the other hand refers to cannabis which contains more than this legal limit the home office says it's legal to grow industrial hemp containing up to 0.2% THC with a license however this is commonly misunderstood as applying to CBD products technically the legal limit of THC in finished products is 0% and research into the industry has found that a lot of commercially available CBD products include traces of THC this strict limit isn't currently being enforced and is unclear how it would be in the future right now the booming CBD market is frankly a of a mess the existing regulations are complex and vague and there isn't a standardized way of testing CBD products or labeling them instead every CBD product out there is subject to different regulations depending on what type of product it is so let's take CBD oil as an example is probably the most popular CBD product and it's classified as a food supplement not a medicine even though that's what most people use it for this means the CBD oil you find on a shop shelf won't have gone through tests and clinical trials like a medicine would have and it can't make any health claims on the bottle plus dosage guidelines and prices vary massively and you have to rely on the manufacturer's assurances that the product contains what it claims to and then other CBD products say cosmetics or veyts are subject to different regulations so at the moment got a situation where we've got a product that is super popular everyone wants to buy it everyone wants to sell it but the problem is no one really knows much about it particularly legal status of it and whether or not it can be used as a food product whether or not can be used as a cosmetic product and if it can whether or not it can be allowed to have a certain quantity of the narcotic element in it in this country technically you shouldn't have any THC at all in the product itself if you want to travel with it then you're going to have to check with the country that you're going to whether or not they will allow CBD oil to be in your possession or for you to use it or even travel with it some places won't even let you take it on a plane and to check that I would say look on the website of the government of the country that you're traveling to and if it isn't clear which in a lot of situations it isn't clear just don't travel with it so currently whether your CBD oil shampoo or tea bag complies to UK regulations or contains what it claims to is far from straightforward but thankfully there is momentum behind initiatives for independent product testing and clearer regulations because the CBD boom looks pretty set to continue and until the benefits are proven in clinical trials and regulations have caught up treat CBD with caution it's an exciting area of research but there are still many unknowns about dosage drug interactions and the effectiveness of over-the-counter CBD [Music]", "VfLW9TnHTRc": "hi everybody it's broken Sierra here love happy Monday it is a gorgeous day it's very nice I had lunch and chatted all about what we're talking about today which is topicals but anyway I hope you guys get a chance to outside and enjoy this lovely day and we are going to dive into our recipe that we made today but first we're gonna talk about obviously the skin which is like goes hand in hand with topicals the skin is so important because it is the largest organ of our body so clearly it's important yes and it's important to take care of your skin but it's interesting because our skin is a huge indicator of what is going on internally yes it is so Brooke tell me about what inspired you to make your own balm so as you guys know we do carry a mary's medicinal freeze which is a nice topical and we have our great synergy balm which is awesome I actually broke my foot and I use this around my foot it got great relief from it yeah it's really really nice so one thing that I noticed is that these are our Mary's medicinal CBD and our synergy really relief is a one to one THC CBD I was looking for something that was strictly THC so a high THC bomb so I took it into my own hands to take one of the grassroot RSO syringes and recreate my own bomb so that's what I did oh creative but we thought we would talk about this because we used products that we have here yes to make something that's a little bit more customized you used essential oils used coconut oil the only thing that we don't have which we were talking about you can just get at Whole Foods is beeswax yes and there's no difference between whether you get the pellet fees wax or the chunks of beeswax so either one so let's show the final product tell us how you so I'm give a smell it smells so good I did any tree oil tree yeah cuz so one reason that my bomb is strictly well not strictly but mainly made out of coconut oil and tea tree oil is for its antifungal properties so I suffer from Candida I get it on my back and I get it but it normally flare up in the spring but it's never really something that's to astronomical but I did just have a birthday and went on a sugar overload ship curry whenever a sugar overlays like me for a day weekend it was so fabulous yeah this is one I haven't used yet so you guys it's amazing this won't ruin your clothes no it doesn't ruin my sheets I put it on after the shower or before bed and it doesn't ruin my pajamas doesn't get on my sheets it absorbs really really nicely into the skin so it's because of sort of like how you made it you make sure that it emulsifies properly yeah let it cool yes okay so tell us like step by step so you combined half well this all kind of comes out to half a cup is what you were saying yeah so I feel like it came out to a total all my oils mixed together came out to a half a cup so I did about 1/3 a cup of coconut oil if you have a problem with coconut oil you can always do olive oil or avocado oil we do but we have in the dispensary which is fabulous so I did that I did an ounce of tea tree oil not only for the scent but I also an regime one oh yes I really wanted the antifungal from the tea tree oil so some of the tea tree or I'm sorry some of these scented oils that we have here in the shop are the blood orange the lavender and the peppermint these ones are great for mood boosting and to reduce anxiety so these are fabulous so it depends on what you need like yeah I have to make they don't have to make there's a tea tree nope if you prefer a certain scent if you want to use this before bedtime because we know lavender is a great one to help relax yeah then throw some lavender in there exactly so what's great about this is I had my oils I took everything I did a double boil put everything in there I had my total one ml syringe I did an ounce which is I think half a bottle of one of these guys of my essential oil right and then I did my coconut oil once that all emulsified and became one or I'm sorry that all became one pretty easily because it's all a waste I started to add my beeswax so slowly right yeah do all at one out all at once because you want it to slowly emulsify and become one so beeswax normally it's a one-to-one ratio so if you have a cup of all your oil concoction and then an ounce of beeswax what I had done was because I wanted mine to be more of a balm than like a petroleum jelly right I did double the amount of beeswax so I did two ounces of beeswax for my no no I did one else beeswax for my half a cup of mixture so you can see it's super nice it comes out really nice and it's like a true bomb and it just rubs on nice and there is no psychoactive reaction to this is strictly a topical it's a non edible you put your essential oil in it's it smells really nice and you feel it's not sticky it's just like I love it so it's super simple did it home nice little DIY but along with that yes we're still doing our accessory sales so we're just saying if you don't want to do this process you can really make a tincture in your levo with some clues flour and just make sure to add some essential oils because it's not going to be an ingestible tincture really right so you wouldn't miss for a topic Lori yep you would get your oil all out of this it would take make it a lot easier you're gonna have to DIY everything once your oil comes out you would add yours oh you would add your fees wax find the consistency that you like right let it cool I let this cool for two hours for this guy because it wasn't full all the way but this one I gave a solid sex just to cool all the way before I started using it and I just stored it in the bathroom it's cool Oh dark and yeah it's really good it's really great for Sienna so so this is good for and Brooke talked about how she suffers with Candida but bug bites well yeah but mosquito bites this time higher because you both are those yeah people we are those people here are those people the bugs love us so that's you know obviously uncomfortable you're inflamed when you want to keep eating this will help cool and soothe and reduce that inflammation but eczema athletes yes yes any of those topical you know like dermatitis conditions and I was gonna say that I've been using my balm for a week now and my breakouts on my back have significantly reduced in redness and size and I'm gonna give it a month and see how much balm I have left and see my spots so and keep us posted yeah and those are those Omega six is reacting to the inflammation in my body which is coming out through the skinny it's amazing yeah anything else you want to add today I think that's all we have we have some great products in we still have the accessory sales well xxx yes yes coming in until supplies last we're just trying to clear out bring in some new stuff if you guys have any suggestions or requests for what you want to see the owner accessories wall drop some you know ideas down

outside and enjoy this beautiful day and we will see you soon bye bye [Music]", "xvOEzUvjP94": "[Music] and just that quickly Riley mailer takes from medical marijuana I take it four times a day one in the morning and then during lunch and then during dinner and then at night before I go to bed the thirteen year olds from Delaware says cannabis oil has helped treat the tumor that was eating away at her bones in second grade and my face started to grow and it was getting bigger my mom decided to take me to the hospital the news from the doctor was grim Riley who was seven at the time was diagnosed with aggressive giant cell granuloma only a handful of people in the world have the disease I was just like so uncomfortable because you know like seeing my face in the mirror and it's like Oh big and it made me really sad and stuff I was also in pain because of my seizures that I started having my stomach would cramp up and I would start I started to hallucinate it's an actually like a gut emptiness of when the doctors you know first described to us what was happening and what they thought was gonna happen after surgery Riley's mom decided to give her medical marijuana to see if it would help her symptoms I was so scared anytime you give your child any kind of new prescription you're scared to do you're looking for those side effects we just researched a lot and came across you know medical cannabis as a possible alternative that could help her heal and I couldn't find anything that was detrimental with using that the tumor it shrunk the seizures they stopped the way smaller than it was before I haven't had a reoccurrence in about four I'm taking cannabis oil it made me feel so much better and my bone was growing back the roots of my teeth were growing back before they were held in with stitches and I was told they wouldn't live but the roots regenerated and I still have my teeth dr. Andrew ordered with the doctor says there's not enough evidence to support whether this type of treatment works the key is if you're thinking about trying it you need to see a pediatrician who specializes in using marijuana and especially in dosing marijuana CBD oil for your kid before I took cannabis my brain was normal and then after I took cannabis all of these years my brain was the same and it didn't harm anything Riley's now made it her mission to help other sick kids get the medicine they need speaking in front of legislature she's already pushed to pass three laws in Delaware one makes it legal for kids in the state to be administered medical marijuana another lets children take it at school O'Reilly law was to make cannabis legal for children because it was illegal and when my mom gave me cannabis it made me feel so much better and I didn't understand why other kids wouldn't have it I wanted to help those kids hi she's also created the nonprofit Riley's smile foundation it's very hard knowing what helped you and seeing other people who could be helped by it bringing smiles to sick children and their families by giving them a better quality of life just like she she is very inspiring to a lot of people and I love seeing that but what she's doing changing kids lives one law at the time the chef's for Inside Edition com [Music]", "J5mOOSlORNw": "[Music] I was invited here tonight to give a talk on cannabis although excited for the opportunity I began to realize how vulnerable this could make me the current cannabis climate is one of vast gray area a space where industry has rapidly outpaced regulation leaving operators at odds and quite frankly confused with entities like the DEA and the FDA more importantly consumers and health care providers are left to base their decisions surrounding cannabis on morals rather than science considering all that it's no wonder folks are elected to tell the truth about cannabis what if we lived in a world where we didn't have to hide what we know no fear no stigma surrounding the subject this is a talk about such a world it was December of 2016 when I self diagnosed what I felt to be postpartum anxiety as the mother to two children under two I brushed these troubles off feeling like every mom goes through this not being able to quiet my mind enough to fall asleep at night I just figured I'm a working mom busy mom busy mind right wrong turns out these feelings of anxiety little to no appetite trouble sleeping and even pain we're all warning signs that a much bigger problem was going on I needed to see a doctor maybe they'd recommend a vacation a yoga class or maybe pharmaceuticals I couldn't stop thinking about that last one what about side effects I want to keep breastfeeding what if I want to have another child I sat in a waiting room with anticipation the doctor will see you now mmm says here you're having trouble sleeping at night you have a knot in your stomach most of the day have a loss of appetite and you're starting to feel pain that you can't attribute to any injury that's correct since you're mrs. Reynolds that you've had two pregnancies in the last two years yes is your baby waking you up to breastfeed at night oh yeah well then your adrenaline must be pumping at all hours of the night to get you to your baby quickly as to not wake up your older child am i right that's exactly right mrs. Reynolds do you drink alcohol yes do you exercise good enough well mrs. Reynolds I'm led to believe that you're experiencing a dysregulation in your endocannabinoid system endocannabinoids in short mrs. Reynolds the endocannabinoid system is one of our body's natural regulatory systems it's responsible for creating and sustaining balance due to hormone shifts after two pregnancies your increased physical and mental demand alcohol consumption lack of exercise I'm led to believe that your ECS isn't working properly there are however a few ways that you can support your ECS one is to supplement the endogenous cannabinoids which would be circulating in your body if your ECS was working properly endogenous cannabinoids there's that word again yes mrs. Reynolds our bodies have cannabinoid receptors spread throughout and we naturally produce cannabinoids for them to receive when for whatever reason we aren't generating sufficient enough endocannabinoids we can regain balance by supplementing with phyto cannabinoids found in cannabis cannabis cannabis cannabis when phyto cannabinoids are introduced with receptors from external sources like cannabis the receptors activate and produce a physiological change which can alleviate symptoms such as anxiety pain insomnia when a cannabinoid connects with a cannabinoid receptor the message of regulation begins to resonate throughout the south and eventually reaches out to adjacent cells and organs vital cannabinoids help to reestablish homeostasis which has been disrupted by a lack of endocannabinoid caused by genetic or lifestyle factors since cannabinoid receptors influence so many different elements of our nervous system and our being system and because of genetic variation from person to person it is nearly impossible to truly predict what an individual will have for a response without self experimentation I encourage you to experiment cannabis is now widely available in several modalities formulations and strengths I also recommend you keep a journal so you can document how many milligrams you've taken and how long it takes for you to feel pain free more relaxed and focused Wow doctor all that fear around cannabis or nothing now let's face it those types of conversations are not happening but why sure we can blame the pharmaceutical Lobby but we can also blame ourselves how many of you disclose your cannabis use to your doctor your dentist how about your chiropractor massage therapist okay how many of those health care providers ask you about your cannabis consumption I've been a dental hygienist for almost 15 years and I can tell you I've never seen it on health history a questionnaire before there is groundbreaking clinical cannabis research being conducted right now but almost all of it is considered anecdotal because of the current regulatory laws some folks brave enough to try cannabis are living pain-free anxiety free and even seizure free lives if we lived in a world free of fear and stigma around cannabis we'd allow ourselves to self heal first maybe not even use pharmaceuticals at all I ask you to embrace your inner can of curiosity start a conversation with your health care provider and get educated ask about access ask why cannabis isn't widely offered in the realm of treatment urge them to know more your health and your happiness can start today and can start with cannabis thank you you", "9L7aVpstaLI": "hey what's up literally nothing what's up you want to get together a bunch of us are meeting up by the school later to do what you know just chill smoke or join or two come on man you know i don't place yeah you don't blaze yet just try it you know i'm super cool with you guys smoking weed like i don't mind at all i just don't know if i want to try it how do you know if you're gonna like it or not if you've never done it i'm sure i'd enjoy it you guys always look like you're having a good time but i know myself if i do it once it's probably gonna become a habit you know there's literally no risk to smoking weed no one's ever died overdosing on it yeah i've heard that but i don't know if it has no risk listen people in pain use it to help themselves if it's good for them how could it be bad for you i'm not kidding search it up if you want all right man maybe i don't know though no guarantees all right let me know either way though yeah i'll give you a call peace more and more tanks are beginning to consume marijuana as it becomes decriminalized or even legalized around the world but what is marijuana and what effects can it have on adolescents and young adults if you search up these topics online there are a variety of different claims being made that either exaggerates or understates the effects of marijuana on teens it can be difficult to know who to listen to but not to worry today we'll look at scientific studies to answer these questions for you welcome to demystifying medicine so what is marijuana marijuana is a drug derived from cannabis plants that is commonly used for psychoactive properties in other words marijuana can alter mental states and lead to intoxication and euphoria this effect is more commonly known as being high two important chemicals found in cannabis are tetrahydrocannabinol commonly known as thc or cannabidiol also known as cbd collectively there are known as cannabinoids thc is a psychoactive component of marijuana known for its ability to make you high cbd is more commonly known for its therapeutic uses and is the reason why medical marijuana can be used to treat a variety of different medical conditions medical cannabis products derived from cbd are commonly used for reducing pain inflammation and seizures marijuana can be used in a variety of different ways including smoking in the form of edibles or tea as well as in the form of an oil or extract which contains increased concentrations of thc [Music] whether you've used marijuana yourself or if you've seen movie characters spark up in late night comedies on netflix you probably already know the short-term effects of marijuana but what happens after the high has worn off recent studies have shown that over time adolescent cannabis users may experience a variety of different cognitive declines these include deficiencies in general executive functioning learning memory and motivation general executive functioning takes place in the very front of the brain it helps with planning and accomplishing tasks monitoring emotions and habits and plays an important role in working memory and attention this is also the slowest part of the brain to develop as it continues to mature up until the age of about 25 years old it was found that daily and weekly teenage cannabis users experience impairments in their general executive function compared to adults specifically in attention and working memory which is the ability to retain information over a short period of time teens were found to be more likely to crave marijuana after their high has worn off compared to adults which can lead to binge-like behaviors it has been suggested that the magnitude of impairment is greater in youth than adults for the functions of learning and memory studies have found differences in the way that certain parts of the brain work between teenage cannabis users and non-users these differences were found in parts of the brain that are believed to influence different types of learning and in parts that help form our cognition these differences however between teenage and adult users were most prominently seen among heavy users it has been implied that daily intoxication during young adulthood can impair the successful attainment of education and directly influences the level of income the heavy marijuana users can achieve for adolescents let's start using marijuana later and occasionally the risks are much lower marijuana may also impact motivation which helps us work on our goals and make our dreams into a reality it has been shown that heavy cannabis use during your teens can lower general motivation later in life across studies it seems as though factors that predict worthlin effects include usage and age of onset generally the earlier you start using and more frequently you use the worse the performance in cognitive functions and mental health throughout the video you may have heard phrases such as it is suggested and seems to indicate so why don't we have results that are conclusive and give us more of a clear answer this has a lot to do with current barriers to research and the limitations of studies being conducted in the united states it is illegal to conduct marijuana research under federal law this means that scientists must use chemical formulations that are not derived from cannabis plant as a substitute for marijuana this raises concerns as to how generalizable the study findings are to the real world even in areas where marijuana research is legal the exact amount of thc or cbd is not usually labeled correctly or clearly on marijuana products additionally there are also different strains of cannabis plants each with different potencies and profiles that play a huge role in how marijuana affects the body [Music] because of these limitations we should take the results of these studies with a grain of salt so what is the conclusion what is the effect of marijuana on teens well the answer is complicated only a few countries legalize marijuana research and the legalization of marijuana is still fairly recent so we need a lot more studies to be absolutely sure but based on what we don't know consistently using marijuana as a teen or adolescent may have serious implications when it comes to your cognitive functions so if you're going to use weed make sure that you assess these risks use it sparsely and safely [Music] do [Music] you", "x0UlGwowlCM": "so working in the drug and alcohol field sometimes i work with clients who are attempting to quit their cannabis use and when they stop their cannabis use they also experience withdrawal symptoms however sometimes they find those withdrawal syndromes are quite severe or uncomfortable and they may go back to cannabis use thinking that their withdrawal symptoms were related to their cannabis use however what we do know from many of our cannabis smokers is they often mix tobacco with their cannabis and so there's they're becoming dependent or their bodies getting used to both tobacco and cannabis so when they stop their cannabis they they forget that they might be also withdrawing from also from the tobacco and the nicotine within that tobacco so sometimes when we offer those people nicotine replacement therapy they find their withdrawal symptoms from the cannabis to be much more comfortable and it was actually probably some nicotine that was also showing itself in those severe withdrawal symptoms", "9SFK6jTQFAE": "talk to me about the New Year's Day in in Illinois for your company how did you do you know an incredibly exciting day you know uh decades in the making it was it was phenomenal it was a tremendous amount of support we had the the stores open from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. we had we had people lining up at 8:00 p.m. on New Year's Eve and at some of the stores and and you know throughout the day hundreds and hundreds of people waiting in line to get through like you said we service over 3100 customers yesterday was phenomenal Cresco has 30 licenses in seven states and Sunnyside is your national retail brand how important will Illinois be in the overall portfolio you know it's our home state and we're incredibly well positioned here to through the through the existing medical program you know when our operator has a 100% market penetration twenty-five plus percent market share which is by far the largest market share in the state we have three of the 21 existing cultivation licenses we're the only one with three we only have one other appear with two and everybody else has one so we're very very well positioned here in our home state to take advantage and make the most of this this new marketplace this new adult use market in what form do most buyers buy you know I think it was it was across the spectrum you've got your traditional flower products you've got concentrates and bait pens and edibles and you know depending on familiarity I think you've got some consumers who will tend to be in that flower concentrate formats and then newer more exploratory consumers the the vape pens and the edibles are a lot more approachable charlie are you concerned at all about the crackdown on vaping the crackdown on flavors and what it means for the future of marijuana no you know what we heard most yesterday was the consumers were very happy to have a safe tested compliance focused product offering that they could legally buy in the state of Illinois that was one of the one of the comments we heard most yesterday that's that is the benefit of legalized regulated and compliance focused cannabis is safe products educate me because I don't know how the system works how do you know that the products you are selling meet a certain quality standard and our set are quote safe that's number one and I don't mean to get on any kind of moral high horse do you have any qualms about selling an intoxicant in a world where there probably is plenty of intoxication already sure so I'll dress the first question first you know regulated compliance focused programs like Illinois in many of them definitely east of the Mississippi they set standards they set quality control standards they set safety standards as it relates to microbial contamination residual solvents potencies etc so you know not a single product can leave our production facilities until it's been tested and certified by a third-party lab that's also licensed by the state so that's you know one of the benefits of that legalized regulated cannabis is these consumers are coming into a licensed store and every product that they're buying will have the the test results you know again as it relates to exactly what's in that product from the potency of the cannabis related constituents and then also any any sort of supplements along with verification that there's no residual pesticides or solvents left in the product any qualms about selling about selling a product that is yet another intoxicant know a cannabis has been around for 5000 years my background of being a regulatory attorney prior to getting into the cannabis space it was one of the things that I had to address prior to entering the industry but to be honest with you is one of the things that I knew I had to offer to this developing opportunity in the US was a background in regulatory compliance to make sure that this industry was developed in the right way I think it's I think we're seeing the benefit of safe reliable third-party tested products entering into a market you know you see the data in in in most states with regulated cannabis you see a significant reduction in opioid abuse in those states so that the data is now showing great support for greater access to cannabis products and Charlie the fact that you have sales tax that's going up as the th THC content in these products goes up so 10% for lower THC as much as 20% on other THC what does that do to the desire you know I don't know that it has an impact on desire because again those it kind of goes by category by form right so the lower THC products are going to be your traditional flower products the increased potency products are the the concentrates that are for you know the more well-adjusted and familiar consumers that are able to handle the higher tolerance and it's also you know it the the price per milligram at that point is lower too so the increased taxes we haven't seen a we haven't seen an impact from that again one one day of data but we really haven't seen an impact from that graduating tax rate believe it you", "g998giWQTyI": "okay and then I have some water getting ready to boil here for rye we're gonna infuse the sweetened condensed milk or the Vietnamese ice cream mm-hmm cannabis bye all right I brought a couple choices for you to smell here tell me what you think so we'll just do the you know so you can really just pick based on okay there's another one okay I know I'm definitely rule out the first one this one's really it's between the second and third but Ryu sounded kind of surprised that I would you up with the first one like I would pick any one of these um this one in the lineup I think is the most kind of a coffee like the second one that used to smell of is called snoop lion oh gee if that one's kind of a sour earthy og and then the last one was the orange believes it does have that sort of leather eNOS that you and then it's also citrus I've had coffee cocktails that have like citrus elements in them and they're super interesting what happens if you like put in all three would that just muddled too much honestly I would smoke all these things together in a joint since you said the first one is what you would do we were kind of going lean towards the bird so maybe we could try some of the first and the third yeah I think that'd be super cool actually so we're gonna use half a gram of each of these will be right at about eight milligrams per personal person and we're putting this on a cup did some corn flakes per oh that sounds amazing I didn't know about that part that's great I go play on breakfast you know it's all stuff you pi-1 eat if you're high yeah I definitely want to eat that and I'm definitely high right now so looking forward to that so this is the amount of condensed milk that we'll use in the recipe right okay great so I'm just gonna kind of sprinkle that in there and then we're going to boil it in a pot for about two hours that'll both activate the THC a and the THC and then it'll also in into the sweetened condensed milk", "Xr293EcpDFE": "early on a really close family friend of my father's daughter was was targeted and murdered in the 80s it was a big case I'd probably had nervous breakdowns before that that was the first time I can remember like oh this is a nervous breakdown it makes you realize that it's like no matter how good the people around you are she can fall apart my name is dr. Siri Satnam Singh and I'm a licensed therapist this week I'm sitting down with a man who is battling depression and deeply-rooted shame today we will witness him confronting his fast this is Damian Abraham [Music] [Music] so your past I know nothing about it yes mother and father what was all about I grew up upper-middle class middle class I guess my mom was a flight attendant my dad was in advertising my mom had a heart attack at 40 and had to stop being a flight attendant and then my they'd been divorced by that point we had a terrible stepfather okay and he did it kind of everything wrong and I think the other thing that ultimately was the shattering thing was he was such a moralist right like this is around the time Bill Clinton Monica Lewinsky and I can remember sitting at the dinner table and he was like they should throw him in jail like Bo claw it was this very like I didn't get along with them politically at that point but then just to kind of have this like it's like sort of ultimate alpha male vision of this is what you should do you should work hard you know I'm a pilot but I also had another job filling vending machines I do this and I do that you know and I'm raising you children to be polite and use manners and respect people you know he had a another life that he was dealing with too so but he it wasn't a great dude yeah and then it's you know it's the things that we're not aware of that really impact our lives so the moralist stepdad I'm sure you had impulses that you wanted to act out that you could not act out because this is not good that's unconscious shaming yeah yeah talk about that some of the impulses you may have had that he said ah dinner so much anxiety is stress around family dinner you know it was really important that we all sat down together and then it was there are a lot of rules you know like how we set the table you know and how we conducted ourselves at that table and it wasn't like we're sitting in a formal dining room dressed up this was just that the dinner table the breakfast table and I think there's a lot of stress around that it was like a shells like it was like a time bomb sitting across the dinner table from this person like what little inconsistency have I forgotten now I have I made that I wasn't supposed to that's gonna set this guy off and it was never like a physical abuse but it was like not talking to you for like two or three days cuz you ran down the stairs it was a very bizarre you see how you internalize that change yeah yes he shamed you yeah and you internalized the shame that because I put the fork this way and it should have been that way that I am not good looking at your videos the word that came out to me is raised it's not just anger on the stage it's rage definitely yes and rage is a ramification of dealing with shame and a number of artists it's not a through-line but this concept that you have been chained unconsciously that you know I'm not good enough and you defend against it divided because a star everything's still bare I am invisible down here on the same level no one should see me because I'm bad so you defend against it and come to a level to where everybody will see me on stage it's it's another form of dealing with shame exhibitionism the where I will dance so fast and seeing so loud and be so flamboyant and be so grand that no one will see that I feel less than no absolutely it's like it's it's a it's an armor yeah you know like you put it on and you could be that other person yeah so you haven't identified from my perspective up to the day consciously that you are shame-based talk about your experience as a teenage boy here it is dad is gone at when did dad leave dad left when I was grade five so I think I would have been about 12 my dad was British he moved back to England moved to Los Angeles for a while then moved back to Toronto so at the age of 16 I went straight edge which is like a way to be sober you know and identify with something in your sobriety which is as a kid it was so important to me you know so I could be straight edge which meant I didn't do drugs I didn't train I didn't do any of that stuff and I I was part of this thing and then I did that you know and I straighted stop me being important to me after a couple years but I still called myself straightedge just as you know shorthand for it well let's not fail you coming to the get room now yes so where do you feel like you feel is a child I don't know I guess it like I guess like I had struggled in school in the very beginning grade one I was diagnosed with a learning disability that I've kind of come to realize was actually my exam anxiety disorder at that age kind of manifesting itself I would have panic attacks learning new concepts so anxiety around I know failure anxiety around what else I'm talking to a fat kid trust me there's a lot to get okay let's work through it being a young teenager preety can do is perceived as housing having breasts you know yeah I was like you know I had to go swimming with these people you know and and it was a physical shaming you know I think it was more like a body shaming thing it was I was the fat kid I want you to have empathy for the child that experienced that I think that's the one that we need to bring into the session the one that maybe on the stage and you punk-rock the one who maybe unconsciously showing up in places I made a name for myself by having a crazy live show early on it would be bloody and it would be chaotic smashing you know and I was big I was huge at that time I look at that now that was a panic attack like I was just like going up there and freaking the on stage and like hurting myself you know I was definitely reckless in my behavior and that's a panic attack and you know it's almost like to get to that to play that fool on stage every night to be that person for people you almost have to get to that panic attack stage what is coming to the space so far is fear mm-hmm anxiety of course that you're trying desperately to stay controlled and I think that's key to the panic attack and the nervous breakdowns to where you're trying to desperately stay in control of these feelings and then you can and then he explode and what are some of the symptoms you have when you have a panic attack like a lack of joy you know just a general like it's it's it's all gone I would just be like tossing and turning at night just worried about anything everything and I think the problem is being in a band it just hyper accentuates those feelings because it's like you're your kind of you live and die based on what someone else thinks about you and I think that's probably why I'm hesitant writing lyrics for the new record you know it's probably why I'm hesitant to to do other things that I want to do creatively is because you don't want to fail on it so what are we gonna do with this critic stepfather was a critic yes the teachers were a critic yes your friends were a critic yes and you still haven't escaped it that you have these musical critics what are you gonna do with that that's a the big question I guess yes I think the critic is inside of you so you're working all day with these shames although you see what I'm saying in different ways it's yeah there's a lot of shame but I also like the other piece of it I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing without this you know without my mental health whatever it is that I've dealt with I wouldn't be fortunate to be able to live this dream you know like I kind of manifested my own destiny in that way yeah well you have something you have obviously some self-love there too but that shame is in there with the self love so it's like toxic cocktail yeah yeah yeah so this reminds me of Anna Freud where she talked about when we are aggressed against that eventually we aggress against ourselves yeah we we no longer need the perpetrator to beat us over the head now we incorporate that aggression against ourselves and that's what you're doing you were beat into it you gotta be perfect you got to be perfect thus I'm not good enough so plus I can't write though I'm travelling all over the world and being recognized yet I can't write on my new album because I'm not good enough so we have to release the inner critic we gotta let him go I'm experiencing you as a man who's very present with his feelings attributions and I think that you have a lot of feelings that that come all the time all the time and really fast you and you are having challenge processing them as quickly as they come I find it like depending on the situation it's hard to let that River flow you know like I think every situation where it's hard to let it flow first day of this tour was like I get I would arrive in the city we pick up the van pick up all the gear drive to the show this case it was Phoenix Arizona which needs five hours in that van in five hours we don't we're not like a band of friends you know there's like bands you hear about them they're like we're all buddies that's not us like why do we fly to LA to pick up a van to then drive to Arizona and then drive all the way back the next day thus spending 12 hours in a tiny little van together that we already hate being in each other with beside each other inside of it and were then we're gonna have to drive all the way up to Vancouver in a van with each other yet for some reason we thought an extra five hours was worth saving a few dollars so phone's idea that to you oh hi yes do you feel I'll be pissed I just think how they feel oh I do this is identification with the aggressor your stepfather a Mian that's not good what are you doing you should never do this so now you have identified with the aggressor and you have become him I don't like the person I become like you know I don't like the way I treat people you know and I find like I don't like the way I treat myself I don't like the way yeah like I it's cool well I should say whenever you speak to your sauna to your van gesture to your wife or whomever that you become aware that they have the potential to reacting to me and not doing what I would like to happen because I'm shaming right I find it I find I can get that place after I've lost my temper and I'm almost like I can't get out of that place after I've lost my temper you know where I'm less like there's almost like too much empathy at that point like I feel so bad for what I did to them yeah so how can we this is just behavioral stuff now so can you be aware of something of that that that's something that you really would like to change that's right yeah I definitely I can see it's like the panic reaction you know I'm like I was quick to fight you know when I was growing up as a younger kid you know it was just like a trigger temper you know and it was just no I'm and it's been trying to get these emotions in check you know it's work what's the word yeah definitely it's work yeah I would love like to be able to get away from that and do away with it I found cannabis is my closest the closest time to that but before I had cannabis oh my god let's go there my early 20s I was seeing a woman her family went through unbelievable violence I had a breakdown came back to Toronto got put on paxil Bute Hren ativan a bunch I can't probably remember the names of I've tried them all and then about six years ago after ten years of these drugs I was in Holland that cycled off my pills again because I didn't like the side-effects felt the panic kind of coming on weed was everywhere turned someone in my band smoking weed so can I try it everyone looked at me like I was lost my mind cuz I'd never done it and immediately it just something happened I could look at myself outside of the anxiety it allowed me to slow down the emotions the flood of emotions and kind of take them as they came and at first I was I was you talk about shame imagine being strain it and identifying is a sober person and the strength than that for 15 years and then trying to drink or in my case smoke weed a lot of strange kids go through this weird thing when they break when they break edge so I felt weird guilt about it at first but then I realized it was working for me and then the weight loss came I was drinking like 6 liters of soda a day you know things like that like now I don't drink soda um but that was cannabis that allowed me to look at that and be like that's gross that's a lot of sugar no one should drink that much sugar and I don't know it I really gained a lot of perspective you know so you have found something that works for you that has been legalized yes it's a I find there opee and it certainly the cannabis have been the best ways to kind of to deal with stuff yeah and it takes time to release this this stuff Shane is the worst feeling that I have come up with in my clients it's just the face because it takes away your love of yourself it goes to the bone it's to the core I think I told a lot more shame about my mental health in my early 20s once I was diagnosed and I was put on those prescriptions but I think later once I kind of gained control of my mental health and gained a little bit of power over it I find working on it it makes me feel stronger this is something that's challenging and it's just let's say it's gonna be challenging for you to overcome this oh it's definitely challenging to overcome this yes and to be easy on yourself but yet if you continue to give it conscious focus it will change it was shift [Music] have you ever done breath of fire I don't think so so you inhale this time he goes out thanks how it goes in exhale close your eyes this is the center of self I want you to open your mouth wide this is the stuff that really transforms you from one session to the next I want you to see yourself there's a little boy at home at school with friends I want you to see when that little boy was unconsciously or consciously shamed don't judge it just experience it and when we experience it in this time in space we are releasing the shame these repressed memories see that lo vuoi how he was shamed for house with his learning disability with his weight at home at the dinner table don't run away from it get into the breath of paranoia let the fear come up don't run away from it the deeper you go the freer you be when you leave here and this safe space feel it [Laughter] inhale exhale let it go let it go let it go let it go what's in the room right now what are you feeling right now having gone through this process I feel for the first time an awareness of how deep shame goes and that the fact that the shame that I experience internally isn't necessarily the result of negative things that were put on me it might have just been innocent critiques of people's you know best intentions I think I also you know like maybe like a little bit of permission for myself to try and enjoy this a little bit more because it's it's it's fleeting and it would be fun to enjoy it while it's happening as opposed to regret it okay okay well end our session with angel cards and I just throw it to the unknown and let the unknown communicate to my client and see if you get some communication from the unknown from spirit I came in to myself we're gonna share it share it okay commitment okay what does that mean to you I think for me it's gonna be commitment to improving you know my mental and spiritual health you know like in emotional health - I guess - as well but bringing commitment to kind of like working on that you know and then it is something you have to be committed to and work out every day it only gets better when they work at it every day so that's what I you know take for that one well good good good good well I think our sessions come to an end and it's been a great session but thank you very much for having me thank you for being here [Music] you", "RgNbp3c-LKQ": "welcome to the first episode of mm medical edibles edibles listen don't play dumb he means like pot brownies my name is Jeff Tania Nicol and I'm a culinary nutritionist the way a professional chef no would graduate from Johnson & Wales University today we're gonna make brownies the most popular and common first edible experience you can make your own edibles at home by making butter or oil simply by using some marijuana is not a drug or trim if you can get your hands on it you can make oil with Keith's hash or shatter in terms of dosage it's really personal we'll go to the loony bin together this recipe makes 12 rounds we'll be using half a gram of shatter and butter which will equal 30 milligrams of THC per serving this shatter was tested at eighty six point four percent THC will be using infused oil as well as butter from this recipe my edibles have been recently featured in two Redman videos as well as the enough about me let's get to baking pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees we're gonna start by melting 12 ounces of bittersweet chocolate we also have a stick and a half of butter and a quarter cup of oil which we have already infused with the shadow we'll melt that together over a double boiler on a low simmer this is just a saucepan with about two inches of water and a heatproof bowl and then stir occasionally as it melts and let it completely about once the chocolates melted turn off the stove take it off the heat and set it aside let's get our baking dish ready while the chocolate melts in the oven preheats I've prepared a 9 by 13 inch baking pan I've placed parchment paper on the bottom we're going to cover the bottom as well as the surrounding edges with the infused oil that way the brownie will come out really easy once it's done baking if your supply is limited you don't have to use your infused oil you can absolutely use butter looks good to me now just set aside Oh what I'm so high right now I have no idea you should always clean as you go it always makes the end process that way less cleaning for you and now for the dry ingredients next we're going to sift all the dry ingredients together two cups of all-purpose flour one tablespoon of instant espresso and a quarter teaspoon of kosher salt I got papers but bongs all the ingredients the reason why you want to sift your dry ingredients is you want to make sure that you take out any lump it also aerates the flour so we're going to put two cups of all-purpose flour and you can put all the ingredients right in the sifter all together next we're going to grab our measuring spoons then we're going to add a tablespoon of instant expressive coffee really brings out the flavor in your chocolate and half a teaspoon of kosher salt we've set aside the dry ingredients now let's get the wet ingredients ready let's start by cracking some eggs we only need four eggs for this recipe when you crack eggs you really want to crack them one by one that way if there's a bad one you can just throw it out can I offer you a nice egg now again we're using four whole eggs for this recipe now we're going to mix it with two cups of sugar you want to use your paddle attachment for your stand mixer we'll blend the two cups of sugar with the four eggs until they're nice and fluffy then we'll add a tablespoon of vanilla extract the chocolate mixture and then our dry sifted ingredients if you prefer to use vanilla bean pods you can use one vanilla bean pod scrape the inside and add it to the mixture you mean marijuana and we're going to mix this until it's light and fluffy [Music] that looks nice and light and fluffy now we'll add a tablespoon of vanilla extract now we're going to add the chocolate mixture chocolate did you say chocolate we're going to combine the rest of the dry ingredients to the batter before we do that I'd like to take the semi-sweet chocolate and just give it a nice toss through the flour that'll prevent the chips from sticking to the bottom right now the batter looks like a thick chocolate mousse and we're going to add these dry ingredients and it's going to definitely thicken up you want to start off slow so that the flour doesn't go flying everywhere and then gradually increase the speed and you just want it till it's well combined you don't want to over mix this batter or else it will end up being like a cake I love cake the final step before we put it in the oven we're going to add 6 ounces of semi-sweet morsels [Music] perfect so you just want to place the mixture into your 9 by 13 baking dish remember we put parchment paper on the bottom and again that's going to help us to remove the brownies once they're already cooked and as you can see it's a very thick mixture that's efficient and of course we want to get every little last drop of this that's what she said you want a nice even mixture so you want to spread it out nice and even that's what she said and that looks just about perfect we're going to put these delicious brownies in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes in the meantime give us a thumbs up and subscribe once the timer has gone off you want to check your brownies with a toothpick and as long as it comes out mostly clean your brownies are all set to go you want to let your brownies completely cool on a wire rack then they're ready for garnishing we're going to make a simple caramel sauce for our brownies we're gonna start with 1 cup of sugar J 2 tablespoons of water I got you and then I'm going to squeeze some fresh orange juice which I'm just going to put through the strainer so we don't get any pulp in the sugar and we really only need about a table if our in juice doesn't appease you you can use any citrus you like lemon lime even grapefruit with the wooden spoon to slightly stir you want to leave it on a medium to low heat until it turns a nice dark amber color the caramels turned a nice dark amber color we're going to lower the flame and slowly add half a cup of heavy cream be careful when adding the cream because steam may rise and you may burn yourself it has such a delicious smell and you can really smell that orange in it your last step is to add one tablespoon of butter it's this beautiful dark amber color this is going to be absolutely delicious on top of those brownies remove the caramel sauce from the stovetop and pour it into a tempered glass dish I've gathered a couple of other ingredients a few of my favorites actually some shaved coconut some Thin Mint Girl Scout cookie cereal pecans peanut butter cups and a variety of candy bars literally the combinations are endless chocolate is like wine is like cheese is like coffee you can pretty much pair it with anything I love chocolate my favorite are the Rolo's I think I'll do coconut Rollo's and pecans definitely a good combination with the caramel sauce I'll just give the pecans and the Rolo's a rough chop you always want to be careful when you're cutting next keep your fingers away from the blade it'll tend to move on you I like to use unsweetened coconut because I think this recipe has enough sugar sugar as you can see I'm barely putting the knife to the edge just to loosen it but it should flip out for us fairly nicely another piece of parchment paper on top and just going to flip it and because we put that parchment paper on the bottom of the dish the Browns came out really easily now this does make 12 servings but you can make them smaller if you want you can use the same dough and use a springform pan and I like to make ice cream cakes or ice cream sandwiches these are definitely a nice size brownie not only the fact that they're 30 milligrams thg per serving but the actual brownie itself is a nice cents now look at how deliciously decadent these look and we haven't even topped them so I've cut these upside-down but look how delicious they look flipped over see how fudgy and chocolaty they are they have a nice crisp outside and you can tell the inside is nice and moist just melting I like to drizzle each brownie individually with the camo sauce that way the caramel sauce loses on all four edges a little bit of coconut a little bit of rolos some pecans and then another drizzle this is a great recipe that you can make with either cata butter or can oil it's really up to you and what you have available please leave us a comment and let us know how you like this video also what do you want to see us make next questions likes dislikes leave it in the comments and we'll get back to you here you have it our medical editor with shaved coconut Rollo's and pecans and a caramel drizzle just you could taste all the chocolate and the stickiness from the caramel the crunchiness from the coconut and the pecans it's just delicious tune in next time subscribe and give us a green thumbs up that was [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your doggie [Music]", "p6oKnG_sEwc": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much

today's episode is sponsored by apple and the new comedy web series the weekend warriors it's adult humor with a lot of cannabis go to our playlist section if you'd like to see a preview what are you talking about again before we get started subscribe and click the bell so you get all of our notifications you're gonna start off with Keith if you need to learn how to do car beep check out episode 3 on our playlist you'll also need kosher salt pepper chipotle chili pepper all purpose flour sugar cornmeal evaporated milk and honey eggs unsalted butter spraying vegetable oil cheddar cheese liquid smoke roasted corn roasted jalapeno bacon and spam good luck with it for today's recipe you'll need a cutting board and knife a spoon a spatula a whisk measuring spoons measuring cups something to portion out your mixture my god are you still talking you'll need a saucepan a sifter or if you don't have a sifter you can use a small strainer and several mixing bowls of different sizes you can see here that I have a very large loaf pan because I make a few of these what I like to do is I cut a piece of parchment paper that would fit the bottom of the pan I spray the pan with some canola oil and then I just place the parchment paper on the bottom there that way when you go to take your lows out they'll come out really easily I like to be preventive spray it and that way no one's gonna come out [Music] you want to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees we're gonna start off by measuring and sifting our flour we're gonna do two cups of flour for this recipe and I usually just put my sister right over the bowl the great thing about this recipe is all the dry ingredients go in One Bowl and all the wet ingredients go in the other okay if you don't have one of these sifters here you can use a strainer now when measuring anything if it tells you one cup to cup whatever the measurement is you want to make sure you get a full cup and then you have a nice full measure and now it goes right in the sifter I get most of it in there if you look at the texture of the flour you'll see the difference we want to separate the flour by sifting almost as if they were individual particles we're gonna measure two cups of cornmeal I happen to like to use Bob Mills and this is a medium grind you can find it fine grind I just happen to like medium and that means the coarseness of the green a good idea is to measure right over your bowl that way if you spill you don't make something so much of a mess and then again just like the flour you just want to make sure you get a complete measure now because it's a medium grain there may be some pieces that don't get sifted and that's fine again I'm just sifting what I can liking it a very light airy texture right hey why hear the most annoying sound in the world those are the thicker grains so you see the thin ones next we're gonna do 1/2 a cup of granulated sugar 2 tablespoons of baking powder 2 teaspoons of kosher salt there's so many things about what you just said that make it not coated sift it into the mixture and again if you have any particles left over you can push it through with a spoon or a spatula our final dry ingredient is Keef we're gonna decarboxylate Lynn to deke our beer Keith just put it in the oven at 300 degrees for seven minutes then you want to let it completely cool before you add it to any item now let's add some Keith we're using three grams of key mix thoroughly with the whisk if you find that you have some large Keeffe lumps in the batter you want to make sure to just pop them in between your fingers well before you add the wet ingredients so you bet your Keef is evenly distributed throughout your batter when you D carb the Keef it really compacts together for our wet ingredients we're gonna start by melting two sticks of butter all of our ingredients have been taken out of the fridge so that they can come to room temperature before preparing this recipe if you don't have key if you can use cannabutter instead we're gonna put this on a low to medium heat we just want to completely melt the butter so that we can add it to the other wet ingredients start with 2 cups of evaporated milk you're gonna need about 1 and 1/2 cans I love evaporated milk because I can just have it in the pantry so if you store it in an airtight container in the fridge you can use it for other recipes if you want to substitute with regular milk you can do that next 4 large eggs you want to crack them in a separate Bowl in case you get any shells or the egg is rotten that way you don't mess up the entire batch let's add the melted butter lastly we'll do the honey and then we can start blending everything all together you want to use your canola oil or your vegetable oil to spray your measuring cup we're using 1/4 of a cup of honey spray it lightly I happen to be using organic honey do-do-do-do-do-do sidenote if you eat local honey it'll help your allergies if you don't have cannabutter and if you don't have Keith you can use infused honey now give it a good whisk you want to make sure that the egg yolk and the egg white have completely blended with the rest of the mixture I like to try to break the yolks before I scramble them before I mix our dry in our wet ingredients I'm going to chop up the rest of the ingredients for our savory cornbread you don't want to mix your dry wet ingredients then go chop everything then add it to the batch you want to get them in the oven fairly quickly because you don't want the batter to sit for too long so I have five pieces of bacon here you can add more or less depending on your liking let's celebrate with bacon for Stephen Marley I'm gonna give him the honey cornbread a lot of people don't eat pork so this way I ensure that he actually likes what he gets and this will be for the savory recipe again I love bacon so these will be perfectly fine safe here with me bake off we're gonna slice up some scallions I think I'll only use form these I like to use the green and the white part of the scallion I already roasted the jalapeno pepper and the corn and all I did was take each one and put them on top of the gas stove burner and then I'll turn it ever so slightly as it gets charred you don't have to do this but I like that it adds a smoky flavor the bacon is smoked the corn and the jalapenos are roasted and that'll add another layer smokiness as well so I like to cut the little stem off and then you want to put your hand flat and curl your fingers up and run the knife through the middle of the jalapeno looking as you're doing it and then we're just gonna cut this little membrane out putting about shut up and I'll make sure to take out all the seeds as well you want to just give this a nice mince so that you have small pieces of the jalapeno throughout be careful after you've handled jalapeno your hands are very spicy so even when you wash your hands be careful touching your eyes anywhere on your face or your southern regions I'm gonna cut the corn in half that way it's easier for me to get the kernels I'm off you're gonna make a little well right in the middle and then we're just pouring the wet ingredients right in you don't want to over mix this you want to mix it until it's just well combined so make sure you get all the edges the sides and the bottom you just want to make sure there are no dry pockets as we mix it you'll see the flour absorbing the liquid so this recipe is done if you just wanted to make the sweet honey corn bread you can make your recipe out of what we just did but since I want to make a savory batch I'm gonna split this batch in half and then add the rest of the ingredients to the second batch on bread we divided the batch in half we have a total of six cups there are three cups here now we're gonna add all of our ingredients for our savory cornbread we're gonna add a cup of extra sharp cheddar cheese if you go a little over it's okay make sure you break up all the corn kernels you want about a cup we'll do bacon we need every last job there's so much beauty in the world scallions jalapenos we're gonna add a good amount of black pepper and half a teaspoon of chipotle chili pepper mix well to combine I'm gonna start with the sweet honey cornbread if you want some cornbread let him go up to the front get his own portion of cornbread that's your call babe I'm using this I can get a uniformed portion size you can use a measuring cup or anything else that you have you want to fill each mold about two-thirds of the way up so that it has room to rise now we'll portion out our savory cornbread I like to put out all the way on the other side of the cake pan so that I know which are which but these are very visibly different then you want to make sure you don't fill it all the way up to the top we have a total of 15 corn bread loaves some sweet some savory we use three grams of Keith and each loaf is 120 milligrams we're gonna put these in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes while those are baking this is a perfect time to take a break a smoke break so roll up a joint pack the bomb take a dab whatever you gotta do it's a bit COO so I personally don't mind the spice in the jalapeno cornbread laughs no but if you don't want it to be spicy you can omit the jalapeno and you can omit the smoky Chipotle chili peppers jalapeno ocula ethanol for the sweet honey corn bread loaves that we're giving Stephen Marley I'm gonna let them completely cool and then I'm gonna decorate them the cornbread has completely cooled you just want to take a regular money and just use it to pop out the corn loaf and as you can see it popped out really easily sometimes the parchment paper will stick to the bottom of the loaf and just peel it off as you can see the parchment paper didn't come off with this one let's cut each loaf to see what the inside looks like because it's the inside that counts each loaf is 120 milligrams so I like to cut it into four pieces look at how delicious that looks you see the medium grind cornmeal it's nice and fluffy it's nice and golden brown on the outside nice and area on the inside you can see the medium cornmeal grinds now we're gonna cut it into our savory cornmeal loaf this one has smoked mesquite bacon with jalapeno peppers and roasted corn scallions and extra sharp cheddar cheese and did I say bacon you can see all the components in this loaf that make it delicious I'm gonna design a Jamaican flag what part of Jamaica for the sweet honey cornbread that I'm gonna give to Stephen Marley first we're gonna add the yellow so that we have an outline for the rest of the triangles for the green part of the flag just gonna use some candy melts with that color I've melted it here then I'm gonna take it and spread some on and you're just gonna spread it just like if you were spreading peanut butter and then I'm gonna take my small knife and I'm gonna lightly press it to the edge you want to be careful as you work towards the edges for the black I'm using already dyed decorating I see it's just confectioner sugar with some water and then some dye added to it that's exactly what I did with the yellow just take your time if it gets too cold you could stick it in the microwave and that will soften it up now that we've finished all the colors in the flag we're gonna re out line the yellow here they are sweet honey cornbread for Stephen Marley I hope he likes them it was an honor to bake for a legend like him and then what's good like a pinch what a great guy and great hospitality and for everyone else we have our smoke mesquite bacon with jalapenos and scallions and extra sharp cheddar cheese and roasted corn it's gonna wait too long this

[Music]", "T9tIe981YFA": "chance the jury will take a field trip to the Middle school to see where the alleged crime occurred. Knew it. Six tonight There is a new product on the market that's being touted as legal marijuana without a prescription. It's hitting store shelves all across the Bay Area. It's something you should be aware of. FOX 13's Josh Cascio reports. Experts have a warning tonight. Sign inside Chillin Glass Gallery in Ybor City reads loud and clear trying this stuff. Delta eight, THC will get you high, Unlike your standard marijuana. This stuff is being sold legally to buyers without a prescription. The difference. What we're talking about here is Dr 90 CBN cannabis of the 80 s being available in hemp. Right. It's available in hemp. It's legal, right still gets you stone, and it's made it legal under the same laws. It made CBD illegal. It's said to be 70 to 75% as potent as the real thing. The best way to think about that is for every two hits off of Delta nine. It takes three hits off adult to hate. So essentially all you all you need is to consume a little bit more in order to feel the same effect right now. The medical marijuana system We have to see a doctor every seven months. On you're fading like extreme prices for cannabis. Some of these patients can't do that. So it allows us to offer an alternative to that whole system, the DEA or Drug Enforcement Agency says it's currently in the process of reviewing the rules surrounding products like Delta eight THC, I'm not surprised because I warned everybody that. It really wasn't medicine for the very sick. It was the camel's nose under the tip, and we've not seen all that We're going to see, says Pull County Sheriff Grady Judd. It should be noted Delta eight will likely show up on a drug test. You could also get it, Do you? Why? If you're driving high on it, what we're seeing here today is not the end result. But the next step. And to find another way to Stone America. I'm worried about the health. Of your loved ones that's going to drive on the same highway with a person that takes enough of this low Delta eight to get stone.

Tell them if you use cannabis. A recent study found cannabis responded differently to anesthesia medicine than non-users. Marijuana we know has sedative effect. It can also interact with anesthesia, so it's so very important just to be open and honest with your anesthesiologist if you are a user. And it really doesn't matter if you're smoking it, eating it, or using other methods to consume cannabis, talk to your doctor. Interestingly anesthesia drugs, they help people fall asleep during surgery, they help you stay relaxed during a conscious, what we call twilight sedation. But some doctors do say that the cannabinoid receptors, they may suppress the activity of other receptors in the brain, where those anesthetic drugs are meant to interact. And it's so important to be honest, because nowadays that cannabis has been legalized in so many parts of the country, we'll forget right? 'Cause doctors say what medicines do you take? As a supplement or, an over the counter which it is, medication so, and that's not the case. We need to know and we don't judge. We need to know everything that you're on before surgery.\nAlcohol. Supplements.\nCannabis. Well even like herbal supplements, yeah. You're healing.\nVitamin C, vitamin E. Fish oil, they all make you bleed. In this study it actually took three times the amount of one common anesthetic drug which is called propofol, to sedate people properly if they were regular cannabis users. So that's a big deal. You don't wanna wake up during your procedure because it didn't work. Good stuff. And again, I just wanna let you know how much I care about the two of you. Aw.\nThank you so much. We care about you too Travis. Should we talk more feelings? Just, I wanna stay connected. Yeah, I will. I wanna be, I do not want there to be any intimacy issues between the three of us. There is none.\nDrew. There is none. I really appreciate you buddy. I love it, I love the bromance, how sweet.", "EBLmGBlEnMY": "[Applause] [Music] what's the first image that pops into your head when someone mentions the word cannabis for a lot of people it could be this or maybe this and for those of you that are better at planning ahead maybe even this basically we're all thinking joints bongs and getting stoned but modern cannabis has become a lot more complex than that nowadays when we talk about cannabis we're no longer just talking about a plant we've broken that plant down into extracts compounds and building blocks with tremendous therapeutic potential as a result cannabis is starting to look a lot less like this and a lot more like this and that's actually great news for all of us because the new version of cannabis is a lot more exciting than the old one in fact cannabis has emerged into a modern-day superfood and if we can reset our image of this plant cannabis might actually become more important to your daily routine than coffee so let me tell you how cannabis became a regular part of my daily routine when I was in my early 20s I had a moment of what you could call youthful indiscretion that set my life down a very challenging path I applied for a job on Wall Street to make matters more complicated they hired me it was fast paced and high-stress and in certain situations that stress could become pretty overwhelming so I tried everything I could to manage my anxiety including prescription medications but those came with their own side effects on my mood and my energy levels so I searched for a different solution and it took years before I actually found one I stumbled upon a little-known can extract called CBD it toned down my stress levels but still allowed me to feel clear-headed and focused and suddenly I was back in control of my daily routine I felt confident and composed and relaxed and I just sort of felt like myself now before you all get the wrong impression let me clarify that CBD does not get you high that effect comes from a completely different chemical called THC and CBD does none of that you could take all the CBD in the world watch the entire Beatles Yellow Submarine movie and you're still not going to feel high and trust me on that one see CBD doesn't impair you instead it seems to have the opposite effect which sounds a little bit like magic until we dig into the science we all have a built-in system in our bodies that keeps our internal functions in balance despite imbalance in our external environment it's called the endocannabinoid system and it regulates things like stress mood and appetite think of it like the conductor of an orchestra when one piece starts acting out of rhythm for example an overactive stress response the endocannabinoid system can step in and smooth it out CBD happens to be one of the chemicals that supports the function of this system helping that conductor to maintain rhythm throughout the body in the brain and brain imaging studies have actually proven this through these studies we know that CBD can help to modulate activity in key brain regions involved in our stress response like the amygdala in other words CBD helps your brain to function in a more balanced state when stress level spike ok so why am I telling you about biological systems in brain activity well for one I paid a lot for a degree in neuroscience and I'd kind of like to get my money's worth the other reason is that this little-known cannabis chemical it's about to change the way we all think about our daily health it's made such a big impact on my daily routine that I now dedicate myself professionally to creating healthy CBD options for people that want to give it a shot and it's not just for people with extreme anxiety or panic attacks either CBT has this gentle calming effect on mood and stress levels similar to a meditation think of it like the volume knob on a stereo CBT doesn't shut the noise off entirely it just turns that dial down a little bit so you can hear the music and because of that it's being used to help people perform better in a wide range of daily stressful scenarios from interviews to networking people that used to have a drink to calm the nerves are now trying CBD instead it is even effective for public speaking [Laughter] [Applause] multiple studies have actually been done on the effects of CVD on public speaking and have found a significant reduction in stress and discomfort compared to a control group and the potential benefits of CVD you go way beyond stress management to because of the broad function of that endocannabinoid system CPD itself can have a wide range of benefits professional athletes are now ditching prescription pills and painkillers in place of CBD and insomnia acts are turning to CBD is a potential natural remedy for more restful sleep but before you go and toss out any prescription pills I should note this does not mean that CBD is going to cure your anxiety your insomnia or your arthritis there's no one-size-fits-all solution these things and for many people prescriptions will just be the best option but the implications for CVA are pretty fascinating particularly when you consider that we may have stumbled upon a natural remedy to common ailments that affect millions of people every single day better yet you don't have to ingest a handful of pills and supplements to get those results CBD is commonly infused into foods and beverages in a way that's healthy and convenient you can get everything from CBD waters and juices to CBD olive oil and hummus but before we all go run out of here and share a giant bowl of CBD hummus it's important to consider the risk factors is CBD actually safe and what happens if we take a lot of it these are all very good questions unfortunately we do have some answers reports currently indicate that daily dosages of CBD up to 1500 milligrams are well tolerated by the body which means they're safe and to put that number in perspective here's a graph that shows common CBD dosages and food products today versus what those reports deemed to be safe and you can see it's not even close you'd have to spend thousands of dollars every single day on CBD infused food even come close to those numbers the World Health Organization has also weighed in on this stating that CVD has a good safety profile and that no public health problems have been associated with CVD use even the FDA which sets the gold standard for safe food policy in our country seems to agree with all this just last year the FDA noted little indication that CBD has abuse potential or presents a significant risk to the public health even more remarkable CBD doesn't seem to be addicting either the FDA's data also found no evidence that CBD causes physical or psychic dependence so let's recap CBD comes from plants doesn't impair you safe for adults consumed and could help millions of people it's a pretty amazing discovery right I think we should all pop open a bottle of CBD champagne to celebrate well actually not so fast because we currently sit at a pivotal moment in the history of cannabis regulation one that will determine if when and how we're even allowed to purchase cannabinoids like CBD C as a country we don't like to change our canvass laws very often we've really only done it once before when we effectively made it illegal back in 1937 and since then cannabis has been vilified for its recreational use the idea that weed equals scary is so deeply rooted in our culture that it even affects the way we think about versions of this plant that have absolutely nothing to do with its recreational use like hemp so now after an 80 year failed experiment we're finally about to revisit the cannabis question and the decisions we make today will set the course of this industry for generations to come now this is obviously a ton of responsibility and it's very important that we get it right this time part of getting it right means doing more research setting the right market marketing standards right safety guidelines because as much as we know today there is still more work to be done and a lot of products on the Shelf today just don't hold up the right quality standards but we can't continue to put it off to kick the can down the road because the longer we delay our regulatory decisions the longer we deny access to a natural solution to common ailments that should be very treatable we need to move forward based on real science one step at a time now I'm talking you about CBD today because it happens to be a pretty great first step it's healthy its natural and we have a growing database of research to support its efficacy so how do we move forward on CBD regulation well first we all need to determine what it is there are a lot of people out there who will tell us that CBD should only be a prescription medication those people are called pharmaceutical companies and there and they're well aware that this industry is projected to be worth 22 billion dollars in a few short years but maybe we're a little skeptical of those motivations because if we removed the veil of cannabis stigma CP is nothing more than a natural plant ingredient with therapeutic potential it's really more like a superfood and fortunately we already have a pretty good blueprint for that thanks to America's all-time favorite functional food caffeine now I know it might seem strange for me to stand up here and to compare something from cannabis to an everyday item like caffeine but bear with me are they really all that different they both come from plants they're safe for adults to consume and we use them to improve our mood and our energy levels interestingly enough caffeine was once vilified too back in 1909 the United States government filed a federal lawsuit against coca-cola for marketing a product that contained caffeine which they deemed to be unsafe nowadays caffeine can be found in all sorts of products from food and beverages to cosmetics and even medication we ensure that caffeine products are safe and labeled properly and then we let people decide if they want it when they want it and how they want it and since I'm sure everyone here has had some form of caffeine today it's safe to say we're all pretty comfortable with that system we need to take the same step forward with cannabis because cannabinoids like CBD should be no more threatening than a cup of coffee and if we do it the right way this time we have an opportunity now to give millions of people access to something that could improve their work lives their social lives and their overall happiness but we need to take a step back first in order to move forward and toss aside those outdated stigmas because this plant is a lot more than just weed cannabis should be viewed as therapeutic so let's hit the reset button on our image of cannabis starting with a fresh look at CBD and if we can change our perspective on one aspect of this plan maybe we can take another look at the rest of it - thank you [Music] you", "7wwX5ShkDsI": "new canadian research has found a direct link between cannabis use in pregnant women and an incidence of autism the study found that children whose mothers reported using marijuana during pregnancy were more than one and a half times more likely to have autism than children who were not exposed researchers looked at 2200 ontario women who gave birth between 2007 and 2012 and said that they used cannabis while pregnant the research was done by the ottawa hospital chill born ontario and the university of ottawa joining me now with more is dr doreen alchar co-author of the study good morning thank you so much doctor for being with us good morning first of all give us your thoughts on what the research found sure so you summaried summarize it nicely but our research was really looking at maternal cannabis and neurodevelopmental outcomes after having looked at it previously in obstetrical outcomes last year and we noted the increase in the diagnosis of autism that was made in children born to mothers who had consumed cannabis during the time of our study period which is about 10 years when you look at the follow-up period of when they were born and then to how long we followed them so were the researchers more interested in looking at why autism occurs or what happens if mothers use cannabis during pregnancy what was your starting point yeah so for this study in particular it was around neurodevelopmental outcome we've previously looked at what happens to pregnancies and we found an increased rate of preterm birth and some other obstacle outcomes which were affected like birth weight and other placental issues um so we we generated more work from that existing uh interest uh to now look at the feed the the babies and the infant outcomes so this is focused on the neural development and brain so autism was one but we also looked at other intellectual learning disabilities and found less of a significant association so there are health warnings out there about using cannabis during pregnancy is your feeling that those warnings are not being followed it's hard to know right now and as you mentioned yes health canada society of obstetrician gynecologist we still recommend against use because we don't have enough evidence to talk to our mothers about what it could mean i think that we probably are seeing similar rates and maybe a little bit more upfront patients telling us about the use because of legalization so that we may be seeing however we haven't looked at the numbers yet but we plan on doing that now to see what the numbers are post-legalization in 2017. right i guess i'm wondering why people why pregnant women would use cannabis is it because it is legal now people think that it may not be um harmful during pregnancy to their baby so certainly that's one there's always the impression that if something is legal it may be okay but we know that that's certainly not the problem the issue with other substances like alcohol and smoking so i use the same analogy um as in terms of why they use it certain moms do need to use it because they've used it for other medical issues for pain management or uh dealing with other symptoms so certainly we have to be aware of and helping those uh patients with other uh uh you know other medications that they will need to have to deal with their uh medical issues as well as there's some people who use it recreationally still as well as for potential help with nausea so this was a big study what do you hope to do with the results uh yeah so this is one of the largest studies and more recent times published we hope that this will help sensitize you know and help our care providers counsel their patients about some of the risks and certainly we know we need to do more studies and continue looking at the cohorts of patients as this was from 20 2007 to 2012 so we need to look at more recent data and continue doing linkage and we also need to look at whether timing of use and other substances affect the outcomes as well as different types of cannabis as you know there's many different forms that can be used doctor thank you so much really appreciate you being with us this morning on this study very important", "DgH97erLA90": "when I was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer giving me perhaps 10 years to live it did feel like things were falling apart give it here give it here okay but just because conventional medicine doesn't have a cure I refused to believe I'm out of options there are many stories on the internet of cancer patients who say their lives have been saved by cannabis like Darren Blackwell who was just days from death at the age of 14 the doctors had done all they could his mum who'd been giving him cannabis oil for the pain boosted the dose and Darren made a sudden recovery Darren lamb bill nice to meet you how are you I'm getting itchy hello Carly how are you five years later he still fit and well I was bones and flesh and fat all in nothing else there was barely any blood in me so he come just give you a good path to death yes yeah then you didn't die yeah yeah that was the difficult compartment because because I wanted to die so the dying part was easy you just have to relax Inka like deal without how I had accepted it the crucial question is to what extent you feel that cannabis kept you alive ninety percent Manchester I was gone mentally just walking around like a zombie and then I came back and I recovered really quickly it was really strange it kick-started my immune system and my bone marrow it helped do something to it there's no doubt about that the addition of the cannabis helped Darren's story fills me with hope but while he's convinced that cannabis saved him there's no medical proof so to discuss the science of it I'm meeting dr. Peter McCormick one of the top cancer scientists in the UK so what's the difference between cancerous cells and regular cells yes so cancerous cells start to grow uncontrollably and become a large mass and they don't respond to the stop grow signals that normally come from the body so basically these cells are not getting the message from management that they should be dying correct or they're just not lit they're willfully not listening correct okay so how do you make them this well you try to identify what makes those cells unique versus a healthy cell and put in what we call a silver bullet to try and kill those cells and what's the closest you come to the silver bullet in this case we're studying cannabinoid receptors cannabinoid is a small molecule naturally occurring in cannabis at Eva's cannabinoid receptors you can think of as radio transmitters of cells and what we've discovered is that one of these cannabinoid receptors is higher expressed in cancer cells so there's more of it in a cancer cell than a healthy cell and we're trying to take advantage of that imbalance to kill off and tell that cancer cells stop growing so if you put the right kind of cannabinoids into that petri dish there it'll kill them off correct that's great what about in my case I've got advanced prostate cancer metastasized it's in the bone yeah so we've done some work on prostate cancers and it looks like in certain cases you can get prostate cancers which will respond to cannabinoid there you", "Z7cHiGiyQN8": "we're sitting in the Central Valley of California it's very poor the land is very cheap and the education is very bad there's nothing for our children to do here and I always say if I was raised here I would do math too we live in a county that has voted repeatedly against allowing any cannabis commerce here in this county we're violating their laws by existing we get by because we say we're not cannabis we're hemp but they are anti cannabis plant it's a hostile Regent but I always said the nuns don't go where it's easy the nuns go where it's hard that's our food and buy some folk and keep us in your voice we're sure the sacred walk we take respects this sacred place we are sisters of the valley we are a group of women who live together pray together work together we make CBD medicine we are not connected with any contemporary religion we are patterned after our beguine mothers the first organized nurses and the castles of Europe between the years six hundred and fourteen hundred CB d stands for cannabidiol it's a compound in the cannabis plant the cannabis plant has so many different compounds THC that's the compound that gets you high CBD is an aspirin like compound it calms the nerves it's good for pain it's good for insomnia it's good for anxiety [Music] the sisters chose to get into the CBD market because we saw it as a newly deregulated market and in any newly deregulated market you're getting on bucking bronco and you got to hold on tight for the ride we don't see eye to eye with our local sheriff he sees CBD or any type of cannabis related industry as damaging to his area anytime anyone asks him about the sisters oh I'm gonna go bust them ladies law enforcement has investigated us in my first year of operations a drug sire followed me for a week he told me that he quit following me after three days he was supposed to follow me for a week but my life was a Yahner that's what he said they seized product coming in and product going out and had it tested in a federal lab and at the end the federal lab could detect no THC in any of our products and they handed me the test results and said carry on we've concluded you're in the hemp business [Music] our top-selling product is a CBD salve which is like a lotion we make it with coconut oil vitamin E some calendula it's loaded with CBD it costs two dollars and fifty cents to make a jar of topical salve which is the balm that you rub on your joints that we might sell for $25 so there's a nice spread I did everything pretty much myself the first year and did $60,000 worth of sales and then the second year I had three more sisters and we made in sold $750,000 worth of product last year it was 1.1 million our public loves for us to be gangster nuns but the fact is last year on 1 million dollars worth of sales we paid a hundred and forty thousand dollars worth of taxes my name is sister Kate I founded Sisters of the valley I was born and raised in Milwaukee Wisconsin my father was a machinist for the breweries my mother was a stay-at-home mom and we had six kids and we were very traditional Catholic family I ran my own consulting company for 15 years it was called expert business solutions I made a lot of people very wealthy through deregulating industries I was a project deployment person if you said to me I want to do telecom in Denmark I'd go to Denmark and figure out a way for you to do telecom services in Denmark what's your bad divorce was left penniless came to the Central Valley and started growing weed my name is sister Alice I've been a sister for over a year now I'm a Reiki Master I was a massage therapy teacher at one point I was ill kind of bedridden taking medication not feeling very well I myself take CBD for fibromyalgia I also have a thyroid disease for many years I talked muscle relaxant sleep and medication anti-anxiety I tried everything nothing really worked it just made me worse I started taking CBD it actually got me off the opiates [Music] the first problem that we have in this business is the taboo of cannabis everyone still believes it's a dangerous product hemp doesn't get you high it is loaded with CBD which is the compound we want for the medication we probably grow a quarter of an acre or less of cannabis cannabis being a Schedule one drug banks will not take our money we have nowhere to do business banks treat us like we're criminals we had to get an overseas bank because no banks in the US would take money from a cannabis business we set up a British company so we could have an international bank that isn't so squeamish about hemp we're considered pioneers by the people of the cannabis industry for even getting MasterCard Visa American Express and Discover they think that's amazing because most of the industry is still in the hands of cash and no we can't get business liability insurance and no we can't get mortgages so easy and we even have trouble getting benefits for our employees this industry is not for the weak-minded [Music] to me what the cannabis industry was missing was a spiritual approach to the plant we do get hate mail from the right-wing don't we and every once in a while a pastor from Michigan will just call and go off on us but we're like okay fine we're not your cup of tea go away we're okay to cater to the 4/20 clubs on the planet in the liberal left so when they say how can you continue to operate with a permit I say we have a higher authority than you guys we have MasterCard American Express Visa and discover if we post one pot plant online we could lose our right to process major credit card so we have to walk a very fine line for them for them well we will walk a line all these big corporations jumping on the bandwagon because they know cannabis is where we're gonna go next coal jobs are not coming back to this country fossil fuels are dying out we're going to create a whole industry out of a cannabis jobs [Music]", "235gIzWOkrM": "Interviewer: Hello, and welcome to this very\nspecial episode with Sadhguruji which we are doing on the occasion of the \nInternational Yoga Day. Sadhguruji Namaskaram. \nSadhguru: Namaskaram. Interviewer: And I want to \nask you Sadhguruji, Yoga has become a very, very \nimportant part of people's lives. In fact, a study has recently shown that about\ntwo billion people across the world have gone to practice Yoga -- that means one out of\nevery three people in the world. Is, is Yoga the latest fad or does it really\nhave the kind of empirical backing that we are now seeing through studies by, by Harvard University and other \nsuch studies that have come up? I, I want to ask you, is there a scientific reason that the world \nis adapting Yoga as a lifestyle? Sadhguru: Namaskaram and on \nthis international Yoga Day, it is very important that first of all, how did this international Yoga Day\ncome into existence? Because when this was proposed by India by\nthe Prime Minister when it was presented, one hundred and seventy two countries said,\nan emphatic \u201cYes\u201d to it. Never before in the UN, anything has gotten\nthat kind of support, because everybody was literally waiting \nfor India to do this all these years. It's now that we have done this. Having said that, why is this so important? If you look at anything that's \nhappened in human history, nothing else has lasted as\nlong as Yoga. 12,000 to 15,000-year history it \nhas and it has lasted. This has not been propagated forcefully, never\nit's happened holding a sword to your throat, somebody said do Yoga. But it has happened only because it has worked,\nonly because of its efficacy it's on. So do we have empirical data about it? \nOne hundred percent. But empirical data as you know it as it is\nbeing collected in today's scientific jargon, and the university levels is only, let's say\nthirty to forty years or fifty years old. But we have enough experiential data in this\ncountry that we know it works. One hundred percent it works. Millions and millions of people have \nbenefited from this, no doubt. So having said that, today, you know, the\ntwo things that everybody is worried about is -- one thing is a virus. Staying alive \nphysically is one big challenge right now. And the next thing is because people are in\nlower levels of activity, they are cooped up in their homes \nbecause of the lockdown, it is an established factor that when the\nnecessary physical activity is not there, there is a decreased level of BDNF or the\nbrain derived neurotropic factors, when that happens, this will bring \nanxiety, depression, Alzheimer's, decrease in emotion, I mean, emotional\nexhaustion, burnouts, all these things happen. This is an established understanding in the\nmedical science. But now with the yogic practices with the\u2026\nwith the Inner Engineering practices, we have established that University of Indiana, professors from Harvard University, Rutgers and Florida University have done a \ncomprehensive study where they're sowing\u2026 showing that the BDNF levels are three \nfold higher than a normal person or it increases three fold within \nninety days of practice. So one hundred percent people are out of their\ndepressive modes and other anxiety situations and all this. One hundred percent there out. There \nis now blood markers clearly showing this. This is not just sociological studies, these are actually very intrusive \nblood markers being studied and we are clearly seeing this\nand even genetic dispositions are changing by the yogic practice within \nninety days\u2019 period. Interviewer: Sadhguruji, I don't mean to joke\nabout this, but in recent research by a group of scientists, including professors from \nHarvard and Rutgers, they've mentioned there that there are really high number of anandamide\nreleased after yogic practices. Many people are questioning, isn't this the\nsame thing that creates intoxication? So is, is Yoga, a substitute for a Friday\nevening or a Saturday evening drink? Sadhguru: No, no, this is those people who\nare not in Yoga they're using Saturday evening as a substitute. You're putting it \nthe other way around. See, look at my eyes.\nI'm always stoned, twenty-four hours. They are getting stoned only on the weekend,\ntell me which is better (Laughs)? So one is there is what is called as endocannabinoids\nthat is produced in our body. There are cannabi\u2026 cannabis receptors, receptors\nin our brain and right through the body. We have receptors, why are they there? Because it's expecting that you produce this\n\u2013 endocannabinoids. When you produce this, everything is at ease. Your experience of life both physically and\nmentally is very pleasant. When your experience of life is pleasant, you naturally function at a higher\nlevel of efficiency and capability. Human potential is fully realized simply because\nyou are not an issue in your life. There are thousand issues to handle in our\nlives outside, but you should not be issue. If you yourself, your own \nthought and emotion is one big issue. Right now people are going about as if it's\nyour right to have a mental problem. They\u2019re saying it's our right. Oh, why are you saying it can go away? It cannot go away.Human beings \nhave to live with this. Why? Because if people think their diagnosis is\nthe nature of being human, I'm very sorry for that. The important thing is, a human being is capable\nof having mastery over his or her system much more than any other \ncreature on this planet. So, Yoga is the science which \nexplores this dimension. And tell me if you were also, you know, when\nwe talk about this, we talk about three dimensions. One is intoxication, I am putting that in\nthe front, but it's actually the last one. Intoxication, intensity of our energy and\nour experience, intensity of our senses, and stillness within ourselves, these three dimensions\nif they are on every moment of your life, you are never the issue in the world -- within\nyourself, you're never the issue. Ha, there are outside situations \nthat need to be handled, we will do to the best of our ability. You tell me Navika, you're doing whatever\nwork you're doing right now, it's demanding in these times, this work that you're doing. Tell me can you do this better when you're\nfeeling wonderful or when you're feeling stressed and depressed? Interviewer: Obviously, if \none is feeling better, one performs to an optimum \ncapacity at that time. Sadhguru: So if you're generating your own\nendocannabinoids, you will be feeling wonderful every moment of your life. Your mood is at your best level, you're joyful,\nyou're blissful. When you are like this, you will \nfunction at your best. This is something that needs to happen. Well, you said two billion people -- I'm \nterribly disappointed with that because this was my mission \nwhen at the age of twenty-five, when things exploded within me \nand I was dripping ecstasy, I thought what is the problem? At\u2026 on that day, the population \nwas 5.6 billion people. I thought in two and a half years\u2019 time,\nI will make everybody blissful. But here I am. Nearly forty \nyears after that, but two billion people, well, I \ndon't think that's a good number. Seven billion people when \nyou say I will say yes, because that is the purpose \nof International Yoga Day, that everybody should have tools of self-\ntransformation and well-being with them. The tools of self-transformation, the tools of being able to manage \nyour own well-being from within, should not be in the hands of\nan institution or a guru. It must be in the hands of every human being. That is when you will see a better world. Interviewer: You're saying that you know,\ndoing Yoga can actually make you anxiety-free, but today, mental health is a real issue. Sadhguruji, we've lost a big Bollywood star and that's come as an eye \nopener to many people in this world on what mental stress \ncan do to you. And mental stress has many dimensions -- mental stress happens because most of the Indians today are living in fear of the virus infection. There are some who are living \nin fear of losing their job. There are some people who are living in fear\nbecause their salaries have been cut. There's some people who are living in fear because they don't know the future \nseems absolutely uncertain. Financial crisis probably is more evident\nnow in virtually every other household than it ever was before. \nDo you think there is\u2026 there is any scientific proof to tell us that \nmental health can be solved by Yoga because the Bollywood star\nthat I'm talking about was somebody who did a lot of physical exercises, was a very fit\u2026\nfit human being? How does mental health relate \nto this yogic practice? Sadhguru: Well, when you say is there any\nscientific evidence, what scientific evidence means is that there are certain markers on\nthe level of our physiological level, which is usually the blood markers. There are certain genome markers, there is\nBDNF, which is an important marker, the neurotropic markers, \nall these clearly show, you can not only prevent these psychological \nailments by doing the right practices, but you can come out of it \nalso if you do it the right way. Only problem is when somebody is in a state\nof mental depression or other things, getting them to do the practice \nis a huge challenge. It is a very big challenge. Unless there are dedicated people around them\nsupporting them in every way to make them do it every day, it won't happen.\nThat's what we do here. I can show you thousands of people who have\ncome out of various mental problems by that, doing because we create a supportive atmosphere. This may not be possible in every \nhome to make it happen. So the question is of application. If we can apply will they come out of it? \nOne hundred percent it's possible. There are some pathological cases \nwhich are very hard. So there also we have seen such cases, whatever level of medication \nthey were on, we have brought down that level of \nmedication significantly. So about suicides that you're talking about. Every year 800,000 people are committing suicide\nin this world, can you believe that? It's more than all the crime, murders, \neven wars put together, that many people don't die, that many people \nare taking their own life. This means every forty seconds, one person\nis taking his own life. Only when somebody that you know dies or only\nwhen somebody who is popular or significant in a society dies, everybody sits up. But every forty seconds somebody is committing\na suicide, we need to really look at this. Why are human beings \nwant to take their own life? Simply because we have not inculcated anything\nin our education system which tells us how to handle our physiology \nand psychological structure. There are many ways to put this.\nThe simplest way to put this is just this. Most human beings have not been taught how\nto handle their own intelligence. If you had half the brain that you have, you\nwould have no mental ailments. Because you have a certain level of intelligence,\nand you\u2026 you have no training, you have no social situation, where you're being taught\nhow to use this to your\u2026 your well-being, now your own intelligence \nis turning against you. When your intelligence turns\u2026 turns against\nyou, it looks so hopeless, as if there is\nsimply no way out of it. That is what leads to people committing suicide. Some may be committing suicide because of\ntheir life situations. But a whole lot of them are committing suicide\njust because of their psychological situations, that can easily be easily be stopped. If there is a proper system, right from childhood,\neverybody is taught certain processes, where their endocannabinoids are on, that \nmeans they are blissful by nature, their experience of life is pleasant. Naturally, when this is there, why would you\nthink anybody would take their life? Why would you think anybody \nwould be depressed? I know there's a whole lot of people who,\nif you utter the word depression, they're usually pouncing on me for that, because they heard the word depression only \nprobably from the diagnosis they got for themselves. The word depression is not only clinical depression,\nif two things go wrong with your life today, you could be mildly depressed. Well, you will talk yourself out of it. Otherwise, you will talk to your friend or\nfamily and they will talk you out of it. Otherwise, you will seek \nprofessional help. If there was no way \nout of differ\u2026 depression, why would a psychologist sit with \nyou and talk to you for hours? Obviously, he knows he \ncan talk you out of it. And otherwise, chemical help. Right now when it comes to chemistry, this\nhuman mechanism is the most sophisticated chemical factory on the planet.\nThe question is only this. Are you a great manager of this chemistry\nor are you a lousy manager of this chemistry? This all there is. Yoga means you become a very \nefficient manager of your own chemical factory. Interviewer: Sadhguruji, the Harvard study\nalso shows a fifty percent reduction is perceived in stress if this chemistry itself changes. So I want to ask you, what comes first, the\nemotion of depression or the chemistry changes? You know, chemistry changes occur after depression\nhas overtaken us or do they take place before the depression emotion takes over us? And how do we control it in, in a normal situation\nwithout paying somebody who's professional in this, huge amount of money for just talking\nus out of it? Sadhguru: See, I think a whole lot of people,\nmajority of the people at one time or the other they will start getting depressed because\nof some life situation, but within a few hours they \nwill talk themselves out of it. Either, you know, some kind of inspiration\nthey will use, either their love for somebody or love for the nation or \nlove for something else, and you know, work \nthemselves out of it. Whatever matters to them in their life, they\nwill use that to come out of it. But whether the emotion comes first \nor the chemistry comes first, well, this is, this is yes and \nno both ways because for some people they have naturally \ncome with a little volatile chemistry. If I say something now (Laughs), I must be\nvery careful because people will again perceive this as something \nagainst women and things like that. Women have always a little more volatile chemistry\nsimply because their physiology has a larger responsibility of bearing a child. \nBecause of this, there are more fluctuating things \nhappening in her body than compared to \nyour man's body. So the chances of chemistry causing emotion\nis very much more possible, not that it's not possible in a man. It is very much possible in a man also but\nit is more tilted towards women, but thought causing, thought or emotion causing chemical\ndisturbances is more so in the male. If you really look at it in terms of gender,\nthis is chemistry disturbing emotion and thought is more in the woman, thought because a man\nalways thinks he's intelligent, this is a big problem (Laughs). So, he will work himself into a place where\nhis chemistry gets messed up. But a woman's chemistry is more volatile \nbecause to facilitate a childbirth\u2026 See, we are just thinking childbirth means,\noh, it just happens. It is not a small thing. It is like a whole \nnew creation happening, all right. So the, the fluidity of our chemistry, sometimes\nwhen it doesn't function well, this fluid chemistry can easily \nthrow emotional situations off. Many women, pre childbirth or post \nespecially post childbirth, they experience like they \nget depressed, they get hysterical, but naturally they will settle in \na few months or so, they don't usually go for \nmedication in this country. No\u2026 they will create a protective atmosphere\nfor that lady and she will come out of it. So this is about chemistry \ncausing emotional disturbance. But emotional stress or even the thought process\ngoing in a certain way can very easily disturb the chemistry because \nthey are not too far away. One will reflect in the other very quickly. Interviewer: Well, Sadhguruji, I completely\nunderstand what you're saying and I'm not one of those feminists \nwho will question this because I've, I've gone through childbirth and, and I think, you know, \nwhat you say is very, very real. But I, I also want to ask you that the reasons are only increasing \nin the times that we live in. There are reasons due to the kind, the kind of pressures we feel because of \nthe COVID virus situation. But there are also reasons that are extraneous\nreasons we have no control over for example, the China situation -- \nThe India-China situation. I want to ask you, Sadhguruji, this country\nhas been a country that has wished and prayed for peace from times immemorial. Yet this country has been ravaged by wars,\nagain from times immemorial. Today, when we stand at one such cusp, how do people really think about the \nuncertainty that is currently prevailing? There is anger which is directed \ntowards the country. There is, there is a whole lot of heightened\nemotion from people in the country. How do you think we have to manage this and how do you think we need to \nlook at this entire issue of China? Sadhguru: This is not only about China. First of all, let's understand this \nwhat we call a \u201cNation.\u201d Well, we like to say India is a cultural entity,\nthis, that, everything, yes it's all true on one level. But essentially \na nation is a piece of geography. So except on the oceans, except in the oceans,\nnone of our other borders are properly defined. East, West, North, \nnowhere is it properly defined. How do you make a nation like this? Is your Western border clearly defined? No, you have a LOC. \nNorthern border, you have LAC. Eastern border, you know all the trouble the\nperfo\u2026 perforated borders that you have. So after seventy-five years of independence,\nwhy have we not defined it because somebody did not \nunderstand what is a nation. We have fancy ideas; we will \npray for fee\u2026 peace. I don't know what's the other word \nyou use, pray and what? We wish and pray for peace. \nPeace will not come that way. We must do the right things \nso that the ambiguity is reduced and the reason for any kind of\nconfrontation is reduced. And then once that is done, \nrest, peace must be enforced. This is the way the world works, peace within\nmyself I can achieve in a different way. But I would say that is also enforced. I am peaceful and \njoyful because I enforce it. Otherwise, if I look at the outside situations,\nI can also get depressed. I have decided such things \ndon't happen to me, I enforce it in myself that I \nwill never be disturbed, I will never be unhappy, I will\nbe peaceful and joyful. This is an enforcement within myself. \nThe same thing is needed. As a nation we must enforce peace, whether it is at the border or \non the streets of our nation we have to enforce peace but enforcing peace\u2026 Interviewer: And you said, somebody, somebody has failed to do it over the last \nseventy-five years. Somebody means who? Sadhguru: \nEnforcing peace is extremely difficult when there is ambiguity about \nwhat is our nation, what is not our nation? Who are\u2026 putting our army out \nthere every day losing men, whether in the West or in \nthe now in the North, constantly, because there is so much ambiguity, because we did not understand \nwhat it means to be a nation that we have to secure what is a boundary, whether we lost something, gained something\nthat's not the important thing. The important thing is there should be no\nendless ambiguity about what is our nation what is not, because at any time somebody\ncan rake up a problem. Right now, we need to understand this. See our problems are in the West, now in the\nNorth, even with a small nation, which is so much a part of our culture and absolutely\nlike one nation it is, though it is a sep\u2026 politically separate nation. Even there we're having problems, simply because\nwe have not clearly defined our boundaries. This, the earlier you do it, \nthe better it is. Now after seventy-five years, \nnobody is willing to listen to you. You should have done it the moment \nyou get independence, within the first two, three\nyears, you must define your boundaries. This is very, very important. \nSomeone did not understand this. This is a serious flaw.\nBut this is a reality. Now at least we should strive to somehow define\nthe boundaries of this nation so that every day we don't have to \nkill young people on our borders. Interviewer: Someone\u2026Well, there is a political\ncontroversy or political slugfest that is on but when you say someone should have done\nit in the first three years of independence, I think the world and the country will understand\nwhat you mean by those words. Well, thank you very much Sadhguruji for joining\nme at a time when India is facing challenges, but on a day when International Yoga will\u2026 Yoga Day will tell us the importance of Yoga\nto not only control our emotions within, but also to get out of depressions and keep our\nbody and mind absolutely fit and happy. Namaskaram and thank \nyou very much for joining. Sadhguru: Various, various very \nsimple and powerful practices being offered free to the entire world.\nEverybody should make use of it. This is not about controlling emotion. This is about transforming emotion, \neither misery or joy is a choice. We must exercise this choice. \nInterviewer: Yes. And from misery you can create ecstasy as\nSadhguruji just explained to us. Well, with that, thanking Sadhguruji. \nWe'll take a short break. News follows on the other side.\nSadhguru: Namaskaram", "MpM9Jsiz6H0": "the skin is the body's largest organ it mediates our sense of touch and guards us from the outside world it's a protective layer and our first barrier to fight illness and disease but it's also the root of problems for many millions of people suffer from chronic skin conditions like eczema a painful red itchy rash that has no cure researchers are now looking into compounds found within marijuana to see how they perform to help some skin conditions there's a large segment of the population that doesn't like using steroids even if they're topical stores on their skin this would be an alternative natural product for them to try inside science when we have somebody who's tried topical steroids or topical immuno modulators that suppress the immune system for psoriasis or eczema and they haven't gotten completely better there's the potential of using this new therapy that might work in a different way and help them the marijuana plant produces more than 100 chemical compounds called cannabinoids thc and cbd are the most widely known and understood the cbd cannabinoid does not give the effect of getting high it is non-psychoactive but it has anti-inflammatory properties that may help with inflammation and itching in conditions like eczema doctors caution though that testing needs to be done some products containing these compounds and claiming health benefits are already being sold to consumers all of these dispensary products haven't been controlled and tested in randomized controlled trials either but there's a plethora of companies making topicals and they're available widely and being used widely for pain for itch and other indications and the data of how it's working is not being collected systematically yet and we'd like to do that i believe it's a wide open horizon with tremendous potential that needs to be investigated but there are a number of regulatory hurdles that need to be overcome and that's where we are so far researchers have started a clinical study to look at certain skin disease that affects some patients with parkinson's disease about half of patients with parkinson's disease have a rash on their face called seborrheic dermatitis and it's like dandruff of the face near the nose doctors want to investigate whether an oral drug containing the cbd cannabinoids can help with the parkinson's related rash there are 40 patients enrolled now in clinical phase 1 and 2 trials sponsored by the colorado department of public health but getting the research up and running hasn't been easy the fact that it's illegal at the federal level but legal at the state level it leads to a lot of complications in trying to do research on marijuana and its derivatives called the cannabinoids they've overcome many years of regulatory hurdles in order to come into work like that parkinson's trial that i mentioned that is actually a trial that is going on it's randomized it's controlled it's the highest standards of evidence to eliminate bias the results from the parkinson's trial are not complete but researchers do know that compounds in cannabis have shown to alleviate pain associated with eczema and psoriasis doctors caution that more clinical trials need to be done before any reliable recommendations can be made this is inside science inside

presentation is meant for guidance purposes only and not as professional legal or tax advice and further it does not give any personalized legal tax investment or any business advice in general so with that out of the way let's hop right into today's agenda so a few things we're gonna cover today I want to first talk about what's the difference between white labeling and private labeling and then I want to talk about why I believe that white labeling is the next wave of the cannabis industry will address some red tape around the industry specifically in the state of California will discuss some pros and cons of white labeling as well as which products can be white labeled and what product you should start with then we'll discuss the capital needs and how much money you need to get started as well as any final considerations to wrap this up and let you get a little bit more color in context of the white labeling industry and what you're actually signing up for once you start to work with a white label er so first white label versus private label so while white label and private labeling are very similar there are some subtle differences to distinguish the two so with white labeling a generic product is created by a manufacturer for multiple resellers so for example a white label manufacturer would sell a vaporizer pen to ten different partners and each partner is now responsible to rebrand that product as their own and they are able to do that with a white label business each retailer each business partner is selling the same vaporizer pen with no modifications at all the vapes are simply rebranded and marketed as the retailer's own product and this is the fastest way to get to market but your product will be the same as every other business or every other retailer out there so without much differentiation in your product or not anything's to really set it apart you'll need to work really hard to differentiate your brand now with private labeling which is primarily what we're going to be talking about and discussing about these terms can sometimes be used interchangeably it depends on the capabilities of your vendor but we'll get to that in a moment here but with private labeling the product is created exclusively for sale by a single reseller by a single person a single brand and let's just keep going along with that vapor example so the private label partner would then have the option to modify the actual product right so if you are a brand or a business and you want to get into this private labeling with private labeling you have the ability to modify it to fit your selling requirements for your brand a lot more levers to pull right the modified vaporizer that we're talking about here is exclusive to your particular business and it comes complete with you know your logo and your name and your brand identity and white labeling has the ability to do that as well but sometimes in private labeling and most times in private labeling you can go a little bit deeper with the packaging or where the raw ingredients come from or what material is used for the outside shell or whatever it's going to be maybe you want to use shea butter instead of argan oil or whatever that's going to be because you have a specific thing that you want to use and again sometimes these terms are used interchangeably and it really really depends on the vendor that you're working with and their capabilities of how custom that they can be and for the sake of this presentation I'm just going to use the word white labeling but again you can get as custom as your vendor allows so in cannabis you can get a totally off-the-shelf kind of product with little input and white labeling you just send them over a PNG of your logo and bam now you've got a vaporizer product but if you want to take it to that next level you can also go to a private label or someone who's on maybe a more sophisticated white label ER and you can provide the raw materials the packaging the inserts and any other things that help you make it more your own or your brand so next I want to jump into what I believe white labeling is the next wave of the cannabis industry so two things I want to address upfront getting started in the cannabis industry is typically very costly due to the licensing capital expenditures how much working capital you need and so many more things that add on top of that it's like a 7-layer cake there's just so much going on that you need to pay for and that's because it's a highly regulated industry this is no different than opening up a pharmacy or starting a liquor brand there's a lot of red tape that you need to address you need to have obtained of professionals help you address so it's gonna cost a lot of money and the second thing I want to address up front is that cannabis is kind of clicky it's all about the relationships right it's a beginning it's a new industry that's emerging out of its Darkness period is there's a lot of relationships and a lot of friendships in there where some of these bigger brands have been friends and been home you know seven eight fifteen years and they really want to keep this knowledge intimate to themselves so knowing this I want to make two main points of why I think white labeling is the next wave that can usher in the next we'll call it class or next set of entrepreneurs and business owners so the two main points I want to bring up is that white labeling helps you to reduce your initial startup costs by allowing you to rapid test your ideas before jumping all the way into the deep end of the pool so instead of having to come up with a million dollars and permits and all the other things that come along with building your own manufacturing facility you can reduce your risk by getting a proof of concept to show some investors that you have a solid idea or product market fit before you go and get fully funded and bring manufacturing in-house or before expanding your products to a whole new line a whole new part of that cannabis industry not to address that relationship part and how clicky things can be you know white labeling allows you to leverage built-in distribution in retail relationships so the power of manufacturing is in a few hands right there's a lot of little mini manufacturers but those that can do large white labeling runs for you it's in the hands of a few people and they have all the economies of scale and over the next 12 to 24 months that's gonna become more impactful because if they're not already there they will get there at some point and they're typically vertically integrated and have relationships with distributors if they aren't one themselves and those distributors have relationships with dispensaries and delivery services you know your hardest task of getting into a dispensary or getting the ability to get into a delivery service and building those relationships throughout the supply chain is typically already done just by engaging with the white label manufacturer now I'm not gonna say that this is the end-all be-all and you're gonna be all set some people are just great at manufacturing and they are terrible at building these relationships just because they have a manufacturing background maybe they came from a different industry we're able to set up a facility fast but just don't have those relationships and so we'll talk about some of the due diligence things and considerations later in this presentation here so that you can understand really what you're getting into and who you're working with and what they can provide you right there's gonna be a just general manufacturer or white label er but one who's really smart connected intertwined into the industry who can really help your brand take off and get some of those eyeballs on your because it's very noisy nowadays in the cannabis industry there's a lot of new brands it's really cool to be a cannabis entrepreneur but it's really tough to break through all that noise so now let's address some red tape about white labeling so you have CBD or THC now CBD is not Schedule one so it's a little more relaxed you can probably find more white label errs to help you out you can even do drop shipping with some of these white label ears where they'll keep some product on hand at their warehouse you can set up a Shopify that sends over an API call to their packing facility or their warehouse and it ships out without you even having to touch or see the product nice again typically with CBD now with THC in California specifically there's a little more you know red tape and some hoops you have to jump through all right the state has acknowledged that white labeling is going to be inevitable not everybody has a million dollars to start a business initially white labeling wasn't even allowed but now it actually is so essentially what you need to do is create an intellectual property licensing agreement with your white label vendor so for example say you and your friend or you and your team or you on your own you build up a brand you want to start a brand you want to sell you know creams or topicals infused with THC for pain relief maybe you want to go after runners and because you're a runner and you know that hey if we build a brand that's geared towards runners we can actually move this product because we have names stay in this local area of runners right so what you do is you're going to develop a logo packaging design if it's a really good one get a design patent for your packaging if it's again very unique or cool and you put that intellectual property into an LLC so that the LLC owns that intellectual property and next what you need to do is find a white label producer or operator who wants to sell your product so you got to get them excited about your brand and don't be afraid to share your ideas they're just ideas and execution is where the real value is that you have to sell this idea to the white label er because a lot of people want to get into white labeling as well some of the manufacturers that we were working with and trying to vet for a program we're starting up here they are so backlogged in the amount of people that want to work with them that they can't service everyone so they're only servicing the biggest most sophisticated brands that want to get into the industry or people that have really good and unique eye Diaz in brands so again be able to share your ideas and sell your ideas to your white label manufacturer and get them excited about it so once you find that person you're gonna be working with if they produce that product then you as the IP holder get a royalty payment from the white label producer okay so there's a few ways in which that could happen it could be on the per unit basis it could be based on total revenue it could have minimum payments every month which incentivizes the white label er to push your product out to those distribution networks there's a lot of different variables in these agreements but essentially you're gonna be getting money on the brand that you created and truly products are gonna get so good and so easy to manufacture that brand is all that you're gonna really have left to lean on right t-shirts are t-shirts some people pay $80 for a white t-shirt some people pay the six dollars for a Hanes t-shirt it's all about the brand and where you fit in and who your target market is right even in food most of the major sauces and salad dressings and other food products are made just by a few co-packers like venture of foods but brand is what moves those units so again the same thing is happening in cannabis just make sure that you're building a brand that people you have affinity for that resonates with them that addresses who they are as individuals as well as a collective group so you can really pull people into that story that you're creating with your brand now lastly once that IKEA agreement is made the state then requires a producer or the white label er to notify the BCC which is a beer of cannabis control that there's a new financial interest holder in the license now it's not that they're a new owner or an equity holder in the license it's simply that you need to let the state know that the brand is benefiting from the sale of cannabis products under that license so that's a state can see hey is this person the new person they're adding on a bad actor or not and lastly you know this is just a high level 30,000 foot look at everything here but do your due diligence in your specific city county and state right I said this is just for the state of California again just some general guidelines on it so our suggestion is to work with a lawyer to make sure you know how to structure these deals properly to protect you and the producer as well as keeping yourself compliant in many of these white laborers have in-house counsel to help you negotiate these deals or maybe they have a boilerplate deal there's not much wiggle room for negotiation but usually compliance is built into the system so let's just jump into some pros and cons of white labeling now it's not all roses it's not all great there's not all these benefits and no drawbacks so let's just peel back the layers of the onion and really just give you a good healthy dose of reality so the pros of being in the white labeling sector of the cannabis industry is that multi-state operators can open into new markets quickly and increase their distribution drastically so if you have a formula and a product that works over in Oklahoma and you want to come over to California you can't bring THC across state lines so to open up in California you need to find a white label manufacturer who will work on your formula will work on your product and bring you into that market so it's how you can take a proof of concept from one state to another state open up fast and leverage all that brand power you have in another state and say hey look we're moving 1700 units a week in this other state can you please help us you know open up in Southern California and then in Northern California or wherever you're trying to go to you could end up opening up an Illinois or in Nevada it all depends on how fast you want to expand but white labeling allows you to do that quicker in white labeling is usually the fastest implementation of getting into the industry and relatively cheaper than an all in-house manufacturing type of business again you don't need a million dollars to start I had done this a little bit earlier but compliance is typically built into the model of white labeling no white label manufacturer is going to purposely skirt the law just to make 50,000 bucks right they're going to keep themselves protected which will then keep you protected another pro about this is that it reduces what you have to focus on so when you go to white label manufacturing you get to focus solely on brand invisibility depending on how much you know distribution is built into your model but when you focus on that again the future is all about the brand and great operations so if you have great operations that comes from the synergy between you and your white labeling partner and their capabilities paired with your capabilities so if you want to focus on just building a brand building visibility for your brand find a white label manufacturer that has the ability to distribute your products to the most end consumers or to the most retailers another positive thing about white labeling is you typically know your costs up front so you can price your products accordingly right if you know what your costs are you can bake in your margins and know how much you need to move to break-even or to make a profit and then also if you want to open up and become a big Big Shot that has lots of offerings having multiple white label vendors allows you to offer a wide variety of products for which you wouldn't really have the in-house capabilities to do it would take a lot of machines to be able to open up a topicals manufacturing and then vaporizers and then bottled flower and all these other things that come along with the ability to white label if you wanted to do that on your own you need a really large facility as well as a lot of money and a lot of equipment and a lot of human capital and human intelligence and lastly I think I hit on this and just hit it again it's the fastest go to market strategy if you want to get into the market this is the fastest way to do it all right so let's discuss some drawbacks of white labeling again it's not all positive there are some limitations to this so when you start to work with a group of people or a team of people or a few different parties things can be lost in translation and there can be misunderstandings in what you want for your products so when you pass on your vision or your product idea is to say another agency and then they pass it on to a project manager at a white label company who then passes it on to a project team with inside that white labeling company you know this stream of information can get distorted at some point an important part of your vision or the functionality of the product that you want or an ingredient it may get lost along the way and that same thing happens and it repeats at a feedback loop right so because it's not just gonna happen in one iteration you know a few things can fall off at every step and then you know the wheels fall off so if you don't keep close eye on your white labeler in that relationship that you have so the chance that your projects agenda will be changed or miscommunicated is a probable risk when you get into white labeling so double-check everything get samples before you give final approval for that scale-up manufacturing you know really really develop a human relationship and good communication with your white label learn as we discuss in the beginning between the difference between white label and private label there is potentially a limited ability to customize your end products so maybe you want to offer some type of minut feature some updated creative packaging idea this may not be possible depending on the white label manufacturer or the flow of the products you know you could have someone manufacture it in bulk like the main pieces and then you do all the final assemblies so you can make sure that there's a handwritten note in each one or I'm not sure whatever you want to do but again this bleeds a little bit more into that private labeling which will then probably increase your cost so just be thoughtful about what is really an important no negotiation this customization needs to be built into the product and if not we're not gonna go with this white label err or this private label or so just keep that in mind as you go throughout the process and spec out your products of what you really want to have and building on that limited customization is that duplicate products will be in the market you know if you go with a set straight white labeling send a PNG of your logo they print you out the packaging the product and all this stuff and it's very much the same as the next company a and Company B you're gonna have to work really really hard to differentiate your product since many companies are gonna have the same functionality the same you know feel to their products using this a lot in the vaporizer industry with the batteries all looking pretty much the same or a lot of the cartridges look the same so just be very cognizant of what's important to you what are you trying to actually accomplish are you trying to accomplish a proof of concept for a brand name are you trying to accomplish moving 10,000 units are you trying to accomplish just getting something started you're really truing up your end goal with the person who's gonna help you get there and see if they have the capabilities to get you to where you want to be at all right so now as we discuss the pros the cons and what this really is and how to do it you know which products can actually be white labeled again we touch on this before you can do CBD and THC variants or a blend of the two you can do topicals buttocks ads and creams and balms you can do oils right tinctures and things like that sprays cosmetics you can do soaps vaporizers the vaporizer cartridges and the batteries you can do bottled flower right someone could grow great cannabis and they just slap your name on it like you grew it for yourself you can do capsules like pills you can do dog treats edibles anything if you can put oil into it you can probably make that into a product there's so many different ideas but it wasn't even thought you know maybe five years ago to do CBD dog treats and now it's one of the more popular products you probably could figure out some gum ideas or beverages there's so many different ideas but look into what your local laws allow you to do right some states don't allow you to infuse THC with alcohol products or that your edibles can't look like animals or you know you so there's a lot of different little nuances and red tape that you have to work with and work around so again work with a lawyer or someone experienced in the industry that can help you get the product that you want and stay compliant so with all those different product ideas what products should you start with well there are many factors and it's really up to you but let's review some considerations when you walk through this thought process of what product you want to start with so first and foremost I always think about what's your risk tolerance do you want to go with a proven product you know you see vaporizer cartridges moving so you go with that cuz it's more of a sure bet compared to something that's you know groundbreaking you know haven't even thought about it you've never ever seen it and you want to go and spend a lot of money in R&D and build this unique product or do you want to do something in between a hybrid or something kind of bring this one plus this one makes a new kind of product you know really up to you what your risk tolerance is because risk tolerance includes the amount of time in the amount of capital you need to put into this so think about how much risk do you want to put into this business then you really need to consider who is your intended target audience so questions around that are like you know what problem do they have and what do they desire right so if you're working with maybe the female target audience and there's all these vaporizer pens but they look real masculine you know maybe you start one that's got more gentle pastel colors it's smaller in size and that addresses maybe the inconspicuous can fit into a purse or can fit into you know women have pants with really shallow pockets and they wanted to fit in those shallow pockets right you have to ask yourself can this product provide a solution to the problem that my intended target audience has there's a lot of different target audiences you can hit I talked about earlier for the runners maybe you are gonna be you know addressing pain relief for runners does this topical product that you're going to create actually work and relieve the pain in their shin splints or in their ankles or in their feet you know I'm not sure what runner problems are but I can just only assume it there's probably something wrong with their legs does your product address that intended problem they have another thing kind of get tying in to the risk tolerances how much capital do you actually have because some products are more capital-intensive than others right if you're gonna be doing something groundbreaking you know more costs are gonna be there but if you're gonna go with something more proven you know not as much cost it can be a little bit faster go to mark him so do you want to do you know something really big and get a huge initial order so you can reduce your unit cost and then increase your margins later down the road because you have the ability to you know get into more dispensaries you know lots of considerations around capital there they need to think about how are you going to be marketing the product and what influence do you have with that target audience so maybe you have no pull at all in any specific industry so maybe you're gonna start using influencers or maybe you do have some kind of pull in an industry or in a target demographic and you're gonna use your personal network or you're gonna go real big and buy billboards in downtown Los Angeles or in Hollywood and get a lot of people to know about your product at a very expensive cost because with cannabis specifically THC you cannot buy paid advertising on the main networks like the googles of the world Facebook Instagram Twitter you just can't do that yet they're not risking the ability to buy those ads so but for CBD you can do that so just be cognizant of where you're actually remarketing at maybe you do event marketing in dispensaries or you go to Facebook groups for people that are in your target demographic you know you could do hand-to-hand combat by getting a kiosk at the mall during the holiday season and sell CBD products right it's gonna be a very very popular product this year I can already tell and feel that CBD is gonna be one of those default Christmas gifts for maybe people that you have no idea what to buy but you know they may have a quote unquote physical ailment or something that these CBD companies are saying that hey if you get this product it's gonna fix this issue or you know help you out with this problem that you have I can really see this becoming one of those successful kiosks at the mall during q4 this year another consideration for deciding which product to start with is what kind of distribution do you currently have do you have built in relationships or you building new bridges right if you're coming in real cold to this industry you know think about maybe having a more differentiated product is an easy your cell into the dispensary because they already have access to vaporizer cartridges and you know bombs and pills and all these other things that are common products by going and getting something more unique you may have an easier sell getting into there or maybe you own a dispenser yourself and you already see what's moving and again you just want to recapture some of that margin if you see that vapor cartridges are moving fast and you know it's easy to sell or upsell one of those vaporizer cartridges or you do a deal on it and you know you're paying $10 wholesale for it and you're selling it for 45 bucks well why not just go to a white label manufacturer and get it for six dollars and then sell it for 30 bucks it's a little bit of a deal because maybe you're in a budget shop and people don't want to pay that forty dollars it's all up to you there's so many different ideas but just think about what kind of distribution do you have and how do you actually get into where you want to be to create more distribution or leverage what you already have and lastly I come to touch on this a little bit earlier but like what expertise do you have you know what is your expertise in maybe you're a dog trainer so you should start selling dog treats because people already trust you in that space if you're a dog walker maybe you should get into selling dog treats because people already trust you around dogs they think that you're a quote unquote expert maybe not as a dog walker but as a dog trainer but if you've built a relationship with twenty or thirty different clients that you walk their dogs maybe you can sell them a bag of treats every two weeks and that adds an extra ten or fifteen dollars in your pocket per client and then you have so thirty clients at fifteen dollars that's $450 a month there you go and then you can start to recruit other dog walkers to get into your business right that's how you can find an opportunity you don't have to become the biggest baddest cannabis company you just had to find product market fit and leverage your built in trust now the big question we always get is hey how much capital do we need to get started in this business so with the generic starting your own company in cannabis it can be quite high but with the white labeling it can be a little bit different but there's a wide range depending on how big you want to go from the beginning right you could start small with a proof-of-concept and then scale up or if you know what you want to do and you jump in full force you're gonna need a little bit more money right and it's all up to you but there's a spectrum of you know how much capital you want to have so I can't give you a steadfast number but I will give you some considerations on how to think about this okay so typically I see a minimum of at least fifty to seventy-five thousand dollars and maybe even closer to the hundred thousand dollar mark and yes you can do it on a shoestring budget but that's if you do things perfect right and if you don't you could be sitting on a thousand vaporizer cartridges with no buyers you have to think about the total cost of doing business not just going to the white label manufacturer don't just try to go in and get done fast you need to have good amount of capital to get started in this industry but again if it's lower maybe you are again that dispensary you already have built in everything else I'm gonna discuss in the next you know a few bullet points here so you know you only need fifteen thousand dollars to do your first product run because you want a thousand cartridges at fifteen bucks apiece for one gram cartridges and you're ready to roll because you got the built-in distribution you've got the built-in marketing you have a captured customer client base so I'm talking more about brand new never been in the industry you're gonna need at least fifty to a hundred thousand dollars but more on that top end especially if you don't have experience the biggest factors truly in my mind depend on the minimum order demands from your manufacturer and your ability to distribute your product out again I've brought up dispensaries can be a little bit on that cheaper side but if you're brand new you're going to need a good amount of money to move into this industry and again it also depends on how well you can actually execute do you have any business experience right just general business experience but how about cannabis business experience in marketing experience do you know how to create a brand how to drum up some excitement for this brand how to move units of a product so what's your go-to-market strategy you're gonna start slow or do you have the ability to move very very fast right so when we talk about this big number seventy five hundred thousand dollars fifty thousand dollars you again consider the full cost of doing business so product samples design of the packaging right if you don't do design yourself paying someone to design your logo the packaging design testing out the products you're gonna go work with four seven ten different vendors you need to buy samples test out those products over you know whatever time it takes for you to create some certainty in your mind so it's gonna cost money and that could cost you know one two thousand dollars it's just totally up to you and how deep you want to do your research then you need to look at your initial product run what the scope of that how much product you actually need to produce for the minimum order quantity storage cause so if you're gonna work with the pure white labeler that does drop shipping for your CBD maybe they charge you every month to store your product but if you're gonna bring it in-house you're gonna have to find some way to store that you can't store it at your house you can't run a THC company out of your house you need to find a licensed facility to store that ad then you need to think about a marketing budget how much are you gonna be paying for any of your marketing tactics website development if you're gonna be building a website and not doing it yourself operating capital taxes sgna there's all these expenses that come to starting a business so really be thoughtful about when you approach this industry and just the specific aspect of white labeling it's not just getting the product it's all the other costs that you have to incur to actually get this product in the end consumers hands or even just to the retailer so that the retailer can bring it to the end consumer we've covered a lot here I just want to go over some last few considerations that you need to put these thoughts into your mind and really think about all right we're really going to be doing this and if we are let's be really thoughtful about this so when you take a white labeling partner you think about how close are they to you geographically you know do you have the ability to go in for an inspection of their facilities or if you want to keep a real tight handle on you know the manufacturing practices and this also allows you to do faster product review and testing you know but if you're a multi-state operator maybe you need to put some boots on the ground in California for the first four to six months while you get your foothold in the LA area or in the San Diego area or in the Sacramento area now the next thing to consider is what's their reputation are there other products out there that they've created that they've helped take to market that they've helped manufacture ask them these questions say hey what other brands do you manufacture for what other brands have you helped explode their awareness get to know your white label or don't be scared to ask these questions then looking into your white label err are they vertically integrated with distribution in most cases they are and in most cases I would say try to work with the least amount of partners because for a few reasons I think three main aspects of this it helps you roll fees into one transaction right it caps your cost you know what you're going to be out the door pricing secondly it helps you reduce your tax burden since most if not all movements are under the same license at the same which means less taxable events and then this also saves time in negotiating and coordinating if there's only two people to work with instead of seven you reduce all that back and forth with emails and phone calls and as we talked about earlier that lost in translation the least amount of people that have the ability to drop a ball the better next consider do they have contacts that want to take your products on this is that distribution part I keep hitting on this because it's really really important right any white label er can produce a great product right like I said in five years everyone's been making great products and any white label can distribute products cuz you just need a license to do that but can they actually get you shelf space right shelf space is the name of the game when you see certain cereals in the grocery store or at eye level versus other brands that are at the floor or way at the top there's a reason they pay for that and it's also prevalent in cannabis it's called slotting fees right in cannabis specifically in California you can see fees anywhere from a thousand dollars up to five thousand dollars per month to get shelf space in some dispensaries now ethically this is frowned upon and some people say hey that's not true market telling you what to do but it still happens look they run the dispensaries they are the first layer closest to the customer they're gonna do whatever they have to to make extra money and it just happens so you know sometimes you can't even get into businesses unless you know someone at the dispensary right there are some dispensaries that are you know sitting outside LAX and all the international clients come there because it's so close they're sitting at the LAX hotels and they do five six eight million dollars in business and it's really hard to get into that dispensary and you can only get in there if you know somebody so my thoughts around this or my guidance would be you need to think about creating a poll strategy getting customers to ask for your products compared to pushing your products onto the retailer's because if seven eight ten twelve people every week for the past month have asked for ABC product and we don't have it it's gonna force that purchasing agent at the retailer to say alright I need to go look at you know whatever this ABC product is we've had 50 people ask us in the past month and I don't want to lose business to the dispensary down the street so that's a pull strategy versus a push strategy on to the retailers and I would say really truly never ever fully rely on your white label partner to do the sales part even if they offer it at a higher sales point they are really good at manufacturing and probably not the best at sales they can probably open the door for you let's say hey Mike I want you to meet Michelle Michelle meet Mike and then you guys take it from there you really need to be a sales person of your product be that ambassador enlists other brand ambassadors to talk about your product and bring your product to awareness within those retailers a few other considerations around one really really important the thing that we think about the most is structuring a deal to understand your exposure so some inexperienced brands will not fix the production fee which can really really get out of hand depending on the experience of the white labeler so for example packaging and you have a manufacturer that does everything from A to Z product and packages it and puts it all together well what if they don't store your packaging properly and it gets damaged there could be a clause in your contract they got to pay for it but it's still a headache that you have to deal with but aside from it getting damaged say you actually dig into the numbers you want to look at what we call production variances so when ideal product we'll say is one package one label one product right but some things do go wrong it will happen so who assumes the responsibility when things go to two packages one label in one product who's paying for that additional package so we suggest you be able to cap these variances or at least be able to moderate it with each production run so getting a report back from the manufacturer we made 500 products cleaned up using 527 pieces of packaging 500 products and 570 labels this can give you some insights to hey maybe our packaging is not as efficient as we thought we should maybe think about retooling our packaging or maybe our label you know should be done in a roll instead of individual labels a lot of things to consider when you start to get these production variances back from your manufacturer so to build on that structuring or deal properly and the product variances is understand the white label our inventory management so you can get reports you know you need to know about your business you need to know the numbers behind your business so do they have a dashboard or a portal that tells you how many packaging units are on hand many labels are on him how many production runs have been done and when is the next one scheduled one of the inventory quantities on hand and what we're seeing is because the industry is very new there's not a lot of sophisticated technology being implemented there's a lot of sophisticated technology but it's not always being implemented and you'll see that many of these white label manufacturers will have to do a hard count by hand and it's not the ability to look into a portal so depending on how granular and how flexible you want to get with your inventory management you know you just take these things into consideration in the last part about structuring is raw materials so when you structure this deal is gonna be say a clause and it says you know raw materials need to come from white label manufacturer but whatever that's gonna be so when you look into that just understand where can these raw materials come from is it the manufacturer only can you work with an outside vendor if it is an outside vendor does it need to be pre vetted by the white label manufacturer is there an additional cost to using an outside vendor you know I would really try to work in there the option to keep it open that you want to work within outside vendor for your oils or for anything any part of the production just at least keep that option open open for negotiation don't close that door because you don't know in 18 months a new oil manufacturer or refiner may come up that is just you know the best product and then you hear it all over the streets a if you're not buying oil from this company you're really missing out you're making a subpar product so that was my thoughts are on structuring a deal properly and some other considerations about white label partners so we covered a lot of ground here a lot of information but I just want to give you a few key takeaways so white labeling is a relatively cheap and fast method to go to market improve your hypothesis you can find a proof of concept get some product market fit and then leverage those results to either go get funding and scale up your operation or if it doesn't work cut bait and just move on no worries a lot less money has been lost I would suggest that you work with a reputable and experienced team who can help keep you compliant throughout the entire process whether that's lawyers tax professionals like green grouse CPAs to make sure you're not going to be exposing yourself to too many taxes experienced manufacturing teams who can create a great product with a little variance and not opening you up to a lot of exposure of risk the next part of roundness is building a brand is gonna be paramount when working in the white label part of the cannabis industry and creating white label cannabis products again if you go with a strict white label and you don't have any customization brand is all that you have but if you work in private label and you go a little more custom you have a few more product differentiators to lean into but really brand is what this is gonna all boil down to you see it in all types of other industries there's lots of different ketchups and I would say 80% of them are made by one big manufacturer it's just the de brand Heinz versus hunts versus you know this new organic something or other that's where it's gonna be at all about the brand and lastly structure your deal to reduce your exposure to unnecessary costs and limited future product update so make sure you're addressing what the production variances are going to be and trying to cap that as well as giving yourself the space to have new vendors come in or new suppliers of raw materials come in to help you make a better product 18 36 48 months down the road so thank you for taking the time to watch and listen to the webinar hopefully this has brought you some value and giving you some color in context around white labeling in the cannabis industry and why we believe this is the next wave at least for the next 12

and oils for topical pain relief i'm dr donald fabio cbd from hemp oil is what we're going to be talking about today and how it's used as a topical pain relieving liniment it's very common it's available everywhere just about all 50 states right now i believe over the counter and again it's a hemp oil extract which means there's very little thc in there there's no psychoactive effect so let's be clear about that we're not talking about the medicinal marijuana we're talking about hemp oil extracts cbd so how can you tell if it's going to be a beneficial for you well you got to read the ingredients and once you read the ingredients you can determine if it's going to be a good product you look at the concentration you look at what's in there and you look at what your goals are so right now our goals are pain relief that's what we're talking about so i just have a couple of creams randomly chosen cbd plus oil gold formula full spectrum hemp extract which is what we talked about so that's good it has the ingredients 100 milligrams of cbd we don't know how much per serving but the jar is 100 milligrams and it's got sweet almond oil beeswax and glycerol stearate and a bunch of other ingredients on the bottom here but no artificial dyes or scents so that's good no artificial dyes or scents it's got a lot of emollience a lot of things that are going to soften your skin with cbd which means it's going to set on your skin probably really good for someone who has a skin lesion like psoriasis or eczema something like that i don't think it'll be really good for pain control because it's not going to penetrate through the skin beeswax sweet almond oil those are oils hemp oil it's an oil it's going to sit on the skin so might be good for skin types of things where you want moisturizing and healing but i don't think it's good for pain control cbd clinic pain relief ointment oh now we're going right after pain they're claiming this relieves pain let's look at their ingredients cbd hemp oil good so we know it's it's there it's safe 400 milligrams so um this is 1.55 ounces this is 1.3 ounces so there's a lot more cbd in here um there's peppermint oil tea tree oil eucalyptus oil clove oil so lots of good oils in here um we look at the label however under active ingredients and it lists camphor 11 and menthol 16 wow that's really high so you're going to get a lot of icy hot you're going to get a lot of counter irritants menthol will give you a cooling effect camphor kind of gives you that cooling heating effect so it's an icy hot 17 percent icy hot is very very strong so this will give you a counter irritant effect i don't know if it's going to decrease the inflammation but it doesn't really address the pain directly it dresses it into correctly because it irritates the skin with the menthol in the camphor and then therefore the brain doesn't sense the pain in the area so it doesn't go after the cause but very strong stuff the next one we have is phytozol transdermal phytocannabinoid complex serum uh what are their active ingredients well it's a 100 milligrams of micro encapsulated time released photocannabinoid complex cbd so the cbd here is encapsulated well and what it's encapsulated in dgme which is a transfer agent so here um there is no menthol there is no camphor there is no methyl solicitolate it's just cbd which is an oil which is encapsulated surrounded in dgme which allows it to get through the skin into the deeper tissues um i do know this does not get into the blood by the way i did research that it doesn't say it on the label it just stays in the in the superficial tissues so this will actually penetrate through the skin it won't sit on the skin so if you're in the cbd gets into the skin through the skin and once it penetrates then it can become an active ingredient at the deeper levels and it binds with the endocannabinoid receptors in your body going after the cause of your problem and suppressing the pain and inflammation that way so a transdermal agent that goes through the skin and doesn't sit on the skin so the active ingredient goes through the skin only company i know that has that whether it's cbd or not cbd that just sits on the skin with emollients cbd with counter irritants so you feel the icy hot so you know something's working but you don't know if the cbd is working so the bottom line is what are you looking for do you want to go after the pain and inflammation or do you just want to do a counter irritant if you just want to do a counter irritant i would say skip the cbd and just go to a really high concentration methyl salicylate menthol camphor formula that you can buy anywhere as well if you want to use the cbd it makes sense to do the phytozol because then you're going to be able to get an ingredient that penetrates through the skin scientifically proven to go six times deeper than other companies penetrate there's the information now you know i'm dr donald fabio thanks for tuning in", "MSzIYGWRXbE": "- [Narrator] You've probably already heard about cannabidiol,\nbetter known as CBD. It's exploded in popularity with claims of treating everything\nfrom insomnia to diabetes. - That's the only thing that would help me with my migraine headaches. - [Narrator] It can be consumed as an oil, applied to skin, or inhaled it as a vapor. We know CBD is a component of marijuana, but it's derived from hemp,\nusually does not contain THC, and won't get you high. The game changer for the\nCBD industry came when President Trump signed a farm bill legalizing hemp cultivation. One prescription drug\ncontaining CBD has been approved for treating two rare forms\nof childhood epilepsy, but the vast majority of\nwhat we know about CBD has been limited to personal experiences and unproven animal studies. - More often than not, things\nthat look good in animals, when you go into humans,\nthose effects aren't there. - [Narrator] According to a\n2018 Harvard Health Blog post, scientists say they still don't know much about how CBD affects the brain or which doses and\ndelivery methods work best. For example, if you put a few drops of CBD under your tongue, you\nmight consume 10 milligrams. But some researchers say you\nwould need 30 times that amount to reach a threshold\nthat can relieve stress. And since CBD products\nare primarily marketed and sold as supplements, the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration doesn't evaluate whether these products\nare safe or effective.

that lasted over a decade of fentanyl patch neurontin methadone Norco a myriad of pharmaceuticals that at the height had me over the next decade on 26 different drugs a day what I was left with was overweight depressed unable to work unable to even drive a car but more importantly what I was also left with was chronic pain because we're opioids are an excellent option for people that are in acute suffering they are not the best solution for people having chronic suffering such as mine so I went looking for other solutions about this time I met a woman by the name of K kurta Posse and k was a self-described waken Baker each morning she would wake up and she would pull out her little pink Hello Kitty pipe and she would have a couple of Puffy's so I judged K very harshly I saw her as a drug user but she also told me something very interesting and that was that she was making pot brownies for her boyfriend who had chronic neck pain and that he was able to use or eat one of her brownies before bed at night and not have to use any harmful pharmaceuticals to sleep through the night and that got my interest because up to that point we all had heard the hype around this but all of a sudden I'm like there's got to be some science here so I I started looking for solutions and the first thing I did is I went to a doctor in California who was willing to write me a recommendation to use cannabis and I thought great I'm gonna go and I'm gonna see this doctor and I'm gonna walk out of there with a prescription and know exactly what to do but instead what I got was a sheet of paper with a list of dispensaries and he pointed to one of them and he said this is the Nordstrom of dispensaries so I suggest you go there well I love nor DS so of course that's where I headed so I went over to the dispensary I stood in line I walked up to the counter and I said to the young man behind the counter now that I know is called a budtender and I said okay I have chronic pain what do I use what do I do and out from beneath the counter he pulled a rice krispies treat a bag of caramel corn and a chocolate brownie and I'm looking at this and I'm thinking what how do I use it what do I take and he's like well I have no idea you know I just like this one and it no it kind of makes me and I was like okay great this is not science this is not medicine I need to go and find out more information so I then made my next stop was it heme con well heme con fulfilled every stereotype that I had about cannabis I mean you had your young ladies with the body paint and the strategically placed pot leaves you had the I heart vagina signs along the wall you had the the deafening boom box you know boom boo-boom boo-boom and I'm trying to listen to the vendors and I'm asking them questions and they're giving me answers and and I can't hear anything but what I also heard while I was there was the same girl in the body paint was treating irritable bowel syndrome with cannabis you had the person with the chronic pain seeking answers the social anxiety looking for answers with cannabis so I thought there's got to be something here and I'm since I'm obviously not finding it I'm gonna have to go figure it out myself so I went next and I bought a couple of ounces of something called xxx chem dog and I got it at the granny rate and I went home into my kitchen and I started making this I could not believe that my pain had been so affected by this plant that I had gone from level 8 to a level 2 almost instantaneously when I had taken a puff of it and that no doctor up to this point had ever bothered to mention to me that cannabis was an option how was that even possible so I thought what is it going to take for a doctor to be able to recommend cannabis effectively for treating patients just me so I made this in the kitchen and I can add the oil and I'm looking at it and I'm trying it and I thought okay what is it gonna take so that a doctor feels comfortable actually recommending this for its patient so what are the keys that are gonna be there the first thing is there's gonna have to be lab tests associated with this product if you do not have a lab test associated with the medicine you do not know how many milligrams of each cannabinoid is in there you don't know what you're taking you don't know how to take it and you can't be consistent and frankly a doctor is only going to want to prescribe or recommend something that can be done consistently and accurately the next thing is the doctors going to have to do a very in-depth patient intake process because they're going to have to have all of the same questions that they would ask in treating any disease but then they have to incorporate a set of questions that are specific for cannabis use in itself the next thing is they're going to have to very well understand this plant and the properties of it there are over 500 chemical compounds within the cannabis plant and each one has its own medical potential within it and so how they work and how they work together is very important that a medical professional understands when making this sort of recommendation and the next thing is they're going to have to have a way of giving you specific dosing instructions for each disease that you're treating so that once they do start this feedback loop that they can see what's working and what's not working and refine the data and keep making it better and better I'm a process engineer finding patterns and establishing with data is just the logical way to figure out something and turn it from a plant into a medicine so I went out next and I got a whole bunch of different varieties of cannabis and I was very excited I made all these oils I sent them out for lab results our lab testing and lo and behold I sat down and I'm looking through all these labs and I'm like what am I looking at I have no idea what any of this means I do not understand I don't understand what beta carry a saline is I don't know what Elsa PI I don't know what any of these different components are this so I need to get more education on this because the thing that's fascinating about cannabis is that it is really a pharmacy and a flower because you have all these different compounds within there you know everybody knows about THC and CBD you hear about these in the press there's the misnomer that one gets you high and one is the medicine I would flip that and I would say one isn't of much value and the other one is really good medicine meaning the THC that's a different talk but let's go ahead and stick with this but you also have other cannabinoids in there like CBN and CBN is the one that helps to make you sleepy you have THC v which we believe regulates the insulin uptake in the body so there's all these other you then have all these things called terpenes what terpenes are what you taste and what you smell in a terpene for example in in lavender you have something that's called a little lool that's very calming if you've ever picked up a lemon and held it to your nose and smelled it and had that uplifting feeling that it gives you that's limonene that's also in cannabis so we know that it has all these various components within it and we have to see how they work together I learned about something called the entourage effect now this isn't an actor with a bunch of fans hanging around him this is how all the components of the plant work together in the case of cannabis the whole truly is greater than the sum of its parts because you can buy isolated where they just use one component of it but it is not going to work anywhere as near as well as when you have all of the components together so let's talk about a piece of chocolate cake you could have your flour your butter your sugar your eggs your vanilla your cocoa all of the ingredients that go into a piece of care of chocolate cake but you certainly are not going to have have the experience of eating a piece of chocolate cake and that is a nutshell what the entourage effect is so now we know that we have to have the whole plant so that we have this entourage effect we know that doctors are going to be able to have to dose it correctly but what is in fact a dose because people don't understand that so what a dose is is how much you take and how often you take it if the doctor says I want you to take two in the morning and two at bedtime that's your dose if the doctor says I want you to take one three times a day that's your dose if they say take ten milligrams in the morning and 20 milligrams in the evening that's your dose now what is the therapeutic dose a therapeutic dose is how much is required for you to accomplish what your objective is for example if your objective is to sleep eight hours a night the amount of cannabis that is required to get you asleep keep you asleep and allow you to wake up after eight hours feeling refreshed that is your therapeutic dose if you're suffering chronic pain it's not the amount that knocks you on your butt it's not the amount that gets you high it's the amount that gets your pain under control to a point where you were still a fully functional member of society that is the therapeutic dose it's not just how much you can use so now let's take a look at what is not a dose all right because I hear all the time from people I'll say how much are you taking and they'll say oh I take a one-to-one or I take a one to five or I take a twenty to one well that's great that's a ratio that tells me how much you have one component is in relation to another but it doesn't tell me what they are it doesn't tell me how much concentration of each one is in it just tells me the relationship between two different molecules it's also not the number of drops if I say how much do you take and you say four drops or two drops or five drops if I don't know how many milligrams are in the whole I have no way of knowing how much is in an individual drop and then lastly the most important in the United States in particular where we are not on the metric system however the medical community is a milligram and a milliliter are not interchangeable one is a weight and one is a volume so you need to know how many milligrams of the cannabinoids or whatever the chemical compound is within the volume of whatever the product is whether it's an oil or a cookie or a rice krispies treat alright so let's take a look here at a theoretical therapeutic dose now I want to stay right here before I go any further this is not a particular dose for our therapeutic dose for anything for anybody it's strictly for the purposes of the disc demonstration and I have it up here and I want you to also before I go any further I want to say that no doctor in their right mind would ever recommend somebody start out in a dose this high you always want to start out very very very low and increased slowly until you reach your therapeutic dose but let's take a look at this for a minute we have a recommendation here of a THC dominant medicine that from the doctor they want you to take 25 milligrams a day divided into two separate doses with 1 5 milligrams in the morning when you get up and 20 milligrams about 1 hour before bed they wanted to have several of these different terpenes in it if possible and they want you to take it sublingually which means under the tongue thus the picture of the person sticking their tongue out at you a little bit rolling stones so I'm going to take that and say ok now that you've got this how do we take that information and convert that over to going to a dispensary to buy a product to match it so I'm going to take this as a typical infused oil because it's sibling wool we need to use a tincture or something that can be done under the tongue and let's take a look into a blow-up of the label alright so this on this label I'm going to look along with you it says it's an extra-strength THC product it has 30 milligrams weight of THC within each milliliter the volume so 30 milligrams per milliliter tells you how much is in there we also know that this is going to be about one milligram per drop because we know that a rule of thumb is when you have an infused oil it's approximately 28 to 30 drops per milliliter so in this case because it's 30 milligrams per milliliter it's gonna be about one milligram per drop so in order to achieve the five milligrams in the morning it's going to be five drops and for the twenty milligrams before bedtime you're looking at about three-quarters of a dropper or 0.75 milliliters to achieve that and that will give you precisely what the doctor has recommended for you so I encourage you when you leave here to go to your local dispensaries and look at the myriad of products that are available on the shelves today they come in all forms they come in capsules and waters and all sorts of other things and take a look and go up to the budtender and ask to show you what some of these products are you have the benefit now of a regulated market which means that you now have proper labeling so everything is easier to tell what is in it which really makes eases the way for you to begin your exploration of what cannabis products may work for what ails you and I just one last word of caution remember always start very low and increase slowly thank you you", "ArO6G30cO2I": "[Music] welcome to the doctor Gundry podcast on this program we never shy away from controversial topics and today is no exception my guest Jenny sanssouci and I will be discussing the healing properties of cannabis CBD and medicinal mushrooms jenny is a health coach wellness blogger and the author of the new book the rebels apothecary a practical guide to the healing magic of cannabis CBD and mushrooms now she became an expert on these ancient remedies after her father was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer as it turns out something that was once considered taboo was key in helping her dad so she's here today to tell you how you can use these plants and fungi safely Jenny welcome to the program thanks so much for having me well this is gonna be fun so can you start by telling our listeners about why and how you got interested in mushrooms and cannabis sure yeah well in 2017 Thanksgiving 2017 my dad was diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer as you said and that moment was a real before-and-after moment in my life if anyone you know has been diagnosed with cancer and knows someone diagnosed with cancer you know that hearing that information just completely changes your life in one instant so as soon as he got diagnosed I knew that I wanted to help in whatever way I could whether that was with nutrition or supplements or you know cooking for him or finding remedies that could work for him plant-based remedies anything that I could you know could get my hands on I wanted to I wanted to try to find for him and I had been working in the wellness world for many years and I had some connections with functional medicine doctors and people in the wellness arena and so I had this arsenal of people to reach out to and ask you know what are the things that I should look into when it comes to helping someone with not only treating the cancer but really helping with the chemotherapy side-effects in the immune system because I knew that I didn't know much about chemo or cancer at the time but I did know that that chemo can really affect the immune system and people can not tolerate it sometimes because their immune system is so weakened so I just thought you know what can I do to help my dad and I just went full force into the research and cannabis and medicinal mushrooms were the two things I kept hearing about over and over again and once I started to dive into the research there it was really really promising so that's that's the route we decided to go on so just so that everybody understands your dad was getting chemotherapy and so you're not going to come on and say you my dad never got chemotherapy all he did was have a joint and chew on a mushroom you know in fact in fact my dad was definitely sure that he wanted to go the traditional chemotherapy route for treating his cancer and I was not about to try to you know get him to do otherwise I'm not a doctor so I was not gonna I wasn't gonna go there but I knew that I could support him with some home remedies and we you know we talked to his oncologist and we got his oncologist on board with all the different things we were trying and he said you know I don't know if this is gonna help but it probably won't hurt so go ahead and we'll just keep monitoring his progress so he has the you know the chemotherapy regimen at the hospital and then we've had our our home regimen that we've been doing on the side you know that's actually great to hear because I work with a lot of cancer patients as well and so many of their their oncologists tell them no you know you may not do alternative therapies during this chemotherapy you know how dare you don't even come near this stuff it will hurt your chances so tell me actually tell us about that process how'd you how'd you find an oncologist that lets you do this number one yeah that's a really good point because I hear that from so many people that their oncologist said no absolutely not don't try cannabis you know medicinal marijuana CBD mushrooms and they say maybe it will hurt or they just don't have enough information about it to be able to say it's okay and luckily for us we we were paired with an oncologist who was open-minded to it he definitely did not recommend that we do it and he said you know this may not do anything but I'm not gonna tell you know so he didn't we were really lucky in that sense because a lot of oncologist don't do that so what I always tell people to do is when they speak to their oncologist about potentially using home remedies and their oncologist says no maybe you'll agree with this I always say what's the exact reason why they're saying no is there something specific to your condition maybe there is maybe there is a drug interaction maybe there is something very specific to you and you shouldn't use these home remedies or you know if not like maybe ask me on college if you on college us if you could try it for one cycle you know until your next scan and see if everything is still okay you know if there's not a specific reason to you maybe maybe they'd be willing to just let you see how it goes for one cycle so what made you tell us about the your research that said you know we need to look into cannabis and CBD and medicinal mushrooms what brought that to the forefront well one of the things that happened really early on when my dad first got diagnosed is he watched a documentary about medical marijuana and it was and he had just recorded it because he thought it looked interesting he wasn't even interested in it for himself he just wanted to watch it and it was all about cancer patients that were using medical cannabis and having really good results you know not only with their cancer but with their with their side effects of their chemo and so he his ears perked up at that immediately and at the same time CBD was just starting to emerge and one of my friends said hey just look into CBD and cancer and see what you find and I started researching that and I found so many stories of people who were using medical cannabis and CBD who have cancer and were experiencing relief and then I started to look into studies I went to a medical cannabis conference I started to get in touch with medical cannabis doctors and ask them what their experience had been and I just went straight down the rabbit hole and I I was you know I was really impressed by what I found in medical cannabis and then with the mushrooms I had already known that medicinal mushrooms could be helpful for the immune system that was something that was already in my consciousness but I didn't know a lot about them and when I started to go down the route the route of researching mushrooms I found so much information there is about medicinal mushrooms being used in cancer hospitals and other parts of the world and people using it to help their immune systems know is really really interesting okay so explain to people as if they don't know the difference may hopefully most people know so what's the difference between cannabis CBD and medicinal mushrooms and our medicinal mushrooms different than magic mushrooms yeah so cannabis CBD is part of the cannabis plant it's a compound within the cannabis plant and it's a compound that doesn't get you high so THC is the compound that most people are familiar with inside the cannabis plant that does get you high so they're two different molecules that are both within the same plant the mushrooms the medicinal mushrooms all the ones that my dad is taking and most of the ones that I write about in the book are completely non psychedelic so there's you know when people think about mushrooms they usually think of grocery-store mushrooms like button mushrooms portabellos Khomeini's or magic mushrooms that are going to take you on it on a trip there's another class of mushrooms that's considered medicinal mushrooms which is their edible and you know you can consume them and they have medicinal properties but they're not psychedelic gotcha and you want for the listeners you want to name some of those medicinal mushrooms yeah yeah some of the the ones that that I cover in the book and that my dad has been taking everyday chaga mushroom reishi turkey tail is a big one that's one of the first ones that we got him started on shitake is a wonderful actually a really great one for right now - because it's shitake has been shown to be antiviral so that's a really interesting one to look at lion's mane and cordyceps and maitake I believe those are those are all the all the ones and then I do I do cover magic mushrooms a little bit in the book too because there's some really interesting things going on in the search with with psilocybin which is a compound inside magic mushrooms but that's not the main thing that that we've been focusing on but it's definitely an interesting one to pay attention to all right so you keep bringing up the immune system with mushrooms in terms of medical marijuana and CBD where where's the benefit that with this in in cancer patients sure yeah with the immune system with the cannabis what we had found with our research into cannabis is that THC and CBD both have properties that have been shown to kill tumors and and slow tumor growth and they can help with the immune system there's not enough research there yet because they can't do clinical trials on cannabis because of the legality so this is a lot of preliminary research and anecdotal stories so that's with cannabis with the mushrooms all of the mushrooms that I just mentioned aside from magic mushrooms but all the medicinal mushrooms that I mentioned have been shown to have immune system modulating properties so they don't necessarily stimulate the immune system or you know dampen the immune system they balance the immune system so they're they're considered adaptogens so they can just help keep your immune system in balance and all of them are really powerful for you know keeping that immune system strong yeah we I have a patient who oh I think he's now 10 years out from stage 4 pancreatic cancer and he we treated him basically with a raw food diet and a lot of mushroom extracts particularly coleus turkey tail and he's like I say knock on wood he's cancer-free now for 10 years and it's amazing now so I'm a huge supporter you know using plant-based therapy in cancer so and I'm you know again I've seen it with my own eyes and and and written about it in my books so can any of these I know that when you have chemotherapy it's not exactly the most wonderful trip so and a lot of patients complain of pain of GI upset of sleep of energy loss anxiety what's the deal with these compounds with that yeah well the cannabis my dad the cannabis that my dad has been taking in a lot of other cancer patients also take this it's a very highly concentrated cannabis oil that comes in a little plastic syringe and you eat these small droplets of this cannabis oil tiny tiny droplets the size of a grain of rice and that can give you around 50 milligrams of THC and 50 milligrams of CBD if you have a one to one ratio product in one drop so that's a very high dose for people that don't know about 10 milligrams of THC is considered a recreational dose that someone may you know use to get high so 50 milligrams is a really really high amount so you have to really start slowly with that kind of medical cannabis product but what my dad has found with that it is really really taken away his nausea completely he's barely ever had nausea and it's two and a half years in now he's hardly had any nausea his appetite came back as soon as he started taking this cannabis oil which a lot of cancer patients I'm sure you know they completely lose their appetite they lose so much weight and that really contributes to them feeling sicker and sicker as time goes on because they're not able to nourish themselves so that was amazing right off the bat he started to be able to eat full meals again and feel really well and then he sleeps great because he takes a higher dose at night he doesn't like to take a higher dose during the day because he still wants to get things done and not feel too you know impaired by the THC but at night he's okay taking a little bit more and he has slept well the entire time so I think that has been the main that's helped ease his side effects from chemotherapy and then I believe that the mushrooms are what's keeping his immune system strong so he hasn't been weakened by the chemo got you so your book is trying to remove the the drug stigma of cannabis and mushrooms why is that important to you well yeah you know when III quit drinking and quit using all drugs back in 2007 so it's been for me I swore off cannabis and mushrooms back then and alcohol and you know I used cannabis and mushrooms in college recreationally and I never thought of them as medicine I never would have even had a reason to think of it as medicine and so for me that part is really important because my perception of all of this has completely changed throughout my research and I've done so much research now into you know the prohibition of cannabis and you know the legalization of psychedelic mushrooms and it is just it has always been focused around patients and I mean of course there's people that that want to use it recreationally but there has been so much focus throughout the years on you know getting these plants to patients who really who really need to find relief and I didn't realize that before so it's really important to me to try to help to shift that perception to see how these can be medicinal for people and that it's not just about getting high or or going on a mushroom trip it's it's so much more than that so you mentioned that the dose is is enough to get you high what if what if you don't want this effect how do you avoid it yeah so if you're using these in the in the book I do talk about a lot of different wellness wellness topics and not just cancer so for cancer patients specifically if you do want to take the THC and use that medicinally and not feel the high you're just gonna want to work up really really slowly a tiny tiny tiny amounts of THC for most people two milligrams of THC is the the threshold if you go above two milligrams you kind of start to feel those those intoxicating effects if you start a little bit lower and move up you know every few days a couple more milligrams and just monitor how you're feeling that can be a really helpful way if you don't want to feel it at all I would take a high CBD product with little to no THC in it and that will you know give you the medicinal effects of the CBD without without having the THC but they do work better together so if you have a little bit of each in there they boost each other up so if you can tolerate a little bit of THC for the medicinal effects that's great but you don't have to you know and if you're not using it for for your cancer journey and you're using it more for wellness then you can absolutely just take a high CBD product with very small trace amounts of THC okay so let's get away from cancer for a minute and let's talk about wellness so give us your take it's the thoughts or the book on why these may promote wellness how do they pronoun promote wellness and let's go from there sure well one of the things that I found right off the bat through my research for my dad was all these different ways that it might be able to help me to which is you know a totally different realm of why I use them versus why my dad using them but for CBD in particular some of the the main things people use it for our pain sleep and anxiety those are probably the top three and I personally found help with sleep right away and the interesting thing with sleep anxiety and pain is that a lot of times when people can't sleep it's because of anxiety or pain either they they have some painful part of their body and they can't sleep because of that or racing thoughts having having those anxious feelings during the night not being able to sleep so using the CBD can take away the thing that is keeping you from sleeping and help you sleep deeper which is what I experience because I can have anxiety when I'm trying to fall asleep and before I started on CBD I would frequently you know take a long time to fall asleep and then wake up a lot during the night with racing thoughts and when I started the CBD I was really - just sleep better so that was that was awesome and as far as the pain goes there was another kind of before-and-after moment that my dad experienced with CBD which was before he got on the medical marijuana train he was just taking CBD that's all we had access to at the time and what he noticed right off the bat was that his joint pain went away just from taking the CBD he was taking CBD capsules and he said I don't even need to take advil anymore he used to have all this joint pain walking up and down the stairs he's been an athlete his whole life so he says all these aches and pains and he was like I'm I'm impressed by that and he's not one of those people that just gets on the bandwagon quickly you know so he that was really impressive so the pain sleep and anxiety are three things that CBD can be amazing for so let's I have a lot of patients who have tried CBD primarily for sleep and for pain and I would say that just as a general rule 50% of them seem to respond and 50% of them don't and of the people who respond what's been fascinating to me is half the people particularly with pain respond to the topical CBD but don't to the oral and the other half they respond to the oral but not to the topical so help me understand this what's going on sure well yeah a base level of why people respond to it differently is because we all have an endocannabinoid system as I'm sure you know in our body that responds and reacts with the cannabis directly so and everyone has their own dr. Ethan Russo who's a cannabis researcher he he calls it the endocannabinoid tone that we all have this baseline tone kind of like everybody has a different digestive system you know your gut flora is going to be different than mine you have a different endocannabinoid system than me so you may have different levels of natural cannabinoids which we make in our body in your system than I do so the cannabis will well and CBD in particular will kind of raise those love raise the levels of the natural cannabinoids that we have in our system so if someone has a lower amount versus a higher amount they're gonna respond differently which is why dosing can be really tricky and is really really personal with CBD dosing and method of delivery like you said some people will respond to a topical some to a tincture it's all gonna really be based on the person's individual endocannabinoid system so let's talk about dosing and how do you know what you're getting obviously marijuana and CBD are legal here in California and we've we've got these shops almost on every street corner now and how how do you figure out okay well is this stuff legit this stuff came from hemp this actually came from the marijuana plant some people argue no no you got to have marijuana base CBDs hemp CBDs no good come on help us sort this out yeah well you're you're lucky to be in California because I really think California especially at the license dispensaries have have have it figured out in a really wonderful way I wish that all dispensaries could be like the ones that I've visited in California and that's because they have a very wide array of ratios of product ratios out in California with different levels of CBD to THC that you can pick from and choose your your ratio because like I said if the more THC in a product the more you're gonna feel those intoxicating effects and so you know you can have a ratio of eight to one CBD to THC or twenty to one and you can try all these different ratios to see what works for you so I think that's wonderful but to answer your question the most important thing right now when you're looking for a product especially a CBD product that's not from a dispensary because those are unregulated you want to make sure you find you had they have a third-party lab test so that's to show that the amount of CBD that they say is in the product is actually on the lab test so if it says 25 milligrams per serving you want to say see that on the lab as well and you want to make sure that it's negative for heavy metals pesticides residual solvents that could have come through the processing because CBD like I said is totally unregulated right now it's really important to get those lab tests if you do get it from a licensed dispensary they have stricter regulations with the kind of products they're able to sell so you're probably better off that way but even if you're getting it from a dispensary you may want to ask and see the lab test to make sure what what you're getting is really what it says on the label so if I'm on my road trip and I stop at the gas station and they've got CBD oil at the checkout counter which I've seen that's probably not the one I want to buy for sure yeah you really want to do your research and make sure the company is is doing like I said those third-party lab tests meaning someone else is doing the lab tests it's not affiliated with the company so they can't you know make it up and it's and you want to make sure that they're using safe practices and then just answer your question about the hemp versus marijuana right now it's all legal terms so hemp hemp face CBD versus marijuana based CBD is basically just about the amount of THC and other cannabinoids which are other compounds within the cannabis plant that are in the product so if it's hemp hemp face CBD it's basically just very very minimal THC it was going to be in that plant that was grown for that CBD and if it's marijuana based CBD it basically just means that in that plant there was a higher level of THC and this is all you know these numbers are are just kind of you know the numbers that they're using to differentiate these plants but it's all the same comes from the same plant at the end of the day now bring us up to date the DEA once classified this substance as really nasty stuff where do we stand where do we stand with the DEA and where do we stand with the FDA with these substances well right now cannabis is still a schedule 1 drug federally so I hope that that will change I don't know for sure when it will I mean people predict that that will change within the next couple of years CBD in as of 2018 became legal federally which is why you see the CBD boom everywhere so CBD from hemp which just means point three percent THC or less is federally illegal anything more you have to get from a licensed dispensary which will be different in every state some states have Medical dispensaries only which you're gonna need a medical card in order to access those products and so you have to go to a doctor get approved for a medical marijuana card and then you can go to a dispensary some states have recreational or adult use dispensaries which is usually twenty-one plus and right now it just varies from state to state so things are changing everyday my hope is that it will become federally legal soon all right I'm going to throw you a something out of left field what do you know about black urine disease so I have a very good friend and I won't mention his name who ran a company that was really big into CBD and kind of put their whole careers into that and was working very hard with the FDA to get FDA approval for CBD and you probably know that the FAA does not approve so yeah yeah and interestingly enough and I did not know this because he said I'm sure you've heard a black urine disease and he said no I I haven't he says well it turns out that too much CBD can actually affect the same receptors in the liver that tylenol hits acetaminophen and can actually poison the liver and it was discovered because some very heavy CBD users notice their urine was turning dark like they hepatitis and it got the name black urine disease and he tells me and I'm not I haven't talked to the FDA about this that the FDA is worried that big-time CVD use and I don't know the dose may potentially damage the liver and that's why they put the brakes on this but but look it up it's fascinating yeah you know I have seen some things talking about CBD damaging the liver because of studies that they did in my surahs' and from what I could gather from these studies the amount of CBD they had to give these rats was was huge like thousands and thousands and thousands of milligrams of CBD like what it would what it would equal with a human it seemed very very I got huge stretch to me but I will look that up and see see what the what they're saying about black hair and disease that sounds pretty scary and you probably couldn't afford to take that much right so let's get back to that is there is there evidence is there at least anecdotal reports about the amount of CBD that you have to use to be effective you mentioned that everybody's endo cab enoyed systems different so what what what should people look for why do they try what do you recommend yeah as far as dosing I mean I've heard from doctors that practice with with cannabis medicine that some patients do well on five milligrams of CBD and some people do well on 500 milligrams of CBD depending on their condition so it's really really different but what I can say is a starting point for CBD you want to start really low and take it by itself and monitor how you feel you know every 15 minutes like do you feel anything different do you feel you're more relaxed do you feel any relief of pain do you feel any relief of anxiety or whatever it is that you're trying to find relief from and pay really close attention and only take more if you feel no nothing if you feel nothing take a little bit more you could start with like five milligrams even something really small and see if you feel anything if not you know around fifteen to twenty five milligrams is a standard dose for people for many people a standard kind of wellness dose and then if you're having a high amount of pain or anxiety you may need to take you may need to take a little bit more and just kind of move up until you find the relief that you're looking for or switch products if it's if it's not working for you or methods of delivery there like you said before you know topicals work really well for some people for people for pain for anxiety a lot of people like to take the tincture under the tongue because that works usually within 15 minutes or so and you can really measure your dose drop by drop so I would suggest starting with it with a sublingual tincture because that that's how you can really really get a measured dose and say okay I took it's this exact amount where some of the other methods you can't always know exactly how much you're taking okay so we talked about anxiety pain sleep and you use the buzzword the wellness dose of CBD so again help me experimentally anecdotally where does CBD fit in a wellness regimen sure well like I said before we all have this endocannabinoids system in our body that CBD works directly with and we have our own molecules inside our body that work with this same system that CBD can help to regulate those those molecules and they affect things like you know pain sleep the immune system anxiety depression mood they have they have so many things that this endocannabinoids system affects it really keeps you in homeostasis or keeps you in balance so taking CBD as a daily tonic is kind of you know tonify z-- your endocannabinoids system and can keep things in balance many people just find that taking it you know a day as a daily thing whether it's at night or during the day depending how you respond can just make you overall you know feel more balanced got you okay interesting dr. McCullen and I have talked about CBD for sleep when we've been on each other's podcast and we back years ago now did 20 milligrams of CBD sublingual before bed and tracked our sleep with an aura ring which I'm holding up on camera and quite frankly neither of us found any effect on our sleep and as I recall I won't put words in his mouth he even tried it with THC and also found no effect for him or me so we both kind of stopped doing it but you're right maybe our endo cab annoyed system is so phenomenally balanced and I hope it is that maybe we would not see that effect so that yeah or the other part is that sometimes taking certain amounts of CBD or THC can be more wake promoting for some people and especially taking a little bit too much THC can kind of make you have those racing thoughts or can cause anxiety for some people so that yeah I know this it is so so personal and some people will say I take CBD it makes me more focused and awake and some people say they take it and it makes them fall asleep so it's yeah it's an experimental journey alright so I'm sure everybody wants to know because you're a rebel apothecary in' should we be regulating these substances what's the best approach to regulating them if they should be regulated yeah I mean I really think that some of the licensed dispensaries in California are doing a really good job with with the way that they are providing their products I think that cannabis products with THC should be most likely just allowed in licensed dispensaries but I do think it should be federally legal I do think that people that wants access to cannabis medicine should be able to have access to it I don't think it should just be you know sold at gas stations and have these low quality products on the market I think that there should be should be staying third party lab testing for all cannabis products and all CBD products I do think they should be regulated in a way where they have to you know contain exactly what they say on the label so yeah I do I do think it should be legal federally and just as long as as long as the regulations are in place to keep people safe so we're not going to pull up to the gas station and get a six-pack of beer and a brownie to go I would say make your own brownies at home which there are some recipes AHA I knew I could get a plug in for you there you know with the magic mushrooms and legality and regulation they're the predictions that are happening for those are that they'll be legal within therapeutic settings because they are researching them for depression and even you know comparing them to SSRI depression drugs and seeing you know how they affect people so I think that those mushrooms which are currently illegal as well will will be available for use in therapy and I don't think those should just be you know available a gas station either those should be you know closely monitored yeah Mike Michael Pollan ism has made uh I think a very strong point that there is good increasing evidence that there is some bona fide medical use for these I think particularly in depression and yeah we need and you you know you argue for this that we need to look at this as another federally regulated license use of these products for specific reasons all right yeah absolutely and I think you're right and maybe you talk about that the use of these products kind of in your own home is probably at least in our state of understanding not a great idea this should be taken with a practice professional in a setting in a controlled setting what say you I say if we're talking about psychedelic mushrooms I would definitely recommend that people don't just try it alone whether it's with a trained therapist or someone who has a lot of experience guiding people through these types of sessions I definitely think that having having guidances is the way to go yeah I had a personal experience in college where I one of my members in my singing group dropped acid and decided to we were on the third floor of our dorm and he threw up open the windows and decided he was going to fly and luckily I grabbed him by his belt and pulled him back in this is a true story so I firmly believe from personal experience that this should be done in a guided setting yes yes if you take a little bit too much of a psychedelic compound you mean it can take you to places that you aren't ready to go by yourself so definitely right in 30 including the ground from a third-story window yeah all right well Jenny this has been great thanks so much for joining me and where do they find out about you your book your work first of all thank you so much for having me this has been just such a great conversation and I'm glad you have so much personal experience with the topic too that makes it really enjoyable to talk about so thank you my book is called the rebels apothecary so you can buy that anywhere where books are sold except right now we can't go into bookstores so online you can find that my blog is healthy crush calm and you can find me also on Instagram Jenny sanssouci healthy crush dot-com I'm sure there's a story what's the crush well the healthy cards I've actually been writing there since 2008 so I've been blogging about wellness and personal development topics for quite a long time and the healthy crush just kind of popped into my mind the tagline is a love affair with living well okay the way the way I've always felt about you know finding out about new wellness topics and getting excited about them and very very good very good okay it's time for our audience question Sandra Liliana on Facebook asks is keto diet safe for people with heart conditions believe it or not I do use my version of the ketogenic diet for my patients with heart disease who have also for instance diabetes as a co-founding factor and as a cause of their heart disease the key and my ketogenic diet is you got to eat about 80 percent of your calories from fat but that fat shouldn't be ribeye steaks it should be fats from avocados and for you people who are watching I have avocado socks on today and they should be from olive oil and the more olive oil macadamia nuts you eat macadamia nut oil sesame oil the better and the key of a ketogenic diet is to really severely limit your carbohydrates to really leaves and vegetables that are going to carry olive oil and avocados into your mouth that's totally different than a paleo or carnivore keto diet where the vast majority of the foods you're gonna eat our heavy cheese's heavy meats heavy fats you know three bottles of cream every day that's not what I use for my heart disease patients so you got to be careful in the term keto diet there's a good way to do keto and there's a bad way to do keto particularly for heart disease so that's a great question Sandra and thank you very much all right Jenny thank you again and good luck with the book and best wishes to your father how's he doing by the way he's doing fantastic I've actually been quarantined up here with him for the last six weeks and he has felt so good the whole time we keep saying we forget that he has cancer he's been off of chemo now for the past three months I'm just cuz he's been doing so well that his oncologist said why don't we give you a break and his blood markers are in the normal range his tumors have all been stable so we're happy hey very good very good all right keep up the good work great thank you so much thanks for having me take care and now it's time for the review of the week following my most

gonna get high on high tea yes hi I'm not smoking cannabis that is it we're not smoking do with it we eatin eat I'm not eating cannabis but it's a new thing they do it in cakes this is shops everywhere even in Lube you've got CBD Lube don't shout that too loud round here in 2018 California was the first US state to decriminalize the recreational use of cannabis ever since San Fran has led the way the guys are very excited all right entries first of all can you smell oh yeah Wow it's like a strong cannabis smell is it Oh golden right now Holden is a top chef here in San Francisco what

used in Holdens catering CBD known worldwide for having medicinal properties and THC the one that gets you high well you hear a lot about CBD CBD is not necessarily not psychoactive because if it wasn't psychoactive wouldn't have any of the health benefits that people are sort of proclaiming that it has so the CBC is very relaxing its relaxing at you high it won't get you high won't inebriate you th see it's it's an irritant and it's it's just like you know though the stuff your mom warned you about holden bikes all these food virgin so his customers can control their own buzz I make this little tincture here and one drop of this tincture is one milligrams so I'm able to really precisely control how inebriated my my guests get can I offer you guys some tea yes yes please yeah who wants to get high on the tea and who does it THC mm-hmm yes PG tipps they say five drops or five the grams of THC to a first-timer is enough to get you higher than I'd ever want to go so this is completely

if you're saying that I'm gonna make that beautiful sandwich taste better uh-huh because off the additional ingredient that's hard to understand for Jeff's point of view because it's not improving the flavor it's improving the state of mind well I've tried it and you put it a drop net and you have it a touch of a bitterness it's like a little bee when you pour like sage or time to me this is

already on track to outpace all of last year as the aha took a look at how both recreational and medicinal use impact cardiovascular health this morning as sales of marijuana soared during the pandemic a new warning from the american heart association that the marijuana millions use may actually be hurting their hearts in a new review of studies the organization finding cannabis use may be linked to an increased risk of heart attacks and heart failure there have certainly been reports of people with heart rhythm abnormalities hospitalized patients who have more complications of their heart attack for example when they're hospitalized with a heart attack or heart failure dr rosemarie robertson the deputy chief science and medical officer of the aha cautioning more research needs to be done after multiple studies found smoking the the in cannabis could shrink blood vessels that feed the heart and lungs i think it's clear to us that using marijuana thinking that it might help your heart or be good for the cardiovascular system there is no evidence for that the evidence that it can harm you is also anecdotal but there is some researchers also finding that edible marijuana appears to be associated with even more harmful heart and psychiatric complications because of the amount of thc absorbed into the body system but cbd is different studies finding that the portion of the marijuana plant that doesn't produce a high has actually been associated with a reduced heart rate and lower blood pressure this as purchases of marijuana spike when the country went on lockdown

dispensary is quite the opposite we've got about a um 30 increase in our traffic lately um and everybody's got questions questions from returning customers asking whether dispensaries would stay open tuesday they got the answer yes but pesota says the majority of curious customers coming through his door are newcomers i've had more questions lately about what's good for anxiety than i ever have before he says customers are nervous about their health jobs and families people are just scared and they're scared of the unknown and a lot of those people are coming into the dispensaries and they're picking up their essential items doctors say the answer to the what should i take question is it depends there are several ways to ingest medical marijuana and each affects people differently

Pakistani desserts use honey and a lot of really tasty waves heck yeah so great let's do this we basically just takes some distillate so we got a bunch of CBD distillate here so basically four thousand milligrams of CBD is what we're working with yep and we mix agar into it and on the magnetic stirrer so agar is like a thickening agent right yeah it's like you know it keeps it more vegetarian so you're not using just regular gelatin I love those magnetic stirrer yeah they're cool we got AB organic kinky butter we will mix in the ghee and we'll give it a little more heat so now we have a good blend of our butter and Annapolis yep now we have some acacia honey and a little bit of sunflower lecithin what is the Leveson do it's an emulsifier so it helps everything bind together so into our ghee and our distillate we're gonna put a bunch of honey honey and then a little bit of that sunflower lecithin we like using sunflower because you can get non-gmo so now we just wait for this to warm up a bit and then that's our honey butter mix basically we mix that with a little bit of distilled water and agar once that's blended bring it to a quick boil let it cool and when it's at 120 degrees pull it up in a syringe and we drop it in the cold oil but as they go through to the bottom they'll cool they'll solidify we'll leave them in there for a minute pull them out of the oil so

and thank you for choosing my thc cbd calculator today i'm going to walk you through how the calculator works and all the different bells and whistles that it includes let's start with the bottom of the page you'll see that there's a home button a calculator button and a heart button let's just click on the home button to start here you have access to a lot of my recipes for example my can of butter recipe my can of oil recipe how to clean and prep your cannabis before you infuse your cannabis and how to decarb your cannabis before you infuse it into your butter and oil and more recipes will be coming soon in addition on the bottom of the page you'll notice an area for recent calculations here is where you can view all the calculations you've done in the past let's get started click on the calculator button on the page you'll notice that you have two inputs one for thc and one for cbd the strain i'm working with today is called harlequin harlequin is a high cbd strain low thc strain i'm using it today to illustrate how the calculator can work with both thc and cbd simultaneously this strain has 5 thc so you'll move the bar to five for five percent and it's 15 cbd you'll move the bar to 15 for cbd the next step is to enter your final dry weight this is the final weight after you have dried and de-carved your cannabis whether or not you're using my cleaning process or you're just straightly carving but before without putting it through my cleaning process you're always going to lose at least moisture weight i started with seven grams but i'm not going to put seven grams in this space at the end of my cleaning and drying process i'm left with 5.2 grams so i'm entering the number 5.2 the next step is to enter the infusion are you infusing your cannabis into butter or oil and what type of oil each calculation is slightly different let's click on butter because it's the first one now when i infuse butter i like to infuse an entire stick of butter an entire stick can be measured in tablespoons so i'm going to click tablespoons and i'm going to click eight if you need a quick reference guide for this you can look down in the green box and all the information you need is there now click the yellow button that says calculate that'll bring it to your results page at the top of this page you'll notice an area where you can actually put the name of your infusion at the top we're going to call it infusion 1. [Music] underneath that there's an area called strain name since we use harlequin we're going to put the name harlequin in there now in your green box you'll notice your total potency your total potency for this infusion is 95.55 milligrams of thc and 286.65 milligrams of cbd but that doesn't really help you that much more importantly look below that you'll see your infusion results are actually called out by tablespoon that's very important information so now you're left with 6.1 milligrams i'm sorry 6.1 tablespoons of canned butter that you produced meaning that you've lost 1.9 tablespoons in your infusion process and each tablespoon of your can of butter is going to be 15.6 milligrams of thc and 46.81 milligrams of cbd but that still doesn't really help you you need to know how much of your butter you're going to need to put into your recipe in order to achieve a specific infusion per serving that's really simple just go down to the bottom of the page and click on the toast button this brings you to the most important page in the calculator you'll notice that you can figure out just how potent you want each serving of your brownies for example to be now i want to serve 10 brownies i'm going to put the number 10 in the recipe number of servings but now if i don't know how much of my can of butter i need to use to achieve that all i have to do is move up where it says recipe can a product and start clicking on the little plus button you'll notice that if i only use one tablespoon of my can of butter i'm only going to have 1.56 milligrams per serving of thc and 4.68 milligrams per serving of cbd but that's not what i want let me click it again oh there we go now i've put two tablespoons of my can of butter into the recipe and each brownie is now going to be 3.12 milligrams per serving and cbd 9.36 milligrams per serving now let's go back to the previous page you'll notice on the bottom of this page you've got an area for notes you can type whatever you want in there since i love you guys i'm going to just type in here i love you and if you really love your infusion and you want to save it you'll notice that there's a heart button on the bottom all you have to do is click that heart button and you've saved it now if you don't like what you've done or you want to completely get rid of it you can either click the trash button to throw it in the trash or you click the start over button and start all over and that's it easy as pie i hope you enjoyed this demo and i hope the calculator brings you many years of use if you like the calculator

here and\ntoday I'm gonna teach you a brief overview on how to make every extract\nunder the sun. So what I want to start off talking about is live resin and why\nlive resin is so relevant in the market and why you guys hear this this term\nbeing thrown around rather commonly. So live resin, the entire process really,\ntakes into account harvesting the plant while it's still technically \"alive\". So\nyou're harvesting the plant, you're not drying the plant, and what you're\nactually doing is taking those flowers and putting them into a vacuum type food\nsaver device and freezing them right away. So you can imagine like harvesting\nfresh blueberries or strawberries obviously you want to pick at the peak\nof ripeness, so that you have the maximum amount of terpenes, the maximum amount of smell, flavor and all the positive attributes of that plant. And you're\nactually freezing that in time by putting it into a freezer once you put\nit into the vacuum bag. Now it's very common for some people to deep freeze\nthat could be all the way down to -40C or -80C. I would say most commonly\nit's somewhere between -10C and -40C, so once we have this\nmaterial harvested and we have it frozen in vacuum bags - ultimately what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to extract it and we're going to extract it with\nhydrocarbons. The reason that we use hydrocarbons is because it's a very\ngentle process. The process of using hydrocarbons will actually take those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes out without disturbing a lot of the other\nplant-based matrices that are in there, and our result ultimately is a extract\nthat is very, very close to the native plant. So when you smell the extract of\nthe plant that we've extracted via a live resin process what will happen is\nyou'll actually smell the original orientation of that plant, it you'll have\nthose original flavors and they'll be extremely robust, extremely profound in\nthe way that you're actually smelling and almost tasting it when you consume\nthe product. Now the best analogy is if we keep that\nfreshness preserved we eliminate the oxidation, the degradation, and all the\nthings that can kind of take that \"fresh fruit\" so to speak or that \"fresh cannabis\"\nand turn it into rotten cannabis so to speak or rotten fruit. And that's\noxidation, that's degradation from the environment that could be disruption or\ndegradation from high temperature solvents. So with live resin were always\nfocused on preserving that natural state of the plant. We're focused on freezing\nthat biomass right away, and we're focused on ultimately extracting it at\nvery cold temperatures to retain our terpenes, to extract the cannabinoids in\na very gentle fashion, and ultimately to have a highly, highly desired end product\nthat's artisanal and a vast majority of consumers enjoy in terms of theirs their\nsatisfaction of consumption as well as their ability to just actually taste and\nsmell the product once it's been on the shelf for a while. So that's just an\noverview on live resin and the next thing I'd really like to talk about and\ngive you guys an overview on is shatter. So you may have seen shatter in the\nretail dispensaries and things like that and ultimately with shatter we're trying\nto get that end product from a sort of a plant-based entrapment of those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes to a glass-like finish. So it's very common at\nroom temperature for shatter you hit it and it'll shatter almost like a piece of\nglass. To get that consistency there's certain aspects of extraction, certain\nthings that you want to deal with. Shatter first and foremost is always\nmade with hydrocarbon, and the preparation of the biomass is almost\nalways under every circumstance dried very, very, very, very well almost to a\nfive percent or lower humidity. We want to avoid a lot of that water that would\nbe pulled out with the solvent, and we ultimately want to extract that product\nat a cold temperature in order to avoid a lot of the lipids and fat profiles\nthat you might create by extracting with a warmer temperature solvent. Hydrocarbon is obviously ideal for this because not only can we extract with hydrocarbon\ncold but it's hydrophobic so that the water is going to be separated very\neasily from the hydrocarbon, but in addition to that it's going to extract\nthat cannabinoid profile and it'll extract those terpenes with leaving\nbehind,  because of the cold temperature, a lot of those fats, waxes, and other\nadulterants that we don't want in our end product. So when making shatter are\nultimately extracting the dry biomass with the cold solvent we're going to\ntake that to a finishing process which is called vacuum oven purging. So once we\nhave our shatter and we want to vacuum oven purge it, what we do is we we spread\nthis out on vacuum oven trays and we go into a very low vacuum, very deep vacuum\nwith a mild temperature increase from atmospheric. So a temperature increase\ndepending on methodologies it ranges vary widely depending an operator but it\ncould be anywhere from 75 Fahrenheit to will say 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be\na common operational range, and we're always trying to get to a very deep\nvacuum we're talking about 28-29 inches of mercury - very, very deep in terms of\nbeing able to purge out those residual solvents. So not only do we have a\nsolvent free product but purging out the residual solvents and the terpenes is\nalso going to take away some of that some of that added viscosity and\nreally get that product to the point where it's like a glass-like consistency.\nAnd we commonly call those as they're coming out of the oven \"slabs\", sometimes\nthey look like Swiss cheese, sometimes they'll they'll be you know a perfect\nslab of glass, sometimes they'll flip over. And it can vary between a\ncomplete glass-like type consistency and it can also vary to you know sort of\nlike Jolly Rancher or warm Jolly Rancher type consistency - but the good part about\nthis process is to make shatter using hydrocarbon you can generally\nstill make a very good end product on biomass that's been properly dried\nproperly preserved even though it does have maybe a little bit of degradation\nit does have a little bit of oxidation of the cannabinoids and loss of the\nterpenes it's okay because you can still make a very very credible saleable\nproduct that's widely consumed in the form of shatter. And optimizing that\nprocess as a way that you can create a lot of revenue for your\nextraction company. So the next thing that I'd like to talk about is diamonds.\nTerp sauce. There's all sorts of crazy names, \"the sauce\" -  that they coined for\nthis type of extract and really what we're after on this type of extract is\nterpene preservation. So it starts off very much like a live resin\nprocess in the fact that we're harvesting these these buds or these\nflowers in a live state, we're freezing them, and we're ultimately preserving\nthose terpenes. Because terpenes are very volatile compounds in general. Too much\nheat they evaporate and they get degraded by heat, they get degraded by processes, they\nget degraded by solvent - so we want to use a very light solvent, like a light\nhydrocarbon, and in this case mostly moving towards a propane dominant blend. Propane has a much lower boiling point which means it's much more volatile in\nterms of removing it from the end product - easier to remove from the end\nproduct is another way to word that. So ultimately extracting this\nlive resin like prepared biomass with a propane dominant or a lighter\nhydrocarbon dominant blend at low temperatures and ultimately what we end\nup with is we end up with this extract that really becomes a sort of miscella of the cannabinoids but also a very amount high amount of terpene\ncontent. And as I stated before the terpenes are quite volatile and any sort\nof heat, any sort of degradation, even just being an atmosphere for too long\ncan degrade those terpenes. So imagine this kind of cannabinoid and terpenes\nsludge coming out of the machine because we've preserved them up to that point.\nImmediately usually what's done with sauce and live resin is you're taking\nthe terpenes and generally spinning them off in a classified centrifuge. The\nreason we use the classified centrifuge is because there's still a little bit of\nsolvent in there, so we just want to be cautious, but what that ultimately does\nis it spins off the terpenes and it separates a terpene layer from the\ncannabinoid layer. You separate those two now there's a variety of different\nproduction processes that go back into this. In some cases if you're if you're\ndoing crystallization you can leave a little bit of solvent in there and you\ncan ultimately recrystallize the THC-a through a supersaturation method.\nYou can ultimately take the cannabinoids off from that terpene fraction and\ndecarboxylate the cannabinoids and then add the terpenes back in - and that's how\nyou make live resin pens. So for example you know once that decarboxylated\ncannabinoid profile is there you take your original terpenes blend them back\nin and it's going to give you the viscosity in order for the pen or the\nvape cartridge to be able to uptake and atomized that extract. And make, again\nthis is an extract that is absolutely in line with the original orientation of\nthe plant, the original smells, flavors terpenes, and the uniqueness. It's very\ncool because you have such variety within these plants and to capture the\nnative essence of that plant and to reconstitute it and to several\nconsumable forms is a massive value add for an extraction business. And if you\nlook at some of the best extraction companies in the world that do this, this\nis exactly what they do and this is exactly how they do it. So on the flip\nside of what we've spoken about here which has mainly been artisanal\ntype extracts and hydrocarbon extracts. Let's talk about crude oil, let's talk\nabout distillate, let's talk about the high-value type extracts. So crude oil is\nexactly what it sounds if you think about crude oil coming out of the ground\nin like petrochemicals or something like that.\nIt's an oil that has a lot of adulterants in it. It needs a lot of\nrefinement. It needs to go through further processes in order to be\nconsumable or in a consumable form. So what we're looking for with crude oil\non an extraction is really any type of biomass but preferred dried biomass\nlow-grade biomass that can be purchased cheap and ultimately refined into\nsomething of high value. So if we've got for example you know a thousand pounds\nof biomass sitting it's been sitting for six months, we're not going to be able to\nmake really a credible shatter product out of that, we're not going to be able\nto make a credible live resin, definitely not going to be able to make any sort of\nhigh terpene extract or anything out of that. But what we can do is we can\nmaximize the extraction of the cannabinoids out of that biomass with a generally\nwarmer solvent - of course there's ways that you can do it with a cold solvent.\nAnd this can be done with hydrocarbon or ethanol. This is where ethanol becomes\nreally applicable it becomes really easy it becomes really user friendly and\ncost-conscious. And this is where you can still use hydrocarbon but not as\nefficient of a method as ethanol for bulk crude oil. So what we actually do is\nwe take our biomass we load it in and we'll saturate it with ethanol for\na given amount of time. Ultimately we take that miscella stream is what we\ncall it which is the cannabinoids and all the other stuff that comes out of\nthe plant along with the solvent and we evaporate that solvent off. Once that\nsolvents evaporated off ultimately we have our crude oil. Now this crude oil\nhas got all sorts of chlorophyll and whatever came along with the plant and\nany sort of adulterants in there. Generally it'll have a lot of fats, waxes,\nand lipids in there that generally come out of the plant in extraction. So\nthere's a variety of refinement processes. One of the most common\nprocesses to refine is to get to distillate and that's what I'd like to\nchat about next. So let's talk about guys how that distillate actually gets made.\nNow distillate is a process that's made through distillation so quite commonly\nor to break it down in really simple terms if you're putting a pot of water\non the stove and ultimately that water is boiling and turning into vapor - \nthat's a process of distillation. That water is being distilled into the\natmosphere in the form of vapors. So that's exactly what we're trying to do\nwith the cannabinoids in the crude oil. We're actually trying to take those\ncannabinoids, we're trying to vaporize them, and ultimately we're going to\nrecollect them in a more concentrated form. But before we can distill there's\nseveral other things we need to do. We need to make sure that there's no\nadulterants in that distillate or in that crude oil that are going to inhibit\nmaking the distillate. So those things can be waxes, they can be chlorophylls,\nthey can be fats, lipids, all sorts of weird stuff that can come over in a very\nrough crude extraction. The way that we refine that is we commonly\nuse winterization processes, we also commonly use fine filtration, there's\nguys that use what are called adsorbent - which could be diatomaceous earth or\nactivated carbons in order to clean up some of these undesirables from this\ncrude oil in order to make it into distillate. But ultimately once it's\npassed through a distillation process it's normally used a what's called a\nfractional distillation, or a wiped film distillation process when you're at\nscale. We're taking those cannabinoids and we're evaporating them and we're re-concentrating them. So what happens is we take this very, very poor quality\nbiomass, turn it into a really rough crude oil, but ultimately extract the\nwe'll call it \"the goodies\" - but the cannabinoids out of that crude oil and\nconcentrate them in a very refined format. That can be remixed in and\nreconstituted into several different products. This process is awesome because it can literally take any grade of biomass and turn it into a shelf-stable,\nreplicatable, scalable, repeatable product that has a consistency across the board\nfor end-users expectations. For example, you get Pepsi every time it tastes like\nPepsi every time you don't want it to taste like Coke one time or taste like\nyou know RC Cola the next time. You want consistency and a repeatable fashion for\nwhich to make your product. So last product that I want to talk about is\nisolates and isolates are made from actually in almost all cases distillate.\nSo we're taking this crude oil remember as we spoke about with distillate,\nrefining it into a distilled product. So we have this distilled product and the\npotency of that can be anywhere from say a little very low-end 75 percent on the very high-end 95 percent - but it's not 100% pure. And what\nwe're gonna do with that distillate is we're actually going to go through a\nsecondary refinement process called crystallization, isolation of\nthese individual cannabinoids. So each one of these cannabinoids has a\nmolecular structure and based upon what that molecular structure looks like we\ncan come up with ideal ways to actually crystallize and crash out of solution\nthese individual molecules. This is a very common process in chemistry. It's\nused very widely and it's ultimately how CBD isolate is made, it's ultimately how\nTHCA diamonds are made, it's a process of crystallization. So how we do that is\nwe use a selective solvent the selective solvent most often used is hydrocarbon.\nVery often it's either butane or pentane in order to make these isolates.\nAnd what happens is you actually take your distillate and you mix it into\neither the pentane or the butane if it's THCA depending on what you're trying to\ndo and you have your distillate or your fine cannabinoids back in matrices at\nthat point it's back in that now that miscella of hydrocarbon and\ncannabinoids. And what happens is over time and over a temperature ramp spike\ncurve and over a slow period of time these cannabinoids will start\nto actually crystallize. And they'll form one little crystal and it will grow upon\nitself. As we reduce the saturation of the solvent they actually fall out of\nsolution. So what will happen is you'll almost see like rock candy or crystal-like formation growing. Once those crystals are fully formed they can be\nharvested and once you optimize this process you actually have nearly 100%\npurity on any given compound. Now there can be adulterants you know that gets\nstuck on the crystals that need to be washed off but in ideal state this is\nsomething that you can refine up to say a good benchmark is 99 to 99.5 percent\nif you're a really good chemist you can get it up close to 99.7 to 99.9. This is where that last little bits very, very\nhard to get, but there is ways to do that. So if we look at you know the the world\nof cannabinoids in conclusion. There's several different ways to make extracts.\nThere's a lot of different ways to make very, very viable market products. There's\na lot of ways to drive revenue in your extraction business with these products.\nUnderstanding this knowledge base and understanding how you're going to occupy\neach one of these market niches, what access to biomass you have, what\ndiversity and methodology do you have in order to create these products and\nultimately drive diversity and revenue in your in your business.

Come I'll show you Well, in order to make a good cannabis extract\nyou need good starting plant material. In my hand I have a cannabis plant it\nsmells fantastic. In order to make a nice extract you need to obviously dry the\nplant material first. Come let's go to the lab I'll show you how to make an\nextract. Welcome to Endoca. My name is Henry Vincente and today I will show you\nhow to cannabis extraction using ethanol We will use cannabis material which is\nthe leaves and the flowers all in one Very important to use organic so that you\nknow there is nothing inside that can harm you. There are over 4,000 different\nvarieties of cannabis now the one I chose has a lot of CBD inside. You could\napply the same method or what kind of cannabinoid eschews so called ethanol\ntake a ball put the plant material inside so the process has to be very\nfast. You don't want the ethanol to touch the plant material to a long time. If it\ndoes you get a lot of other stuff inside which you don't want. You just use enough\nethanol to cover so that we can separate the plant material from the cannabinoids. You need to be fast in this process because we can only stir for three\nminutes so I use a plastic spoon. You don't use mechanical devices because you\ndon't want to create a spark. If I create a spark now everything will burn. You mix\nwell then we have to separate the ethanol from the plant material. I do\nsimply by taking a sieve and put it in another Bowl. It can drip a little bit\nyou know there's still some alcohol left This was the first filtration now we're\ngoing to do the second filtration in order to remove the plant material you\nhave left, and we do that by using a simple coffee machine\nIt can heat your material and it can filtrate and we start with the\nfiltration part coffee filter, take your spoon you take now the material on the liquid\nand you pour it into the filter paper and you see the process starts. In order\nto accelerate the process we change the paper, every time a single filtration has\noccurred if you have more material you just continue until you don't have any\nmore, and like this and it's dripping beautifully. Now it's time to cook so\nwhen you cook at home you can use many different things I have here an example\nof a rice cooker which works fine a pot and a heating device works also fine and\na water distiller. Now my favorite is the water distiller because if you cook with\nany of these methods we need a cleanroom box like this for those of you who\ndoesn't have a box like this you can cook outside but to make it all easier\nlet's use the water distiller. Now this is the process where we separate the\nethanol from the cannabinoids. The time it will take for the full separation\ndepends of course of how much material you put inside I use a bowl to collect\nthe pure ethanol that's going to come out here because you can you reuse it\nagain and again we give it some juice and we wait so now the question is when\nto stop I can see I have 80% of my original ethanol volume so that's\nindication that it's time to see what's going on inside you open the lid slowly\nand look inside and you can see that is very little material in my case this is\nthe time to stop just to be sure not to breathe it here we go and be careful\nwhen you pour because there's very little material you don't want to lose\nit and now I'm going to show you the final step using the coffee machine what\nwe have to do is remove the remaining ethanol from our extract put it on the\nheating device turn it on and we wait best is to wait for 24 hours so that\nyou're sure that no ethanol is left I already did this and as you can see from\nall the work with it we have very little material the final test is a quality\ntest we do it by using a paperclip dipping it into the material and you use\na lighter you light it fast and see what happens if there is a spark you know there is \nstill ethanol left so you can see comparison see it's burning then you\nneed to put it back on the heater but in our case it was well done. To make a\ncannabis extract at home you need a lighter\nfilter coffee machine some small bowls, two bowls\nsieve plastic spoon coffee filters alcohol cannabis. Put the cannabis into\nthe bowl cover with cold alcohol steer three minutes with plastic spoon filter\nthe alcohol through the sieve filter again through the coffee filter it still\nuntil 80 percent of the initial alcohol volume is gone pour into a small ball\nhit the small ball with the coffee machine for 24 hours to remove the\nremaining alcohol. To check if there is any remaining alcohol use a small spoon\nand the lighter if there is any remaining alcohol the product will\nproduce sparks when burning with a lighter keep heating until you don't get\nany sparks anymore Enjoy your cannabis extract Stay tuned\nnext time I'm going to show you how to purify the extract and turn it into pure\ncannabinoids in my hand is 99% CBD beautiful

of Humboldt brand products really excited to share with you today everything that I can about major and minor cannabinoids and how they work in your body along with some great things about current research on PTSD cancer neuropathy and more so let's get started you know cannabinoids are substances that are produced both in plants and in the human body and they're responsible for some but not all of the effects that you experience from cannabis and in fact some of the other effects may be due to things like terpenoids and flavonoids phyto cannabinoids are one type of cannabinoid so you'll hear the terms phyto cannabinoid and endocannabinoid phyto cannabinoids are the ones that are produced by plants the cannabis plant is the only plant that's known to produce really significant amounts of this viscous resin and when you look at close-up shot of the surface of a cannabis plant you can actually physically see the phyto cannabinoids accumulating in the resin glands so the resin glands are those little structures on the plant have a little stalk with a ball on the end and that's where the phyto cannabinoids actually accumulate so the THC and CBD are right there in those resin glands endocannabinoids are a very similar class of substances but what's really interesting about them is that they're made naturally in the human body you know back in the 80s when I was a little kid we used to see these commercials this is your brain and this is your brain on drugs and you'd see the two eggs in a frying pan it was really interesting to me to learn was that we actually didn't even know that there were things called endocannabinoids or something called an endocannabinoid system in our bodies that's a natural architecture for interacting with cannabinoids and that's actually the reason that humans have such strong interactions with cannabinoids is because we have this natural architecture in our bodies to interact with them the endocannabinoid system is a network of receptors in our body receptors we can think of receptors as little docking sites right in your brain and all over your body these little docking sites that cannabinoids connect with and cause all of the different things that you experience from them let's talk a little bit about THC and CBD and CBN those three together are often referred to as the major cannabinoids the reason is is because they're often the most prevalent although current analysis is showing that cbc maybe should be called a major cannabinoid these days as well because it's present in almost every sample and at a decent level sometimes higher than CBD the relative amounts of THC and CBD are of a lot of interest to people right now you hear people talk about ratios one to one and two to one and 15 to one and twenty to one and it matters it matters how much THC relative to CBD there is because those are specific for specific ailments so a 20 to one CBD to THC cannabis flower or tincture for example may be good for addressing one thing like seizure control where a one to one or a two to one CBD to THC substance or tincture might be the best thing safe for pain relief so the ratio is specific to the application so that's why we care about ratio and that's why we talk about it a question I get asked a lot is is there anything you can do during the growing stages of the plant to change it from a THC plant to a CBD plant and unfortunately the answer is no you know I've been asked is there a nutrient can I water starve it can I change the light can I do anything to it to change that THC plant to a CBD plant and unfortunately the answer is no whether a plant is THC dominant or CBD dominant is actually determined by genetics so if it's a 15 percent THC planner is a 15 percent CBD plant the fact that that's the dominant cannabinoid isn't something that you can change but what you can change is the total accumulation of the plant so that can be affected by growing conditions you know if a plant doesn't have the right growing conditions nutrients soil and water it won't produce as much cannabinoid and the final potency percentage won't be as high so that is something that you can affect now there's three main types of cannabinoid ratio that you can consider there's cannabis that's very high THC there's cannabis it's very high CBD and right in the middle there is cannabis where you have equal amounts of THC and CBD and again which bucket cannabis ends up in high CBD high THC or equal amounts of the two is determined by genetics of the plant THC is probably the cannabinoid that we're all the most familiar with it's the one that's been talked about the most it's the one that for a long time people attributed most of the effects of cannabis to this one molecule to THC we know more than that now which we'll talk about throughout this presentation today but the reason that people talk a lot about THC is it has some pretty big effects you know THC is the main psychoactive or intoxicating component in cannabis you know when we talk about that it's to indicate that there's a shift right and the way you feel in your emotional state when you consume THC now THC is referred to in a few different ways out there you'll see THC you'll see Delta 9 THC Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol so those are all the same thing THC is generally the most abundant cannabinoid in cannabis but that's been changing as more people have focused on developing more CBD strains and we'll talk about CBD a lot as well today one of the fascinating things about THC is that it actually exists in different forms in the plant so you actually have THC acid as its dominant form in the growing plant and THC is the form that you find after it's been heated so when you put something in your pipe and smoke it you're actually doing some chemistry converting THC teach the acid to THC now there's a lot of confusion amongst patients about THC acid and THC you know a lot more is known about THC THC acid is just coming into our purview as something that we're interested in and we want to know about the researchers who are the original people who pioneered cannabinoid research when you ask them at the conferences you say ruff Raphael Michelin like why aren't you studying THC acid he was like oh there's nothing to it there's nothing there it doesn't have strong effects in the body near Raphael's around it's because of people who went out there is evangelists and as early adopters and tried this and have built bodies of anecdotal evidence to say there's something interesting going on here with these acidic cannabinoids so THC acid is the form it's in like I said before it's been heated that means in the growing plant or in dried material let's say on the shelf in a jar and dispensary that's the form that most of it is in the conversion of THC acid to THC is called decarboxylation that's a big word I like the word activation more and I think it's a little bit more intuitive so you'll hear me use the term activation and decarboxylation interchangeably at room temperature decarboxylation can actually also occur over time so as your cannabis sits in that jar you can actually have some of that conversion as well so it's not entirely stable smoking or vaporizing activates or D carboxylates THC acid and turns it into THC making it available for those experiences that you're most accustomed to for reliable decarboxylation of THC acid to THC you know a lot of people are interested in that because they're making their own medicine at home if you want to do that my best advice is to heat your raw cannabis you know don't put it into butter first but just the raw cannabis itself on a baking sheet in the oven so if you pre-heat your oven to 212 degrees Fahrenheit and you bake it and keep it in a thin layer to make sure that the heat can actually penetrate all the material he did for 90 minutes and you'll have great THC acid to THC conversion so so why do we care so I've talked about this thing exists we have it how do you convert one to the other so but why do you care about it well the reason you care about THC acid and THC and the difference between them is because the effects are totally different and in many cases the therapeutic application is totally different depending on the patient and their needs and what's right for you it really depends on your desired effects and the relief that you need THC acid has been exciting to people lately because there's a lot of new people coming to cannabis and they want to try it for the first time they've got one hesitation though that's the intoxication component to it maybe they're not comfortable letting go not having control in that moment so THC acid preparations tinctures especially you can find THC acid in are a great way for people to try cannabis for the first time without a whole lot of danger of fear of intoxication there's a lot of interesting findings from these bodies of patient anecdotal evidence that we've been putting together to show that THC acid has some pretty substantial anti-inflammatory properties and may have some anti [ __ ] properties as well more work needs to be done on that but there's some clear indications that there's more to learn there you know when I talk about THC acid patients are really you know interested and concerned how can I get access to that like what kind of products can I find THC acid in well the the most direct way is through juicing so you can actually juice raw cannabis both the leaves and the flowers if you're juicing flowers you do need to add a little bit of water into your blender as well or school turn out quite right wheatgrass juice blenders juicers are actually the best ones to use because of the way that they process the material some juicers can actually activate the THC acid and converts it to THC during the process of juicing because of the amount of heat that's used so you want to use a juicer that doesn't have a lot of heat if you're concerned about preserving your cannabinoid acids glycerin tinctures that are made without any heat or alcohol tinctures made without any heat are another place that you can find acidic cannabinoids water extracted hash will often have a small amount of activation but you can keep the majority of it in the acid form as well and you can capsulize that so you can take it as an oral ingestible as a capsule so those are some strategies in ways that you can access acidic cannabinoids and try them if you're interested one of the other things that's been interesting as i've have worked with several patients concerning the use of THC acid and THC is there's a distinct time-phased effect that's different for THC acid what we've learned is that if you're interested in pursuing THC acid therapy you have to try it for a while to make sure you're actually experiencing the benefit for many patients is actually up to three to four weeks after daily use that they truly start to experience the benefit I have a lot of patients who approached me and they say Samantha you know I'm trying to choose is it THC acid therapy or is it th which one is it that I want you know aren't we funny as humans that way right we want to be an a/b thing but really the answer is it's probably both you know I myself I have fibromyalgia so I deal with chronic pain and there's days where I have really acute days they're really bad days acidic cannabinoid therapy on a daily basis is something that can lower the overall symptom level of someone who has a condition like mine chronic pain condition but on those acute days I probably need some THC and so they can really complement one another so the acidic cannabinoid therapy to bring down that total level of symptoms that you're feeling and the activated cannabinoids to really help you deal with that in the moment situation because THC as you know you feel very immediately and can give you that immediate relief if you need it to help promote your quality of life and keep you functional for that day when you are pursuing THC acid therapy especially if you're doing it to avoid intoxication you really do need to make sure you understand that there is going to be a small amount in that activated form THC present so you may still feel a little bit of psycho activity but it certainly should be a lot less than if the whole thing was activated again most of our evidence around THC acid therapy has to do with patient anecdotal evidence that's been gathered by various clinicians even dispensaries who are doing their own research there's a certain dispensaries have gone on a mission to gather data and figure out what's really happening with some of these unique substances some of the things that we've observed are reduction in inflammation and muscle convulsions in spasticity but the one that fascinates me the most is changes in cognitive development in children who are taking acidic cannabinoid therapies we see some really amazing shifts in their behavior both from THC acid and CBD acid we see changes and emotional intelligence in speech and cognition I'm fascinated to see what the further research on THC acid reveals and we should be really fascinating people often wonder what's normal for THC should it take care of my pain should it take care of my nausea like what is it really supposed to do for me there's been a lot of research that's been done there's certainly more to do but we have some really clear ground that you can stand on and say THC is great for these things it's great for mild to moderate pain relief and it's become because of that has become a great option for people to wean themselves off of opioid therapy say from post-surgical pain for some people they can deal with post-surgical pain using cannabis for many people that's a challenge and they often need the opioids for a few days but cannabis can be an incredible tool for getting yourself off of that addictive medication as quickly as possible so you don't experience those side effects control of nausea is a very significant finding around THC people with cancer and AIDS and who are taking a lot of different pharmaceutical regimens to help get them through their condition off an experience a lot of nausea and also the need for appetite stimulation as we all know THC does a great job at appetite stimulation sometimes when you don't want it to THC can also be a great solution for insomnia for many people helping people go to sleep and then stain is sleep a little bit longer the one thing that we should always consider especially for new users to cannabis who are trying THC for the first time is that for some people it's not always totally a great experience so if you suffer from anxiety or you find yourself on the bipolar spectrum or with schizophrenia or with conditions like that THC may exacerbate your condition so if you fall into that spectrum you really want to make sure that you work closely with your doctor if you're just thinking about exploring THC dominant cannabis and your therapy regimen and make sure that it's the right choice for you and then it's done in a controlled manner because everybody needs to be successful and their therapeutic regimen that one might need a little bit more guidance and some THC levels for flowers are really interesting you know in owning the lab for the last seven years it's been fascinating to actually watch that potency average rise in addition to the the potency average of flowers rising you see all these other kind of new products coming out but a lot of people wonder like what's normal for flowers what's average what's high what's low so in Northern California where my laboratory does testing we see the average range of THC dominant flowers to be about sixteen and a half percent once you get over about eighteen to twenty percent that's near in the strong range and over 21 percent you have a lot fewer strings that qualify and if another dividing line is 25% you do have some strains that perform over 25 percent THC but it's a lot fewer than below so it's good to understand what average ranges are and also that there is actually a value associated with those ranges and so if your economics of cannabis use matter to you then it might be good to understand what things fall into your price range and how you can best use those in your therapy regimen there is a whole class of patience right now who's really interested in the mild to moderate range of THC potency especially older people I know as I get older my response to THC definitely changes we often have a lower tolerance level for it as we get older so those lower THC products say 10% THC and below are becoming more attractive to those new people who are coming to cannabis for the first time so just because it's low potency doesn't mean it's bad it just means it's right for a different person than something that's high THC so we've had this explosion of concentrates especially in California I mean in every legal market I'm sure but I'm here in California so that's where I see it the most I remember the first time I saw a BHO wax I remember the first time I saw a shatter and as a chemist I was fascinated by it and I asked them about it and they wouldn't tell me anything it's top secret in others videos all over YouTube the times I think all of this stuff so it's certainly no secret anymore and as the secret has gotten out the proliferation of it's been amazing and what's really fascinating is it's really changed the potency thresholds that people are accustomed to and that they expect in the marketplace so interesting to know that Keefe you know so that's a cannabis that's been run and over a dry sieve say and the resin glands collected generally doesn't get over about 30 or 40 percent THC and more often it's actually a little bit below that with hash so traditional hash like you used to see coming se out of Afghanistan and Pakistan in places like that which you actually don't see much of anymore generally ranges between about 10 to 60% with average being at about 48 bubble hash which is water extracted hash still popular all it's waning in its popularity as other extracts come into the market co2 extracts and BHO extracts and all these different things that people are doing but water extracted hash you know averages at about 50% and really tops out around 65 or so you do have a few rare ones that go higher than that but the average is a real solid 50 percent wax or BHO or shatter co2 extracts you know those are chemical extracts so bubble hash hash and Keith are all made by what we call a mechanical process right where you physically remove resin glands and gather them and press them together whereas these new concentrates are totally different so they come from a process of chemical extraction so the extraction of cannabis with butane with co2 with propane some with nitrogen there's a variety of things that you can use but that chemical extraction as you might expect as much more efficient so you get much higher concentrates um ranging upwards of 90 plus percent definitely something to be careful with if you're a new user but can be a great source of relief and very concentrated dose of cannabinoids if needed for the right patient let's move on to talking about CBD a lot of talk about CBD people are really excited about CBD you know when I first started speaking to patient audiences seven years ago I would ask people who's heard of CBD in here and I get a couple hands half timidly raised when I asked that question to an audience today everybody raises their hand until they know what CBD is which is a really cool thing to happen in five or seven years so why do we care about CBD and what's the buzz you know what is it all about well it's different from THC in many ways in both the way that it makes you feel and a therapeutic applications so CBD has been called non psychoactive or non intoxicating the way I like to say it is you'll still be able to operate heavy equipment afterwards probably so CBD is a great option for people who again who are seeking cannabinoid therapy are a little concerned about the feelings of intoxication they might experience from THC and would really prefer to take baby steps in to cannabis they feel safer so CBD has become one of those things that people can try in a safe way in a safe place in addition there's a greater level of permissions right they've been created around CBD both legally and culturally in our society and that entry point of that kind of environment of permissions that's being created for CBD is really exciting because it's really been the impetus for changing the conversation around cannabinoid therapy focusing on the medicinal therapeutic and less on the psychoactivity and intoxication components that have historically been our kind of cultural association with cannabis CBD is interesting in that it's usually found at low levels so sub 1% less than 1% but in some cannabis it's the dominant cannabinoid although that does occur more rarely than with THC there's a lot of efforts underway to create more CBD strains their seed collectives there's independent growers there's companies who are making products now and they want the only specific cannabinoids to be present especially CBD so there's a lot of work around developing more CBD strains and creating more access to CBD for patient population so interestingly CBD like THC also has an acid form CBD acid or CBD a fascinating of course that both of course are non intoxicating as CBD is not intoxicating if THC is present though it's good to understand that you may still feel some feelings of intoxication so CBD does really lower the overall feelings of intoxication that you're going to feel from THC because of the way that they interact but you still may feel a little bit so if you do feel some intoxication don't be surprised it's because of the THC present the therapeutic uses of CBD and CBD acid are different a lot less is known about CBD acid fewer people have used it but it has been the one that has shown some pretty incredible shifts in children who are using it again as with THC acid the time to feel the effects are different so with CBD acid therapy you may need to be using CBD acid tincture or juicing three to four weeks before you actually feel that overall reduction of your symptom level one of the best stories that I heard about Beadie acid therapy was out in the village of Mendocino in Northern California and I was visiting a little collective out there called the Leonard Moore cooperative we've done a lot of work to try and promote CBD and there was a patient of theirs that had ALS and it was a fairly far advanced case of it and she was about to go into Hospice and the family was really upset about that they really wanted her at home you know everybody does better at home and so you know there in that moment of desperation and they were gonna try anything and they got some juice to cannabis from Leonard more cooperative and that juiced cannabis being given to her on a daily basis is what kept her off of a feeding tube and kept her out of hospice and so she was able to have really an incredibly higher quality of life through CBD acid therapy and there's there's so many stories like that we don't have enough time to tell but it can be a very powerful alternative to the drugs that people are using or the care regimens that we start to pursue as as people go into end-of-life so like with THC acid there is a recipe for conversion if you need to convert CBD acid to CBD say for a product or a tincture that you're making to help with your own therapeutic regimen and there's some specific conditions so again heating raw cannabis in your oven so not in oil or anything else is the best way to do it you want to spread it out on a baking sheet pre-heat your oven to 295 so it's a higher temperature than with THC and heat it for ninety minutes and you'll get great CBD acid to CBD conversion if you don't go to that 295 degree temperature your conversion probably won't occur or I'll occur in a partial way so really important that you hit that temperature and because it's important you hit the temperature I recommend that people buy an additional temperature gauge for their oven so you can often buy them right in the grocery store and the little gadget aisle you can hang it right in your oven and make sure that you're actually at the right temperature because I'll tell you our oven thermostats are terrible for the most part I have learned so when people are looking for CBD and they're looking for it the flower form they're often kind of restricted to asking about specific strain names some strains that you can look for that are likely to be CBD dominant are things like tsunami Harlequin canna tonic Harless sue can ASSU stinky pink diesel and of course Charlotte's Web that we heard about a lot from Sanjay Gupta interestingly stinky pink diesel was the first I know it's a funny name was the first high bead high CBD strain that was isolated and identified here in California through lab testing that happened at Harbor side it was a strain that came out of very very small growing community in Mendocino County called Koval oh and I remember doing a seminar out in Koval Oh about six years ago now in the public library there and as a very small place about six people came and the woman who actually had created that strain and submitted it for testing and was it was actually there so it was a pleasure to meet her she stills got those genetics and is holding on to him tight you know that's one of the things that's been interesting about CBD is because it's been so limited in supply and there have been so few people who have held the genetics there was a tendency for a long time to hold on to them and and not share them with people what's really exciting is that we've had some producers and breeders and creators like Lawrence Ringo who made all of their genetics available in seed form to whoever wanted to buy them so that's been a really exciting change in CBD is it's now very publicly available for people who say want to grow it themselves or work with it themselves the therapeutic uses of CBD are different from THC complimentary but different so it definitely deals with pain just like THC does but it attacks pain from a different side than THC it definitely reduces inflammation as THC does but it specifically deals with pain due to spasticity and there are a lot of chronic pain conditions that originate from muscle spasticity fibromyalgia multiple sclerosis I mean epilepsy it's origin is spasticity and that's why you've seen CBD become a go-to therapeutic alternative for many people who suffer from these spasticity related conditions CBDs also been shown in some more modern research to be very effective for eliminating chemotherapy induced neuropathy and also neuropathy in general even diabetic neuropathy so that work was done in a very formal setting and was actually very clear so CBD has a lot of different uses especially for people suffering from chronic pain one of its other major applications is as an anti-anxiety substance so CBD for many people who suffer from anxiety really seems to provide them incredible relief now I never recommend that somebody go off of their anxiety medication without consulting their doctor but for many patients they've been able to either find it as a compliment or a substitution for a more traditional pharmaceutical regimen that they were previously on CBD has also been shown in some research to perhaps have some anti-tumor activity for particular types of tumors a little bit later in the presentation we'll talk a little bit more about that research for people who are using CBD and THC together they have some interesting interplay with one another that's good to understand because they become tools in your toolkit as a patient and a user with a therapeutic regimen that you're trying really to have be successful so CBD actually prolongs the effects of THC and the way that it does that is actually inhibits the enzyme that breaks down THC in our liver so when CBD connects with that enzyme it changes its shape and so THC doesn't fit in it very well anymore and can't be broken down and so it recirculates and we experience it for a longer period of time CBD also reduces the feelings of intoxication from THC so when I tell people that CBD is gonna make their THC last longer they're alright I'm gonna get high for longer well it's a little bit different than that you'll probably be less high but your therapeutic benefits will last for longer so it's a point at which we have to kind of separate those two ideas the expected CBD levels for flowers are a little bit different than for THC especially when we're looking at CBD flowers that have a one-to-one or a balanced ratio because think about it you couldn't have 20% THC and 20% CBD in the plant right no one to another they 40% cannabinoid and they just don't accumulate at that level no lab has shown that result yet so the only time that you really see CBD go above 20% or even in that range are in those 20 to 1 CBD to THC flowers oftentimes and say a one-to-one CBD flower you'll see something like 5% CBD and 5% THC or maybe 7% and 7% so the levels are a lot lower than you see in those THC flowers that we've really optimized for potency over so many different years how high the CBD level is again depends on ratio so if you're dealing with a twenty to one you can actually see CBD levels up as high as twenty but with balanced or with lower ratios you're going to see them more in the single-digit range so that doesn't mean that it's poor quality and I know we have this idea that cannabis at a certain percentage means that it's low quality so you kinda have to throw that out the door when it comes to CBD it's just an entirely different thing to consider let's talk about cbn a little bit you know it's gotten kind of a bad rap and you know there's a reason why it's a byproduct of THC degradation so when THC degrades it becomes CBN that usually happens in the presence of UV light and oxygen and I used to say to the growers that I would talk to you so don't put it in the turkey bag and throw it in the corner of your room and little light run across it and back and forth all day because that UV in addition the oxygen the bag is going to cause CBN conversion a lot of dispensaries and people in the kind of open market of cannabis view CBN is a negative indicator of either processing or age on cannabis that's true but it has to be taken with a grain of salt it really only applies to indoor grown cannabis outdoor grown cannabis is going to naturally have a small amount of CBN present due to the UV that's impinging on it from the Sun and the weathering that's happening as it grows in the outdoor environment during the entire grow season so not uncommon to find say 0.5% CBN in an outdoor grown flower that's been perfectly grown and perfectly processed and is very fresh so CBN is not always an indicator of negativity either in the growth conditions or in processing so good to understand that it also has some interesting therapeutic benefits one of the ones that's interesting to me especially is around cardiovascular effects it actually decreases heart rate without decreasing blood flow so can bring your heart rate down some animal model research has also said that CBN induces feelings of grogginess I actually did some consumer testing along the way in developing the humble products to look at CBN and I found very clearly that CBN is a very dose dependent substance and that at low doses can be effective as a sleep aid but as you go into moderate and high doses actually seems to be contraindicated for sleep and can be alerting to many people so there's a very interesting finding and in fact found throughout our work that LOC cbn dose and a dose of THC accompanied with Mersin are virtually equivalent so let's talk a little bit about some of the minor cannabinoids THC and CBD and CBN we hear about those a lot there's other ones that have started to percolate up you know we hear about them here and there but we don't know a lot about them part of its because not a lot of research has been done so there's more work to do but there's some interesting things to look at CBC is one of my favorite I think it has a lot of promise you know CBD has been shown to be a very powerful anti anxiety substance in the preliminary research that's been done CBC has been shown to have 10 times the anti-anxiety effects of CBD Wow interestingly CBC is present and elevated amounts in juvenile plants and then as the plant grows older and matures and flowers you have lower CBC levels there have been some plants that have been isolated that are CBC rich plants and they are actually mutant plants that can't produce THC and CBD very well and so because they can't produce THC and CBD very well the CBC is allowed to accumulate the reason why is that they all share the same starting material so this little pile of something called CBG acid inside the plant and the THC enzyme the CBD enzyme and the CBC enzyme all grab on to that CBG acid as their starting material to convert to become the cannabinoids that they eventually are THC CBD and CBC so when the THC enzyme and the CBD enzyme aren't grabbing any of that b:g acid it's just left there for the CBC in Xiamen it goes to town and starts to accumulate uns that's the only time you really see it at appreciable levels in a mature plant so there hasn't been very many of those identified so that's kind of that's the search right for the ambitious grower out there is that CBC mutant CBC's also been shown to have anti-inflammatory and pain relieving effects as well cannabidiol or CBD is an interesting one as well it's non psychoactive or non intoxicating as a CBC by the way again anti-inflammatory and pain relieving effects seems to be a theme right you hear from almost every cannabinoid THC CBD CBC now CBG we're hearing that pain relieving an anti-inflammatory effects so if you're dealing with pain cannabis is a great solution or a great thing to drive for people you know we often hear about cannabis and glaucoma and I don't know we've all probably heard Peter Tosh this song where he talks about it too right I always associated that especially with the way people express it and talked about it what it had to do with THC but if you look at the research you'll see that what was actually shown to be reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients in the research that's been performed with CBG in many of the cases that have been identified so it's also an interesting molecule to look at therapeutic li CBG acid as I said is the precursor to both THC and CBD in the growing plant but you always have a small amount of CBG that's left over and sometimes it's not a small amount it can actually help growers look at an indicator of whether or not they allowed their plant to mature longer so a mature plant that was harvested in an optimal time probably have 1% or less of CBG maybe up to one and a half percent but you can see plants with as much as five or six percent CBG present in them basically what you're looking at there if it's not a genetic mutant is a plant that was just harvested a little bit too early that balance and that varying balance between the different cannabinoids as well as the other substances of the plant at different points of maturity and harvests are some of the things that shape preferences that people have say for early mid to late harvest products THC v also has a lot of buzz about it tetrahydrocannabinol it's a mouthful there's been limited research on it it's a very rare cannabinoid in my laboratory we've isolated three different cultivars of THC cannabis over 5% by weight so those are very interesting all in one small community in Mendocino so they've been kind of collecting genetics it's sifting through to them to see if they can find th DV and a few of them have the animal model research assist some interesting things about THC v relative to THC and that is is that the presence of THC v is thought to bring on the feelings of THC stronger and quicker so it quicker hi that's more intense but also has a shorter duration I said call it the quickie right if you can actually find the THC v cannabis there's also been research people say hey Samantha where do I get some of that diet weed and I say diet weed well what's the diet weed the diet weed it turns out is th T V cannabis so there's been some animal model research that suggested that it actually prevents the munchies which if you struggle with your weight and you smoke cannabis may be a significant issue for you not being proven out in humans yet so as soon as we get more THC th T V cannabis for everybody to try we'll have to run that one to ground and see if it really is the diet weed but there's a lot of people excited about the prospect of that right now there's also a related compound on the CBD side called CBD V Orkin a bit of Eron CBD v and THC v are both what we call propyl cannabinoids they have a three carbon ring on them that what makes them a little bit different CBD v is also a non intoxicating cannabinoid and it's thought to perhaps be one of the differentiators in CBD dominant cannabis that has greater or lesser efficacy for epilepsy treatment so interestingly in in groups of epilepsy patients who have been trying lots of different CBD strains we find that they don't all work the same some work better than others they maybe have the same CBD to THC ratio so you can tell it's not about that it's not just about the CBD and THC well one of the other things it's present can be CBD v and some preliminary animal model research has shown that CBD v has significant anti spasticity properties so it may be that the anti spasticity properties of CB DV when coupled with CB d really create the best solution for a lot of people when treating epilepsy and spasticity but more to learn on that as well there's a lot of exciting research happening right now and it's an exciting time in that our government here in the u.s. even is allowing more research up to this time a lot of it has had to happen in more international places in Spain and Italy and Israel and Canada who have had a Amsterdam who've had a greater level of permissions than we have there's been a few pioneers here in the u.s. dr. Sean McAllister is one of them he's out of California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco and Sean is a true pioneer you can you two of him and watch him all day if you'd like to what Sean did was he induced tumors into animals into rats so you can actually buy cancer many people don't know that but you can buy cancer and you can give it to things as in a clinical setting so these rats were given cancer and they were allowed to grow tumors in this case breast tumors were the specific case study that I saw from from Sean so he showed a picture of this ugly tumor on this poor rats chest and then he made CBD THC injections into that tumor and after 30 days of the injections at the right ratio of CBD to THC that tumor completely disappeared and the next thing that Sean shows is a picture of a rat with nothing but beautiful pink skin on its belly and if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I probably wouldn't believe it because it's such an amazing transformation so Sean's work is really exciting he's really diving down into whether the specific cannabinoid ratios that are needed to treat a specific type of cancer Sean was a rebel he got his first research grant under the auspices of actually demonstrating that cannabis wasn't good for you and and bless Sean for that because that was how he got the funding to make these findings now the NIH is willing to fund his research at face value as a benefit for finding cures for cancer so that's an exciting shift as well there's been a lot of research on PTSD we have a lot of people in our society these days suffering from it from all of the wars that we've had recently addition to just the stress and pain of this fast-paced culture that we're all living in right now so there's been a lot of looking at how can cannabis help these people recover and come back to normalcy and enjoy a greater quality of life well we've shown that THC when it stimulates the cb1 receptor can interrupt memories and we all know that cannabis affects our memory wearing work and if personally in anecdotally but it can on a on a more clinical level so when your memories are disrupted that way when you have PTSD it can actually let you have that break where you can get control and get control of your thoughts and control that looping and that focusing on that negative experience you had which is the root of that PTSD so again through animal model research and showing that stimulation of the cb1 receptor eliminates these long term negative memories there's a real prospect of hope for people who are suffering from PTSD using cannabinoid therapy instead of other pharmaceutical alternatives there was some great research at Temple University on chemotherapy induced neuropathy as well neuropathy is the degeneration of the nervous system and there's a lot of pain associated with it the study found that when CBD was administered before the chemotherapy that could actually completely prevent the onset of chemotherapy induced neuropathy so for those people that was you know an amazing amazing shift they in a 2010 FDA clinical trial they actually concluded that inhaled cannabis significantly reduced neuropathy as compared to placebo in human studies so fascinating to see the FDA and 2010 was actually doing this research which is not well known so some great things on cancer PTSD and neuropathy and one that's really been in the press a lot lately has been treatment of epilepsy that's happening through the activated CBD being administered to patients often in tincture form or orally ingestible and it's causing incredible shifts and changes in people who suffer from frequent seizures I had a story from a fellow who called me and he went to tell me about his four-year-old daughter and you could hear the sounds of him making dinner in the background all of San sounds the family I liked him from kind of the first few words he said to me was hearing and he said you know my daughter has 800 seizures a day and basically that means she's in an intractable seizures all of the time I'm really desperate to find something to help her they've got her on all of these drugs or causing all these side-effects and she has no quality of life and no interaction with the family it was a very sad story and he didn't live anywhere near me in my state so I was able to help him with was information about CBD and strain names that he could look for to try and find something to help her he called me back about a month later he said Samantha I want to tell you about what's happening I said you know she was at eight hundred seizures a day and we've had her on a CBD tincture now for a month or so and she's down to one seizure a week and later on that young lady was down to one a month it gives you chills when you think about I mean can you imagine eight hundred seizures a day was no that's one every you know every if you figure out how many minutes there on the day and that's pretty much a constant seizure so the fact that CBD can bring this kinds of relief to people is something that's opening doors and opening minds about cannabis as a therapeutic alternative sir so many of these complicated drugs that are currently being used to treat these very serious conditions so it's I'm excited to be a part of and share with you this current research and maybe help open your mind and your landscape of permissions for trying cannabis and for supporting it in the use of your families", "Q4SzpaHq-u0": "[Music] so I'm in a massive cannabis field right now and we're not in Colombia or Colorado we're actually in China near the Himalayas local farmers have been tending this field for the past five months and today they're ready to harvest the fruits of their labor they're about to top down 24 tons of cannabis the whole mission their company about how the heart cannot be you'll find your plan the whole woman the ha she knew and by the way it's like some that whining flu a few months ago this clot was all tobacco in court but now young Lou who manages this field says they're growing hemp a strain of the cannabis plant known for the increasingly popular non psychotropic component CBD the CBD market in the US will grow by 700 percent this year and be worth more than twenty three billion dollars by 2023 in China wants a piece of that fields like this in Yunnan Province are now a part of a growing CBD boom in China research analysts say UN and Heilongjiang provinces alone produced just over 11 percent of the global CBD supply last year the extract is taken from these plants then sold in the US demand for CBD from China has ballooned because of its supposed health Frenchie's consumer products increased with CBD like coffee bath bombs and gummy bears claim to help with pain and relaxation whatta man the CBD honey would go Edie ones yeah oh wow kind of sweet and fruity in a way wonder chefs here we're in Quin being here dozens of startups have sprouted up to capitalize on the cannabis and CBD boom in the u.s. the city has become a trailblazer for cannabis much like Denver after marijuana was first legalized in the u.s. Chinese entrepreneurs are convinced they can turn their country into a cannabis superpower China already has the infrastructure and the know-how since it produces half of the world's industrial hemp that's mainly used for textiles and paper but here's the catch in China cannabis is actually a very sensitive topic junsu PCL ba you fool tryna shop that's because it contains not only CBD but THC the psychoactive ingredient that gets you high I feel very safe in my new outfits anyone caught selling products with THC risk spending the rest of his or her life in prison or worse face the death penalty and by extension CBD consumption in the country is also illegal so when we visited one of the world's largest CBD extraction plans it actually felt like we were touring a prison here there are dozens of surveillance cameras barbed wire and every door is locked with a coat oh wow looks like a Star Wars control room in here but what's illegal for the country turns out to be big business and authorities aren't stifling that instead they've put in place very strict regulations on CBD production will mention condom a girl who should say go onto the King Kong Shah Jahan I want to know do you have tests for your employees like drug tests taken I sure go on tea time away gg-get you're not so this apparently is CBD it's kind of muddy looking it kind of looks like a black bean paste or something this factory runs 24 hours a day seven days a week pumping out 1.5 tons of CBD a year so this is what the world wants pure CBD extract and the most pure CBD can be sold for 8,000 to 10,000 dollars per kilogram we went to Shanghai to meet a Chinese entrepreneur who sees this raw material from Yunnan as a golden opportunity to sell CBD Shanghai you have a dollar debt not sure rockefeller count all Summer Sun leads the Chinese branch of CII acts an American financial firm that analyzes companies in the US for Chinese investors when they looked at the CBD boom they decided to open a company in China one may watch other Hayashi be the to me my own son says to really win big it won't be about just selling to the US eventually he hopes one day he'll be able to sell these products inside the country so Chinese entrepreneurs like son are starting to educate Chinese consumers he's selling CBD free products that are legal in China this influencer is testing one of sons products it contains other extracts from cannabis plants but he's marketing products to Chinese consumers as CBD it doesn't have any CBD is that misleading jungle vine hemorrhage at all tension the PR DVD shriveled up see my logo for some beer [Music] as companies anticipate the CBD market in China to open they are starting to invest big in the cannabis of the future - Oh Madonna Mia don't really match the home the country is quickly catching up to the US and Europe and entrepreneurs believe their country will eventually surpass competitors as a CBD powerhouse in production but most importantly consumption yoga since in the trainee at the Tantra pompe oh ho Chun Chiu geranyl woman shampooed on the tree most Wakana shaman a fan for that room to come here time at sea for sure young leo says China can only succeed because he expects the country will do to the CBD industry when it has already done to dominate other industries like smartphones plastics or clothes what can you make voice in the sugar-free trinomial the I woke up you will I depart from your dumb out that wrong with the changing wait wait huh [Music]", "km6Rg_tsI6o": "Canada's legal cannabis market is about to get a little bigger today the federal government announced that edibles will become available for purchase this December but there are tight rules about what's in it and how it's sold the CBC's Katie Simpson is here with all of the details so Katie tell us what did the government announce today well the government had been expected this is part of the the next wave of the legalization process and so today the government announced that it's not going to be until mid December at the earliest that stores can the stores that are licensed retailers can actually start selling edibles as well as topicals and extracts those are a number of different products that there is a big market for according to some of the people who work in the industry that we spoke with today have to say but again this is part of the larger process with the government trying to to legalize marijuana legalize these products and there are going to be some limits here as well the government announcing that the way that edibles will be packaged they'll be limited to 10 milligrams serving sizes and there will also be continued to be the rules around how much marijuana or how much cannabis people can buy when they are at one of these licensed retailers bill Blair who is been in charge of this legalization program he earlier today spoke with reporters and defended the way the government has moved forward on this I've heard from the industry and people saying but you know we could make more money if you only did this or relaxed these regulations but quite frankly that's not our motivation our motivation is and will always be to protect our kids to protect the health and safety of our of Canadians and to keep our community safe and displaced that illicit market that has developed over decades so the government has said from the beginning that the reason it is doing this is it wants to make it harder for kids to get marijuana it wants to eliminate the black-market those things that'll be a long term achievement that has not happened yet if they are able to achieve that but this is the next step in that wave okay so what's the reaction been so far today well we went to a marijuana shop I'd never been to one before and we went in there very busy we have to fact-check very busy and we went in and spoke with Michael Patterson who's a co partner at fire and flower and he says that one of the biggest things ever since his shop open back in April one of the biggest things that customers ask is when can they get their hands on edibles have a listen just because in the previous black market you really had no idea what you were consuming and because there was such a delayed effect when it hits people quite often but have very bad experiences so there's a lot of people who are interested in consuming cannabis not by smoking it and would love edibles they just don't really want to take the risk of what's currently out there so that opens up edibles opens up a completely different discussion because right now on the black market as Michael just mentioned no one knows what they're getting really also there's the concern which is a concern for the Canadian Centre for substance use and addictions they have a concern about people who might not know what they're doing if they are taking these because the body processes edibles in a different way than if you were to say smoke a joint or smoke Agyei as the kids say have a listen I think one of my biggest concerns is is over consumption or over intoxication with smoked cannabis you start to feel the effects you know relatively quickly if you're using an edible cannabis product so it can take up to two hours before you can feel the effects so this is a next phase thing obviously that centre of the official we spoke with from the centre says this needs to be researched heavily there and there needs to be a lot of precautions around this particularly because there are some very serious fears about you know what if kids accidentally get their hands on this people who don't even know it's a cannabis edible eat it and they don't want to have an experience like that so there's still a lot of work to be done around that but for those who are interested in the edible products they gotta wait until mid-december okay Caity Lotz to chew on thanks so much Katie Simpson I've heard from the industry and people saying but you know we could make more money if you only did this or relaxed these regulations but quite frankly that's not our motivation our motivation is and will always be to protect our kids to protect the health and safety of our of Canadians and keep our community safe and displace that illicit market that has developed over decades Canadians will soon be able to legally consume a new range of cannabis products edibles such as baked goods candy and cannabis extracts will be available this December as well as topicals like ointment screams and even makeup but the government is setting strict rules on them each individual package of edibles will be limited to a maximum of ten milligrams of THC and packaging must be plain and cannot appeal to children also cannabis products containing alcohol nicotine or caffeine will be prohibited unless it's natural caffeine like what's found in chocolate for instance so is industry on board with these regulations Sebastian st. Louie is the co-founder and CEO of hexo a licensed cannabis producer based in gatineau he joins us now from Montreal Sebastian thanks for taking the time I want to start with your overall impression of the regulations rolled out today what's your reaction to those I think from hexose perspective we're really pleased at the progress that we're making in Canada I mean we're on the world stage world leader creating just amazing experiences for consumers and now we have a whole new way to delight our customers so we're very excited about October and December walk me through some of the specific regulations here though because it makes it clear that the products cannot be appealing to youth how do you navigate that what does that mean because a chocolate bar or gummy bear the cookies these are appealing to kids well we're working very tightly with Health Canada on exactly how we roll out the products and bringing a cannabis into responsible use has been a core tenant of what hex has been all about for the last six years the interesting thing about legalization of cannabis as we've seen in the stats in Colorado and now in Canada even is we see a reduction in youth use and so as we move into edibles now we'll simply apply the principles that we've learned from dried marijuana and oils and make sure that we don't put the products within easy access of youths make sure that the packaging is not appealing to them and of course avoid certain form factors when we're talking about gummies about things that could look like a toy or a gummy okay so you have to have plain packaging and how would you make a edible chocolate bar and cookie for example that isn't appealing to a youth because those seem my kids they like chocolate bars they like cookies it starts from the safety of the distribution and then from the safety of the packaging itself so we put everything in child resistant containers and then of course it's up to the adults that purchase cannabis to make sure they store them in a safe location out of the reach of children the limits of 10 milligrams of THC in the package of edibles people tell me that this is a low level of THC compared to what's there in black-market edibles so is this a potent enough limit for the market yeah the exciting thing about the research Heco's doing today is that we can actually increase the effect in body with much lower doses than what's typically seen in black-market we've been able to go to a smaller particulate side and the result is that it's a safer product it's a lower dose it's a better experience for the consumer and we are we're absolutely happy to work within the ten milligram limit people will have a very pleasant experience with with those levels it's legalizing it is obviously a new frontier and experience for Canada but for a lot of people who might try this for the first time edibles might not be the way they are introduced to cannabis for a lot of people so will there be instructions will there be guidance on how an edible would affect a consumer for the first time versus other methods of consuming cannabis so interesting that we're now only legalizing edibles but hexo has had experience with edible cannabis products on the market now for many years we were the first company in Canada to introduce our D carb product which is an edible cannabis powder which fits currently under the dried marijuana regs and so we've built a whole slew of Education programs and working with the distribution and the provinces in getting that information into the hands of consumers start low go slow right so but if I want to try an edible for the first time how am I gonna know how that may affect me is there going to be some sort of advice that comes with the package when I buy it or is it just gonna be trial and error there is reaction and depending on everyone's biological makeup for different doses so that's why we suggest for example especially in the case of our new beverages that we're launching with Molson Coors this coming October what we're gonna be doing is ensuring that the product is sessionable and that it starts at a very low dose especially in the case of THC so the idea that someone's gonna be able to work up to an appropriate dose for the effect that they're looking starting at say 2 milligrams of THC and then if somebody feels that they need to have a higher dose well then they can have a second or third session of the product ok so what are you doing with moles in Korres because the regulations on the Edible says no alcohol no nicotine no caffeine how's that working well we we think that mixing alcohol and both this is both hexo and Wilson's position the mixing alcohol and cannabis is unsafe and so we're not shipping any product that will have alcohol and cannabis together what we're doing is we're creating formulations powered by EXO that'll help people for fun sleep focus sport sex and Diet we're inserting those formulations into all kinds of great based beverages that Molson is investing in and those will range from sparkling waters to waters to of course some d alkalized beers that people are familiar okay so using them for for manufacturing and distribution and bottling and canning and that sort of thing but not alcohol connected with it no but the base products as well that they're investing in because they're starting to diversify and starting to buy other beverage brands outside of beer okay so most of course doesn't have trouble supplying the market with its product the marijuana industry the cannabis industry has had problems supplying the market since since legalization began how do we avoid some of the problems we've seen with traditional cannabis on edibles I think that there's been a lot of lessons learned by the industry in the in the last six years heck so for one is ready for October 17th now it looks like it may be a few extra months to get products on shelf but we're already ramped up the logistics supply chain is done we have the largest cannabis manufacturing Center on the planet in Belleville Ontario 1.5 million square feet of straight manufacturing we have over 1,100 employees hard at work including 25 top phd's food scientists and the products are going to be absolutely fantastic and ready on store shelves with our partners of course starting in Quebec with s QDC but Canada wide okay

Appetit invited me to have dinner with her for Christmas Eve we're out here on this beautiful patch of land we're known as daughter vow runs when an organization that provides medical cannabis for people who can't afford it Nona happens to be a fantastic Italian cook and I can't wait to see what she's cooking up tonight I can't believe the sauna would send me a rim life grown-up elf oh I love your sweater thank you so much I figured I'd you know get the most festive weed oriented thing I could I could really really keep it you got a whole bunch of weed laid out here what are we gonna be doing we're still finishing our harvest so how about if you give us a hand trimming yeah definitely so Nona are we gonna be cooking with this weed that I'm trimming right here oh absolutely I'm gonna show you how to make a marijuana cookies cookies in the shape of marijuana leaf and we're also gonna have eggnog wait did you just say eggnog yes it's a special type of eggnog that has been treated and that's all I'm gonna tell you will surprise you great speaking of your food I've never had it but I know that you did an episode of Bon Appetit which made you world-famous there must have been a lot of nice people like saying how awesome you are huh absolutely and that really surprised me because no in no way that I think that it would go to this extent every day I get many many many compliments from people encouraging me to keep on with my work and how much they admire what I do I'm really glad that the world has a weed grandma that just helps out like as many people as she can and you know more importantly than that spreads the spirit of kindness that you know I think cannabis kind of exudes you know it does it does you're a great mascot for wenona thank you you got a grandmother fetish huh I do now so I think this one is just about done and I think that we have enough trim and we brush this through like this well this fine screen is the fine mash and if we twist put this through you can see that we have both this trim product which we can use in one of our recipes and then this as well underneath we have some teeth oh wow scraping that's all together it's gonna be like a fat little puck of key huh that's right none are you ready to get cooking I'm always ready to get cooking yes you're all right my dear now at this point in time I am going to show you how we make the dough and the ignant we're going to take the clippings that we used from the Year bud and infuse it with the butter it's 1/4 ounce of trim to one stick of butter in order to activate the THC in the marijuana I have to put it in the oven for one hour at 240 degrees decarboxylation very good very good this is about 3 cups of trim that has been removed from the oven and that we will put through a sieve so that we can use it to make the cookies also the kief is the net result from the clippings which went through a screen and that is going to be put in the one cup of cream it's a 1 teaspoon exactly - one cup of cream and this is the basis for the egg new well each one of these the cream and the clippings with the butter will go at least one hour on a very very low heat that's why you have to keep watching and stirring you don't want to burn it [Music] okay now my dear to carry it on we're gonna make the cookie dough that's a third of the letters gonna make somebody happy [Music] all right so it looks like the weed cookie dough is almost ready right just about put this in the refrigerator yes ma'am [Music] so what do you say Nona we've been chilling for a little while that dough's been showing we ready to make some cookies let's get baked let's do it let's get baked that's beautiful I'm very happy with this so who are these cookies for these cookies are specifically being made for Santa Claus he's got a long night and he's gonna be cold and hungry so I'm give him some warm milk and fresh cookie can I try cutting a cookie yeah he needs it too here should I make one real big pot cookie all right okay abracadabra he's gonna punch it out right perfect that's a nice big one yeah that's gonna be good I don't want to medicate this one a little extra for Santa yeah he can't grow a weed up in the North Pole I'm guessing hey all right so we got a ragtag team of pot cookies here are these ready to go in the oven absolutely and how hot is this oven right here it should be at 375 great and how long are they gonna be in there for just about about 10 minutes we'll check them at 8 minutes to be sure okay okay Abdullah don't burn your mouth when you swallow this one hole so I mean those are looking good some of them got a little crispy going on life interesting look that one cookie like nice and poufy your cookie in the meantime I'm gonna start baking the eggnog first thing we're gonna do is put the six egg yolks and we're gonna have them beaten until they're nice light and color look at that all I think that's ready the next step is to put in 3/4 of a cup of warm honey and you can feel it it's still nice and warm now I'm gonna pour that in slowly now that the honey is dissolved I'm gonna add 2 cups of half-and-half okay so next I'm gonna add 6 ounces of bourbon - whatever you drank 5 and 7/8 there goes the Bourbon I have here 1 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon now the last is the cream that's been infused with the key from the cuttings and I'm sure Santa's gonna have a high time with this when he's drawing writing it's later customs the world lit on your eggnog it's a good existant it gets all that Cape cream will proceed to the lid next next to the left stuff pour this into the pitcher I will add 6 egg whites beat it until they're soft peak and I'm gonna add a tablespoon of sugar I think wait right yes oh

Seattle behind to head to Vashon Island where I'm gonna meet a woman who runs the cupcake game here and also has her own line of infused edibles she's gonna show me around a bunch of farms on the island and then she's gonna teach me how to make cannabis infused cupcakes from scratch it's gonna be another weed full day on Bon Appetit so let's find the kitchen and get baked [Music] I hear that you're the cupcake queen of Seattle wow what an honor that's great yeah I have a company called cupcake Royale and we actually work with a lot of local producers we like the idea that we can support

products and other confections that we're getting ready to launch wow that's amazing and do you use all like the local ingredients right that's it absolutely and that's why we're here today because we're gonna make some cannabis cupcakes we're gonna use the cupcake RL recipe to make a chocolate buttercream but instead of the usual chocolate reuse we're gonna use good chip chocolate so first stop we need to get some butter and I want you to meet my friend Natalie who has this lovely farm that we're okay great so let's go check it out you know hi baby how are you doing are you doing very well I'm Natalie nice to meet you natalie has a dairy farm and we're going to pick up some cream and we're going to take that cream and turn it into butter and then we're going to infuse that butter with cannabis for our cupcakes and these are your milk factories right here huh exactly so I'm LT eat it this morning and I got her mouth and I have it in the farm stand for you if you like to taste something else that edith made i have some cream on one here this is the savory this has olive oil and salt and freshly ground pepper on it and this is just the fromage blanc with a little drizzle of local Vashon honey actually Natalie I have something to share with you as well some of Washington's finest but I don't know if you'd want to give this a go okay I can do it go yeah we can try okay great and it is from Washington it's called laughing Buddha and it really just one of my favorites on the market in Washington from a flower perspective all right I've never hot box before I'm standing before pretty great I gotta say let's let's get into that cheese okay so let's start off save that's your savory Wow really really creamy texture of it it's just amazing Wow so you guys are all about doing stuff from scratch yeah is that part of food culture here in the Pacific Northwest yes it's almost like a religion yeah I mean you can really taste the difference I'm going honey mmm Wow mmm holy crap okay here's your milk great what do we owe you for that that's okay you can have it oh really yes my gift to you in that case here's my gift to you it's this really fine bud you seem like you enjoyed that Jay I have to say I did excellent so enjoy the rest of that bunch and we're gonna go put this to good use I've got my jar of fresh milk that I picked up from Cornerstone farm and I've headed over to Vashon velvet where one of Jodi's friends an amazing cannabis farm where she grows some really banging buds we're gonna pick our buds and I'm gonna go put this thing down cuz my hands are freezing right now [Music] before we do anything everybody needs a name tag state regulations excellent want to be in full compliance how did you guys get into the cannabis business when the state announced the rules for getting a license to grow cannabis they said there was a 30-day window and they might never have another window open so I thought chance of a lifetime we went for it and never looked back enjoyed every minute of it Bravo that is fantastic awesome and are you a cannabis enthusiast yourself I never know and then if it's a Saturday night I'll try some of the Laughing Buddha yeah so I wanted to show you the strain that I think would make some really great cupcakes this is our platinum blueberry this is a really space-age looking grow right here go ahead and stick your fingers in and take a sniff wow there are so many different flavors going on there I mean beyond just that tart blueberry aroma there's so much else going on like a maple syrup or yeah I can't get enough of that smell and as you can see we use exclusively LED lights which use about a third of the energy of regular standard HID lights so we're trying to reduce our carbon footprint as much as possible so Patrick how far along are these guys right here these are about two to three weeks from harvest at this point oh that good karma is paying off because I mean you've got these incredible looking buds so Jody do you think this is gonna go well in your cupcakes I like the sweetness I'm excited to see what it tastes like when these guys said they make stuff from scratch they were serious I mean every single ingredient comes from the source I met the cow that we got our cream from and I met the cannabis plant that we're gonna get our buds from and now I'm hanging out with the chickens we're gonna get our eggs from and then we'll be ready to make cupcakes [Music] we have all the ingredients right here to make cupcakes and it starts right here and we're going to skim the cream off the top how do we turn that into butter we have to churn it and this is a butter turner it's crazy steam punk jar that looks pretty arduous for one person but here check it out I have an idea if you just hold the jar and I'll go like this Wow don't hit this a little bit how long does it actually take it's gonna take about 30 to 45 minutes yeah that looks like butter all right and what we're gonna do is we're gonna put this butter into this bowl and we're gonna press it against the side to kind of squeeze out more of that buttermilk all right I think we are ready to melt this up and to infuse it with our canvas okay Jody how much weed do we have decarboxylate in here this is one gram of platinum blueberry from Vashon velvet threw it in the oven at 290 degrees for an hour and that allows it to decarboxylate which means it releases the THC what we're going to do with that we're gonna put this in this 1/2 cup of delicious butter we've been working so hard on and infuse it for 30 minutes from super low heat we're starting to smell good already so you're ready to strain it we got some cheesecloth in a strainer here with the bowl underneath it we're just gonna pour this straight through the cheesecloth there's all our spent weed flowers okay so what goes into a cupcake batter we're gonna put in the dry ingredients I have two cups of flour here then we have 1 and 3/4 cup of organic cane sugar so one teaspoon of baking powder and result is this gonna give you a little mix to combine them just a little make them next step we're going to add our cannabis butter yeah we put a lot of butter we get last wrap alright that looks good I like how it's breaking up we're going to take some of our wet ingredients and mix them together we're gonna start with four egg whites so we're gonna add to that a half a cup of warm water we're gonna add a half cup of sour cream we are doing in this recipe one teaspoon of vanilla paste and this is Madagascar per bone vanilla so we're just gonna whisk this together and now we're gonna incorporate this is going better let that mix a little and now we have a nice smooth delicious looking manner that is looking super creamy these are ready to go into the oven huh this is this is exciting as soon as we open that door back up we'll have cupcakes let's put them in the oven 325 we're gonna start with eight minutes and then we're gonna rotate it after eight minutes and do six more minutes or 14 minutes oh yeah those are perfect it's like beautiful awesome alright so while those are cooling let's open some good chip chocolate and get ready to make our buttercream this is our deep dark chocolate bar the Washington state serving size is 10 milligrams Wow tasty there's no plain tea flavor and I can barely taste it yeah you really gonna talk about it - yeah yeah I like it alright so what we're gonna do is we're gonna melt eight-pitch of chocolate bar so this is gonna be 80 milligrams of THC spread across 12 cupcakes that's about seven milligrams of cupcake we did the math on the cannabis cupcake batter and that is scene or so a milligrams per cupcake so you add that plus the seven and rectory all right great pretty potent cupcake we're gonna start with putting 2/3 cup of our delicious hand turn fresh butter so we have two and a quarter cup powdered sugar we're gonna add a pinch of salt blend it all up slowly so you don't get the cup cloud we're gonna put three tablespoons of fresh milk going back to the Madagascar I'm going to put one teaspoon vanilla and we're gonna add the cannabis infused good chip chocolate yeah that was amazing we're gonna let that mix in we're so close to having cupcakes so I'm a big fan of a hand swirl instead of piping on although you can do the other and grab a little dollop and then you do a very magical thing to kind of Pat it and then you give it a little loop right I swirl on that one Cheers thank you so this is the best cupcake in Washington State huh let's see what you think mm that's a good cupcake oh my god experts you know what they do they go like this they break the bottom up and you put it on top super easy get out of town I wish I knew that point but into this thing this thing is double infused we infused the butter that went into the cupcake batter and we melted a bunch of your delicious medicated chocolates and put it right into the frosting boom boom this is a strong guy this cupcake right here is a representation of the adventure we had I had the fortune of seeing where all the ingredients are a lot of the ingredients that went into this came from really I mean it all just came together in the best cupcake I've ever had excellent truly thank you so much thanks for coming out to Vashon Island today barring out the beat thought about defeat mmm that is one good cupcake", "J4wIX9obTbw": "[Music] foreign [Music] recently late actor ifan khan's wife made an appeal to legalize cbd oil in india her appeal witnessed some criticism the recent controversy

going to be showing you guys how to make your own diy infused nerd ropes so if you haven't already follow me on instagram at daverny freeman i will be doing some giveaways so you want to follow me on instagram that's where i announce all of my giveaways and if you want to be a young young young young guy go ahead and hit that subscribe button and the notification bell so let's jump into the video so this is everything you're going to need you're going to need some heavy duty aluminum foil it doesn't really have to be that heavy duty you can go get the 99 cent one whatever fits your grip baby so i'm gonna use some aluminum foil and with my aluminum foil i'm just gonna place them on a flat uh surface and you you will be putting this inside the refrigerator so boom pow now what i'm going to do is i like to create my own little mold i don't know if you guys want to go on amazon to see if they have these molds but i know a lot of people were saying they could not find any nerve rope mold so you really have to do them by hand so this is what i'm doing now i'm just making my own little molds which is just popping the aluminum foil up a little bit so it can have this barrier in between the two i'm doing that on each side so that's what i'll be doing right now [Music] and you guys do want to be careful when you're making your little liners because this is aluminum foil and it's easy to kind of tear through them [Music] so you guys i prefer to reuse these package this the packaging that comes with it so i ain't i'm not gonna buy normal packaging y'all don't play with me we're just gonna reuse these packaging what you do is you take where it's sealed all at either end of the rope and you kind of open it up like you will a bag of chips it's very easy to tear so you do want to take your time to open up the seal and once you open it up there should be a like a little cardboard against against the seal and you put your fingers in between the cardboard and the foil and you gently slide your fingers down in order to tear the packaging apart so that's what i do i do that then i set it aside and i take some nerds now this i do this all the time so i have additional nerve ropes and nerves in there and i like to take the nerves off of the rope which is very easy um so i don't have to buy a thousand boxes of nerve ropes yeah i mean i'm nerves when i could just use this now that you have separated your gummies from the nerves you're going to place them in a heat safe microwave safe bowl and place them in a small one i do recommend doing small batches at a time because if you do so many it's going to be kind of hard to control it so now you want to take your infused coconut oil i like to use liquid coconut oil instead of the coconut oil that goes back to solid and you want to use your tincture i'm using my eva clear tincture that i already infused with your cbd and they're going additional box of nurse just in case i need them but i don't feel like i will it's just whatever floats my boat and you also want to get yourself some type of piping bag or you can get a a condiment um container i think a ziploc bag is cheaper well not really cheaper but it's it works for me and i do reuse these so it's not like i throw them away because i know i hate plastic now i'm taking my coconut oil and i'm just coating this ziploc bag with the coconut oil if you do not want to use your infused coconut oil you can definitely use pam to coat this bat this ziploc bag but i'm saying if you're going to infuse something why not have everything be infused you get what i'm saying you're going to share but yeah so i'm going to do that and i'm also gonna do the same thing to my aluminum layers that i made my little molds because if you do not it will stick i don't care what anyone says in my i've been making these for forever in a day and they will stick if you put them in the freezer you put them in the refrigerator you will have pieces of aluminum stuck to your gummy now you looking at like a food like you're in third grade with goat with with aluminum foil in your mouth like it goes so yeah that's what you want to do just make sure everything is evenly coated then move on to the next step [Music] all right you guys so to my two rope gummies and six additional gummy bears i add half a tablespoon of infused coconut oil just to give you guys some type of starting point but this is definitely a trial and error type of situation so as you guys i have my tincture right here and i'm going to use five milliliters which is a teaspoon of t-shirt and i'm placing it to the side in a condiment disposable condiment container because i wanted to be you know on hand and you guys also saw that i had my liquid lecithin next to me just in case i'm going to need that as well so you want to take your rubber spatula or you can use anything that you're going to throw away i like to use this silicone rubber spatula because i could just wash it off and reuse it now i'm making sure that everything is evenly coated and i'm going to put this in a microwave for 10 seconds and it's going to look like this now i'm just stirring this around to make sure that my oil and gummies are combining together i microwave it again bring it back out stir it around and as you guys can see a little bit you see how they're the gummies in the oil is not coming together so what i'm doing is just trying to stir it a little faster and a little harder just putting a little bit of elbow grease into it to see if it's going to combine together and once it does as much as i would like for it to at this point i'm going to add my tincture to this i only add a half of the teaspoon into this at this time because you can always add more you really can't take it away so that's why it's super important to do this in small batches so you won't gotta worry about anything but as you guys can see the oil really did combine well with this so now i'm going to go ahead and add that t-shirt and do the same steps stir it around kind of be careful because it will splat it out okay y'all see what i'm saying i told y'all it'll splat out and that's nothing but my tincture splatting out honey that's why i'm like uh um let me let me try to put you back on in there girl then i'm stirring it around again just just to make sure that it is fully incorporated because if you do not do this you will have it will be set like oil and vinegar separate yeah this that's exactly what this will be baby your gummies will be to the right and your tincture will be to the left so you want to definitely make sure that it's fully incorporated microwave it again then you're going to place it in your ziploc bag or your piping bag remember this ziploc bag is already all uh down so i'm trying to give you guys a good angle but this is hot girl i'm like oh i'm about to stop the camera this is hot so you want to go ahead and pour that into there i use i try to use my rubber spatula to get the rest of it out but do what you can because it will kind of become you know it'll cool down a little fast so you will be working very quickly boo boo so once you get that together you're going to just whatever side you're going to cut it out you're going to cut it away from your workspace okay i cut it on the ground so you're going to cut it away from your workspace line a little bit of nerves just a little bit unless you want it real thick to the bottom of this pan and we're going to pipe on our gummies [Music] [Music] so you guys i am starting off with a thin layer i like to use at least when it when i like to make beans nerd robes i'm showing you guys how to make one and a half so with the measurements and things that i will put in the description box to my preference it makes one long nerd rope and kind of like um a quarter of one as well so what i'm doing now is i'm just going ahead and piping out my gummies and once i get done piping out the gummies i'm gonna take some additional nerd rope and sprinkle them on top of the gummies so they can have gummies on both sides i um really do this as a preference when it comes to how many nerds i'm actually putting on the rope so like i said this is really trial and error for some people you guys gonna have to figure out what what you like and what works best for you [Music] so all of those nerd roasts that you put on the side or if you're using a new box you're just going to go ahead and sprinkle as many nerves on this as you want to help you out you kind of want to make sure that all of the gummy is covered and go to your next step [Music] so [Music] all right so now you want to just go ahead and put your nerd roads in the refrigerator for several hours and once they harden up you're going to come back to them [Music] all right so now that it's been several hours i'm going to get my packaging my flat irons i don't use them on my head but i should use them for this okay and i get my nerd rose as you guys can see that it was covered up so you don't have to worry about anything getting on them [Music] now this is why it's super important to spray down that aluminum foil you guys see how easy they're coming out of here i'm definitely being gentle because i don't feel like anything cracking breaking or anything like that or in between boo-boos so you see how easy they're coming out but i'm just plopping them out ever so gently and now once i plop them out i'm going to put them on the cardboard that every nerd rope come with and i'm just going to place it on there and we're going to go ahead and package them so that's just what i like to do [Music] so now what we're going to do is i put them on my cardboard liners i'm going to flip them over so that the cardboard is facing up and i'm going to get the two ends of oh sorry you guys then we're going to get the two ends of the aluminum foil kind of put them together where where nestle had the glue already there so i'm just going to line them up as even as i can and we're going to heat seal them with our flat irons with my flat iron they go from like a one to a five and i believe i have them on a a two maybe a three i just want them to get hot enough so when my hand touch it my hand is not burning and i can kind of just like close it all together so heat sealing something together is really really easy you guys and that's just pretty much it you just heat seal them together and you will be all done with your diy infused nerve bros thank you guys so much for watching this video if you guys want to see any other type of infusion definitely put a comment down below and i really do appreciate you for watching this video i it means a so much so here go the little small ones that i did as well now this one i'm going to just do the same thing that i did with the longer one i'm just going to cut the nerd box so it fits this size you know what i'm saying so or you could just put them in your odorless airtight containers but you guys see how i have the little miniature one right there in front and that's pretty much all you do sorry for the noise you guys brandi and devin are outside playing tug of war with a stick yeah yeah yeah talk to you guys on my net video", "2lsXC-BADyY": "- Nate started taking\nmedication for autism when he was around five years old. As Nate was getting into high school, the aggression levels just really started spiraling out of control. He randomly started running\ninto other classrooms, punching people for nothing. It took four adult men and\nhandcuffs to bring him down to the ground, cuff him and restrain him. At that time, he was taking\n18 pills every single day. And it wasn't even helping. I started researching the\nmedical marijuana states. We were able to come to California. I remembered seeing the\nbig neon cannabis leaf in the window, I'm like, \"Well\nthat's gotta be where we have to go.\" (laughs) (upbeat music) - [Interviewer] Why don't you\ntell me a little bit about your family, you have three kids. - Okay, my name is Jenni Mai. I have three sons on the autism spectrum. Each child is of course so\ndifferent, like any other child, and as far as them being on\nthe spectrum, Nathan is what is considered to be at\nthe very severe end. And rather than trying to\nfind the right medication, they just gave him more\nand more and more of it, and that was really the\nonly solution they had. I did not want him being\nchemically restrained in a bed, being (crying) taken care of by strangers. I'm sorry. I had come across this little video clip of a young boy who was just\nrepeatedly punching himself in the head. - [Reporter] 11 year old Alex\nEkels is severely autistic. His self-destructive\nbehavior brought on by-- - And it caught my attention because it was something that Nate had done. His parents were talking\nabout giving him some kind of an oil. I was confused, because it\nsounded like it was some kind of a marijuana derivative,\nand I was actually shocked and maybe even a little bit disgusted. - [Reporter] And after a\nfew months of treatment, the Ekels say they saw\na dramatic improvement. - Within just a few\nminutes of this boy taking the oil orally, he was\nsmiling, he was calm, and he wasn't hurting himself\nanymore, and I'm like, \"Wait, what just happened there?\" (laughs) I watched it a few more times, and I was completely\nshocked and desperate. - At that point, Jenni\nand her family just moved from Wisconsin to Missouri. Two states where getting pot\nlegally for really any reason is super difficult, but particularly medical\ncannabis to treat autism. Currently only 12 states include autism as a qualifying condition. Five other states and\nthe District of Colombia are considered autism friendly, meaning doctors can\nrecommend medical cannabis for debilitating conditions. So that leaves 33 states\nwhere you can't access medical cannabis to treat autism at all. - I was raised in the Nancy\nReagan \"Just say no\" era. - Say no to drugs, and say yes to life. - I would have never in\nmy life considered this to be a medicine, but I\nbasically told my husband, \"We have to try that.\" - Like most illicit drugs, the scientific and medical research of\nmarijuana has been challenging. But the tide appears to be turning. The first large scale\nclinical trials underway in Montefiore medical\ncenter in New York City. And it may be the key to\nunlocking access to treatment for children with autism, nationwide. Dr. Eric Hollander is leading that study. - I've been involved in research\ndeveloping new therapies and treatments, in\nautism spectrum disorders for about 30 years, and there's a big need to develop treatments for the\npoorer symptoms of autism. - This study focuses on a new\ncompound called Cannabidivarin or CBDV, it's an extract from\nthe cannabis plants similar to CBD, it doesn't include THC, the psychoactive drug that gets you high, and what Jenni uses to treat Nate, but it's the first step\nto studying cannabis to treat autism. - This particular\ncannabinoid has some effects on some of the underlying mechanisms that we think are essential to autism. The problem behaviors,\nthe destructive behaviors, and also in some of the\ncompulsive behaviors, or repetitive behaviors or\nperseverative behaviors, so it gets at a key mechanism\nthat we think is important. - There is reason to be optimistic. This new CBDV based drug is similar to one that's already been approved by the FDA to treat a severe form of\nepilepsy that shares some of the same symptoms that\nDr. Hollander is studying. This new research could\nhelp cement what has largely been anecdotal support of\nusing cannabis to treat autism. But while that research is\nongoing, parents like Jenni are moving to states that\nhave more lax marijuana laws. For Jenni and her family, that\nmeant packing up everything and moving all the way across the country. That decision may sound\nextreme, but for Jenni and Nate, it's been worth it. Their lives have been transformed since first visiting a dispensary. - We got home, and he\ntook a hit immediately. We got this one. - [Nate] Okay. - And within, not even five minutes, it was just like a light switch. He was happy, and just kind\nof looking around like, he had never seen the world\nin that way and he was smiling and looking at me, and\nI just knew right away, 'cause nothing acted that\nquickly or that positively ever. - Jenni has learned a lot since moving her family out to California. There she joined forces\nwith fellow mom, Ronda, to start the non-profit\nWhole Plant Access For Autism. Now it's a team of moms\ndedicating their lives to helping other families\nnavigate the challenges that come with getting cannabis\nfor their autistic kids. - I feel like a lot of people\nthat come to our booth, someone in their lives has\nbeen touched by autism, and they don't know that\nthis is an option for them. Other times we get people that you know, come to us after the event, they email us or they find us on social\nmedia and they want to learn. And that's kind of what we're\nabout, we're about educating. - We decided to take a\ndrive out to Joshua Tree. I had him vape and take an edible right before we left the house. He saw that I saw taking\npictures and most of the other pictures that I've\never taken of him in his life, it was kind of a vacant stare,\nhe wouldn't really look, he wouldn't really smile, and\nhe ran over in front of me and sat down. He sat there and he posed for a picture, like everybody else would\nin a situation like that. (sniffs) And I just, I'm like, \"That's it. That's basically his birth picture.\" You shouldn't have to go\nthrough the whole gamut of medications and side effects\nand long-term consequences of some of those side effects\nin order to get to it.

you an extra potent honey recipe today and i'll show you ways to utilize it to get full advantage out of everything so we're going to make some honey then we're going to take the excess and make some honey infused coconut oil and then after that we're left with like a little taffy-like substance that we're going to make some candy with this video is really in-depth i like to usually make my videos pretty quick so you can get the gist but i wanted to try this one just to break it down deep dive for you so you can learn from me as i'm learning throughout the process so come on with me this recipe is sure to get you buzzing so let's dive into the hive let's get infusing my friends we're going to be using an ounce and a half a shake one ounce of flour you could play with the ratios that you're feeling some organic unrefined coconut oil already infused for the extra kick some raw unrefined honey as well as some bee pollen there naturally occurring lecithin to act as an emulsifier and then we'll be using our liquid sunflower lecithin as well to emulsify you're going to need a cheesecloth a strainer a french press like we're going to be using today as well and i'll show you how we're going to use these later in the video the next step here is going to be the decarboxylation process we're going to break down our bud here the ounce at least that wasn't broken down cover it with some foil here and then we're going to go ahead and put it in the oven 240 degrees for 40 minutes you can play with it 220 for an hour you could do 250 for 35 now we're gonna add the honey i have the crock pot on high and i put the honey under some hot water to make it easier to scoop out we're just going to scoop out a good amount i'm not going to do the whole jar my goal here is to kind of use at least as possible to make the most potent product possible and you could also use a double broiler here might be even a little better because you're not going to get the heat directly on the honey so feel free to use that double broiler or you could use the levo too now i'm going to go ahead and add our pre-infused coconut oil it does not have to be infused the coconut oil is just another fat here to help the thc bind to so we can get that potent product and we can make sure we're sucking out all that goodness to make our edible hit hard did about a tablespoon and a half there and the cool thing about this is we know how strong it is because i actually infused this batch with the levo2 which is really convenient like i said you could use it for this recipe as well but then i checked it here with the t-check 2 potency tester that helps me know how strong my product is when i'm making it highly recommend i'll drop a link below if you want to check out the t-check too i'll also put a link for the levo as well links for other videos everything down below so 3.2 milligrams per milliliter we're looking at about 47.7 milligrams per tablespoon so yeah you can do the math we did about one and a half there we'll end up adding a little more here for about two tablespoons total maybe a little more let's go ahead and add a couple scoops of this bee pile in here the bee pollen like i said is just going to act as an emulsifier with that natural lecithin in it and it's not going to have that taste of like the sunflower even though we're still going to add it we're going to go double here to make sure that this hits right that it's available that it's just gonna be the best honey we can make let's go ahead and add a little nutmeg here we're gonna spice this up today make it like asian spice style honey i'm gonna do a little nutmeg here then we're gonna add a little cinnamon as well it's going to give it that good flavor kind of cover up the flavor of all this cannabis we're using because we're using so damn much two and a half ounces is a lot to infuse with just how much honey we are so this [ __ ] is going to be extra strong now let me show you what it's looking like this is looking tasty it makes me want to make this honey just without butt in it no i'm just kidding we're going to add the bud of course now we already added that um bee pollen let's just add about a teaspoon to a tablespoon of the liquid sunflower lecithin to cook up with the cannabis like i said this is important to have so everything blends together at the end you're going to see some stuff down later in this video i try to make full use of everything i hate any waste when it comes to infusion so i'll show you some tricks that i kind of learned or tried in this video and let me know what you think i'm just curious so we're just going to stir this up here nice and mixed together the crock pot is on low now i had it on high just to heat up quick but we're going to infuse everything on low there is one part where i turn it on warm about two and a half hours in i turn it down let it sit and um you'll see what that's looking like here in a second just added a little more bee pollen trying to get the mixture right and this video is just really in depth very thorough i do a lot of videos that are just a couple minutes but i wanted to bring you something that's more well-rounded something that can help us both learn more when we're making crazy good edibles add a little star knees in there give it that flavor next part let's go ahead and add that bud that we had decarb the two and a half ounces in our case play with it in your case maybe you could go a lot less if you just want something that's not as potent you could use a concentrate you could do whatever you're feeling here or you could just have an infused coconut oil mix it with the honey with an emulsifier and you'll be good to go but let's just go ahead and add this d carb bud here in our case the two and a half ounces like i said this is a lot so we're going to go ahead and stir it around and we're going to have to end up adding a little more coconut oil and we're going to add a little more honey just to make sure everything's looking good that you know there's a liquid layer over the bud we don't want to burn anything and that's why i was saying the double broiler could be a good method too because it's a lot harder to burn anything in a double broiler or with the levo but i love the crock pot i love the ease of it especially when i'm making such a big batch using two and a half ounces so that's about two tablespoons maybe two and a half we'll say total so that's an extra 100 milligram kick right there which will make this nice like i said it doesn't need to be infused this is just a little way to bring up that thc content a little more let's add some more honey we're gonna infuse this for about three hours total i probably could have gone two i might have gone a little long here to be straight up honest with you but that's what this is all about it's all a learning experience so let's mix it together i'm gonna come back in 30 minutes like i said the crock pot is on low i don't want anything to burn here today so 35 minutes in here you can see it's starting to melt we're getting that liquid there it's got that breaking down and we're just going to go ahead and put the top back on and let it sit i'ma pop back in a little while and uh keep giving it a stir you want to stir it you know as frequently as you like i would say you know every 20 30 an hour i ended up walking away and getting caught up in some editing for like an hour i probably should have stirred it just a little more i'm just trying to be open and honest just to help you make the best recipe possible and this is what it's looking like about two hours in i probably could have stopped it here strained it but what i decided to do at this about two hour mark was put the crock pot on warm i put the crock pot on warm for about 30 minutes just kind of let it sit then i put it back on the low to finish up so we're looking at about that three hours total for infusing and there it is the three hours in you can see it's darkened up it's all infused so i'd play with it you know you could do two hours to four hours i'd recommend i wouldn't go under two hours personally but let me know if you try if you do an hour and a half and you like it drop a comment let me know now the hard thing with honey is that it especially this unrefined honey first let's take everything out here you know the cinnamon the nutmeg etc but the thing with this honey is it's so thick once it needs to be hot to strain properly so we need to do this right away so grab your hot mitt whatever you're using and we're going to put it in the french press to just really press it out of there and get all the honey we can like i said it wants to cool down quickly so we need to make sure we're doing this at a good rate here just scoop it right in there this two and a half ounces here we're gonna press down and just press that honey out and this is like you know you could use whatever method you like you could put it in a cheesecloth and squeeze it with your hands and whatnot but like i said we gotta work here when this is hot so put some nice pressure on there and just push that honey out like i said there's a lot of flour as we know but look at that honey coming to the top strain it again get everything out of the crock pot push it down here in the french press we're just going to repeat this process and get as much honey out as possible like i said it wants to cool off pretty quick so now we're going to add just a little more bee pollen in there help the honey emulsify a little more and then we're just going to stir it up see how it is right there and if it does start cooling down a little bit you can throw it in the microwave just you know 20 seconds real quick help it be a little more liquid there and we're just going to keep stirring that up and there's our honey now you might be saying there's like a lot of other stuff there that's what i always think i'm like well i have all this butt i feel like there's so much probably honey even in there i feel like there's probably thc so now what we're gonna do after this honey here that we're gonna pour up that's just delicious by the way probably my favorite top three you know edibles infusions that i've ever made just put a little more lecithin in there make sure it's all good just a touch and we're gonna take that coconut oil and we're going to make a full batch of the coconut oil with the bud that was already in here i'll show you kind of how we're doing that here in just a second continue to stir up that honey make sure it's all mixed properly there it is our beautiful potent cannabis honey and i'll do a test later so you can see that it's potent i test it and it definitely is potent and i'll give you some good ideas that you can make with it now let's load up our bag here with the two and a half ounces of the flour that we already pushed all the honey out of but as you can see there still looks like there's liquid in there has like that molasses look we just need to heat it back up and then what we're going to do now is take this bag close it up and then we're going to infuse it with the coconut oil that we had see trying to twist it's like impossible and this is still really freaking hot and it's still hard to get the honey out so we're going to take full advantage of this by mixing it in with our coconut oil the coconut oil that we used previously that is already infused so this coconut oil should end up extra potent we're just simply going to add this bag to the crock pot and then add the rest of the coconut oil and we're going to let it infuse today for about two hours stirring every 30 minutes or so since both were already infused we could probably even do it last time we could probably do an hour and it would still be fine but i'm going to do it too just to be safe here and right after we're done infusing let's throw our nut milk or fine cheesecloth bag in the french press and press out all that green goodness right there and then we'll just go ahead and dump that jar back in the crock pot give it a stir get any of the sediment that's on the bottom and then we're going to fine strain it through our fine strainer here and after it goes through all the way here you'll see we're going to add a little bit of that liquid sunflower lecithin to help everything emulsify help that honey combine to the coconut oil and such and then we're going to pour this back into the coconut oil jar i stir it but then i'm going to give it a nice shake try to help everything mix up even better here but what we're going to find or what i found when doing this is that there's still going to be some separation i think it might be because the honey cooked too much or it's just too dense even with the emulsifiers it still wants to separate so we're going to go ahead and strain it through again here for the second time to separate that you can look even on the bottom of it right now it looks like a caramel like thicker caramelly candy substance that's left from the honey you can see the oil draining out right now which is cool but it's still mixed with the honey i'm going to grab a close-up here to show you just what i mean and it still looks like it's mixed together see how that's coming out right there that's the honey mixed with the coconut oil and i just thought this was a cool shot so i grabbed a close-up to kind of show you how the substance is looking and you might be able to see if you look in the fine strainer at the bottom there that's where like the caramel like build up is now we're going to strain it through here for the third and final time i mean you could probably do this to your heart's content but it's starting to get colder anyway when we don't want it to get too cold or it'll just be a pain like i said you can throw it in the microwave if need be but you can look with my fork how i'm moving that kind of caramel-like substance around and i'm really interested to see the potency on this see if it tastes good and see if we can make a good candy here next for this three-part recipe now if you look here at it it looks like see see how it's like caramelly right there really thick nice and i'm gonna i got some ideas here we're about to work on next before we test all three so you can see if you want to make it and we're left with a good amount of infused coconut oil looking a lot more potent but color doesn't tell all so we'll have to test this next here not a crazy amount but still pretty good amount right there start low and kind of see if i feel anything from this let's see what it does i'll come back to you all right so i'd say that amount i took was feeling about like 40 50 milligrams i'm an hour and 42 in i is usually feel most by now i have a feeling it's going to come on a little slower but it's hitting the spot it's nice and then i was asking my roommate he's like dude that shit's good he's like that honey is nice i'm like oh okay man well you tried it he's like yeah he's like uh we made a juice this is a good idea so they what they did is heat up a little water put some of that honey in there stir it up add it to the juice and then ice it and they said it hit the spot had them feeling good last night so i would say overall recipe is a success but we're still yet to try [Music] um this the uh what i did with the second recipe we're going to try this next and then i have this here the honey that kind of toffee like substance that i'm going to roll some stuff out and try to make like a candy with like a cow tail that candy is kind of my inspiration for the look and feel of that so overall honey is a success so far and uh hits the spot and hits good got me buzzing right all right now time for the candy experiment let's take out this honey caramel-like substance roll it out with the wax paper and then we're going to go ahead and just add our can of sugar that we have on the outside so it's not sticky and giving it a little extra potency let's slice it up these are looking like little sugary tootsie rolls now the question is how are they all right so they've been sitting for about a week so they flattened up but here are these little like honey candies let's give them a taste tastes like [ __ ] to be honest with you we'll see if one works i don't even want to eat another i'm honestly not going to eat these other ones unless it hits really hard but full transparency this is not legit the honey was delicious and hit hard the coconut oil hit hard this tastes really bad i usually don't care much about taste but this tastes pretty bad all right so it's about an hour or so later from that little honey candy that tasted like [ __ ] now i was talking trash on it but i am feeling it i'd say right now it feels like what i'd usually take maybe like a 20 milligrams it's not super heavy but it could still kick in a little more here but not taste good not taste good let's do a little recap though [ __ ] it so those were an experiment and still eat them but kind of failed because it tastes pretty damn bad the coconut oil was a success put this in a smoothie did like a t in between teaspoon tablespoonish hey good should have recorded that i think i said i was going to but i'm doing a video every day so i got to get more out this one's taking a while this is an in-depth video and then of course the honey come some recipes with this for you um do like a simple syrup that you can put in any drink really etc and yeah so recipe was worth it it's taken some time this video's taken a long time and i'm looking at this too this uh ghee butter double dose that i did in the brownies or double those brownies this is the butter here and now that i say that too there was something else that i wanted to mention in that video and that was that if you wanted to and what i would do next time i was just trying to do it quick once again is i would have put some water in there when i was cooking it you can do this in any butter recipe even if you're using a crock pot or whatever and it's going to help separate the chlorophyll and all that other plant material from there so you can have a more clean tasting product although the brownie still did taste really good i will say that for sure um yeah thanks for hanging out i hope you like this in-depth video um but like i said i'm trying to do something new here i've done a bunch of like shorter ones and stuff but never one quite like this that's this in depth so i hope it finds you well um and i hope you're having a good 2021 so far like i said i'm doing a video a day trying to go extra hard and uh just trying to bring you dope content if you want to make this recipe hopefully i can help you you know you can and if you make it you can help me drop a comment below let me know if you tried something maybe you did something different so you were left with something else like maybe you turned the honey into something really cool just let me know drop a comment below and uh oh winded walking up the stairs sitting down but thanks for chilling guys always good to have you here you", "INSqIJDiBFI": "welcome to episode 3 of mmm medical edibles my name is chef Tania Nicol chef and culinary nutritionist well no [ __ ] today we'll meet my favorite Chocolate Chunk cookies yes I'd like a chocolate chip cookie those little chocolate chips just won't do so I like to make it chunky me today's episode is sponsored by backbone and also the marijuana crime drama a sea of green check it out fully loaded on our YouTube channel you can also get it on DVD shut up and take my money now if you're like me chocolate Aulick I like to use chocolate chucks I like my chocolate today's recipe will be infused with Keith's very commonly on hand for most smokers usually collected at the bottom of your grinder you want to keep it in an airtight container I keep mine in a mason jar and keep it away from the light I like to go to the light no keep is one of the easiest ways to get THC into your edible if you're like me you probably have a lot you want to decarboxylate the Keith I am so confused right now it's just THC a and you need the heat to activate it just like you would when you're rolling your weed in the joint and you light that first hit got a big enough joint there right you need the heat to get high and we want to get high want to pre-heat your oven to 300 degrees so in order to decarboxylate the key you're going to use an oven safe Bowl we're going to use some parchment paper it's contained in the parchment paper which makes it easier and I've already pre-measured my two grams of Keith and I'm just gonna put it right in here with this piece of paper and you want to spread it as evenly as you possibly can to put it in the middle right you want to set the timer for seven minutes you want to allow your Keef to completely cool before adding it to any of your recipes a good rule of thumb is D carb your Keith before gathering your ingredients that way it'll have enough time to cool by the time you need it mmm smells delicious for this recipe we're going to use two cans of Keith two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour a teaspoon of salt a teaspoon of baking soda three quarter cups of granulated sugar 3/4 cups of PAP dark brown sugar one teaspoon of vanilla extract two sticks of unsalted butter softened and two eight now let's get to baking in order to make the cookies you want to pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees we're gonna add the softened butter the granulated sugar the dark brown sugar and the vanilla extract along with the key in the mixing bowl carbs wise it's gonna set me back don't even give a [ __ ] we're gonna add a teaspoon of kosher salt you spilled the salt and a teaspoon of baking soda and then you just want to gently mix it we're gonna take the butter and put it right in the mixing bowl now we're gonna add 3/4 cup of granulated sugar mm-hmm that must be the sugar oh gold that's gold the dark brown sugar you'll probably need a spatula for this one since it's tightly packed yes and a teaspoon of vanilla extract [Music] hold your parchment paper and add the kief to the mix the great thing about parchment paper is that the kief doesn't stick to it now we're gonna cream the butter the sugar the vanilla extract and the keith's in our stand mixer or you want to touch the mixing bowl to the stand make sure it locks in place and you're gonna use your whisk attachment to make the cookies you want to blend the ingredients well until it forms a nice creamy mixture turn it off halfway and make sure you scrape the sides of the bowl we don't want to lose any of that swipe swipe swipe swipe swipe swish [Music] now we're gonna add the eggs one by one if you recall from the brownie episode we do it one by one in case there was a bad egg then we don't ruin the whole mix she was a bad egg [Music] you also want to make sure you scrape all of this down when you add the eggs to make sure everything gets well combined add the mixture with the flour baking soda and salt after that comes the chocolate chucks hmm you know what I need a little chocolate pick-me-up make sure you lower the bowl when you add the flour you want to start the mixer off slow so that the flour doesn't go flying everywhere [Music] scrape the sides of the bowl so you make sure you get all the flour into the mixture now it's time to add the chocolate chunks [Applause] waiting for cookies now it's time to portion the cookies make sure you clean off the whisk we don't want to lose any of this yummy goodness you can eat that you can use a small scooper or a table spoon whatever you have at home you want to use an ungreased cookie sheet or baking sheet or like I use parchment paper you want to have enough space around the edges for the cookie to spread please I'm gonna need you to spread I'm gonna try to get a good amount of the chocolate chunks along with the cookie mixture that way you ensure that all the cookies have chocolate chunks in them and the last ones aren't just sugar cookies once you've portioned out all your cookies depending on how small or how large you make them you can figure out how much THC is in each serving plugging that back in he takes the derivative and he solves the equation crowd goes wild it's also secondary Tomich THC percentages in your Keef again if you smoke high grade weed your THC should be at higher levels and if you smoke that schwag who does that then you're probably closer to the 20% mark we have a thousand milligrams of THC in this recipe we've made 43 cookies with two grams of keith's giving us a total of 23 milligrams of THC per cookie I have five numbers sitting all around me here we'll put these in that 375 degree oven for nine to eleven minutes until they're golden brown once they're golden brown will allow them to cool for two minutes on the stove and then move them over to a baking cooling rack cookies it's not that sniffing it's not for you let them cool on the stovetop for two minutes and then move them to a wire rack to completely cool now that the cookies have cooled on the stovetop for two minutes we'll move them on the cooling rack for them to completely cool once the cookies have completely cooled you can store them in an airtight container leave them on your countertop or put them in the freezer the last longer thank you for watching episode 3 of new medical edibles here you have it our chocolate chunk cookies made with Keith at 23 milligrams per dosage

"GopidLYktQA": "and in our Health Alert tonight nine students in Florida hospitalized after eating marijuana infused candy apparently a student inadvertently brought the THC candy to school mistaking the product for a popular sour candy our chief health editor dr. partha nany joins us now with more on what happened and how those kids are doing now doc thanks Alan well first of all the students injuries were not life-threatening the kids were between ages 10 and 12 and were sent to the ER because they were having stomach pains but this is still a warning for parents who have edible marijuana products in their home if the packaging and the candy or treat inside resembles any products that kids are familiar with then they're more likely to see it as normal food and be tempted to eat it unfortunately these types of accidental poisonings are on the rise so dr. nany why does food prompt more overdose incidents well Glenda edibles often have several times the recommended dose of THC now t-h-e is this psychoactive ingredient in marijuana yet the edibles take a longer time to kick it me that you won't feel the effects right away so oftentimes people end up eating even more of the drug as for kids they can experience severe effects like trouble breathing loss of coordination altered perceptions panic paranoia and heart problems all bad things all bad things for sure doc so when kids overdose what are the long-term effects super important question Alan and honestly I don't have a good answer for you because acute marijuana exposure on children has not been systematically studied so there's no research or science findings regarding the full effects so it's super important that anyone who has kids in their homes keep edibles and all types of marijuana products out of reach and out of sight they should also be kept in child resistant packaging that also contains the the way so that it seals it conceals the contents rather so it can't be seen and please don't consumes the edibles in in front of the kids because we need to keep them safe we do dr. Nandi that's great advice thank you for joining us and if you a question or health concern for the good doctor email him dr. Nandi at ask dr. Nandi dot-com or send it to us on Facebook or Twitter we'll get it right to him", "Tjqix5Vmy8s": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to the dude gross today I'm gonna be showing you what I've been doing a lot lately and that's making gummies with the magical butter machine there's pretty much two steps making the oil and then making the gummies so yeah hang out take a look to get started we need an infused oil coconut oil is whatever researched it would be the best for gummies so you basically need coconut oil cannabis soy lasts 10 or sunflower less 10 and that's all you need to get your your infused oil started there's a couple different ways to infuse your oil I went with this magical butter machine which I will link in the description and that's pretty much just set it and forget it kind of set up the diet on the first thing that we need to do is D carve our cannabis I'm going to use about an ounce of trim and D carb that going into the oven in 250 degrees for about 30 to 40 minutes what that does is actually breaks down the THC a and converts it to THC a psychoactive drug in cannabis it's an extremely important step to do if you don't do that before making your oil you're probably gonna have a much weaker soil too in future comes with the recipe for the magical butter machine is 2 cups of oil per 1 tablespoon of Weston so the sunflower lustin I had 2 tablespoons of soy Allah southern flower less attendant with 2 cups of coconut oil and then all the 1 ounce of d carb cannabis coconut oil has a melting point of 76 degrees so if it's cooler than that where your kitchen is it's gonna be hard so you basically just gotta put it over a saucepan or put it in some hot water and then it will melt right up so you can actually use the oil and the magical and that's it oils easy just take it out strain it and then you have your infused oil let's get to making the actual gummies for the recipe I'm going to show you here we're gonna use 1/2 cup of infused oil 1 6 ounce box of jell-o whatever flavor you like a half cup of water and three packs of this Knox gelatin I also put in about a half of a teaspoon or tablespoon of the sunflower less than two but it acts as a multiplier and makes it a the gummy bears a lot more firm and not oily after that would just mix together everything as the e kicks up and I like to go out a medium high heat until it gets to like a little rolling boil and once it hits that point I just continue miss mixing it and then take the heat back down to low pretty much with one or two on your dial and you are pretty much good to go after that point you don't want to pour into your molds too quickly if you do it when it's still really hot you get a lot of spillover so having it harden up just a little bit really helps out there's two ways of getting into your molds these little droppers that come with all these silicone molds I'll link that in the description as well or you can just put it into a like horror cup thing and just pour it directly into the molds - depending on how big the molds are sometimes that's an easier way [Music] once we have oliver molds filled we just put the silicone molds into the freezer for about 20 to 30 minutes might take an hour in the fridge but either way works then take them out the freezer and pop them right out some people say use some cooking spray on the silicone molds I did that once but they kind of came out oily so the first ones I used I didn't like that they were kind of coated in oil I kind of fixed that by putting them into some sugar and then into a jar just kind of sugar coated I'm shook it up and let them breathe for a little while in a few days they were okay generally I would say after that I did not use any kind of cooking spray on the molds and they still came out pretty easy so I don't think who can spray isn't nearly as important as some other people might and that's it we have gummies I like to let them breathe a little bit where because they do kind of have a bit of an oily texture to them they still are firm they're fine outside of the fridge but I like to just let them out on some wax paper in the fridge for a few days and they just kind of dry up and are a lot better texture after a couple days of curing I just put in some baggies I leave them in the fridge but you don't really have to they're good a room temperature yeah we're good to go after that pretty easy stuff you can get really creative too like don't just follow this recipe or whatever are the recipes you want I mean instead of water use orange juice in a pineapple flavored gelatin mix up your oil use the stronger the oil the better if you can use the less of it that's great you're just basically adding that cannabis infused oil into an already like a gummy recipe so the more coconut oil you add to it the worse the taste is I would say but yeah get creative with it have fun with it and yeah get weird that's it for today let me know if you have any questions or comments or anything I love talking to you guys here and what you guys do what I might be doing dumb or what you guys got that's uh it's cool that I don't even know about so yeah till the next time take care", "LHJD_GFGkrc": "pot weed bud brass whatever you call marijuana it can produce a euphoric high that comes from one main chemical Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol or THC THC is found in resin produced by the leaves and buds of the cannabis plant and when it's introduced into the human body it has psychoactive or mind-altering effects THC is structurally similar to the naturally occurring brain chemical Ananda by an and amide is what's called an endogenous cannabinoid and it acts as a neurotransmitter sending chemical messages between nerve cells throughout the nervous system and because THC mimics the structure of an and amide it's able to travel through the body and alter these brain communications affecting regions of the brain that are linked to pleasure memory thought sensory perception movement and more the effects of THC can vary between people many experience a pleasant euphoria or relaxation because THC activates the brain's reward system

of months with a draft law already on the table according to one leading legal expert it could all happen very quickly i can see by the committees that i am part of it everyone pushing that it will be done we have already the draft you know it's very fast that you have a draft that all the officers in the in the governments are agree about it the government just announced that it would also approve the use of cbd one of the key ingredients of cannabis in everything from cosmetics to food to top it all off last week the united nations decided to remove marijuana from its list of quote-unquote world's most dangerous drugs where it had been classified since 1961. all the regulations are going to change from march in the whole world but we are going to be the first like the cannabis industry also we are going to be open country to cbd's and 0.3 a thc a lot of things going to happen here but not medical if legalization goes as planned people over the age of 21 will be allowed to use cannabis and to purchase it at special stores smoking in public places however will still be forbidden it could take up to a year for the new laws to take effect but israel's cannabis industry is not waiting for the green light in fact they're already starting to strategize for the future we're ready for tripling our size at the moment that it's ready intellicanna is a cannabis cultivator that grows between 5 to 10 tons of medical cannabis each year the company uses a special lighting technology that imitates natural sunlight its system is set to optimize growing conditions yona levy believes the recreational market would inject billions of dollars into the israeli economy there's a estimate of roughly seven to nine billion shekels every year on the illegal market okay that part that's going to become legal now add to that the fact that a lot of people when it's illegal they wouldn't want to do it and if it's legal maybe they'll be more open of doing it other companies are also getting ready univo pharmaceuticals in the southern israeli port city of ashkelon is one of the biggest marijuana producers in the country we have the all raw materials we have the many factory we have the distribution centers of course we have all the infrastructure to to go through the all 95 medical centers and the pharmacy stores right away they've also come up with proprietary methods to produce pure cannabis oil that can be used for a wide variety of medical purposes we are going to be in the uk uh and in other markets in in europe right now it all depends on the regulation the israeli regulation and the the import regulation for the for the another market import and export regulations are an extremely tricky legal landscape for any company to navigate israel only gave the go-ahead for cannabis exports a few months ago and importing it could soon be a thing of the past if local farmers have their way import is a it's a big issue we don't want to kill the israeli industry so it's going to be very difficult to import to israel one thing's for sure with legalization fast approaching companies will have to duke it out for a piece of this budding business from israel maya margeet reporting for the media line you", "Nlcr1jd_Tok": "In 1970, marijuana was classified \nas a schedule 1 drug in the United States: the strictest designation possible, meaning it was completely illegal \nand had no recognized medical uses. For decades, this view persisted and set back research \non the drug's mechanisms and effects. Today, marijuana\u2019s therapeutic benefits \nare widely acknowledged, and some nations \nhave legalized medical use or are moving in that direction. But a growing recognition \nfor marijuana\u2019s medical value doesn\u2019t answer the question: is recreational marijuana use \nbad for your brain? Marijuana acts \non the body\u2019s cannabinoid system, which has receptors \nall over the brain and body. Molecules native to the body, \ncalled endocannabinoids, also act on these receptors. We don\u2019t totally understand \nthe cannabinoid system, but it has one feature \nthat provides a big clue to its function. Most neurotransmitters \ntravel from one neuron to the next through a synapse to propagate a message. But endocannabinoids \ntravel in the opposite direction. When a message passes \nfrom the one neuron to the next, the receiving neuron \nreleases endocannabinoids. Those endocannabinoids \ntravel backward to influence the sending neuron\u2014 essentially giving it feedback \nfrom the receiving neuron. This leads scientists \nto believe that the endocannabinoid system serves primarily \nto modulate other kinds of signals\u2014 amplifying some and diminishing others. Feedback from endocannabinoids \nslows down rates of neural signaling. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it slows down behavior \nor perception, though. For example, \nslowing down a signal that inhibits smell could actually make smells more intense. Marijuana contains \ntwo main active compounds, tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, \nand cannabidiol, or CBD. THC is thought to be primarily responsible\nfor marijuana\u2019s psychoactive effects on behavior, cognition, and perception, while CBD is responsible \nfor the non-psychoactive effects. Like endocannabinoids, THC slows down signaling \nby binding to cannabinoid receptors. But it binds to receptors \nall over this sprawling, diffuse system at once, whereas endocannabinoids \nare released in a specific place in response to a specific stimulus. This widespread activity \ncoupled with the fact that the cannabinoid system\nindirectly affects many other systems, means that each person\u2019s \nparticular brain chemistry, genetics, and previous life experience largely determine \nhow they experience the drug. That\u2019s true much more so with marijuana \nthan with other drugs that produce their effects \nthrough one or a few specific pathways. So the harmful effects, if any, \nvary considerably from person to person. And while we don\u2019t know \nhow exactly how marijuana produces specific harmful effects, there are clear risk factors \nthat can increase peoples\u2019 likelihood of experiencing them. The clearest risk factor is age. In people younger than 25, cannabinoid receptors \nare more concentrated in the white matter than in people over 25. The white matter \nis involved in communication, learning, memory, and emotions. Frequent marijuana use can disrupt the development \nof white matter tracts, and also affect the brain\u2019s ability \nto grow new connections. This may damage long-term learning ability\nand problem solving. For now, it\u2019s unclear \nhow severe this damage can be or whether it\u2019s reversible. And even among young people, the risk is higher the younger someone is\u2014 much higher for a 15 year old \nthan a 22 year old, for instance. Marijuana can also cause hallucinations \nor paranoid delusions. Known as marijuana-induced psychosis, these symptoms usually subside \nwhen a person stops using marijuana. But in rare cases, \npsychosis doesn\u2019t subside, instead unmasking \na persistent psychotic disorder. A family history of psychotic disorders, \nlike schizophrenia, is the clearest, though not the only, \nrisk factor for this effect. Marijuana-induced psychosis \nis also more common among young adults, though it\u2019s worth noting \nthat psychotic disorders usually surface in this age range anyway. What\u2019s unclear in these cases \nis whether the psychotic disorder would have appeared \nwithout marijuana use\u2014 whether marijuana use triggers it early, is a catalyst for a tipping point \nthat wouldn\u2019t have been crossed otherwise, or whether the reaction \nto marijuana is merely an indication of an underlying disorder. In all likelihood, marijuana\u2019s role \nvaries from person to person. At any age, as with many other drugs, the brain and body become less sensitive \nto marijuana after repeated uses, meaning it takes more \nto achieve the same effects. Fortunately, unlike many other drugs, there\u2019s no risk of fatal overdose \nfrom marijuana, and even heavy use \ndoesn\u2019t lead to debilitating or life-threatening \nwithdrawal symptoms if use stops. There are more subtle forms \nof marijuana withdrawal, though, including sleep disturbances, \nirritability, and depressed mood, which pass \nwithin a few weeks of stopping use. So is marijuana bad for your brain? It depends who you are. But while some risk factors \nare easy to identify, others aren\u2019t well understood\u2014 which means there\u2019s still some possibility\nof experiencing negative effects, even if you don\u2019t have \nany of the known risk factors.", "BdRgA7K4DcE": "benefits and harms in medical marijuana can be debated but more states are legalizing pot even for recreational use a new evaluation of marijuana's risks is overdue that's the topic of this week's healthcare triage [Music] last year the National Academies of Sciences medicine and engineering released a comprehensive report on cannabis use at almost 400 pages long it reviewed both potential benefits and harms we've talked about benefits before let's focus on the harms cancer the greatest concern with tobacco smoking is cancer so it's reasonable to start there with pot smoking a 2005 systematic review in the International Journal of cancer pooled the results of six case control studies no association was found between smoking marijuana and lung cancer another 2015 systematic review pooled nine case control studies and could find no link to header neck cancers another meta-analysis of three case control studies of testicular cancer found a statistically significant link between heavier pot smoking and one type of testicular cancer but this evidence was judged to be limited because of limitations and the research all of which was from the 1990s there's no evidence or not enough to say of the link between pot use and esophageal cancer prostate cancer cervical cancer non-hodgkins lymphoma penile cancer or bladder cancer there's almost no evidence or not enough to say that pot has any effect on sperm or eggs that could increase the risk of cancer and any children of pot smokers using marijuana while pregnant does pose other risks as we'll discuss in a few minutes heart disease another major risk with cigarettes heart disease isn't clearly seen with pot smoking only two studies quantified the risk between marijuana use and heart attacks one found no relationship at all and the other found that pot smoking may be a trigger for a heart attack in the hour after smoking but this finding was based on nine patients and may not be generalizable lung function it also makes sense to think about the risk of respiratory disease in the short-term after smoking pot a 2007 systematic review found lung function actually improved but these benefits were completely overtaken by evidence that lung function may degrade with chronic use lung function however is a laboratory measure and not necessarily a clinical outcome and what we really care about is lung disease once you control for tobacco use the links between marijuana and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease appear minimal almost no evidence is available to link pot used to asthma impaired driving driving while impaired is a major cause of injury and death in the United States six systematic reviews were considered a fair or good quality by the National Academies and the most recent one pulled three of the others it contained evidence from 21 studies in 13 countries representing almost 240,000 participants for people who reported marijuana use or had THC detected through testing the odds of being involved in a motor vehicle accident increased by twenty to thirty percent to study them this is of course a relative increase and shouldn't be confused with the overall percentage of getting in a car accident which is much smaller regardless driving while impaired is a terrible idea although we have good tests to determine two people are under the influence of alcohol no such tests are currently available for marijuana making enforcement more difficult we did a whole episode on pregnancy effects babies born to women who smoke pot during pregnancy are more likely to be underweight delivered premature and admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit according to a 2016 systematic review but there were no links seen for changes in birth lengths head circumference or congenital malformations there's limited evidence for pregnancy complications for mothers and there's not enough evidence to come in on much else about babies and their outcomes memory and concentration there's moderate evidence from many studies that learning memory and attention can be impaired in the 24 hours after marijuana use there's limited evidence however that this translates into worse outcomes in academic achievement employment income or social functioning or that these effects linger after the pots worn off mental health the possible relationship between marijuana use and mental health is complicated the most recent meta-analysis found that there's a significant connection between heavy marijuana use and a diagnosis of psychosis specifically schizophrenia this mirrored the findings of previous reviews that sought to cover only high quality studies another systematic review highlighted a potentially small but statistically significant link between marijuana use in the development of bipolar disorder heavy users of pot are also more likely to say they have suicidal thoughts what makes this complicated is that it's hard to establish the arrow of causality are people who smoke pot more likely to develop mental health problems or people with mental health problems more likely to smoke pot there's a similar issue when talking about the relationship between using pot and other substances so I'm able see marijuana as a gateway drug leading to other substance user abuse but others and a lot of research see this only as a correlation in which people who are likely to use or abuse substances are more likely to use pot as well secondhand smoke has states legalize the drug for general use more cannabis users feel freed from secrecy they smoke more in public raising worries about secondhand smoke a two-year old study made news recently by arguing that one minute of exposure to pot smoke impaired how vessels responded to blood flow for at least 90 minutes a greater impairment than seen from tobacco this was a study in rats though not of humans out in the world as for the risk of a contact eye the amount of THC detectable in secondhand smoke is negligible almost everyone agrees that children should not use pot but concerns are legitimately raised about whether children might have increased exposure or access after legalization although this issue has not been studied widely it's possible that pot the THC and the metabolites from smoke could have an effect in the developing brains of children these concerns are more applicable to adolescents who use pot regularly however not the accidental ingestion reported in the news once in a while new questions almost all the harms the medical literature focuses on involves smoked cannabis we know little to nothing about edibles and other means of administration nor do we have any consistent manner of measuring the level of exposure bottom line you gotta weigh the pros and cons many of the harms we've discussed are statistically significant and yet they're of questionable significance almost all the increased risks are relative risks the absolute or overall risks are often quite low we haven't focused on the potential benefits especially medical ones here but many people use pot even rationally for benefits they perceive to be greater than the harms we've listed we unquestionably need more research and more evidence of harms may emerge but it's important to note that the harms we know about now are practically nil compared to that of many other drugs and that marijuana's effects are clearly less harmful than those associated with tobacco or alcohol abuse people who choose to use marijuana now that it's easier to do so legally will need to weigh the pros and cons for themselves the electus show really helps if you subscribe or like us right down there well we've got you another good way

disease can it actually cure serious illnesses the reason for thinking it might stems from the fact that the medical use of marijuana has become legal in almost half of all American states and anecdotal evidence has been accumulating that cannabis in oil form can actually reduce cancerous tumors anecdotal evidence isn't enough but pharmaceutical companies are starting human clinical trials Alistair Lee's head has been investigating in California I watch women die every day I watched children bury their moms so I know what is in front of me and I'm doing everything I can to prevent that Serah amento and her family are running out of time she has stage 4 cancer the chemotherapy isn't working and the doctors say there's nothing more they can do left with no options everybody speaks about cannabis oil there's a certain stigma especially being a mother of doing cannabis oil you know everyone looks at it like you're getting high and it's not it's a medical it's it's a natural option that the government's ignoring and I knew I want to live I have to live cannabis has been used as a medicine for millennia nearly half all US states have legalized it for medicinal use research into its cancer fighting properties is limited but the signs are strong enough to get britain's leading cancer research group interested and even trialing cannabis treatments cannabinoids are certainly very interesting molecules and there's a lot of research there's hundreds of papers being published looking at their chemical properties against cancer cells turning that into effective treatments is a long road and certainly it's not going to be the one cure for cancer because nothing is this is how you're able to engage what level of activities going on in your body it's all about scientific proof collecting case studies with medical evidence I have many many thick books of medical records but this is really one that matters Stephanie LaRue says she has proof the impact of taking cannabis oil was the fact that the cancer is gone all the tumors are gone they dissipated in my body with no evidence of metastatic disease they're just gone Stephanie's doctor confirmed to the BBC the tumors had gone despite her opting out of conventional medicine but stopped short of endorsing cannabis oil cannabis works no chemo I only did cannabis and the tumors are gone and the scans I have is evidence and proof of that kind of like what more do you need a lot more according to one of the world's leading oncologists this is chemotherapy so these are natural products you know man who helped cure Lance Armstrong's cancer needs data and real scientific evidence until somebody proves it whether it be the manufacturers who put together a clinical trial whether it be doctors who get government funding to do it or patients who say here my records and let's put it in a medical journal and be transparent with what I had what I was treated with him what my outcome was then until that it's snake-oil again I'm not trying to impede progress or say it's bad but at the same time I don't want people to get false hope so cannabis snake oil or can this plant cure some forms of cancer what is the evidence there have been hundreds of scientific papers published this study came out of the University of East Anglia last year showed that mice with cancer had the tumors reduced using cannabis this the first human tickle trial eight out of nine patients responded but they will died within the time we'd expect despite that there's a long list of charities and research groups that say it's an interesting development it may have a clinical use and now the big pharmaceutical companies are getting involved this huge cannabis garden is in Britain GW Pharmaceuticals is developing drugs from the cannabis plant the latest human trial is a cannabis oil to treat brain cancer we understand how some of these molecules work we have the preclinical evidence and the regulators have given us permission therefore to expose humans in a clinical trial setting at this point in time but for now it's an underground industry a bloke in a backyard with a stick a bucket and a jar of solvent who's making the cannabis oil he wanted to be known only as cell not because the cannabis is illegal in California but because of the flammable materials he's using we then pour the liquid into the pen so this is this is the finished product yes that's the finished product there's about one gram of oil in there and do you think this is a cure the cancer in many instances it is and it can be it depends on the person's particular condition or their state how the cancer is but we've seen thousands and thousands of people get better from using this oil squeeze out at very little and now and then I just and swallow it but to be effective Sarah needs to take a lot more than this and eating a gram a day is too much for many people when you ingest it you get 20% of the medication the properties that actually attack the cancer when you do it rectally you get 70% so you're actually getting more benefit from doing it that way and you don't get high and not only do you not get high there's no sleepiness there's snow there is no side effects it is her only hope but it's also unproven medicine I'll continue doing it until the cancer is gone I believe it's the best option I've seen it work for others and I'm hoping it'll work for me Alice Solis had their and just to reiterate what he reported there is as yet no clinical evidence that shows where the cannabis can reduce or destroy tumors but it's a question that more and more researchers are trying to answer", "V3FF3u0jfRk": "study presented at the November meeting in the American Heart Association grab media headlines before the meeting even started sources like WebMD would have you believing that smoking pot drastically increases your risk of stroke let's see what sources like healthcare triage think about that too the research the study we're talking about today published in the journal stroke reports that marijuana users between 18 and 44 years of age have significantly higher odds of having a stroke than non users using data from a national survey collected by the CDC the authors concluded that recent marijuana users were 82 percent more likely to have a stroke while the risk of more frequent users defined as those smoking 10 or more days per month went up to almost a hundred fifty percent come on a lot of people smoke pot if those between the ages of 18 and 44 were really a grave danger of stroke don't you think we'd be seeing a lot more strokes in this age group feels like I've mentioned relative versus absolute risk you know once or twice but here I go again 80 to 150 percent are the relative risks and since absolute risk is way more applicable in real life that's what we should talk about relatively risky over on Twitter took the time to figure this out for a lot of studies sensationalizing the news including this one and according to his calculations the absolute risk increase of stroke for frequent pot smokers is point five percent zero point five percent we've covered what we know about marijuana use before we did not specifically mention stroke risk in those videos mostly because there's not much evidence to justify it there just aren't a lot of non case control studies focusing on stroke and marijuana use the few that do exist suffer from the same problems mentioned here along with the fact that it can be pretty hard to get honest self reporting of marijuana consumption which is what all these surveys rely on and finally the studies that do exist contradict each other some studies like this one report an association between marijuana use and stroke another study analyzing only male data reported no association between those two factors the current study reported higher use for frequent marijuana users that also reported cigarettes and as the author's point out in their discussion other studies do not report an association between marijuana and stroke once cigarette and alcohol use have been adjusted for so all we can do for now is remind you of what we've said before the level of harm currently associated with marijuana is much less scary than that of other things like cigarettes or alcohol it's likely real meaning greater than zero so take that into account but don't panic we can always use more data especially with changing marijuana laws and more and more people use it and we'd probably need it to be better data especially for it to be newsworthy hey did you like this episode you might enjoy this other episode where we go through all of the harms of marijuana italy's what we know right now you also could like the video down

fastest-growing group,\nincreasing 10 to 15 percent every year. Medical marijuana: Here's\nwhat you need to know. The law: Is it legal? Under federal law, marijuana is\nillegal to sell, possess or use, but 33 states plus D.C.\nnow permit medical marijuana for qualifying patients. Thirteen states have passed laws\nallowing limited-potency cannabis-based products, and\n11 states plus D.C. legalized recreational use. The treatments: What does it\ntreat, and does it work? There is a growing body of\nresearch that suggests marijuana may be helpful for\ntreating certain conditions. >>Kent Hutchison: Not a cure-all. And\nthis is true for cannabis. The evidence base is\nsomewhat limited. The report by the National Academy of Sciences\nfound evidence for pain and for sleep and for nausea and\nmaybe there\u2019s some growing evidence for anxiety, but we are\nstill waiting on more scientific studies to be done. >>Other studies suggest\nthat it could help treat PTSD, manage nausea\nfrom chemotherapy, and ease pain from MS and other\nconditions. Considering the alternatives to\nmarijuana, some doctors hope more research will\nfurther validate  cannabis-based products. >>Peter Grinspoon: With cannabis,\nyou always have to ask, \u201cAs opposed to what else they\u2019d be\nusing?\u201d If they\u2019re using it instead of\nopiates for pain, it's much safer than that. So\nwhile cannabis is not without its harms, and it\u2019s\nnot without its side effects, it's almost always\nsafer than what else you would be using. >>The process: Can a doctor\nprescribe it? State laws vary for medical\nuse, but in most cases a patient would first need to\nvisit a state-certified or trained medical\nprofessional. They can't prescribe\na product or dosage, but can provide formal approval for\nmedical use. >>Scott Gebhardt: A\nphysician has to do a history and a physical\njust like a regular doctor visit and make sure that\nthey have a condition that will qualify them for\ntheir card. >>Typically, a patient would\nthen need to apply to their state registry, which\nwould issue a card that allows them to purchase\nmarijuana at a dispensary, which can offer hundreds of\nproducts with a wide range of effects.

about buying and selling cannabis business licenses now as the industry matures we're seeing a lot of people want to get into the industry we've seen some of the older legacy players maybe even the new people trying to get out as well or trying to sell some of their cannabis business licenses now for whatever reason they're trying to exit that means that there's a marketplace now how do you actually navigate through this marketplace for successful transaction we're going to talk about that and more in this video now if you have any questions or you're looking to sell your cannabis business license and please reach out to greenville CPAs via our website at green growth CPAs com or give us a call at eight hundred 676 right into the presentation hey there and welcome again to our

the large operations doing fifty to a hundred million dollars a year in revenue so we have the ability to help you carve that path towards your success now before we dive into the topic I need to let you know that the information contained in this webinar present a is meant for guidance purposes only and not as professional legal or tax advice and further does not give any personalized legal tax investment or any business advice in general so with that out of the way let's review what we'll cover in today's presentation so first I'm gonna talk a little bit about the cannabis market context and the industry overall and why we're actually talking about this and why this is a very special time in the cannabis industry then we'll review things about buying a license the steps and considerations when you're doing that as well as some deeper dive into buyers due diligence tips and then we'll talk about selling your license in steps and considerations building on that buying portion and then we'll talk about some additional licensing selling tips so first why are we even talking about this well if you look at the current state of the cannabis industry and how we got here right so there was a rush of money that came in in 2015 to 2019 that was a very large period of capital investments people wanted to take advantage of what we call this Green Rush well once you start to get in there you realize there's not really that big of a rush there's a lot of building blocks that need to be laid down first and many cannabis businesses failed or they ran out of cash essentially failing if you have no money you have no oxygen for the business and many of these businesses these cannabis businesses are drowning in debt and they cannot continue to operate they may have gotten all the way through you know licensing and some even got as far as licensing the whole build-out but they couldn't even afford to operate so bankruptcy is not available for cannabis businesses since it's a federal protection and cannabis businesses are illegal under federal law but there is this thing called receivership which we'll cover in our next webinar which is one option for you as a cannabis business operator if you are one of these that are drowning in debt to untie yourself from many of your cannabis business obligations not all of them taxes will not be able to be dropped off in most cases but receivership is a way to sell off your assets including your licenses so in an industry that's got these ever-changing regulations the deeper your pockets the longer you can stick things out and straighten out your business so that you can go forward but where we're at today is that a lot of people overextended themselves if they're with too much debt or they invested too heavily in too many markets and now they need to get rid of assets but what you see is that many assets have depressed values the supply of licenses is going to increase significantly for two factors you have more licenses coming online and then you have people that are exiting the industry for a multitude of reasons and that supply is going up which then depresses down the price of licenses there's also spaces out there real estate where some businesses haven't paid rent in months so you can potentially take over leases when you start to buy these licenses and buy entire business units so this is a buyer's paradise and we have a very small window as a seller to have a great opportunity here so you're seeing new market entrants come in they want to buy licenses you have to strike while the iron's hot while there's still this hype and this excitement around the industry and before supply goes up too much in the number of licenses now what you saw a real-life example of this was that med men started to sell some of their licenses what they did essentially was had a fire sale on the Arizona licenses and their Illinois licenses some of them which mean potentially they can't find cash anywhere else or maybe they want to you know take non-core assets that they don't believe is gonna be the best markets and focus and double down on maybe their California or their New York operations at any rate they had like a fifty or seventy million dollar sale for licenses so it's not just the small operators you're also seeing large operators take advantage of this small window of opportunity to sell licenses at their max value so now that you understand a little bit about the market context and why we're talking about this right now let's talk about buying a license some steps and considerations now these steps are pretty much in the order you want to go but things can be moved around as you progress down you're buying path so first and foremost you want to check local and state regulations because not all licenses can be bought and sold so at the city level certain cities do not allow license transfer an example of this is West Hollywood if you attempt to transfer a license it becomes null and void but there is a possible workaround that I will get to later in this presentation so if you see it's all good at the city level then you go up to your state licensing body and you say alright well can I sell my licenses how do I transfer licenses in California this is called the BCC the beer of cannabis control and first and foremost it's important to understand that state licenses are not transferable or assignable in other words a state license in the state of California is not an asset that a business can just transfer in a sign to another buyer instead the buyer must actually purchase the entity or company that holds the state license for example company X cannot buy a company Y's state license instead company X must buy company-wide the end result is that company X is the owner of company Y which holds that state license now this is why having each license in its own entity is so important so once you do that you're gonna make the transaction you're gonna notify the BCC within 14 days now there's essentially three phases to this process the buyer will call company X takes 80% of company Y with 20% of that remaining equity retained by one of the original owners then again you submit that information to the BCC along with the required live scans and all the things that go along with that and you continue to operate your business while the BCC vets that buyer now phase three of this process is it after the BCC clears the new buyer right the new owner the original owner will be free to transfer the remaining 20% interest to the buyer now upon transfer of that remaining 20% to the buyer the original owner provides a sign written statement to the BCC confirming that they have transferred all of their interest you may say how long does this take there's no hard timeline to when the BCC must complete phase three it could take them two weeks or two months who knows to actually do that vetting of the buyers so it's gonna take a long time I'll talk about this many times throughout the presentation don't expect a quick sale now once you have gone through and saw all right I can sell or transfer some type of license in some capacity in some way you need to double check with the local and state licensing bodies that there are no points against the license for any disciplinary action now typically these actions come in tears in California it's in three tiers now tier one being the least severe tier three being the most some examples of those things are tier one fees not being paid or not complying with any regulations the smaller ones or not confirming the of your clients Tier two is like considered you know things like sale or delivery of cannabis to a motor vehicle or selling to minors and then Tier three this is the most harsh penalties or the most harsh level and these are things like working with non licensed cannabis businesses you know intermingling white market versus black market product or selling returned goods to new customers once you've figured out how many points if none that's better if there are some you know you look at the severity and all the different nuances to how they got into that situation if you want to go forward the next step is going to be researching the legal entity that holds the license now again I brought up earlier we would suggest that you consider having each license in a different entity so you can keep those entities as clean as possible don't try to roll over an entity from a business previously that may have some issues or some baggage that you bring along with it now the things you want to look into are making sure that the state filings are up to date with the Secretary of State statement of information all the things of that nature making sure their fees are paid now also you want to ensure that there are no back debts or any prior obligations now you can look into services that will do this for you there are many of them out there and you want to do this because you will potentially inherit these back debts or prior obligations or all these issues now your deeper due diligence we'll talk about in a moment is where you really really go deep into this but if you can find any public information about issues that's what you really want to do at this step now once you've completed those you want to do an initial financial dive into the operations and ensure that all the back taxes were filed accordingly and accurately now you want to make sure that they actually do 280e tax calculations did they take deductions that they weren't supposed to take did they take things that they were supposed to take things of that nature now this is quite involved and could take some time and you will likely need to engage a cannabis specific CPA or someone that's very intimate with all the nuances to cannabis tax filings now this is where you're gonna have to probably sign some agreements with the seller you know they're gonna exchange some very intimate information about their business so you're pretty far along in the due diligence process at this point and you're gonna want to you know really peel back all their tax filings maybe they might share an income statement or a balance sheet with you as well at this time and we'll talk about that a little bit further in the buyers due diligence slide now if you like what you see through these first four five steps here then what you're gonna want to do is create an LOI so creating an LOI which is a letter of intent to purchase you're going to work with your lawyer to create this LOI and it's essentially a quick high-level term sheet saying alright these are what the terms are of the deal you know barring that we go through all this due diligence and things work out fine or things look right now I'm gonna hit on a few things you want to put into your LOI but this is not a comprehensive list of all the terms so first and foremost you want to put a purchase price on the business now this could be arranged this could be the dollar amount specific it's really up to you how you want to phrases now in 99% of cases as a buyer you want to include an urn out for your seller what an urn out is it refers to a pricing structure that in most M&A deals where the seller must earn part of the purchase price based on the performance of the business following the acquisition this is kind of a lining incentives in making things you know future based not just hey I brought it up to here you know if the business is great and you can see its catapult its growth and there's a lot of good things going on maybe don't take that urn out but at least always ask for that now urn outs are often employed when the buyers and sellers really disagreeing about the expected growth or future performance of the company that they're buying let's just be clear here and we really Frank this is a very common thing in the cannabis industry seller's really think their stuff is worth a lot of money when it actually isn't you know this is just part of negotiating I've made several videos on negotiating and M&A and things of that nature so you can you know watch those videos and get a little bit deeper into that but you know you wanted this essentially structure and say hey if a business hits a certain sales figure then it'll pay out accordingly to that seller lots of different considerations there but in your LOI include at least a purchase price or range then you want to talk about what type of consideration you're going to take as a seller or give as a buyer for that purchase price now is it gonna be stock right is it a bigger company buying a smaller company up we're gonna give that smaller company some stock in the large company is it going to be a - deal is there gonna be some financing and we'll go into this a little bit later about you know stock versus cash you know it could be a combination of stock and cash but I would really say as a seller you want to get as much cash as possible I'll talk about that a little bit later now the next thing you want to include is closing conditions or certainty to close now what this does is spell out specifically what items need to be done to close things like agreements that need to be signed or reviewed due diligence on ABC or XYZ appraisals things of that nature so you know exactly what needs to be done to bring this deal to a close and then as a buyer you may ask for what we call an exclusivity window if you can get it do it and what that says pretty much is that hey we get 45 days to make this happen don't shop this deal around to anybody else we have the first right of refusal to make this deal happen you know kind of paring onto that exclusivity window is having a target closed date and what this does is makes everyone move a little bit faster this can be 15 to 45 days after all closing considerations are met or whatever you think is good for you and the team and everyone involved in this the next step after you created your LOI is doing that due diligence as a buyer now you're gonna start off with doing a deep dive on the financials the people of the business the agreements the licenses in many other things now you do this pretty much to prove the legitimacy of the business that you're buying and the word of the people that said hey this is like true and this is true and that's true and this is what it actually is going on you want to make sure that that's actually true okay now for taxes if you do find anything phishing or simply just to protect yourself as a buyer from audits later down the road because we know that they are coming this is a new industry what you want to do is get an indemnification of tax liabilities for prior acts so for example if you get audited for a past year before you own the business that potential tax ramifications will lie with the seller you may not always get it but you should at least ask for it and to explain further on this deep dive with the financials people's agreements and all that now I already covered a lot of due diligence items in our M&A due diligence video so you can look that up just google M&A due diligence for cannabis businesses you'll see our video up there it's got a nice orange bar you can see the word due diligence on it check that out it goes to all the different items in why each item is important in what to look for what are some red flags orange flags yellow flags things of that nature so really watch that video it really pluses out the whole due diligence process but additional items that you want to look at when you're doing a license purchase for sure and if I didn't really cover them in that video I wanted to spell them out explicitly right now you really want to do a background check on all of the owners right now cannabis yes it started with what we call the legacy players or ex drug dealers now you want to make sure you're not working with extremely shady people things you know they had any major criminal charges is there anything fishy that comes up in their background have they been part of any kind of fraud cases are there any you know what's going on with these people you can do a formal background check quick google searches things like that then you also want to look into the banking and merchant processing for the business you know go and interview the bank see how the relationship is with the bank and the business called the merchant processor make sure there's no issues on that end things you want to look for is the deposit frequency are they doing it once a month once a week twice a week every two weeks what amount of Lee depositing what are the terms for the banking arrangement you know are they getting charged one point for all their deposits up to a certain amount and then higher as it escalates for higher deposits is it four point six points two points find out what those terms are because you want to try to keep that banking relationship intact if you don't already have one on your own now one of the most important things for a retail business if you're buying a license is to do what we call a trade area analysis now what you're gonna look at is the demographics of who make up that trade area and the amount of traffic either car traffic and foot traffic there's a lot of companies out there that can do this traffic analysis for you or that have the data you can just you know buy or peel into and create that and just really look at some good statistics about what is your potential grab and market share or potential market that you can grab at right it's called total addressable market Tam another one to build on to this is the competitive analysis you want to look at the other businesses in your area the licensed businesses as well as the unlicensed businesses you have to understand no matter how many regulations and how law enforcement officers the black market still rules cannabis on a dollar-for-dollar compared to the regulated legal market now you also want to consider how many licenses are in the area and how many licenses are going to be coming up for the next two years three years one year right we call these licenses that are coming online and typically cities have a rollout plan or states have a rollout plan you know we're gonna be adding another hundred retail licenses twenty-five delivery licenses eight more manufacturing ten more distribution or whatever it's going to be you know really look into that and once you find all the currently operational businesses you want to do what we call window time and essentially sitting out in front of the business and count the number of patrons that go in and out of the business this tells you all right they're doing 35 transactions an hour or 75 transactions an hour or maybe 200 an hour you want to go into each of those businesses and see what the setup is potentially you might see hey they use this POS system or that or you know you look at some of the things that are going on the business to explain the anomalies in the window time data so if you see one dispensary is putting a lot more people through the actual business per hour then go inside see what's going on see what the operation looks like compared to a shop that's relatively the same size that does maybe half the amount of people is it that they have bad you know weed maps reviews or is it that they have just better processes and you can kind of glean what those processes are so you can integrate them into your business once you buy them now some key statistics when you're looking at this competitive analysis would be population per dispensary now it's like alright how many people are there per dispensary in this market you want to do it at a one-mile radius a three mile radius and the zip code of the business this pretty much tells you how many people are being served by each dispensary in the area and then lastly you want to dig down into the brand relationships who are they working with do they own any brands are there gonna be any relationships that you lose because there are you know it's best friends and homies that work together and they get great deals because they've known each other in the industry for ten years or five years or three years you really have to look into them because some of the numbers you may find in your financial due diligence you say wow the cogs are really low for this top shelf high grade cannabis then you buy the business in the person that was selling that cannabis to the business says hey I'm not giving you that deal that was a sweetheart deal for Frank I like Frank I've been working with him for three years I'm not gonna do that same thing for you and a little bit more just peeling down into the terms of the deal is it's EOD do you get 15 days 30 days to pay things back things of that nature now this applies to you know all the different types of businesses great yeah as a retail person you may be looking at other things or a manufacturer you're not looking at you know foot traffic but just consider and look at some of these things and how they can potentially apply to your business that you're buying as a new cannabis business operator or as someone who's expanding their portfolio now that we've talked about buying I want to talk about selling your license in additional steps and considerations so again first starting off with the local and state regulations with the city go ahead and see hey does the city even allow me to sell my license right if it doesn't like the West Hollywood example then maybe you don't want to open up in that city so if you're a pre licensed and you don't have a place and you're just kind of in the beginning stages maybe look at some of the local regulations say alright well if we intend to exit the industry in five to seven years are the regulations good so that we can sell our license or sell our business later down the road now you know we already talked about the BCC it's all those three different phases just look into that for your particular state when you're selling your license are there any limitations or things that must be done before you saw your license now let's expand the scope in these steps of selling your license there's a few things as a cannabis business operator that you want to really know so you want to know why you are selling the license how much you want for that license and you know how did you get to that number you really need to know how you got to that number not just some pie-in-the-sky there has to be some meet you know under this whole thing and then what you're going to do with the proceeds because it's gonna dictate some of the deal terms strategic buyers and things of that nature so there are many wise to selling your cannabis business or you just want to focus on a specific vertical maybe you have a cultivation and a retail space and you just want to get out of retail and you want to folk and triple down on cultivation that's one way or you just want to get out of medical and go only to recreational so you're selling off while your medical licenses are you exiting a state due to certain tax reasons maybe you're like wow the state here is not very good for cannabis businesses let's just go to another state or cut this arm off and focus on the other operations that we have or are you like med med and in need of cash and you want to drop some of your lower performing assets that could be it too when you take that money or those proceeds to invest in your business in other ways or you just not want to be in the cannabis industry any longer all these are valid you just need to know your why and you want to know what you want in how much do you want in how you got there you know do you want 8.5 million dollars in cash and then another million dollars in stock because you're looking to be acquired by a large large operator maybe someone that's public or someone that has you know very deep pockets you need to understand how much you want and the reason for why that is a good price because the business that's buying you is going to be doing due diligence and they're gonna check all of those reasons and it can't be like oh it's a huge industry and it's growing rapidly and it's a Green Rush trust me licenses are not that big of a deal compared to they were two years ago and in four years it's not gonna matter as much as states start to see how much tax revenue they can generate they're gonna open up the floodgates and the states in the cities are gonna give out a lot of licenses and they're gonna let the free market dictate who wins and who loses now after you figure out how much you want you need to know what are you going to do with the proceeds from this sale now you pretty much are going to want to work with a CPA to determine the potential tax liability when you make this sale and you want to make sure that that actually influences the timing of when you sell your company or sell your asset or sell your license for example if you have a lot of profit in 2020 you may not want to sell your company you know in 2020 at all or at the end of the year because that may increase your tax liability for the year so you may want to push it just you know ten days or two months out to January 2021 assuming that you're on a typical ordinary calendar year now if you have an alternate calendar year and you end your business year on June 30th then you know pay special attention to those dates all about timing all about tax planning right when you start to deal in the large numbers the mill the tens of millions it can be a big deal and it can have huge implications for you and you also want to know what are you going to do with that money when you get it are you gonna put it into a 1031 exchange are you gonna put it all into you know just a regular account are you gonna do some investments with it it's all very important and you just need to have at least a plan you may not need to stick to it because things change but at least be thoughtful about how you're moving forward now if you are in a good enough position where you know you're planning an exit and you can you know really be thoughtful about this try to work on the numbers of your business right if you're planning an exit see how you can trim or pad the numbers of your business things like cutting unnecessary costs ramping up or optimizing production so you can get more dollars per square foot out of your cultivation or more grams per square foot out of your cultivation you know things like minimizing waste in you know reducing shrink within your operation creating an offensive tech strategy where you're not just thinking about taxes in April when it comes up you're being thoughtful every month about either you know planning for the obligation reducing certain costs are increasing certain costs you can offset things doing a cost segregation study working with different tax codes to help you back in some indirect costs into cogs things of that nature another thing you may want to do is implement an accounting an inventory software system this will improve the value of your business and the value of your deal once you get to that due diligence stage the cheaper the due diligence is or the better the information they find around the business to prove that legitimacy of your business the better things will be for you in the higher number you're gonna get later down the road now once you've worked on the numbers of the business you want to work on the operations of your business and the kind of setup of the business we'll say so one term you may hear is a keyman discount now when you'll see this more often is when the business relies heavily on the contributions in any form of one or two key people in the business now why that's important what if that person goes away right they get out of the exit the business or they die or they get hit by a truck right there's this thing called key man insurance so you can look into that a little bit more but the way to you know mitigate that risk is to start documenting your business processes so that new owners can come and understand how to repeat your business success you implement strong internal controls and documentation which then helped make this due diligence audit easier and they can really see all right this is a replicable business model we should buy this business because everything's documented the path to success is paved it's not you know blazing our own trail and if you have a business that is tied to a person's name that consider changing the name of the business and you know it may even be a trademarked kind of infringement situation where it's too close to another existing business maybe you are an edible company and it's very close and you kind of played off the name of a very popular candy brand for example I saw one of these when I worked at an intellectual property law firm they were being given cease and desist letters the you know candy company was harassing them a lot they end up having to change the name of the business but if they had to do this in order to make a sale it could have gone to a heavy discount in that purchase so just be thoughtful about these kinds of things and as a seller one last thing you want to do is to perform due diligence on your buyers now you're watching this video hundreds of people are gonna watch this video a thousands of people gonna watch this video everyone wants to be in the cannabis industry it's not a secret anymore everyone thinks there's a lot of money in here and there is if you do things right you know you have people like family offices PE firms private investors angel investors venture capital group's you know cannabis enthusiasts and yes even some real business operators that maybe run a liquor distribution business or they may run a food distribution business they want to get into cannabis distribution what you want to do is separate those smart and good people whoever those are from the tire kickers you want to find who the true buyers are and the people you really want to work with things you want to look into are what deals have they done who are they representing if they're not representing themselves right there may be agents out there going to buy cannabis businesses for family offices you know they may be buying it for their children or they may be buying it to get into alternative assets so they have some non-correlated assets - maybe the stock market or their core business things of that nature find out who they're representing and do due diligence on the people that they're representing also find out why do they want to get into cannabis this will help you into waise first do they even understand the dynamics of the industry right now how we got here as well as it will also dictate how you tee up the deal to them if they say they really want to be cannabis business operators they love the industry then you play up certain aspects if they're looking for pure cash financial arbitrage then you play up the financials you know what you have to pad and things you need to really put forward as these are the aspects of why this business is worth a lot of money we've covered a lot of ground here I just want to go over some additional licensed selling tips so the first one here is if you're selling your business never pay for due diligence fees you never ever want to take on that burden because it might be trying to scam you so for example we had two cases this last year and the one is gonna be the most important of this and it illustrates this example so you see scam artists out there all the time they do all these crazy things but what happened is that you know a new client of ours reached out and told us a story about how a buyer reached out to them and said hey we want to buy your business for fifteen million dollars that big number that gets the business seller all excited they weren't even really considering a serious sale but they were like okay what will entertain the offer now this potential quote-unquote buyer said hey we'll buy it you know but you have to pay us thirty thousand dollars to do the due diligence fees and if everything checks out smells right you know we'll buy the business now what these scams are essentially is just a business it's gonna go ahead and take that $30,000 in cash and due diligence fees peel into your business but they will never buy the business they were never intending to buy the business they were just looking to get that thirty thousand dollars off of you so throughout the due diligence process make sure each side of the deal is paying for their own due diligence fees it's putting some skin in the game for both sides of the deal in helping to move things along in aligning incentives now the next thing is as a seller avoid stock purchases you know I talked about this earlier what type of consideration are you looking for cash financing stock sale things of that nature I would say really only take cash so what you'll see sometimes this is a company will reach out to you they'll make a thoughtful offer it's the right number but they're gonna say hey will purchase your company for five million dollars but that consideration is going to be stock of our company our big parent come now unless it's highly reputable but even then you're seeing these large cannabis companies the public ones you know even the large private companies their valuations are getting slaughtered and who knows that they're gonna be around in 12 to 18 months it's just too risky your money is not safe when you start to get into the stock market of cannabis businesses it's just getting crushed right now so I would say as a seller try to get most if not all of the money from the sale in cash you can potentially take some of that you know sale in stocks you know have some potential upside limit your downside you just really look for cash cash is king in this industry and in every industry now the next point expect these deals M&A deals to take six to twelve months all right and it could be even longer depending on the taxes you know the implications from it if you have to go through any kind of regulatory you know oversight reviews things of that nature you just plan for these to be long they don't take 30 days they don't take just 60 days they could take quite some time and if you have that thought process then you're not in a rush to sell and when things take a while you're not getting too frustrated but hey any M&A deal there's gonna be frustration built in it's par for the course now I brought up that you may run into ownership issues like in West Hollywood where you can't transfer a license or it becomes void and null so what you could do is enter into a management service agreement with the buyer so you'll say hey the buyer has a management company and whereby all the income and profits from the acquired dispensary or from the managed dispensary is ownership of the buyers management firm essentially you are just designating that all the proceeds and benefits and income and you know the losses are assigned to that management company now you need to check with your legal team on this to make sure that everything is done according to local regulations and laws and things of that nature but that is potentially a way around this license transfer and business sale issue is a management service agreement now the next point here from multi license holders I brought this up earlier and I want to reiterate this break every license into its own legal entity so if you're at the beginning stages every license that you get if you're not going to be you know a microbe is licensed if you're gonna go get a cultivation a menu during a distro and a dispensary and a delivery you know make sure that each license is housed in its own entity it makes this M&A process so much easier to deal with you know the buyers can do clean checks you know the entities are fast you can fracture and break your part your business easier as a seller and the buyers will pay a premium for those clean entities with the license you know you may run into an issue with your distribution company you know you may get into some excise tax issues and you want to sell off the distribution business or you want to sell off the dispensary that's just kicking butt well they're not gonna buy that you know whole kit you know with the distribution issue and the you know the dispensary if you have that issue so by housing that retail license and its own entity you have the ability to sell that operation off in part and you know not be impacted by the issues from your distribution business if you're gonna be selling your business for more than five million dollars I would say even you know north of three million dollars you want to get audited financial statements by an independent CPA firm audited financial statements really move deals forward and create confidence on both sides of the deal what you're gonna notice is that when you get into the realm of M&A in the cannabis industry you know there's a lot a lot of crappy deals out there but when you get the stamp of a CPA firm that has audited financials so many more doors open up it's kind of that stamp of approval CPA you know a national designation it really helps give confidence again on both sides of that deal so if you're gonna go for a larger sale try to get your financials audited before you go for that sale so we're in 2020 go get your 2019 or 2018 get both year is fully audited so that you can move that deal along quicker you get a higher number on that loi from your buyer and your due diligence will move along much quicker and lastly here if you're using an agent to sell your business just be thoughtful and understand that you know their commission percentages range from anywhere to six to ten percent and sometimes it can be even higher depending on the circumstances of the sale especially if you're doing a fire sale and you need to offload it quickly and you're really tapping into their network it could you know range all the way up to fifteen or twenty percent you know that can be quite egregious but in all the pens who has the leverage in the selling situation and it also depends on how much the agent is selling your company for in most cases the higher the sale of the business the lower the percentage is going to be but also if you have like a hurdle you know say you want to sell the business for 4.2 million dollars and they get a higher pricing they get five million dollars that differential of 800 K maybe the agent gets a higher percentage of that differential compared to the base of the 4.2 million it's all to you and how you structure that deal you can always say no to the agent you don't have to use agents but in many cases having someone who is familiar with the industry and you know kind of plugged into the M&A network can really help out and move that deal along quicker and get you access to higher quality buyers and as well in a buyer situation you will likely pay some fees as well so it's not just all on the seller buyers may be paying fees as well and that can again range from the two to seven percent you know sometimes it is six to ten percent it all depends it all depends every deal is unique in its own right we've covered a lot of ground here talking about both sides of the deal the buying and the selling now I just want to review a few key takeaways of buying and selling cannabis licenses so before you apply for your own license and go in and get one consider looking at the resale market again I told you at the beginning the supply of licenses increasing significantly and you have a lot of businesses that either want to exit are failing are struggling you know they want to get rid of their license you don't always have to go and do it yourself potentially look into buying a business that is in a very depressed state now the next point keep each license in its own entity for smoother transaction is down the road if you're gonna get multiple licenses you know make sure you break each license into its own entity like its own LLC its own S corp its own C Corp work with you CPA to figure out what entity type is best for the each license next buyers should always ask for and earn out from the license sellers now you may not always get it but you should always ask for it next due diligence is critical for buyers to knowing what they're actually paying for don't take any seller for their word you want to make sure you have your team Hey the money pay the 25 to 75 K to do a full deep dive and audit the financials out of the operations you know meet with all the key people in the business review all the licences review all these things all the due diligence process watch that video I did on ma deals the due diligence side of it it's the first part of all this M&A process watch that video it's a lot of good information to help you actually break apart peel back the layers of the onion so you know what you are buying and then lastly if you cannot buy and sell your licenses you know then really consider entering into what we call a management service agreement where you designate all income and profits to you know the

today's podcast i wanted to talk about cannabis and i know that that is a very controversial topic i live in canada it is legalized here in canada anyone that's listening or tuning in today that maybe has a closed mind about it either if it's if you know that cannabis isn't your thing and you're not interested in learning more about it then this is definitely not the episode for you that said if you're coming here and you're skeptical but you're willing to have an open mind then i definitely please ask you to just like just activate that open mind a little bit just really listen to the whole episode today before you pass any sense of judgment or come to any sort of conclusion i've done a great deal of research for today's video i'm gonna share my own experiences my own perspectives and opinions from the good to the bad and i'm gonna share a lot of just general objective factual knowledge about cannabis so just yeah keep that mind flourished and open keep that flower keep all those petals open let's absorb the information and then come to conclusions so anyways that's my spiel um i'm gonna jump in though because i do have a lot that i wanna talk to you guys about today and this is why i love cosmic brews because we can talk about things that maybe aren't so politically correct if you will or we talk about things that are a bit more supernatural and spiritual and things like that so i'm definitely not that weed is supernatural it is somewhat spiritual but yeah i just really enjoy being able to talk about these kind of taboo topics with you guys here's how we're gonna crunch down today's chat just to give you guys a quick little overview first we're going to start with what exactly is cannabis i'm going to explain the effects of cannabis the difference between thd and cbd and all of that then we're going to go into why cannabis has such a bad name and such a bad stigma the racist history of the bad stigma and the villainization of marijuana and then we're going to finish off with just the stereotypes including where i kind of feel and how my experience and opinion fits into those stereotypes and basically a final overview on on how i basically implement cannabis into my life and my thoughts on the matter so first things first what exactly is cannabis now cannabis is different than what they call marijuana because cannabis is all of the plants that basically create cannabinoids whereas marijuana is specifically the flower that comes from cannabis plants like you you might hear the term weed kush marijuana cannabis all inter like just interplaced and used at different variations but it's really kind of most people i think generalize all of those things to mean the exact same thing which is pretty much weed or marijuana now there are actually three different types of cannabinoid plants or species of cannabinoid plants but the two main i guess popular ones that you hear about are usually the sativa plant and the indica plant and these are known to have two very different effects on human beings sativa being more energizing and indica being more calming that said most of the grown cannabis is actually a hybrid of the two so it doesn't really give you one effect or the other in fact they all tend to give you all the different strains tend to give you different effects the reason for that is trichomes now trichomes are basically like the crystals or the fuzzy part on weed or cannabis plants and within those trichromes or the crystals you're gonna find four different components amongst a lot of other ones but the four main ones are thc cbd terpenes and flavonoids and those four different things are going to make up the i there's like an actual term for it i can't think of it right now but it's basically like it creates an effect it creates like a rippling effect of the type of experience that you're going to get or the type of reaction you might have to the different types of cannabis plants so out of those four ingredients thc and cbd are known to me known to be cannabinoids and flavonoids and terpenes are known to be non-cannabinoids which means they don't have any sort of effect on you they kind of more so create either the aroma the smell the color of the plant et cetera et cetera including even the taste which is why when you start getting into different weed strands you'll notice that a lot of them have basically been labeled under things like blueberry or chocolate or whatever because different plants can give a different flavor and a different color and a different scent and then when you get into the actual cannabinoids which are thc and cbd i think this is where people sometimes get very confused because cbd is actually non-psychoactive so you can actually smoke cannabis you can vaporize it you can have cbd oil you can have extractions from cannabis plants that don't have any psychoactive i'm getting too ahead of myself that do not have any psychoactive effects cbd is an amazing amazing thing a lot of people use cbd for epilepsy it actually helps stop seizures they use them for migraines a lot of people use it for anxiety and insomnia which is what i tend to use cbd for but that said it also has like a calming just general effect on the body um and it's anti-inflammatory so there's a really like a lot of really good effects that can come from using things like cbd now moving into the thc thc is where you get that psychoactive reaction to weed so this is where i think people either decide whether it's a good drug or it's a bad drug because anybody that basically kind of shies away or stays away or disagrees with psychoactive drugs is not going to agree with the in take of thc different concentrations of thc will create different types of sedations euphoria paranoia creativity it can cause energy it can cause like definitely different effects based on the different concentrations of thc now that said thc can also be known to cause impairments in cognitive and verbal function so that is i feel like that also kind of plays into that stereotype about weed where you kind of see stoners as people that are really slow and kind of slurring their words together which can definitely be an effective smoking weed but it's definitely not the only effect or the most prominent effects all the time i know many a stoners that can smoke and they don't speak slowly or slur their words or kind of like slow down or have any problems with cognitive function so i feel like that's definitely subjective to the user now the common effect that needs to be done or used to actually activate all four of those ingredients is heat so that's why you'll notice that any kind of use or ingesting of cbd weed thc any of the sort it usually comes in the form of smoking it of burning it of baking it vaporizing it it all has to do with heat it's taking the non-active ingredients and by heat it's activating them so it causes the effect on your body so that's just like an overview of what cannabis is and how it's used and i guess just like a different breakdown if you've ever just been curious about the drug itself that's my umbrella knowledge very very simplified version so i think it's really important that if i was going to do a video all about cannabis and my opinion on it my use of it and all of that that i i definitely dove into the stigma behind marijuana so back in the 1800s in the united states there was actually no federal laws against using or ingesting any kind of cannabis in fact the fiber from the plant was used to make things like rope to make things like paper to make things like clothing and at the time it was used as like a main component or a main ingredient to actually manufacture those things so in the early 1900s there was a spike or an increase of the amount of mexican immigrants that actually moved into the united states and with them they brought the word marijuana and the recreational use of marijuana the word marijuana was used and was also villainized villainide why can't i get that word done today done today i'm not making any sense vilified why the word was vilified because along with the increase of immigrants came a lot of political unrest so then in 1937 we see harry anslinger einslinger i don't really know how to say his last name and it doesn't really matter he pretty much began what is known to be the war on drugs he created this marijuana tax act that created a ton of fear monitoring around the use of marijuana now this man was incredibly racist and he definitely had an agenda he took a bunch of non-scientific backed facts about marijuana and then basically found a way to tie it to both the mexican communities and the black communities labeling it as violent labeling it as a gateway drug and labeling it as just basically either what you would use if like for instance a lot of the uh propaganda around marijuana back in the day was basically like if you smoked it it would make you super just like aroused it would cause people to act absolutely insane and psychotic and crazy all the way to it would cause people to commit violent crimes which is just clearly clearly not the case the other kind of like sadistic thing that he did and intentionally did as well was that he made sure to use the word marijuana which again remember it's the spanish word for cannabis and weed which is further creating that tie yeah this man was just not he was he was kind of a piece of uh a piece of something and this trickled into the effect of racism creating a lot of extreme influence on how people basically perceived or saw weed don't tell me the facts i've already made my mind up kind of mentality that it's just horrible needs to be stayed away from and a lot of this fear monitoring and a lot of this racism influenced not only the public's perception on marijuana but also even the media and how it portrayed marijuana use in a lot of the famous movies or things that you would see back in the day so it was definitely the topic of marijuana and weed and the context in which it was being shared or promoted around was definitely being controlled and the narrative written was definitely not an honest and true one it was coming from a very very evil place a very evil man that started this but it was it was not just him it takes more than just one man to do that one year after that marijuana tax act it became three times more likely for a black person to be arrested for any kind of charge or any kind of possession of marijuana and it became almost nine times more likely for anyone that was mexican to also be getting those charges which then moves us into the 1960s and the 1970s this is basically the hippie era they were against mainstream culture and powerful institutions and were basically all about peace and not war and being able to be conscious and to wake yourself up to the truth and to break a lot of these stigmas and the fear monitoring that was basically surrounding things like marijuana but also other psychedelic drugs and again created political unrest they weren't happy with that so because of that political unrest in 1970 under president nixon there was a controlled substances act that was basically created that classified marijuana as a category one drug if you want some further context as to what that means that puts marijuana as more dangerous and more addictive than cocaine and meth now since 1970 other things have changed for instance in the states there have been quite a few different states that have actually legalized if not the medical use of marijuana even gone as far as legalizing recreational recreational use and like i said i live here in canada where it has also been legalized for recreational use if you clicked on today's video feeling some type of way about weed and it's tied to more of a personal experience than fair i think that it's super important to highlight the stigma around weed because a lot of this negative stigma literally has come from years and history of fear monitoring and racism so just taking a little break from today's episode i wanted to talk to you guys about better help if you

ounce and a heavy pour or about a glass and a half of wine so if you live alone and you like to have a glass of wine with dinner let's say after accomplishing a great goal or just in general if you want to bring wine with you somewhere and it's just you drinking it but you don't want to have to pour out the bottle because you aren't able to finish it then this is definitely gonna be all up your alley because of the single serve format of the usual wines and their bottle design usual is always fresh with no more flat bubbly or stale roses plus usual wines are made from world-class abas and they're made with minimal intervention zero sugar and zero additives the one are also lower carb like i said have zero grams of sugar and usual has a red blend a rose a and a sparkling white wine called brute they also have a limited production brute rose just for the summer and that one was my favorite so a little fun fact is if you're drinking wine in the u.s did you know that in the u.s there are over 60 additives allowed by law to be used in wine making usual wines doesn't use any chemicals or sugar additives to enhance the flavors or the stability of their wine they're truly like a clean wine brand now obviously grapes contain sugar but to clarify all usual wines are produced using natural sustainable grapes harvested every single fall these grapes are picked at optimal ripeness to ensure all sugar will be fermented completely until the wines are dry with no residual sugar so all that's left over afterwards is just delicious and clean wine now like i said the root rose was my favorite i'm looking forward to trying the white wine though especially and the red one now that we're dipping into the cooler chillier months but if you guys want to give it a try then just go check out their website at www.usualwinds.com and you can use my discount code caitlyn k-a-l-y-n for eight dollars off your first order and try your first glass on us now that we've discussed you know the importance of what exactly is weed now we understand how it works and how it affects our bodies and what gives it different tastes flavors and colors we've discussed how it's basically been painted as this terrible gateway drug when that is actually definitely not the case it doesn't cause i mean everything in moderation just like with drinking or with caffeine even you don't want to go into excessive modes of ingesting or using and yes it can definitely have some negative outcomes too like i said it can cause paranoia it can cause anxiety it can even cause psychotic breaks again if you're smoking too much weed or ingesting too much thc but that said just to put this into perspective around 90 000 people i think it's in the united states but it was like around 90 000 people in the united states die every year in relation to over consumption of alcohol but zero like literally there have been no documented deaths from over ingestion of weed or marijuana a lot of the propaganda around wheat and marijuana is that if you smoke weed or you smoke marijuana you're going to become lazy you're not going to be a contributing citizen to the public or your community or your family or to your significant other that you'll just basically want to slow motion eat in your bed and roll around in the crumbs because your body feels different and stare at your hands and your palms and you know just drift away on a cloud which i mean honestly that sounds iconic to me for like a sunday afternoon but i do want to talk about the different stereotypes and how a lot of them actually aren't true for instance oh this is where i get uncomfortable because i need to like input my own personal experience but you are talking to somebody who has been incredibly productive and incredibly motivated by the use of cannabis find rest when my insomnia is really really bad and find groundedness and contentment through the use of cbd as well as even going as far as spiritual advancements and making i guess more and all i mean by that like spiritual advancements is really just getting to know more of myself more of me on the inside more of the energy that takes up this body that fills this brain that allows me to experience my senses to think to emote and all of that and that introspection has also been enhanced through the use of things like thc so there's definitely more people around you than you might actually think that use marijuana especially if you live in places that it's legalized where the reason why you wouldn't think it is because they don't fit the class stereotype that we all think of when we think of potheads or stoners i don't know if i'd go as far as calling myself like a pothead or a stoner but i've definitely gone through phases where i was phases where i would smoke literally every single day also taken large breaks in the past in different years like 2017 and things like that where i was very like i just didn't want to have it for a little while like i felt like i needed to take a break but that was again just like with drinking and caffeine it's like you have to be able to know your limit so you do need that self actualization because at the same time even though this drug isn't actually physically addictive it can definitely become habitually addictive and so that's i guess where i'm coming from as i explained to you guys my personal experience with marijuana because i have felt both the pros and cons both what it's like to have or use or consume weed in a way that is actually balanced in my life versus an unbalanced or a like what's a good way to put it um a dependency issue so for the longest time i used to feel really shameful about the fact that if i showed up to a house party or if i was in a group setting or it was like time to go to the bars or things like that that most of the time i would have actually preferred to you know smoke and then go then drink and go because there's a lot of and that's just my own personal experience due to my own conditioning around things like alcohol i used to have a big problem with alcohol for a while where there was even more shame and guilt that i can't that i would basically experience when i would try and drink really didn't enjoy being drunk and i really didn't enjoy feeling the feeling of being drunk but i did enjoy the feeling of being high and i think i enjoyed it because i tend to be introspective just in my day to day nature so anytime i would smoke especially when i would get good high quality strains like sativas and things like that like i turn into just this happy bubbly person which i actually enjoyed more than when i would become a drunk person and that was again just my own personal experience and i i guess like i always struggled for a while and i still kind of do with the idea that it wasn't okay for me to say that in a group setting like if everybody was drinking i couldn't like partake in the celebrations the festivities the activities and openly admit like oh i'm okay i don't need a drink i'm actually just gonna take a couple puffs of my vaporizer but now that it's been legalized it's definitely been easier because i think that again we're seeing more people come to terms with the fact that this drug is not that harmful now i should put a disclaimer in here when i say that this drug is not that harmful we unfortunately due to a lot of these laws and a lot of these stigmas and things scientists haven't been able to actually gain the proper access needed at least in the past in order to actually test and do different types of research in order to see the types of effects that come from marijuana but in the tests that have already been done it's looking like the only real effects are in cognitive function and memory and perhaps like verbal missing verbalization which i feel like you know what that happens to me but normally it's just my anxiety that said if you're under the age of 21 your brain is still growing and developing so it actually is harmful and can be detrimental to smoke a large amount and a consistent amount of weed before the age of 21 because it doesn't give i'm remembering this very vaguely from the research that i've done but i'm pretty sure it affected how the hippocampus of the brain grew in the teenagers which i think just literally means that your brain isn't going to grow properly if you are abusing weed or marijuana before the age of 21 but i think after the age of 21 you know you're a mature adult your brain is fully grown you have the capability and the like honestly it's up to you then to decide where you stand with it decide how you feel about it and then go on and live your life and not really i guess if you're making mature decisions and you can find a way to healthily balance it it's literally no different than if we were to be sitting here talking about a drink or sitting here talking about coffee or any other kind of drug not to mention i feel like there's also the stigma around marijuana where it's like people people don't believe that it should be legalized because when people get their hands on it it's literally just so that they can continue to get their hands on it but we don't really put that same stigma stigmatization or that same i guess pressure around pharmaceutical drugs which are more highly addictive and detrimental as well as like i said things like caffeine or drinking whereas drinking and even caffeine it can cause greater effects on the physical body drinking especially than weed really actually does are you looking to meal prep without all of the hassle prep plan and basically all of the annoying side of meal prepping because if you are you definitely want to give hellofresh a try i'm sure

story times about this perhaps on my main channel if you guys want that let me know if you guys want to hear about like more funny or specific stories or things like that now that we've broken the ice here um but here's my i guess short brief history with marijuana or cannabis so the first time i smoked weed i was in high school i believe i was in grade 10 if not it would have been late grade 9 or summer going into grade 10. and at first i i think in grade nine i was pretty against it where i just kind of really didn't even care about it like i knew people around me did it and that high school parties did it but i just wasn't really about it grade 10 i don't know what happened actually i do know what happened but realistically all that really matters is that i started acting out a little bit and a good friend of mine at the time she was one of my best friends i still find her to be a very kind warming soul but was also going through some hard teenage times and we just kind of like bonded over the fact that we were like yo weed really helps which is not a healthy thing to do because like i said i was under the age of 21. uh we didn't smoke all of the time but we would definitely on the weekends and stuff and after grade 10 i kind of went into a complete pendulum swing of kind of going through just like this rebellious acting out phase like i said to grade 11 where i was just in a completely different mindset and i decided to completely like i remember i wasn't trying to drink at parties i would always dd everybody i didn't smoke weed i remember i made my high school boyfriend feel really bad any time he smoked weed and i shamed him which is terrible to think about but i did back in the day because i just basically flipped into the other mode basically around 2013 i started dating um another another longer relationship of mine and he was five years older than me we met at work and he was somebody who smoked and smoked more regularly and at this time i would have been going on 20 so again too young under the age of 21 guys don't do as i do i'm just telling you the truth of my story um so i started smoking when we started dating but again it wasn't like it was a regular thing it was just kind of like a recreational use every other weekend or so he had a cottage when we'd go to his cottage and things like that and then around the age of 21 we started living together and then i we kind of like got into a routine where it was i want to say like friday saturday sunday type of thing but throughout the week when we'd both be working and he was going to school and working as well we wouldn't smoke and at the time i just i couldn't do it in front of other people i remember for the longest time i don't think i have a lighter hair for my candle but for the longest time i used to be really afraid of lighters and fire and like i wouldn't be able to like hit a lighter and so i was just like a complete noob back in the day and i was basically just i felt very safe around the people that i would smoke around which was pretty much just my boyfriend at the time and our two friends that we were really close with they were a couple and all four of us would hang out and they were also older than me and i just kind of felt like we did it in such a wholesome way like we would like hang out at their house and just like you know just have like crackers and hummus and watch crime shows or things like that so you're gonna want to skip forward to about 2016. now at this point i'm single and i've moved into my first apartment by myself i had moved out of my apartment with maggie to which actually maggie and i i skipped over that 2015. we would also sometimes dabble um and at the time again it was coming from a very wholesome place like it would be like end of the day we would dabble we would smoke a little bit listen to taylor swift make our dinner like dance around our kitchen and it was just like again just like wholesome best friend smoking vibes and nobody knew and then moving forward the year after that this is where things started to get into the out of balance experience that i had with marijuana so i moved into my first apartment by myself mentally i was really struggling mental health-wise 2016. like it's weird because you can go back and watch my videos and you would have no idea especially because i've been re-watching some of the youtuber videos in order to create youtuber this year and when i go back to 2016 it's so funny for me to watch just even my demeanor on camera because i'm so peppy and i'm so i'm just like hi guys i'm like i talking like a really high-pitched voice part of it was just that i was trying to you know get comfortable with myself on camera but i think also another part of it was because there was actually just like so much mental anguish i was hiding at the time it's not a big deal honestly that sounds kind of heavy but it really just is the truth i was mentally struggling a lot with depression and anxiety but extreme depression and i had gone to a few a few therapists from high school on but at the time i wasn't seeing a therapist so it really wasn't going well things with my family were really not going well which was the root of a lot of the problems and come fall pretty much the first year i ever ever actually did youtober was when i started to use weed every single day and we're just gonna break all the rules right now i'm just gonna say the words that i've been beating around because i know that these words come with such harsh context and whatever but f the stigma i'm just gonna break it down guys like i was smoking like bongs like every single day starting in the morning and just would like work all day and like i hibernated i didn't leave my house like it started to become this really unhealthy habit and it's crazy because like i said when you break down those stereotypes guys i was not smoking sitting on my couch and watching tv all day to me it was like this easy kept secret because my life seemed like it was still fully functioning although i was in a lot of pain and at that time it no longer became something i used to engage with the world or every now and then recreationally it became a substance that i started to rely and depend on in order to basically turn off all the pain i was feeling and focus in on the work i wanted to do and it became a very unhealthy habit so 2017 we're going through like a life history lesson right now but 2017 i moved to toronto and that gave me that new fresh environment to really start fresh and again it moved back into a more recreational use i started dating a different boyfriend um that i met here in toronto and yeah he also smoked very recreationally and again it just became back into balance and life was back on track on the weekends every now and then we would smoke and i would also have some weed at home to smoke as well but again it would be like the odd night or so if i ever wanted to relax or be creative but again it wasn't a daily use and then skip forward to 2018 and again we have the same type of mental anguish i'm going through some very hard deep soul work um and it wasn't up until actually towards the end of it would have been around this time 2018 so about two years ago that i sought out my now therapist who has pretty much helped me work through all of this that has led me to me being able to sit here and openly be honest and authentic and talk to you guys about it because i do think that there is a lot of very unfair stigma around this plant around this drug that isn't there for things like alcohol that if i was sitting here talking about wine no one would really question meanwhile i think that it's way less harmful and has actually also helped me like i don't want to just paint it in a bad light so yes i'm aware of the fact that you can actually have addictive behaviors or addictive personalities with weed but it's not physically addictive and so i understand both sides there's pros and cons but just like there are pros and cons to drinking just like there are pros and cons to even ingesting caffeine pharmaceutical drugs so on and so forth so where is weed in my life now okay i recently uploaded a night routine where i decided because i do my night routine's vlog style so it doesn't mean that that's my routine every single night i literally just show you that routine of that night and i figured you know what i'm just gonna i'm gonna include a little clip of this and when i did you guys actually shocked me so many of you wrote in to me just basically being like oh my god thank you like i don't feel crazy anymore like i hide i'm a closet stoner um or even the people that were like i don't really agree but i'm open to hearing more because i asked if you guys wanted me to do this right now like sit down and talk about it and i was just overwhelmed with the positive reaction because i was really uncertain of how people were were going to react but at that point i had basically decided when i decided to put it in the video i decided that i was going to own who i am and i wasn't going to let anybody change my mind because like i said i've done my research i've had my experiences i know where i sit with it i feel good about how i like i guess where weed it sits in my life but i was so elated when i actually saw how people reacted because it was a pleasant surprise to see how many people were open-minded to at least hearing about it and breaking their own internalized i guess like imagery or meaning of what weed actually is end of 2018 i moved into this apartment the house that i'm in right now with larissa larissa and i you guys probably know what i'm talking about but if you don't she is my best friend as well as we work together in a lot of different ways behind the scenes and uh she is actually who helped inspire me to open up more about being a weed smoker especially a woman who's a weed smoker online because there is nobody out there talking about it there's nobody sharing this unbiased information because i mean up until me talking about my personal experience i was trying to be as unbiased as possible because nobody's really doing that nobody's really talking about it and i think that that makes sense because there's still a lot of fear around if you get labeled or tied to a certain image or stereotype that people will you know cancel you or hate you or whatever the internet likes to do nowadays but when we started living together i was able to actually learn a lot more about weed larissa is i i feel like she is just like she just knows and now she also works for a weed company in canada so she knows even more now like if i have any weed questions or anything like that i usually go to her and vice versa we enjoyed like it was again it was very much like a part two or a very reflective image of when i lived with maggie where weed wasn't something that was necessarily problematic but me and my best friend lived together and we would have the odd night i would say probably a little bit more than usual but that we would just smoke and dance around the kitchen and just hang out together and like get creative and talk about our dreams and our goals and and honestly work on our dreams and goals so it was very much like a productive slash consumption use but again it was more recreational it wasn't as much on the day-to-day and then you skip forward to now it's 20 20. i live alone again so larissa moved out about a year ago now kind of used it as like a okay i can start whatever type of habits i want only ever smoking joints and vapes and yeah and like the odd edible but i really don't mess with edibles because i don't like how hard they hit and how long they take and that is too much lack of control for me so i tend to i like to smoke mainly out of my vaporizer but i also do smoke uh joints as well i don't think i could handle bongs anymore if i'm being honest with you because it's been so long learning how to embrace my truth and not just believe what the vast majority of people believe because when you actually look at the facts of marijuana it's kind of hard to deny that if we're gonna feel okay about alcohol then we kind of have to feel okay about weed too or unless we're literally just ignoring the facts now that said i should make one last disclaimer before i go and that's the fact that i know that i talked very openly about weed today including my own experience and consumption and uses of marijuana and weed but i don't want to glamorize it either there are definitely people that just do not mix well with weed it's not for everybody at all and there have also been times where i have smoked too much and i've been in the wrong setting or i've been around the wrong people and it's activated my anxiety or activated my social anxiety or triggered a panic attack um i definitely want to put that out there because i don't want to just make it seem like wheat is cool and like you should smoke weed and get creative in things or like go on a spiritual journey because that's definitely a fun thing that you can do if you are over the age of 21 if you are in a place where read is legalized and that's an experience you want to introduce yourself to that said though i definitely don't want to make it seem like it's something that is like i don't i basically am just i don't want to encourage any kind any type of dependency on it and any type of glamorization or romanticization of the drug it is still a drug everything in moderation you wouldn't over drink caffeine because it would give you a heart attack you wouldn't over drink alcohol because you would literally get alcohol poisoning just like you don't want to over smoke or over intake thc or weed of any sort on a basis that is not balanced so there you guys have it i'm glad we've cracked the ice guys now i feel like i've gotten all of the facts and broken down all of the misconceptions about weed so now when we talk about it you know we can talk about all of the funny story times or just the different sides of weed if you guys have any questions if you have any further story times any further information you want me to talk about experiences you want me to talk about including the good and the bad definitely let me know and like i said i'm curious now that we've gotten through the entire chat what your guys's opinions are so definitely leave those down below i definitely know too that there can be people that have again either had bad experiences or know people that have had bad experiences so i definitely think that you know your opinion no matter what your opinion is it doesn't have to be good you're welcome to be as open-minded and as honest as possible but let's just try and keep the conversations um like buildable let's let's allow people to speak their mind without any sense of harsh judgments or criticisms so that we can make the conversations proactive you know and aside from that i love you guys all the way to proxima b and back and i will talk to all of you guys in the next coffee talk see you guys later", "WIJzk_M5L0c": "okay hey how you doing man - Chung great to meet you shoot it works how long you been doing it five years I think how long you've been doing this one thing like 14 years with

getting the feedback and reading what everyone has to say now this particular uh today for this update i do want to talk about a uh a question i received from vincent a on youtube and he wrote hey matt thanks for all the marijuana market updates we'd like to hear what you think about cannabix tech just recently got a u.s patent for a thc breathalyzer couldn't find much recent financials but wondering what your thoughts are i couldn't find any other publicly traded company that makes a thc breathalyzer and with more states legalizing for recreational use i think this might be a good long-term option thanks well first off vincent thank you for your comments and your questions i really appreciate that you're you guys are the reason why we do this is just to provide you uh with a little bit more analysis in terms of of cannabis related stocks it's not easy to find uh but you know and it provides you with actual information what you do with it entirely up to you but i want to try to provide you with very middle of the road straight line and and no bull no just cut to the chase and tell you what it is give the info and then what you do with it entirely up to you now i'll start with a little bit of background on the company and then i'll look at it stock performance cannabix technologies incorporated trades over the counter on the pink sheets under b l o z f b l o z f and it also trades on the canadian national stock exchange is a canadian company so it's not on the nasdaq or on the new york stock exchange it is over the counter it is on the pink sheets um but it's not a company that that cultivates or sells marijuana so it's not your typical marijuana company it's a company that's in the market of creating tools for law enforcement and employers to test the presence of thc on an individual uh and vincent is correct the company did just receive a patent for a cannabis drug detection device uh it's patent uh it's a patent the company's been working on uh since 2014. it recently just got it just uh a week two weeks ago now the actual breathalyzer has already been produced and is in field testing uh a a with an occupational health clinic in southern california it works the same way an alcohol breathalyzer does law enforcement if you are at a traffic stop or maybe in an accident and there's a question about your your impairedness then they break out a little device you breathe into it and then instantaneously it tells you what your alcohol your blood alcohol level or how much alcohol is in your blood and every state has different legal limits if you are over that legal limit then you can be arrested for driving under the influence the thc breathalyzer works the exact same way if you breathe into it and it's meant to register the amount of thc you have in your system uh whenever whenever legal limits are established uh if they haven't been already then you can determine whether you're driving under the influence or operating a vehicle under the influence or showing up to work under the influence or whatever have you now so it it just works the same way as an alcohol breathalyzer and it's supposed to reduce the thc identification process from what is now days sometimes hours into seconds and minutes as of august the company said results missed breathalyzer uh takes less than five minutes to obtain uh and cannabix officials said they're continuing to work on scaling down the current device it is a pretty good size one it's you know it's more that you know the ones the police use for alcohol are very small rectangles and you know with a little tube on the end that you blow into this is actually a bit bigger it's not huge but it's not necessarily compact uh and they're working on trying to decrease the production costs of that device all in all achieving the patent is really pretty big news for the company um as now it's kind of in the driver's seat to develop this kind of technology ongoing now in terms of the company stock it was trading at a range of around 27 cents to 30 cents a share for most of the last 12 months it ticked up to about 66 cents a share in december that's likely response to the current used political situation involving democrats controlling the house the senate and the white house now as i've said before uh you know investors are the belief that with democrats in control of all three of those entities that federal decriminalization of cannabis is closer to reality thus pushing cannabis stocks up we saw it with even our cannabis watch list holdings which i'll talk more about later that they pushed very high after the election and then after january when the georgia election finally gave control of the senate to the democrats now cannabix got its big boost when news of its patent award became public earlier this month as you can see with the chart here the stock price vaulted to more than a dollar 79 a share that's a 616 jump from march 2020's low of 25 cents a share that's a massive jump now the stock price hit a golden cross that's where the 50 day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average back in december of 2020 that golden cross indicates a potential uptrend could be in the offing but in this instance it's more likely the patent drove the stock higher not the pattern so um just be aware of that that the you know news does dictate stock price and this instance that's exactly what happened it wasn't because the technicals showed that it was time for the price for the stock to start moving in an uptrend um and finally vincent is also correct uh financially rather he is correct there is very little and i mean very little financial information available on this company what i could find is that the company doesn't carry any debt but it also hasn't mass-produced its breathalyzer yet so there's very little reason to have any it's basically raising funds to pay for r d it's not taking any debt because it has no need to um and it doesn't have any cash flow either again because it hasn't sold anything so right now its financials are pretty much on level term it's raising funds and then investing those funds uh in into its research and development when it starts mass producing then you might start seeing this company start taking on some debt uh and and even start generating some sales once that becomes fruition that's when the balance sheet will start to expand and you'll start seeing hopefully what the company would hope for would be a balance if not a tip to the cash side to the good now overall the this company is a little tricky for me in terms of investing there's another company out there called hound labs it started uh on-site testing of its own marijuana breathalyzer and the news of this online field test just came days after cannabix uh announced its patent award so i'm sure there was no surprise there uh hound labs is a private company so you can't invest in it the same way you can with cannabix um now for cannabis i would issue some caution realize that there's not they're not the only player in the game here it just happens to be they're the only player that you can actually invest in um it's not an expensive stock even with the run up i mean dollar 79 still is fairly cheap uh it's not bad but if that momentum isn't sustained a pullback could lead to triple digit losses you see the stock go up 600 percent um if their uptrend isn't confirmed or isn't isn't sustained it can drop right back down to that 25 27 30 level that's a massive loss so you have to really put all that in perspective until they start marketing and putting out a product to sell it's going to be very difficult to gauge whether this stock is something to really invest in at this point at least to me and at least in the cannabis industry r d companies are great but there's always caution that you have to kind of throw yeah you have to factor in here whenever you're investing so i would say it's kind of buyer beware here you know understand that it's an r d company there are no sales uh there's no debt that's great but there's no income either so um yeah you know it's just very very tricky um getting in now on the ground level yeah if that's your strategy that might not be a bad idea because if if they start mass producing and start really building up production of this thc breathalyzer and start building up sales especially in the law enforcement community where in states where adult use and medical use is legal well that could be a huge boom for the company and that could be a huge boom for the stock price um is it going to happen you know i'm not a soothsayer i i don't know i mean the run-up is uh is again because of the patent not necessarily because of the it has a massive new product on hand it's got it because it's now taken a step closer to the potential of creating a patented product that they can put on the market and sell commercially now i want to look at our cannabis watch list on money and markets our watch list continues to perform well uh average gain of our six positions just as at 34 but again you have to understand if you've been paying attention you'll see that the broader cannabis market has been hit with some pressure and that has pushed some of our stocks down slightly nothing to be alarmed at but it's just something you need to be aware of so swipes are mounted international it's up about close to 30 percent uh it was up as high as 40 percent it's paired back uh perk and elmer this is actually a company that's actually increased over over time rather than been suffered by the pullback and that's because it's a little more diversified outside of cannabis it's up about 28 since i recommended it so i put it on the watch list in uh september turning point brands this is another traditional tobacco company like schweitzer mounted uh it's up more than 65 percent uh grow generation uh this was you know was our top performer it has paired back a little bit it's still up 61 since i put it on the watch list in november i think it still has room to grow i think this is just a pullback uh i think i think it's temporary uh and i don't think it's going to last too long i i think once we start seeing hearing more cannabis in the news then i think you're going to start seeing more cannabis stock prices jump um planet 13 holdings this is the most recent addition to the watch list it has struggled not not going to kid around it's down about 11 since i added it uh and that's again because of headwinds that canada the cannabis industry is facing they got a nice run uh after the election uh both in november and then again in january now they're starting to pull back a little bit i still think there's a lot of potential long term for planet 13. i don't think it's one that it's it's not time to sell it's not time to get rid of it if you do own it uh just be steady stay the course and i think you'll be just fine and scott's miracle grow again to illustrate how stocks fluctuate when i added this to the watch list in september it dropped about 10 11 it is now up 34 since i since i recommended that price so it's at about a 44 45 swing in price since i added it so uh again it just goes to show you that you know not everything is stays the same and you just have to you know monitor your strategy and stick to your strategy which is what we do here at money markets with cannabis so with marijuana market update so just hold to it you'll be fine i'm going to keep watching things for you if there is an instance where i think that it's time maybe to back out of a position uh that you may have bought based on on the watch list i'll let you know um and i'll be the first to tell you i'll put out a video and let you know uh immediately when that should happen now you can check out my cannabis watch list on moneymarkets.com uh but there is one more thing i do want to address and this is something that uh is is not not personal but it is something i do takes very seriously i'm all about being transparent um i try to give you all the information that i have afforded to me as a research analyst and and sometimes that information uh that i see and that i that i get access to isn't necessarily correct now last week i answered a question about charlotte's web holdings incorporated and the information i told you about the company's debt that i found from research from research that i looked for was actually not accurate however you have to bear in mind that's not the reason why i told you that charlotte's web is not a buy i told you that charlotte's web is not a buy because it has no stock momentum and it's got very high volatility and it's just not one that i'd want to take a risk on right now does that potential of course they all do um but my reasoning was not because of its debt my reasoning was because of its stock performance but again i want to be very open i want to be very honest with you and tell you uh that this was an incorrect this was incorrect uh and and and explained to you why so uh you know that all aside uh it's a lesson learned but um you know again next week i'm gonna talk about another cannabis stock that's been mentioned in our youtube comments or email you can uh comment on our youtube section right below email me at feedback moneymarkets.com and let me know maybe if there's a sector or a stock you'd like me to take a look at would love to do that coming up later this week we'll have the bull in the bear podcast as well as our money markets week ahead i'm going to give you a little bit of a sneak preview next week's marijuana market update i'm actually going to have a cannabis insider on and we're going to talk about the market so make sure you stay tuned for

for medicinal cannabis says the UK is home to six million CBD users who take it in supplements cosmetics and vape liquids and with some of the best known pharmacies and health shops stocking up UK sales alone are expected to exceed 1 billion a year by 2025 advocates claim CBD can help with a seemingly endless list of conditions from anxiety to acne but what exactly is CBD does it make you high and most importantly to the bold claims behind these wellness products actually stand up to science CBD more formally known as cannabidiol is the cannabis extract but no that doesn't mean it can get you high so that's THC THC is the primary psychoactive component in in cannabis THC and CBD are both cannabinoids in the cannabis plant they differ because THC is intoxicating and CBD isn't and it has produces very little side effects to better understand health claims it's useful to split CBD into two categories wellness CBD and medical CBD wellness CBD products are available off the shelf in health shops and pharmacies CBD oil is one of the more popular ones but it's also made its way into shower gels bottled water gummies and even tampons people claim that the wellness DVD helps with general aches and pains anxiety daily stresses and sleep but there's little evidence to say that it actually does help with this and now the NSA is cracking down on the sale of wellness CBD products under a law they're classified as normal foods this means the claims that they make and how safe they are need to stand up to testing before they can be authorized for sale there have been a few studies now where they've taken bottles of CBD from health food shops and looked at what's inside them and sometimes they found that there's actually teach seeing them little or no CV some of them have alcohol in them to the level which they could be considered sort of an alcoholic beverage if companies don't adhere to these regulations by March 2021 then their products could be taken off the market the second type of CBD available is medical CBD there are a small number of approved medicines currently available on the NHS that contain much higher doses of CBD and there is some evidence to show that they may be effective at treating certain conditions that's epidural X which is approved for two very rare childhood epilepsies and then there Sativex which is licensed for like pain and spasticity in multiple sclerosis only doctors on the specialist registrar can prescribe these on a named patient basis with very little scientific evidence about the effects of wellness CBD and what the shorts or long-term risks are the Food Standards Agency says healthy adults should think carefully before using it and if you're pregnant breastfeeding or taking medication you shouldn't take it at all I also think that when it comes to CBD there's probably a really big placebo effect out there sort of global placebo effect because people are looking for something in their life that can really help them and they're not getting that from their general medications so then they're turning to sort of herbal medications and those having medications should be a quality standard that we all agree upon [Music]", "q2gsu7CnFSE": "[Music] welcome to true buds tv it's your buddy jack here and we're making a potent cannabis infused liquid coconut oil using the shake here i'm using about 37 grams whatever fills to the top of the levo2 that i'm using today you can use a crock pot you can use a stove top this will all apply no matter what method you're using so obviously you're going to need your flour you're going to need the coconut oil we're going to put in a little sunflower lecithin at the end to help it emulsify create a more even mixture throughout our baking sheet and foil to decarbon a strainer fine strainer cheese cloth tea check 2 is optional let's spread that cannabis out on the tray nice layer there coat it in foil tightly let's put it in the oven 240 degrees for 40 minutes or you could do 220 for an hour i like to let it cool and flip it over like this and then use the foil itself as kind of a device to pour into your whatever you're using crock pot or the levo in my case now let's add that liquid coconut oil a cup here to start we just barely wanted to top over the flour and we're going to repeat this process so next we'll do four ounces and then two we end up using about 14 ounces total to this 38 grams here and we're going to infuse it at 200 degrees fahrenheit which is about low on the crock pot for four hours you can play with this do what you like the levo ii has a stir so you don't really need to worry about stirring it automatically does it for you which is a nice little perk there it is let's strain it out we're going to push down with a spatula you could put it in like a french press to make sure you get all the oil out or just squeeze it with your hands if using cheesecloth we're going to pour a sample to the side here then we are going to add our sunflower lecithin to help it emulsify give us a more even texture and mixture throughout and then we're going to give it a nice stir for a while whisk it up make sure that mix is well make sure your infusion is still warm and hot we'll let that infusion cool a little bit and then we're going to use the t-check 2 here that's why we put the sample to the side it uses light to test your sample so you want to make sure you test it before you add that lecithin all right it's getting ready here the device my favorite part about to put the tray in here and test and see how potent it is today let's see we're about to make some caps with this so i hope it's nice and potent some 6.4 milligrams per milliliter that's nice that'll be some decent um you know infused capsules

It's your player partner\n2 Chainz checking in and this is \"The Most\nExpensivest: High Roller,\" and first I got my guy,\nthe comedian extrordinaire -- Hannibal Buress. Hannibal: What's up? \u266a\u266a And last but not least. The man that put\nthe 'G' in geek. We're talking about Tommy Chong,\nladies and gentlemen. \u266a\u266a Please, please, please. And we have\none common denominator. We enjoy\nthe fruits of our labor. -Yes. -If I must say so myself. We're going to\nhave a dish that is infused\nwith expensive marijuana, and hopefully\nwe don't pass out doing it. This is Zairilla Bacon. \u266a\u266a So tell us what's going on. What you got here? Right here we've got\nthat Z Juice, which is medicated Kool-Aid. -Okay. I've got the watermelon and this\nis my new flavor, peach mango. Each bottle is 100 milligrams. I make my own THC lean syrup. 100 milligrams, how would that\nhave you after you drink it? Well, everybody's\ntolerance is different. If you have a low tolerance, maybe about\na quarter of the bottle. A quarter of it? If you've got\na high tolerance, like myself, I just chug it.. -Yeah. -Yes, sir. Let me see you\nchug out off. -What? -You won't chug this. I wish I had my phone. -She didn't hesitate. -You ain't got your phone? -She didn't hesitate. She's going to chug\nthat mother fucker and it's got\n100 milligrams in it? Keep out of reach of children. That's some deep shit. She's going to be\ndifferent later. Oh, man. She's not even going\nto take a break. She's just -- All right. -I stay highly medicated. -Okay. Yeah. Highly medicated. This is\nthe mac and cheese. It's going to run you\nabout $500. You charge. Your shit high, shorty. Just a little \"turch\" of that. Not too much. Just a little \"turch.\" A \"turch.\" -Just a little \"turch.\" -Yeah. That's enough, that's enough. -Right on. This is my Zairilla's medicated\nchicken wings made with my Zeewee's\nfrom scratch BBQ sauce. In Chicago,\nwe call it Mouth Sauce. -Mouth sauce? Yeah. -That's right. So, we're going to eat this\nand get high? You want to try\nsome of this shit right here? Tommy, wake up. You want to try\nsome of this shit? [ Laughter ] -Already. Already. -Come back to earth. Come back here, man. -See that shit he's doing? -He's eating wings with --0 That's what you do\non a first date when you're trying\nto get some. Medicated wings,\nI'm very careful with. Oh, you've had\nthis before? I know what happens when you --\nwell you'll find out. Hannibal: This is going\nto get interesting. -So is the stuff in the sauce? -Yes, sir. -Also in my batter. -You hittin' it from both ways? -Yes, sir. -These are crispy. That's how\nit's supposed to be. -I like it. -What's that? -What's that there? -This is the asparagus. -The whole thing is? -It's reefer, too. -Every piece. -I use it in my\ninfused olive oil. Oh, it's in\nthe olive oil. You can't even taste\nthe reefer in it. That's the tricky part. -That's the best part about it. I love that, too,\nbut I think that's low down. I do. That's some low-down shit. You're making me\nwant to eat, man. It's a trick. This shit's tricky. You feeling anything? Well, you'll know\nwhen I'm feeling something because I'll panic\nabout the cameras, and run to my car\nand leave. [ Laughter ] When I run away from everybody\nscreaming it's like, \"Oh, yeah, I think\nthe asparagus got to him.\" Zairilla: That's usually\nabout $75 a pound. Really? So how much does\nthe Kool-Aid cost? -20 bucks. -20 bucks? -20 bucks for one thing. -For this thing right here? Yes, sir. She just drunk a $20\nright in your face. -After 20? -[ Laughs ] Yeah. You're looking at\nthis big platter of wings is normally about $1,500. -These wings about $1500? -$1500? -Yes, sir. -That's about 70 wings. So that's about, what, $7\nand some change? Wait, am I bad at math? -You're horrible. -Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Oh, that's about $20 a wing. $20 and some change,\na wing. -A wing. -Holy shit. I just ate\na little $40. Those are\nexpensive wings, I see why Viceland\ndidn't pay me to come here. [ Laughter ] I think that shit's\nstarting to kick in. This is\n$20 and some change! Tell me what you think\nabout the food. I ate\n$60 worth of wings. Tommy, I'm talking to you. Tommy. -It was only three of them. Shit's good,\nain't it, Tommy? I love the greens. These, whatever these are. Asparagus makes\nyour pee stink. Is that true,\nor is that just just a myth and we went with it? It has an acidic base about it\nand when it mixes with a certain chemical\ninside your body, it lets off a certain scent\nas you urinate. \u266a\u266a What you got\nright there? Zairilla: So we got right here\nmedicated crab legs. Come on with it. Now these crabs normally\na pound go for $275 a pound. -For real? -Yes, sir. When these crabs were alive,\nthey didn't even know this would be\ntheir future. These crabs didn't know\nthey would get shot up with weed and get... -Full of weed, man. ...eaten on Viceland. I don't know how\nto open crab legs. I should've watched\nmore Rick Ross videos and I would know exactly what\nthe fuck I'm doing right now. We got some --\nNow we've got some -- Is that crawfish?

I think chicken and waffles\nis overrated, over-hyped\ncombination of food. So is your heart rate\ngoing up, as well or is it just\nyou're talking crazy? The chicken is Alvin. The waffle is the Chipmunks. How long have you\nbeen smoking, Tommy? Over 50 years. Have you ever been eating\nchicken and then like, \"Yo, I wish I had\nsome waffles with this shit.\" You back on this waffles. What's going on? I never left. I'm a real player when\nit comes to eating delicacies. I remember back\nwhen my chicken wings was between 30 cents\nand 50 cents. Now they're 20 bucks. -You know lamb chops. Since '71.

I was in a urinal,\nI took a piss, some of my pee splashed up\nhit me on my lip. Ruined\nmy mother fucking day. [ Laughs ] Gave you pee breath. All right, look. [ Applauding ] Thank you. Oh, wow. Thank you, guys. [ Cheers and applause ] Thank you. -Can I get a doggy bag? -Absolutely Yeah, we're about to\nget some take-home boxes. It's about that bacon. -Right on. -Bacon, bitch. -[ Laughs ] Thank you. Is it good marijuana? What up, what up. It's your player partner\n2 Chainz checking in and this is \"The Most\nExpensivest: High Roller. My boy, Adam, and my boy, John,\nwe're about to get into some real weed lingo\nand some real prices, y'all. Adam: All right, Chainz, we have\na few very special things for you to try, here. -All right, what you got man? I'm ready. Let's give this honey badger\na whirl. I want to show you\nhow this works. [ Roars ] John: It's got a ceramic tip\nas well as a bubbler. Its like a warm straw. It's essentially\na portable dab ring. Pretty cool. I think we should start\nwith the NBX King Louis, we've been waiting\nfor that. Now, what John is doing\nis he's actually mixing the King Louis\nconcentrate, it's sauce. All right, we're going to wait\nuntil that heats up and then you're going to hit\nthat nozzle. So what do I smoke,\nthe end right here? Yes, sir. As soon as\nI start touching, you're going to\nbreathe in, okay? There you go. \u266a\u266a [ Coughs lightly ] [ Coughing ] Pretty good,\nright there. \u266a\u266a Beautiful flavor profile. Nice and tasty. I'm gonna hit --\nI'm gonna hit it -- I'm --\nI'm gonna hit it -- Yeah. one more time. \u266a\u266a We've got to get it now,\nI like this. Welcome to the club,\nmate. All right. For real, how much\ndoes this stuff cost, man? So the honey badger itself\nis about $250 retail. The sauce itself roughly\nbetween $50 to $60. What makes it special\nis the high terpenes. They've probably got four\nor five different terpenes, like limonene,\nbeta-caryophyllene, myrcene. They're testing around\n13-15 milligrams per, as well as\nyour cannabinoids, so the cannabinoids,\nthe THC is testing probably around\nbetween 75-85%, so you're getting some really\namazing pure stuff there. Cool, so how much does\nsomething like this cost? [ Record scratches ] It's $250 retail. Should we try the buggy? This device here\nis our showpiece, though. Our friends over at Ziggy\nhave been kind enough to provide us this rig\nto be able to play with. Took 14 glassblowers\nseveral hundred hours of work. It's a $150,000 piece. They want\n$150,000 for that? -Yeah. -That's right. You think they would buy it\nand use it or just buy it and keep it\nas an art piece? Typically we wouldn't allow\nsomebody to smoke from this, but, obviously,\nthis is a special occasion. Let's load that up\nwith the King Louis and let's give him\nwhat he wants. Yes, sir. You're going to have to\nput something on that, man, you're going to have\nto put a real boog on that mother fucker\nfor me. -Yeah, I got you. -I've been smoking a long time. All right,\nlet me try this shit. Come on. \u266a\u266a Mm-hmm. \u266a\u266a [ Coughs ] What do you think of\nthe taste and flavorings? [ Smacking lips ] [ Coughs ]\nI like it. Excellent. That's what kind of\nmake this sauce so special. I think\nwe should also try, which one\ndo you want to try, Adam? [ Coughs ]\nOoh. [ Laughs ] -The Alien Bubba. -The Alien Bubba? All right,\nlet's do that one. [ Laughing ] [ Mumbles ]\nI like that flower. You like the flower? Yeah, all this shit\ngets you too geeked. He's too geek --\nIt's too geek -- It's \"2 geeked, 2 fast.\" We've got here a cannagar\nour friends provided for us. This thing's worth, roughly,\nretail side, $500-$600. It's 1,000 milligrams-plus. They're amazing. They made it especially\nfor you, my friend. What they've done is\nthey've ground up the flower, wrapped it\nin palm leaves, and then they dipped it in oil,\nthey've got kief in it. It's a super joint\nis what it is. Do you want to\nlight it up? Sure do. That was\ncustom made for you. It's not a for-sale product\nhere in this market yet. Mmm. So, it's, uh...

So what made you come up\nwith that type of idea? I really, as a kid, loved to get the encyclopedia\ndelivered to my house, so I designed my box\nto kind of look like one. -That's some geek shit. -It is super geek. So, tell me more about\nthe box and everything. -This is a monthly box. -Are these pre-rolled? -These are all pre-rolls. -Let me try this out. This is all different\nkinds of flowers. Man.

This right here is\nsomething special, man. The other product that's part\nof the $24,000 box is this. It's our vape exhale. That's a $3,000 easy bake oven\nand a bubbler all put together. That looks too expensive. I don't want to be\nresponsible for that. On the plane\nthey might mess with it. We've got this vape pen\nwith the gold. This is nice. How do you use this? So this one will do\nvape oil or the flower. -Really? -Yeah. So we just open this one up\nand you grind the flower. I love this. I want you to see one\nmore thing before we go, here. This is my custom box that would\ncome with the $24,000 box. What kind of wood\nis that? So this is\na reclaimed wine barrel. That's dope. That's how I need to get one\nof my floors done, wine barrel. -Somebody locked it on me. -Did you lock it on me already? There it goes. So you open it up... -It's nice, bro.\n-...it's all gold inside. Got your flower all ready,\nloaded up. This stuff\nit'll keep you fresh. It's my box? Is this for me? -That's yours.

I'm happy to be\nreporting on it. I'm happy to be\na tester. Like I said, on this episode\nthere will be no stuntmen or no stunt doubles needed. I'll be here\nto try my own product. I love my job.

Blunt Bongs That's not...that's not weed. Whatever name you give it, cannabis is the most commonly used \u201cillicit\u201d drug in the United States. And it has a pretty prevalent place in our\nsociety, popping up in our media and on the news. Marijuana has long been considered a gateway drug gateway drug gateway drug Marijuana is a dangerous gateway drug. leading to the use of other, more addictive,\nand more dangerous substances. But what does marijuana actually do to to\nthe human brain? ...and body? And is it as dangerous as D.A.R.E. always\nled us to believe? This is drugs. This is your brain on drugs. Any questions? Well, marijuana has been legalized in several\nstates. And it\u2019s legal for medical use in several\nothers. So it\u2019s becoming more mainstream. In fact, it\u2019s legal right here in California. So we went to a local cannabis dispensary\nto talk to some experts in the field. So my name is Shelby. I am the assistant marketing director here\nat Torrey Holistics. Here at Torrey Holistics, we really try to\ndo a lot of education because that's ultimately where we are going to break down the stigma\nwhere people are going to realize the medicinal benefits of cannabis. Torrey Holistics opened as a medical dispensary\nin 2015. We were the first in the state to get our\nrecreational retail license, but we still serve medical and recreational alike. Marijuana use in the U.S. has a pretty interesting\nhistory. Early white colonists brought cannabis to\nNorth America to cultivate as hemp, which was used for making rope, clothing, and paper\nproducts. During the 1800s, it became popular as a medicinal\ntreatment, and \u201chashish houses\u201d flourished. Until 1906 when the Food and Drug Act required\nlabels on anything containing cannabis. Then, as Mexican immigrants began arriving\nin the U.S. following the Mexican Civil War, they brought recreational marijuana with them. Racist anti-immigration sentiment rapidly\nled to fear of the \u201cMarijuana Menace\u201d. In the 1930\u2019s, a string of very dubious\nstudies linked marijuana use to violence and crime. And states began to outlaw the narcotic. When Harry Anslinger, the Chief of the Federal\nBureau of Narcotics was appointed, they were going through a budget cut because of the\nGreat Depression. So to keep his title and keep funding for\nthe department, they actually kind of created this whole scare around cannabis. He started referring to it as \"marijuana\"\nbecause he knew that everybody was already consuming cannabis. It was in tinctures, you could buy at a local\npharmacy. And so the senators who were voting on this\nprohibition bill didn't realize that marijuana was the same thing as cannabis. So they effectively voted to ban the very\nsubstance that they were using for their own medical needs. Following the release of the famous film \u201cReefer\nMadness\u201d in 1936, the federal government passed the Marijuana Tax Act, effectively\noutlawing cannabis except in specific medical and industrial cases. For decades, despite new and better research\nindicating that marijuana isn\u2019t associated with violent crime and debauchery, marijuana\nuse was increasingly restricted. And the punishments for its possession and\nuse became more and more harsh. Anslinger first pushed it as, like, you know,\nlike you're going to be very lustful and you're going to do crazy things, it's a gateway drug. And then he actually changed his rhetoric\nlater in the century to be, like, cannabis as a lazy stoner drug. Like, you don't get anything done, you're\nnot contributing to society at all. This eventually led to all kinds of government\npolicies, like mandatory minimum sentences, a three-strikes policy, and President George\nBush\u2019s War on Drugs. These have had lasting and damaging effects\non many U.S. citizens and the public\u2019s perception of marijuana. You can learn more about the history of these\nlaws and their effects on our country\u2019s citizens by checking out the links in the\ndescription below. But then in 1996, that started to change. Medical marijuana was legalized in the state\nof California. And now, almost twenty years later, cannabis\nhas a pretty prevalent place in our society. Public perceptions and acceptance of cannabis\nhas definitely improved in the last several years. Especially in light of the opioid epidemic,\npeople are much more receptive to a lot of the research and findings coming out. So it might seem kind of weird that we actually\ndon\u2019t know very much about the risks or benefits of marijuana. See, even though it\u2019s becoming legal in\nmore and more states for recreational and medical use, cannabis is still outlawed by\nthe federal government, so it\u2019s heavily regulated and restricted. That means that it\u2019s difficult for scientists\nand doctors to get marijuana to actually use in their research. And without that research, it can be hard\nto say much about the possible dangers or benefits of using the drug. So what do we know? When you smoke a joint and get that high feeling,\nwhat\u2019s happening in your brain? Even that\u2019s not so simple. Cannabis has two major chemical components. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, and cannabidiol, or CBD. Plus smaller amounts of a whole bunch of other\ncannabinoid compounds. These molecules act on what\u2019s called the\nendocannabinoid system in the brain by binding to cannabinoid 1 and 2 receptors. These receptors were actually named after\ncannabis, because they were identified by scientists trying to understand how the drug\nworks. Both kinds of receptors are found throughout\nthe body, but CB1 receptors are the most common in the brain, found at the end terminals of\nneurons. The brain produces endocannabinoid compounds,\nwhich bind to and activate CB1 receptors. Cannabinoid receptors are g-protein-coupled\nreceptors, so when they\u2019re activated, it kicks off a cascade inside the cell that has\nsome effect downstream. In this case, that means modulating the signaling\nat the synapse. The molecular biology of this is actually\nreally really complicated, but in general, activating CB1 receptors has an inhibitory\neffect on the release of a variety of neurotransmitters including dopamine, GABA, glutamate, noradrenaline,\nserotonin, and acetylcholine. Our best understanding of the endocannabinoid\nsystem is that it plays an important role in regulating other systems in the brain and\nthroughout the body. In the brain, endocannabinoid signaling plays\na role in memory, cognition, pain perception, and motor movements. THC is considered a psychoactive compound,\nmeaning that it affects perception, cognition, or behavior. It binds to CB1 receptors, activating the\nendocannabinoid system, and inducing the feelings of relaxation and euphoria that are commonly\nassociated with cannabis use. As well as impairments in spatial and verbal\nmemory. Your license, where is your license? My license. It's on the bumper man, right back there,\nman. No, I mean your driver's license. Oh. Oh yeah, yeah, I've got my driver's license,\nman. Users of marijuana often report enhanced introspection,\nand sometimes feelings of anxiety or paranoia. Cannabis use can also lead to \u201cthe munchies\u201d. Feeling like you\u2019re hungry. Thought to be a result of the way THC is processed\nby the liver. CBD, on the other hand, is not a psychoactive\ncompound. It has the exact same chemical formula as\nTHC, but with a slightly different chemical structure. This means that it binds to the endocannabinoid\nsystem differently, and doesn\u2019t induce those psychoactive effects. But it\u2019s being explored for treating a variety\nof conditions, and is believed to be anti-inflammatory, like ibuprofen. Most notably, it\u2019s used to help prevent\nseizures in very severe types of epilepsy. And it\u2019s being explored for use in treating\nmigraines and anxiety. Speaking anecdotally, I have friends who swear\nby CBD for treating their migraines. So CBD has become more popular in research. And it's showing that it's a very powerful\nanylgesic, very powerful anti-inflammatory agent, and you don't need to experience any\npsychoactivity with it. So now you can consume cannabis without that\npsychoactivity that some people are kind of put off by. You can have the medicinal benefits alone. One thing I always like to say everywhere\nis that if you ever find yourself too high, say you took an edible that you're just feeling\noverwhelmed with, have some CBD on-hand. CBD will bring you down from that high. The products that are available for medical\nand recreational use contain different varieties of cannabis that have different effects. Some have higher levels of THC or CBD, and\ndifferent \u201cstrains\u201d are reported to have different psychoactive effects. Like how people say that indica is \u201crelaxing\u201d\nwhile sativa is \u201cstimulating\u201d. The difference between different strains like\nindica and sativa involves something called the \"entourage effect\", which we use very affectionately in this industry. It has to do with the over 113 different cannabinoids\nand terpenes in the cannabis plant. They play on each other in very unique ways. If you think about how many different sorts\nof combinations those cannabinoids have, all of these different regulatory compounds are working with each other to create a specific effect. How long the sensation lasts depends mostly\non how the cannabis is consumed. If it\u2019s smoked, it usually takes under three\nhours for the sensations to fade. But oral or edible doses can last much longer,\nwith some of the effects lasting up to 24 hours. The research on the therapeutic benefits of\ncannabis use are so far pretty optimistic. Though the studies are still plagued by small\ngroup sizes and restrictions on marijuana use. The long-term effects and risks of cannabis\nuse also depend on how it\u2019s used. Some risks are obvious. Like if you smoke cannabis, you\u2019re at an\nincreased risk of problems like chronic cough, bronchitis, a weakened immune system, and\nlung cancer. Unlike a number of other drugs, like alcohol\nor opioids, cannabis is not physically addictive. That means that if you stop smoking weed cold\nturkey, you might feel irritable, anxious, and have trouble sleeping, but it won\u2019t\nmake you sick. Or...kill you. It\u2019s also thought to be pretty much impossible\nto fatally overdose on cannabis. Last year, the National Institute on Alcohol\nAbuse and Alcoholism stated that 90,000 people died from alcohol-related causes. Whereas, with cannabis, there's never been\na reported incident of an overdose. So yes, it's much safer in that sense. Consuming an very large amount can lead to\nextremely unpleasant consequences, like psychotic episodes, but it won\u2019t directly cause death. But, that doesn\u2019t mean that using marijuana\ndoesn\u2019t come with other kinds of risks. Or that using marijuana can\u2019t have negative\neffects on other aspects of your life, like any kind of drug or addiction. Using marijuana during pregnancy is believed\nto carry risks like a low birth weight and possibly other developmental problems. Though it\u2019s difficult to say if these\neffects are definitely a result of marijuana use or other external factors. If a person starts using marijuana as a teenager,\nbefore their brain has finished growing and developing, it can have long-term effects\non cognition and memory. Researchers have done small studies using\nMRI scans to look at brain structure in adults in their 20\u2019s with people who are diagnosed\nwith a cannabis use disorder... basically meaning that they use a lot of weed,\nand it has negative effects on their lives... and people who don\u2019t use cannabis at all,\nand found that teenagers who smoked pot daily had abnormally-shaped hippocampi and did worse\non long-term memory tasks compared to non-users. Some research has found that heavy cannabis\nuse starting during adolescence can have long-term effects on dopamine signaling in the brain. Dopamine is a chemical that plays important\nroles in reward and motivation as well as movement control. Scientists think that this is likely due to\nheavy marijuana use interrupting normal brain development, resulting in problems with the\nwiring and leading to problems down the line. And in general, people who use a lot of weed\nhave issues with verbal memory and cognitive tasks. Pretty much all of this research has been\ndone in people who use a lot of cannabis. Like, every single day, for extended periods\nof time. So far, we don\u2019t know much about the possible\nrisks of just occasional usage, like in social settings or on the odd weekend. Our view of cannabis use at Torrey Holistics\nis that moderation is key. With anything. You drink too much coffee, you're going to\nget a stomach ache. If you use too much cannabis, you could have\nmemory impairment. But it all comes down to just consuming responsibly. In places where marijuana is legal, it\u2019s\ngenerally pretty easy to access. There are storefront dispensaries where you\ncan talk to \"bud tenders\" and shop for your favorite varieties. Or online sites that allow you to order products\nfor delivery to your front door. But even where it\u2019s legal, there are some\nrestrictions. It\u2019s highly taxed, for one thing, and you\nmust be over 21 to purchase it recreationally, or over 18 to get a medical marijuana card. Cannabis in California, at least, is more\nregulated than the food we're eating. If it's grown on a farm, maybe a mile down\nthe street from another farm that uses pesticides, the labs will pick up on that and it won't\nbe able to be sold. So the cannabis you're consuming, as long\nas it's from a legal, licensed dispensary, is very very safe. And while some surveys indicate that more\nthan half of all Americans have tried cannabis at some point in their lives, around 163 million people, only 4 million people would classify as having\na cannabis use disorder, a rate of about 3%. In contrast, about 5-6% of Americans who try\nalcohol during their lifetime will become addicted. This could be because it\u2019s just generally\nmuch easier to access alcohol than it is to get weed. And we might see those numbers changing if\nmarijuana continues to become more mainstream in the U.S. And remember how marijuana is considered a\n\u201cgateway drug\u201d? While it\u2019s true that marijuana users are\nmore likely to abuse alcohol and nicotine than non-users, the majority of people who\nuse marijuana will never go on to use \u201charder\u201d substances, like opiods. And even when marijuana users do use harder\ndrugs, it\u2019s at the same rate as people who use other already-legal drugs, like alcohol\nand nicotine. So it\u2019s not an effect of cannabis, so much\nas it\u2019s an effect of any drug that affects the reward systems of the brain. There's a misconception that cannabis is a\ngateway drug. And they're finding now that it's actually\nan exit drug. It can be very helpful, actually, in people\nstruggling with addictions. I see the cannabis industry fulfilling the\nneed for alternative forms of pain management. With the opioid epidemic, I think that a lot\nof people are seeking alternative forms of relief. And they're finding that with cannabis. Ultimately, we know that cannabis is a very\ncomplicated plant with complex chemical components. And we don\u2019t fully understand its effects\non the human brain or the long-term risks or benefits of its use. Scientists are hard at working on studying\nthis topic, trying to better understand the chemistry and neuroscience of cannabis as\nit continues to be legalized in more states and becomes more popular nationwide. I'm so excited about the research coming out. Like I was saying, there's so much to be done. Over 113 different cannabinoids that we've\nonly just touched on. So I think that the findings are just going\nto continue to show the medicinal qualities of cannabis. Because it\u2019s still federally outlawed, there\nare a lot of complicating factors in its use and study. Like it might be legal to use cannabis in\nyour state, but you could still lose your job if your employer has a zero-tolerance\npolicy. One issue that I think about a lot is the\nfact that we don\u2019t really have the marijuana equivalent of a breathalyzer to quickly determine if someone is currently under the influence of cannabis or not. That means that unless a police officer actually\nsees a person using weed, it\u2019s really difficult to know if someone is committing a DUI. Because a person might test positive for cannabis\neven many hours and days after its use. At any rate, it seems likely that marijuana\nis at least as \u201cokay\u201d as any other currently legal substance available to the public. That whole \u201creefer madness\u201d thing was\njust propaganda. We must work untiringly so that our children\nare obliged to learn the truth. Because it is only through knowledge that\nwe can safely protect them. So if you live in a place where marijuana\nhas been legalized, enjoy responsibly. Do you have strong feelings about marijuana\nlegalization or its use? What concerns do you have as it becomes more\nprevalent in our society? Or what benefits do you think it might offer? Let us know in the comments below! Thanks for watching this episode of Neuro\nTransmissions and a huge thank you to Shelby and Dr. Beth at Torrey Holistics for their\nhelp with this video. Until our next transmission, I\u2019m Alie Astrocyte. Over and out.", "mAZXWAuWp6E": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make nerd ropes here's what you're going to need two boxes of nerds one cup of gummy bears and some tincture the first step is to fold some foil in an accordion shape and spread it along a baking sheet then you can pour your Nerds into each fold of the tin foil make sure you have enough because if you don't the gummy make sure we'll stick to the tin foil and it'll be harder to take them out after then you'll melt you're going bears in the microwave for about 40 seconds and if you like add 1 tablespoon of ginger and stir it in I'm gonna be pouring my gummy mixture into a squeeze bottle so it'll be easier to dispense be careful not to pour too much just like I did on that first one take it slow and just do a thin line now you can top the ropes with some more nerds once they've all been filled squish the tinfoil together to make them into a tighter more compact shape then put them into the fridge or freezer I still had some remaining mixture left and instead of making more ropes I'm just gonna make some little nerd bytes by using a mold that I had on hand I also added some more nerds on top before I put them into the fridge once they've solidified in the fridge or freezer shake off the excess nerds into a bowl and then peel them off the tinfoil now some of mine came off okay but some of them I had a little more difficulty with so I decided to leave them out for about 24 hours outside of the fridge or the freezer so that they could dry out a little bit more which made them a lot easier to peel off the nerd bites in the silicone mold came out really easily after letting them sit in the freezer for about an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys they turned out so beautifully it did take an extra day for them to drive because they were sticking to the tinfoil but after I let them dry they turned out absolutely wonderful just make sure you put enough nerds on the bottom part of the tinfoil so that you're not having issues with the going mixture sticking I can't believe how fantastic they all came out I'm so excited and they're so delicious because I have already tried some and the little bites are so few I love them so much I could have made more ropes but I kind of liked having these little ones if you just grab I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you to the person who requested me to make this video because I'm absolutely in love with these and I'll be definitely making them again thank you guys so much for watching I hope you try these out have a wonderful day", "INVzvJHc2PA": "hello everybody and welcome back to the channel in today's video we are going to be making cbd oil with a crock pot but before we get into today's video folks if you wouldn't mind if you're new here to the channel please consider subscribing and for those of you that have already subscribed thank you so much i really do appreciate all the support and if you all wouldn't mind please give this video a big thumbs up okay folks so you may or may not know but our farm is solely dependent on our sale of hemp flour and that's what we're going to be using today our hemp flour now if you guys are interested in cbd hemp flour to make your own cbd oil go ahead and check out the link in the description below also go ahead and check out this link up top okay so first and foremost we're going to need cbd flour to make cbd oil you will find an array of options on our website if you're purchasing from us you'll see large flour or regular flour you'll see small flowers you'll see trim and some other odds and ends on there as well but today we're going to be using regular sized hemp flour the variety that we're going to be using is biox which is our most popular flower which is my personal favorite but there's also cherry wine on there i'll sweeten it a bunch of others that are all great as well it really depends on what you're looking for um but today we're going to be using biox and that's probably our most potent flower as well and that really depends on your potency level also and the same thing goes with trim versus small flowers there's a whole bunch of different potencies if you guys have questions go ahead and email me i'll be absolutely happy to answer any and all questions that you guys have about the hemp flour okay so we're going to need some stuff to make cbd oil with a crock pot unlike using an expensive machine like the magical butter machine you're going to need some other kitchen gadgets in order to make cbd oil correctly at home with a crock pot and so first and foremost we need a carrier oil now this is obviously you use this for a magical butter machine or any other machine we're going to use mct oil today other popular carrier oils are hemp oil and olive oil i really don't like olive oil that's just my personal preference i do love mctl it's the best carrier oil of all of them but if you're looking for a little added flavor hemp oil if you can find it is really good as well but today we're going to be using mct oil and the reason why coconut oil and other oils aren't in this is well coconut oil will be solid at room temperature so that's not good for cbd oil and other ones don't have the necessary fats to be a superior carrier oil and you really need that absorption rate to be high especially for a crock pot okay obviously next you will need a crock pot um these are relatively inexpensive you can get them for like 15 online you don't need a large one uh your batches are going to be anywhere between one to two cups of oil and one to two ounces of flour so really you don't need a large crock pot a three to six quart crock pot is plenty um another thing you will need is something to decarb with now we're going to use our magical butter d card box i love it there's no point in using a pyrex dish if i have this but you can use a pyrex dish with a cover that works as well and this will be one of the first steps we do here as we make our cbd oil the next thing you definitely need is going to be a filter of some sort some people use a cheese cloth um i don't i've never used that i've always used the magical butter filters you can get this pack on their website or you can get any type of micron filter i believe it has to be 150 or more um that's just what we use uh you can go more or less probably depending on the amount of plant material that's going to go through or how many times you actually want to sift through it this package also comes with a silicone glove i really like using that too especially when we're squeezing out the oil but that's going to be later on in the video now this part isn't necessary um to use i'm going to show you how to get around this but a lot of people will use this to cut up or grind up their flower a nutribullet or a magic bullet of anything like this to cut up the flower pre-decarb but i'm going to teach you a trick today on how you can avoid that it takes a little time but there's a trick now if you buy your hem flower from us it's going to come in a package exactly like this this is a pre-packaged um one ounce pre-packaged from us and what we'll do is we're gonna throw this in the freezer for four to six hours and what that does is it makes the hemp fiber very brittle and once it's brittle you can scrunch it all up in the bag and boom you don't have to use a grinder to cut up a flower we've already done that process and here we go here is our scrunched up flower and a ziploc now you don't have to use the bag if you if you're not purchasing from us use a ziploc same exact method in there for four to six hours scrunch it up and we're good to go so we've already done this step i'm not going to time lapse it or anything like that you will need to cut it up one way or another whether it's the bullet or it's through uh freezing it so let's dive into making cb duo with your crock pot here at home and get into the next step okay folks let's get into making cbd oil with our crock pot here we have already measured out a cup of mct oil so we're going to get that in the crock pot now to get it warmed up this process doesn't take very long but this is going to be the first thing you're going to want to do is measure out your oil and get it into the crock pot we're going to put it on low and we're just going to let it sit all right we're going to move this off to the side here for a minute next thing we're going to do is we are going to use our magic butter d card box again you can use a pyrex dish as long as it has a cover or any other baking dish as long as it has a cover now what you're going to be doing is you're going to be de-carving so get your oven preheated to 250 degrees 250 all right so we're going to preheat our oven right now again 250 uh preheat and then once we put this stuff in there it's going to be going in for 30 minutes now again you're either going to this step you're going to be blending your hemp flour which i just don't like making a mess so that's really just not what i want to do but this is an option you can do that get that you take your um your shredded up flour whether you use the magic bullet or you use the freezer method like we did and you're just going to pour it in to your d carb box whether that's the pyrex or this particular box you're gonna make sure that it's nice and even you're gonna cover it and we're gonna throw it into the oven for about a half an hour once it's preheated to 250 degrees so that's what we're going to flash forward to next and then we'll start getting into making the cbd oil okay folks so let me move this out of the way here real quick all right so we have done we are done with the d-carb process again 250 degrees for 30 minutes and there is your nice fresh ground uh cbd hem flower so now we're ready to go um but before we dive into putting it into crop i want to make sure that this isn't the end-all be-all recipe so we used one cup of mct oil for one ounce of hemp flour you can use two cups you can use less flour you can use more flour it really depends on what you want but i'm going to stand by one cup per one ounce if you want to go less you know you can use 14 grams of flour per cup i really don't recommend anything less than that because i don't think you'll get a good experience with cbd i just don't think the potency will be there for you the other thing about the crock pot too it's not nearly as efficient as the magic butter machine so this is going to be a process it is going to be in the crock pot for four to eight hours really depends on when you're ready the longer it has to be in there to cook into the oil the more chance of a higher absorption rate so just remember that as well and again guys you can find all this stuff on our website or feel free to leave a comment or email me and you can find us on facebook and instagram as well if you need to get in touch with me through there okay so let's go ahead and get this going into the crock pot now remember we put this on low already the oil is already nice and warm we have our ounce of ground flour here and we're going to go ahead and dump it right into the crock pot okay so now that that's done we're just gonna move around the flower and we're going to let it cook down [Music] and that's really all we're doing now we're going to let this cook down absorb all into the oil we're gonna cover it again you can use more oil or or i wouldn't use anything less than a cup of oil but you can use more oil like two cups we're just doing a very small batch for the video but as you can see it's already starting to go right into the oil so now we're going to check it about every hour on low so we'll see in another hour and then we're going to repeat that for probably six hours for this particular batch so that is how we get started making our cbd hemp oil in a crock pot okay folks we have let this go for about eight hours i lost kind of track of time and we've been stirring about every hour and this is what it looks like right now very liquidy you know all broken down and that's what you want to look like again you got to go for the longer cook with the crock pot i know with the magic butter machine it's four hours but you're really safe with an eight hour on low cook um of course the setting is low for the crock pot so now what we're going to do is we're going to get our strainer again this is something you're going to have to purchase in order to make cbd oil and then we're going to get some gloves and we're going to slowly pour this into the strainer all right so here we go again it's a balancing act with the strainer just got to take your time get this out of the way here you're just going to let it all go into the strainer there kind of write it up a little bit now again we only did a cup of oil very small batch and what you can do now is get all the plant material in there much as you want because what you're going to do now is once it's in the strainer you can squeeze every last bit of oil out of the flour because the flour does absorb some of the oil okay now one of the things that you get with the magical butter kit uh when it comes to buying these strainers is they give you the silicone glove it's pretty important because it helps you squeeze out all the [Applause] oil all right that's about all you can have with that and then you can put it in your container whatever you desire whether it's a droplet bottle a mason jar but this is the finished product this is your cbd oil and you made it with a crock pot so that's really it for today's video guys if you have any questions feel free to comment in the video uh or you can reach us um via facebook or instagram or email if you guys are interested in the hemp flower that we use today go ahead and check out our website link in the description below but that is all i have for you guys today i hope you enjoyed the video hope you all stay happy healthy and i'll see you in another video", "pWxQLhCM2cg": "are we going to look back at this time and think that was the time when cannabis really took off where it was really publicly accepted where the money could be made absolutely oh yeah know for sure when we opened our first store one of our investors was learning jujitsu so that he could better handle himself in the event that he did go to prison Steve white CEO of harvest health and recreation one of the largest cannabis companies in the US what's changed I mean what is it about right now historically for the average investor cannabis was way too risky in a couple of years your question is whether or not everybody's going to be on board so right now you're in that sweet spot where you can have where you could make tremendous returns if you invest in cannabis we're at an inflection point the golden era of cannabis investing yes I will say this is the golden era I truly believe that Danny Moses legendary investor who bet against subprime mortgages aka the big short in Danny Moses the optimist of the bunch and a hell of a trader and so that was the big short yeah is this a big long this is the big long it's the best macroeconomic opportunity I've seen within the US markets in my career was there a light bulb situation when you thought this is it this could be a huge business well I went to a dispensary in Denver right when the market opened and it was eye-opening Vivian Azer the first pot stock analyst for a major investment firm Cowen and company there were young people there were old people there were people that looked affluent and not and keep in mind five years ago it was still really taboo in five to ten years how big will this industry being according to your estimates from cannabis in the US should be as big as tobacco in u.s. Wow Melissa joins me now and it's interesting because this is all about cannabis the product I'm hearing more about than ever is CBD I mean at what point does CBD just become one part of this industry as it gets more and more legalized well at this point even the estimates hi projections for the CBD market vs. whole plants by 2025 are much smaller at 16 billion dollars by 2025 versus 67 billion the whole plant so still marijuana the plant itself whether it's used for recreational use or for medicinal use is seen as a bigger opportunity CBD right now because you're seeing it everywhere you're seeing a proliferating creams etc absolutely on the drug store shelves it's it's easily accessible to the consumer but there are questions about CBD as well I mean about the medical a fit effect you can see they claim it can do it everybody exactly and and is there the research to support that we don't have firm research yet and that's why it can't be put into the food supply for instance right or it's not supposed to be anyway post yes it's not legal if if you consume CBD and so for cannabis so a lot of these companies are Canadian I mean what is the pathway to investment if that's if they think this is the big long so the Canadian companies because it was federally legal they had access to their exchanges they had access to our exchanges for instance that's why you hear about companies like tilray that went public at the Nasdaq with sky-high market caps of you know when they first went public twenty billion dollars bigger than American Airlines for the US companies because it's not federally legal they can't list so they list on smaller OTC exchanges exchanges in Canada and not being federally legal or at least not having the infrastructure so they can tap traditional banking they can do things like write off business expenses that's really Han handcuffed them to some degree but at this point multi-state operators are publicly traded they are invested and some investors like Danny Moses say that's that's where the gold is gonna be made so there they you it because there's that potential of when the spigot turns on yeah this big it will really turn you you", "rMMHqxyvVAU": "so what's up everybody welcome back to chef Judy's TV on today's episode of in the kitchen we're gonna be cooking cannabis infused cooking oil so what I have right here I have about 34 grams of shake I have about two cups of cooking oil and have about two cups of butter this video is sponsored this video sponsored by blessings on blessings dispensary in LA there are just 2157 west century Boulevard on the corner of Van Essen century so if you guys are ever in LA go ahead and check them out I'll leave all their informations in the description box down below but yeah they actually provided me with the shake for you guys that don't know what shake is shake is basically the leaves that fall out put a flower and settle at the bottom of the container this is some really high-grade shake it came from a high-grade plant if you guys get if you guys that's not as very much like you're just filling up my whole house my neighbors won't be big on big beech over here some but yeah so blessing a blessing dispensary supplied me with the shake shout out to my homie swag City over there he didn't want to subscribe me with the shake thank you guys for sponsoring this video but without further ado we gonna jump into it alright so the first thing we want to do is we want to decarboxylate the weeds basically we want to activate that Tec so the way we do that is we throw it in the oven a 250 degree oven for about 25 minutes and it activates that THC that way we can put it into oil and do a further second step to activate the marijuana into the oil so I'm gonna go ahead and throw this in the oven and I'll see you on about 25 minutes alright peace so it's been about 25 minutes we just got the weed out of the oven as you can see I got separated to two piles 17 grams each like I said if you guys can see that color it got a little bit darker so now all that has to do is add the week to the jars and put the jars in a double boiler not really a double boiler I'm gonna do is put the jar and in a pot in the water that's slightly boiling like a like a mouth simmer you want the water to be about maybe 200 degrees and you want to put that in the water for about an hour and a half - two hours all right so now we're just going to transfer the weed to the jar I like to use the napkins cause as you can see it transfers very easy yeah I can see downtown let's begin for a same thing with your butter sack just to the butter so once again that's 17 grams of shake and about 2 cups of oil 2 cups of fat if you want to use the flour you can use a flower but cut that use about maybe a 8 3.5 grams of flour because the flour has more THC to the shanks so we're gonna have to go ahead and throw this into our boiler that got fitted over here slightly balding and we're gonna leave that in there for about an hour and a half to two hours we go come back and start pretty ugly I'll see y'all when it's finished all right peace alright everybody so a bit about an hour and a half we can go ahead and take these off now this one was my butter so we're going to do the butter first we got our storage containers right here this was restored in we got our strainer we also use coffee filters excreted and also this would be a double strain on there right oh so we don't do that like that big I like that hopefully I won't make a mess I'm kind of rushing because I got a I got a flank that I'm leaving for in an hour so kind of rushing but we still gonna do this the right way alright so this been in the pot boiling for about an hour and a half now we're just gonna strain it out and store it and that's all there is to it and that's how you make the butter and the oil alright so go ahead goodies over here at that point we make a mess kind of hot really I really wanted to use cheesecloth but I don't useful it's gonna take forever I'm just using the gate to squeeze not everything all - next one medicated [Music] [Music] sorry about the TV in the background I forgot to take that TV off okay it's not good like I said I'm Russian so I'm gonna do a better video I'm doing better videos to show y'all how it's really done but coming with a rush but like I said I'm leaving in an hour to go to Atlanta once again a shout-out to my sponsors blessings on blessings dispensary on the corner of venice and century in los angeles if you guys are in the area please check them out tell them chef doing since you get some good herbs all right [Music] got all that that's real strongly medicated so here we have our butter and here we have our olive oil there we have people Canada's tenderloin like I said you can use this in all kind of applications you could just do it on your bread you could put it on steak chicken fish whatever you wanted to use it for we have our butter and we have our olive oil or I was a lot of butter butter olive oil I don't know I got confused I'm confused right now I've got a flavor in our anyway as always if you don't like what y'all saw here hit

up it is 3 p.m on a sunday afternoon thanks for tuning into cannabis legalization news where we explain marijuana so you can change them today we're going to be talking about three policy makers who are just showing their whole ass to the whole world uh let's see we're also going to do an update about mexico and malta and somebody in detroit is suing detroit for just some petty stuff so let's just get right into it hey mickey hey tom oh i can wait i'm reporting from 1937. we have a breaking story that's come across the line for cannabis legalization news thank you for joining us everybody since it's 1937 we're gonna say i hope that you've turned up your radio as opposed to likes and subscribes uh governor ricketts who i'm assuming was the appointed governor of nebraska in 1937 says if you legalize marijuana you're gonna kill kids what was the date of that article maybe that was a march 14th 2021 what march 14th 2021 oh that makes me angry i mean i understand when it's something that is just so wrong that you think it's from like 1937 but when it's from 2021 and it's a governor in a position of power saying that weed will kill your children it is just a lie it's the same type of why we've been fighting against on this program and thank you for joining us by the way uh since 2019 starting with the 19. corn [ __ ] are in charge of nebraska dude period the the balls there's only one nut in nebraska yeah there's nothing i mean like i would i would probably be fine going through life as a cat lawyer in nebraska simply because they'd be like well at least he's not on wheat yeah and you're white and i'm white that also helps this haircut probably doesn't let's see that haircut picture that uh governor pete ricketts is rocking so governor pete ricketts uh gave a press conference as you can see he has adopted the lex luthor-esque uh seriously dude like like evil incarnate is right like yeah stereotype right there right and governor pete ricketts and other prohibitionists in nebraska held a conference on wednesday in the capital rotunda just ahead of a unicameral hearing on medical marijuana legalization mmj is in front of nebraska lawmakers for a fifth consecutive year months after losing ballot approval in the 11th hour last fall following a ruling by the nebraska supreme court governor ricketts said if you legalize marijuana you're going to kill your kids that's what the data shows from around the country um you know that is the biggest lie that i've heard all day simply because uh children are not dying from cannabis they aren't if anything in legal cannabis states children's schools are getting funded children have a harder time accessing cannabis especially in states where the illicit market is allowed to participate in the uh regulated market so all those people that were because you know you know who doesn't card right nikki oh dealers drug dealers don't card and so like i see stuff like this and when i see stuff like the the caps in florida when they say that this is about you know preventing our children our children are going to have brain damage and you're like no well you preventing the 10 percent uh flower cap on thc for medical cannabis or for lawfully purchased cannabis just means that the dealer down the street can be like you don't want those nuggets i got the real thc in my nuggets right here and because it's illegal i'm not going to be carding to see whether or not you're over 21 or paying my taxes but it'll still be a cash transaction this is how you get spice outbreaks and other uh outbreaks of bad drugs when uh you know overall you know my 100 percent and legalization but it's also our harm reduction and how we treat just our perception of of what it is like this is complete [ __ ] like complete idiots see like what the how are you shoveling stupid to your people and then still get reelected like how is this like like like like does anybody even ask like hey where are the kids that are dying like like show me the data show me on the doll where marijuana touched you but let me uh just continue to read some of his stuff and i hope that i don't get too upset about it so governor ricketts we already said that ricketts continued marijuana has big impacts on people's cognitive abilities changes their gray matter in the brain damages their ability to be able to develop their cognitive abilities to be able to think to do well in school this is something that's harming our young people and it continues on through the workforce so uh you know i didn't use cannabis when i until i was in college i've been a c student since i was four and so i know i'm pretty sure maybe if i would have smoked weed when i was in high school i would have done better but but no probably not have you ever gone to school it's exceedingly boring the only people that do really really well are the people that are like oh you listened to what the teacher said kissed her ass a little bit and then did it a-plus this kind of stupid does not do your constituents doesn't do america any favors like this is the kind of [ __ ] that so you're saying a guy who lives in a legal state you or me or anybody in legal states deserves to be behind bars because pandemonium has erupted you know this is it's and then not only that you're saying in order to save the children we need to keep it illegal so that the children can continue to access it through drug dealers as opposed to cannabis will no longer necessarily be something that drug dealers are stocking because people that can actually buy sell and grow it uh on a local level uh and where it's licensed and where the purity is regulated and then not only that where they're like i need to see your id oh i don't have my id get out dude safe access isn't is about uh uh you know it's the the the plant itself being a good plant like good product good known product and it's also about a safe place where you can pick it up like i go to the store and pick it up dude yesterday i just went to uh uh uh stop by have a heart and i picked up this uh for my sponsor washington blood code thank you so much so good um so good dude i've been smoking mids for so long i forgot what good we was like and oh my god this is the champagne the weed but anyways uh uh you know i went to the store yesterday they had a long line and everybody was a good citizen there was no cops no raids like the the kind of civility that happens when it's legal and people don't treat it like the [ __ ] up ignorant type [ __ ] that they're preaching in this like your kids no your kids are in trouble with the law because of this the law is the the issue not the plan this is not you know it's ignorance 101. you know ricketts said that the use of marijuana has a huge human toll sharing examples of two fatalities he says were linked to ingested marijuana or thc let's see the death report on those two fatalities meanwhile how many uh people have died of the coronavirus in nebraska or how many people died of heart disease in nebraska how many people have died of alcohol poisoning or like liver failure in nebraska how many people are dying of cheeseburgers in nebraska but for some reason if you legalize weed children are going to be the one who access it that why alcohol is still illegal because then uh children would would ha not be able to access or the children would be able to access alcohol i mean like it just makes no sense what they're saying the same thinking as like you know in legal states they're trying to put limits on what's already out there but we got to think about the children are you [ __ ] kidding me children will go to the store you're not allowed in the store you've got to be 21 and over so you're there and you've robbed the weed dealer and so now the weed dealer isn't necessarily going to be on the streets no more especially if you regulate your plant correctly and you make it really really easy for those growers to get licensed so suddenly they're trying to go legit because they don't want to be looking them behind them and see if everything's going to get shut down they're going to take everything they own they would prefer to be legal themselves and then again i don't know who's selling this weed to kids but i do know that it's not the licensed operators i mean when you know back in traditional days you know i don't ever recall being asked like hey uh can you prove me who you are and what state or what a idea is you know this is uh this is just dumb this is dumb and it's hurting this this this is the type of [ __ ] that hurts our society in the whole like you know i travel the bus you know to work every day when i when i come in i go through the city and i don't know if you know but seattle's a pretty big city you know and uh we have a huge homeless problem and a lot of these people freaked out like during the uh uh what was that when we had the chop and and all the maggot people were freaking out about like antifa and you know we're just uh uh un uh dystopian society well the thing is you know we have a large homeless population of people living in tents [ __ ] that i haven't seen in a long time and it has nothing to do with legalization but people point to this like acceptance of like but part of the problem is how we view mental health and drug addiction like harm reduction is 100 percent what we should be doing not incarcerating and uh putting things on prohibition like uh dr carl hart billion dollars out of the depend defense department's trillion dollar budget to help the [ __ ] homeless people why why do we do maybe it's because we like seeing homeless people so we can judge them as being bad so that we can be like you know not that guy i got some things going on uh but it's just so mean and so stupid how we do this stuff and so like you know again the ama one of the organizations that ricketts mentioned quoted a january article about a mississippi ballot initiative that said while it's possible there may be beneficial medical uses of marijuana numerous evidence-based studies demonstrate that significant deleterious effects abound and the article also notes that such measures put physicians at risk of criminal and civil liability now the ama is full of scientists and they should be better than that because they should know that the reason why numerous deleterious effects abound is because those were the only studies that got funded and they were trying to find any deleterious effect and then one of the big risk factors is the risk of criminal and civil liability that has nothing to do with the cannabis plan and everything to do with the legality and the scheduling of the cannabis plant agree yeah this type of [ __ ] until it's over so you know if if you guys have not yet i mean like you're not you can't disrespect the office but you can invoke people out of office you know you can't you can be polite but firm and then of course then if you're a trumper you can just forget that america is a thing and do whatever you want until like again you get arrested but don't recommend that you know you're not going to convince these people of this because they're already in belief of stuff that ain't real you know it is this is oh my god dude this is why i smoke some good weed like this is why you need good weeds just to put up with this [ __ ] this this idiot odyssey uh that this guy is a representative of a group of people in america and then he has a bunch of other people that agree with him that you know what studies are you guys looking at where are you why why is this such a thing for you to to deny like prohibition doesn't work right we've had how many billions devoted against uh this plan howard buffett and because warren buffett's kid is crazy and he's an anti-prohibition guy and he's got billions of dollars and so that's one of the reasons why uh macon and and uh not detroit the detroit of illinois decatur uh has had such a hard time in illinois getting more licenses and opting in to allowing cannabis businesses is that howard buffett spends all this money on propaganda and of course like the picture of mr ricketts at the podium he's at a sam podium smart approach marijuana the most ironically named anti-marijuana uh organization in the free world but and this is why we don't have nice things because these well it is not us per se but like the [ __ ] and government the people who are running the show the ones who are the authorities right like ones that are stuck right here in 1957 you know where things were easier because you didn't have to really think you could just depress people and believe in crap and then you know what didn't matter you just had to make sure that you had a good haircut and you're white especially a man and then you could just tell people facts yeah yeah make [ __ ] up [ __ ] and that's the problem like so the ama they're like a roller coaster too and i think anything that is a entity in government is a roller coaster of this opinion on cannabis like with the va you know one year it's like don't do it next year it's like okay we're gonna think about letting you guys do it so it's okay it's not a plant that's killed anybody no one's proven anything and now it's like don't do it again people it's not this conversation is so more about wellness and social justice that at the end all game everything that we preach about this is the greatest hypocrisy we got going on right now oh yeah and the hypocrisy continues because ricketts also cites the american psychiatric association a dubious association in my book if you ever see how antipsychotics work which pdf is 2019 position statement on the matter posted online uh and the document concludes with the apa does not endorse cannabis medicine the words danger or dangerous don't appear in the document however it does say in part policy and practice surrounding cannabis-derived substances should not be altered until sufficient clinical evidence supports such changes well that's effing impossible because of the way that the funding is currently set up the only funding is for finding harm there is no funding in for finding benefit because that would defeat the purpose of schedule one tac if you think about too a a psychological company they're not there to help you get better i mean like the if they were they would be promoting what would help which is treatment and and and consultation and you know they there's no magic [ __ ] pill that makes anything better like whether it be uh schizophrenia i mean it helps but things with treatment need to be done like that's this is just pure fear mongering of taking care of yourself you know the endocannabinoid system i'd imagine you know it's entwined with your nervous system your bone structure seriously throw that freaking back into the pipe of the american psychiatric association uh so this endocannabinoid system that we discovered approximately 30 years ago and i've done a lot of research on predominantly in israel where it's more lawful to actually do research that's objective as opposed to trying to find the harm why isn't that enough i mean like we know that it's a biological system in our body we know why it works we know what it does we know that it doesn't kill people now does it i'm not sitting there saying like we should give it to children no right the stuff your home it's it's that as as dr ethan russo told us and if you haven't seen that episode on cannabis legalization news smash the likes hit subscribe and then search uh ethan russo cannabis legalization news on youtube and you'll find it and he does a great job explaining that this is the chief homeostatic regulation regulation system on your body or in your body stuff doesn't usually get out of whack when you're a kid stuff starts your whack more and more as you get older more and more after you've seen enough rotations around the sun where you're going to get injured or where you're going to get old or where you're going to have pain or where you know you might have um audio audio auto immune diseases like crohn's or ibs or or lupus or or uh so many other diseases that your endocannabinoid system's out of whack on and and the only thing we clearly have is we have a governor of nebraska that's suffering from uh cannabinoid deficiency and we all are paying the price for and by we all i mean like i have to read this and get like so mad that suddenly i become cyclops without his freaking visor and then um not only that you know those poor people in nebraska that actually need access safe access to their medicine what are they doing well they've probably already moved yeah now i'm proud that i cursed not as much as i thought i was going to on this uh i mean really i was heated when i saw the topic i was like oh man oh she's gonna be effing all the time keep rolling on to the next one i'll go back to 1937. hang on [ __ ] let's cut uh okay so the next story is just as bad as the first story tennessee republican wants to permanently block recreational marijuana through state constitution in tennessee yeah and this this one even it gets worse right so representative brandon ogles of franklin tennessee received approval in the house criminal justice subcommittee for house joint resolution 140 which would amend the state constitution prohibit future general assemblies from permitting recreational drug use now the hate and stupidity does not stop there it goes on to the potential constitutional amendment would also prevent the state legislature from ever legalizing rape human trafficking or prostitution without making any another change to the founding document like how are you going to put rape and and prostitution in the same like the thinking here is not you're putting rape in par what was it prostitution yeah one of those things is consensual and then the one with the cannabis that you're putting in there there's no psychological dispute or there's no real psychological damage for adult use cannabis but anyway this is one of those things where i'm so angry and it's 420 somewhere that we can test the official position of the department or the ministry of health of japan this should make me violent so violent that maybe i'll even have more burning eyes after this 420 bumper [Applause] [Music] okay it was all a lie tell the minister japan that it'll kick in i'm sure your anger will [ __ ] well now as we continue on with this one anger is going to continue on ahead of wednesday's meeting yeah although amended the resolution he initially filed to also include the ban on legalization of recreational use of substance on the federal drug schedules list the item first only pertain to sex crimes i mean come on man do we i mean what kind of [ __ ] stupid like how are you gonna ever like first off why do you even need a bill for legal like we're gonna stop like we're gonna make sure no one ever legalizes rape like like was that ever an issue where is the legalization of rape uh lobby that's like you know what we need we need to legalize that uh rape but this is that [ __ ] we're like i'm doing a good thing here but at the same time we gotta get the we people like they're all the same people right yeah because there's there's two stops after marijuana uh the first one is human trafficking and the second one is rape you know according to the ministry of japan cannabis use makes you violent uh man like the problem the real problem with the the laws are that they're so wrong that they like we're not trying to get like censored by youtube we're trying to like say like no there's an endocannabinoid system this is why medical marijuana actually works here's how these other things work you really have nothing to fear about this plant it's terribly over regulated you guys are just causing yourself unnecessary harm because you believe in fat fantasy and lies and remember everybody in this country was [ __ ] brought up to believe that santa claus is a real goddamn thing that brings you toys in order to support your parents to be able to manipulate and control you and then we're like shocked that our leaders are still feeding us lies and garbage so they can manipulate and control us but that's the thing though man everybody's between the santa claus lies and the [ __ ] the government's here to help you lies i mean gary's been swayed government's a little kind of like a wizard like the government is basically santa claus to a certain extent especially in america shout out to rob man thanks for tuning in really appreciate it um love that show up clt be in the grommies man hell yeah and so um i had a point most mostly my point is um sometimes when i read the news out of the south or nebraska i feel like it's before we had technicolor before we had science facts or even knew what the endocannabinoid system is it's a very special time that makes me angry but this is why flower states get a bad rep this is why the flower states when everybody thinks that you're you know uh banjo uh i hear songs coming when i walk you know i mean like it's just you're being a stereotype stop being stupid stupid stop it stop stop hurting your people stop hurting america i mean essentially all gays told the committee this will ensure we never have recreational drug use in the state because it's illegal to drink i'm assuming or smoke cigarettes in tennessee this will ensure that we never have recreational drug use in the state i think it's a very much an expression of the value system we have in the south in this state again evidently you're not allowed to drink or smoke cigarettes in tennessee or maybe not even have coffee where do we draw the line on drugs because like with this unlike with coffee i don't have to filter this through water to make an extraction first off it wouldn't work if i was going to make an extra extraction from it i would do it with a more of a polar solvent you know like an alcohol and or a butter however then sure that's more of a drug coffee is more of a drug than cannabis flour cannabis flour is a plant again the perception of drug use and how we interact with drugs and how we treat things because like you're saying it's a variety of things from coffee to heroin right let's just it's everything it's sugar you know and if we can just learn the chemistry won't be a drug let's all realize how much of a drug sugar is you take the sugar cane and then you gotta process the crap out of the sugar cane so much so that you can strip out any plant material what so frickin ever and then you get what's the chemical composition i know it's carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen because it's an organic molecule but what a hey if you're watching out there and you know the chemical symbol for uh sugar uh and that that that would be of course um uh sucrose not uh dextrose or or fructose uh we're gonna go with uh is glucose because glucose and fructose put together is sucrose that's sugar did you say [ __ ] those we are yes this is what happens when cannabis legalization news get enough gets onto a tangent we should have a tangent bumper but the thing is though i mean come on this is the [ __ ] with the the save the children and the recreational drugs we'll never we don't need this in our not my backyard [ __ ] children and so like if i'm gonna be giving uh their kind of bs lines i should at least look like a cat if i'm gonna say like we need to make sure we have cannabis concentration limitations for our regulated cannabis markets for the children i should look like a cat if i if i'm telling my voters my elected representatives in nebraska that the reason why medical cannabis should not come to nebraska is because it kills children i should look like a cat because you are in a freaking world of fantasy it's not real and you should be robbed of your reality if you're saying dude i you know it's just hard to see that there's so much stupid out there but at the same time i know we have a lot of good people and that's the thing like everybody's like oh this legalization is going to happen tomorrow this legalization is going to happen tomorrow and you and me and then if you're joining us on wednesday you should hit them thumbs up subscribe and then tune in on wednesday we're going to talk about tommy chong and all the weedy smokes for the past 60 years um but that's a point of it man like you know chong probably thought it was gonna be 10 years away 40 years ago i thought it was going to be five years away 10 years ago you know and and then some people think it's going to be tomorrow this year and it ain't because some people think that cannabis will kill kids and not only do they think it they have press conferences where they announce it as if it's a fact and again if it the more act or whatever happens if something happens even though uh what's the shunmu turquoise session where he talks about like it's always a priority for democrats like i'm not gonna see i'm not i will be excited we will go live the day of if something goes through a bill where they say hey like we did it to the moor act originally but i'm not holding my breath man like this is not you know we've we've but we are they've gotten everything off their plate though and so like i'm yeah i'm optimistic that the second half because now we're getting into the 420 time and so uh after wednesday we're past st patrick's day and then it's the next holiday is really easter and 4 20. and so i'm thinking that that's probably where they're going now that they've gotten the senate all of washington's gotten the 1.9 trillion dollar corona relief package uh signed sealed and delivered on to the next one and maybe some of that next one is going to be that uh cannabis package coming out of the senate you know we will be going as soon as we have details on that yeah no i just you know uh being that we're further than we were which is nice but again it's never far enough when people like lance gore hasn't seen his mom and his daughter personally in six years like how does he let the prosecutor that's wrong not even just but not just the prosecutor but the visitation visits like like he hasn't had access like so that nut job in the the buffalo guy the when they the insurgency when that guy took over that [ __ ] got a in meeting with with the news people like the following day lance hasn't seen his mom or his daughter his daughter graduated high school uh college and uh uh like brilliant kid um without her dad like prom all this [ __ ] all the life stuff like she's got a dude i mean just life like the government has taken away this man's life and not just his but many others you know women this is [ __ ] they're a plant and what does this plant do makes you better well again it it helps regulate your homeostasis levels yes and so like uh if you have things like think about anxiety or anything else or like you know pain stuff where your your central nervous system is kind of like freaking out a little bit uh that may be why your cb2 receptors are all over those types of areas in your body and then also maybe while your cb1 receptors are very very concentrated in your brain except not in your brain stem and so like you're not going to stop breathing like you can with alcohol or opium or opioids this is not an opinion this is a biological fact based on thousands of dead people tens of thousands of dead people and how many of them were dead from marijuana you know two people did get hit by a bale of it and so they were like moving a couple of bales and and oops but that was a farming accident that really wasn't but you know like you're like you're saying though like it's it's a stabilization of your body like kind of like how you have centrum for women and centered from old men for seniors right like there's skywalker you know there's the sky master sky master excuse me i mean this thing dude i really tell the difference of really good weed these are all top colas and uh i've been buying mids man right at the top oh yeah that's that's good i've been powering through in the gang oh look at hey uh slowly now now let's see if you can get the autofocus going put it up a little bit higher your eyes and it might block off your face okay uh there it is this is what we're fighting for everybody i feel like we're on a uso show but we're looking at pictures of weed right oh i mean just the fact that this people are serving time or this little amount right here not even not even a gram probably uh it would put you in trouble like in tennessee like you like as soon as you're in town you drive through the the state line you're ass puckers and you're going to be like all right if that one cop sees me because i'm too dark and decides to pull me over and happens to smell something i'm [ __ ] yeah but let's get back to this [ __ ] who's in charge of tennessee olgas is his name or olga's uh o-g-l-e-s it's uh i think it's norwegian for stupid but uh amending the state constitution is a years-long process the legislature must approve a resolution with the proposed language in two separate general assemblies hopefully one is not run by you know people who don't believe in science uh meaning it would need to be taken up by the legislatures in 2023 or 2024 session if it passes this section or session hopefully then this means this was just grandstanding on the part of the governor and the reason why you grandstand as a politician is because you're supposed to be solving problems and all the problems were caused by all the politicians before you and now you're going to be the only one that escapes this this uh causing of problems by politicians and fixes everything so uh what pardon you missed the uh the awesome statement here august also added that those long-standing southern values were eroded in virginia as a result of the recent legislation like like what's up these people with their values like there's a guy on the floor the other day that said i know that black lives matter don't like traditional family what the [ __ ] are you talking about we all have moms dads people we love like what the what kind is this [ __ ] values like we are not going to believe in science and we will oppress people is is that one of the values what are these when you say values it could be just a bouquet of freaking flowers man well what type of flowers are they daisies you know are they uh are they marigolds are they uh dandelions or you got something worthwhile for us you know like you know what are you what are you saying these values are because values could be racism you know that's the value is that the value they want is because like the values against the south it sounds like that they're really upset with because you know virginia actually legalized it sounds like the values they want are not believing in science and oppressing people because they can that sounds like a really un-american value i wouldn't be sad if he happened to walk outside and got throw punched but you know whatever no no no you're not allowed to do that he's an elected official you have to respect the office and that's why you vote him out of it because he's clearly not qualified damn right i mean he's preaching goddamn third grade like like who is your audience who what is the educational level for your constituents like i feel sometimes sad like please tell me i not all of uh what messed up state is this not all tennessee things like this i know they don't let's bring it home because uh governor olga said that if you ever want to have a true discussion about medical marijuana you have to truly solidify it we'll never have recreation the conversation will not even be had by a dozen or so conservative lawmakers in this chamber until we know without a doubt there's no recreational coming on its heels and the slippery slope is stopped period and so like um that is just a catastrophe of a statement and these catastrophes of statements are often made but rarely this terrible because first off it says if you ever want to have a true discussion about medical marijuana i don't know if this guy has the ability to have a true discussion about medical marijuana because it appears that he does not understand the endocannabinoid system otherwise he would not have this tact uh and then you have to truly solidify that we'll never have recreational god forbid anybody in tennessee would do anything they enjoy what is tennessee the home of like whiskey and nashville yeah just saying where did it hurt you where did this little flower of a plant like did it jump out and get the bad day one day i mean like what how did this thing come at you one day like you gotta stop a slippery slope because like giving people something that's an alternative to opioids alcohol cigarettes lots of other perhaps pharmaceutical drugs for sleep to anxiety what type of slippery slope are you trying to stop here the slippery slope away from being uh addicted to prescriptions and like you know not being able to get off of these prescriptions is that the slope you're trying to stop do you not want your people to be healthy well isn't also tennessee the place where uh like the oakway pandemic like was a peak once thought with like all the focus of the doctors hustling pills and on all the stuff like i believe big farmers got a big pool there like just like a florida big pole in um indiana because i mean that's where like eli lilly is but then where spies are located moderna pretty sure fives of modern are not in the south like you know but it's still it's like you got poor populations are easily manipulated you know that's that's that's what i'm saying people you are a commodity you know they your constituent is not looking to you as a somebody to want to be for your favor they're thinking you are an asset that i'm going to shovel this pill program for you you know this is ridiculous man there are websites to namaste said mel genitalia [ __ ] candies yes uh just want to give a shout out to jay phoenix for throwing us fiverr on this you know really appreciate that i'm not necessarily saying that people should find out where the governor of tennessee and or uh nebraska lives but uh if you would mail them a sack of gummy bears perhaps um you could do but you know it's not necessarily what you you may want to do however you have to realize it's at least sending a message yeah when you're talking to people that have so checked out from reality they believe that they may have lost the ability to enact sensible regulation to make the right decision when it comes to uh appropriate policy on this because they have made a moral judgment uh and that that really kind of relieves them of having to make a factual judgment well and i think we have to like say what like with mcconnell and uh uh you know their constituents re re reelected him right like the man helped push the hem thing through but again he's also a horrible human being like how do we manipulate the legislatures to benefit the the campus the cannabis policies right so i doesn't normal grade uh because the constituents what not there's a lot of grading that goes on you know by well normal's not necessarily an ngo they kind of are actually but these types of political organizations that are trying to rank uh legislatures because i just say you know look at your local areas and and and see what you can do you know it if you're not going to be the one to run against that person you can at least always support the person running against the one that's going to be in your favor with the you know what you're what you want yeah well let's move on to the next piece of crap story that's coming out of the south uh florida house committee approves thc limits for medical marijuana so the bill aims to prevent medical marijuana from being treated as a recreational drug but opponents argue there's no justification for the measure representative spencer roach likens what he's seen now in the state's medical marijuana industry to the practices that precedes the opioid crisis are you [ __ ] kidding me dude but hey this basically means that we now have a factual discrepancy with mr roach now first off he's one of the most ironically named senators in florida that senator roach is against the medical marijuana however he's starting to conflate the opioid crisis with cannabis now to this is where the slippery slope actually is to go down this means that you are not paying attention to the factual aspects of the substance and its effects on your body and and that is the dangerous slippery slope you see he's going to now stay opioid or opioids heroin those types of things and then disappear and go well that means marijuana that's right that's just factually wrong it's legally correct under uh the federal law legally that is the correct statement which is wrong it's shockingly wrong terribly wrong like hurting us wrong but that's i think part of the education right we have to teach these dumb asses that cannabis is not toxic non-toxic right all these other things are toxic like go through your liver and get flushed out and uh it hurts your body you know inevitably uh cannabis it clings it loves your little fatty cells and hangs out and things and you feel great with it like your body is not recognizing it as if it is alcohol cocaine heroin uh some other drug which is also recognized as a poison by your body uh for some reason your body is recognizing this cannabinoid as something to store in fat cells for regulation for later first like some reason yeah again it's a natural product like and i always it's like being a dead horse but scurvy we learned the hard way that if you don't get vitamin c you get scurvy you know and so if your body doesn't get thc you get [ __ ] up law enforcement [ __ ] up law enforcement you also get a whole cavalcade of uh treatments that the pharmaceutical industry is not all that great at treating for chronic conditions that are probably caused by endocannabinoid disruption not that we're allowed to study this disease or or even system uh and as a result who suffers you me the people everybody who benefits law enforcement pharmaceutical companies exactly there's so much misinformation that people are you know that's the thing about law enforcement right like i am not an acab i i like cops i i have nice things i want my my kids to be protected and stuff like that like they there's better [ __ ] and other [ __ ] to worry about and and legalization the prohibition hurts our society like like we are under trust in law enforcement that's what it does cannabis prohibition undermines trust in law enforcement it's it's you know the other day uh i was thinking uh i had uh smoked a little bit and uh uh i was on my way home and i i was right next to a cop right next to me at the light first i tensed up a little bit but then i realized there's no reason for this guy to even like suspect me or do anything like like that went away real quick opposed to 10 15 years ago or out of state anywhere out of this state my ass bucket is when i have a cop around me yeah but this guy this senator roach i'm sorry representative spencer roach i saw spencer and i thought it was senator representative spencer roach he says 15 years ago when we look at the opioid crisis that's what we're seeing this kind of doctor shopping drug seeking behavior we not only have a responsibility to act now but an opportunity to act before it's too late i would like to direct spencer roach to hash and it's 4 000 plus year history uh but uh other than that he says that this bill is going to restrict the thc levels of medical marijuana products to 10 percent for whole flour and 60 for other products while limiting patients to 1500 milligrams of thc every 35 days based on no freaking science whatsoever you know this dumb ass he doesn't even know why they have to doctor shop because most doctors are not putting out cannabis prescriptions because they put their their license at risk like this is another ridiculous argument about why we should save the children we can save ourselves from ourselves this is ridiculous again like you said hash right and then roach goes on to conflate these are apples oranges and this isn't even apples oranges this is more like apples staplers comparisons well you're not even close you know he's like roach says i mean we're talking about 10 million milligrams over a 70-day period that's 740 now 780 bottles of 24-count aspirin all right first off no second uh you have now said you're gonna have a 24-count bottle of aspirin who buys the bottle of aspirin with 24 aspirins in it what are you doing going out for a weekend you know it's worse aspirin and then so the only reason he said the 24 was so that he could multiply that number and say 780. and so this is which what i how i would look at him if i saw him i would be like you should know better you should no worse medical advice though i mean aspirin will [ __ ] kill you if you take a lot like i have yet i'm trying really hard on cannabis aspirin may cause some stomach bleeding but like it's the tylenol that can actually kill you and so tylenol can cause the liver failure okay at least he didn't give us that because like he could have said that's 780 bottles of 24 count tylenol maybe he didn't get permission from the tylenol people to use that uh [ __ ] but yeah whatever because you know this this this ban on on medical cannabis having 10 or more thc that's going to save the children right there because the children are only buying medical cannabis that's a good one too oh my god but no that's like they aren't can you regular can you tell the drug dealers that they're not allowed to grow more than 10 thc because that's how the bill should be written uh i mean the so the bill was passed through its first committee with a party-line vote but at least two republicans expressed serious concerns with the thc cap saying it sounded too close to lawmakers playing doctor thank god at least somebody spoke some reasonableness is that lawmakers playing doctor when it comes to a woman's body we want lawmakers playing doctor when it comes to our body and what we put into it what is a drug how i can have a drug all those types of things but i'm wondering if it's the sun that does this to these people because you know california is starting to turn into florida because uh feinstein says should marijuana legalization limit thc probably not but it's happening supposedly senator dianne feinstein yeah and senator john corn of texas who jointly chaired the senate caucus on international narcotics control released a report in which they proposed various regulations of legal cannabis protect public health and safety oh i'm glad there's a federal police power now it seems like but among the call for a national institute of health remember that one institute that like says cannabis is heroin that one to intensify its research on short and long-term impacts associated with high potency cannabis and make a recommendation jointly with the food and drug administration as to whether states should cap the potency of products that may be sold again 15 legal federal patients at one time but their stock was capped at 3.5 percent it's just that it still ignores the fact that hash has existed for thousands of years and keefe has existed for thousands of years i put some uh some keef on my my pipe earlier when it was 420 somewhere and um i'm fine again like you can't you can't get any more concentrated than that when you're taking the trichomes not nor should you nor are you trying to like sit there and get at the ever clear like i don't want necessarily cannabis distillate because that cannabis distillates not gonna have the the entourage profile that i'm going for you know it's gonna have too much of the thc and not enough of the terpene profiles or maybe some cbd or some other lesser lesser cannabinoids in there to kind of smoothen out the experience public health and safety i mean i'm tired of being protected for myself i am tired of this [ __ ] like arbitrary public health and safety i get coronavirus that's affecting the public health you know that's stuff can go from one person to another i'm going to have to pass this this chillin to somebody else and i'm not doing that much right now because coronavirus but um where is the public health and safety risk i i can see benefits like i'm i'm getting the benefits now it's one of the nice things about living in illinois no it's the the law is the public safety and health issue right like the the law the fact that uh uh we are incarcerating kids and we are going after people that that's the public self inhibit and then access access the safe access that poor kid and then there's there's more uh data that comes out and who's the people that are getting arrested for cannabis the black and brown kids so think about them think about all the dangerous deleterious impacts that the legality of this plant is putting on them when they get caught with it especially when they're young for the rest of their lives all right and they still do it and not only they still do it they have schmucks that are running states in this country that are saying that we're going to stop it that it kills kids in in the states that have re-uh formed their prohibition their their you know legalized it you know their enforcement therefore the better every single even our nation's capital that you know the the law enforcement and the relationships are always for the better i haven't heard of any like oh now the raids have increased because more people are walking around like zombies through the city or attacking dominoes you know where's the freaking horror stories right you know it's just the horror stories are like children are getting new parks and uh school built in colorado right uh i don't have that that newspaper article on me anymore but our schools in peoria illinois got six hundred thousand dollars from the taxes nice sweet you know we didn't have that before that's going to help those children oh and and there's fewer people selling cannabis on the street because uh you can go buy it uh now which is nice this is like capping the vitamins on tomatoes you know what i mean it's like you can only have so much health right yes think about that like if they said like oh my gosh you have too much uh tea no not thc you have too much vitamin c in this orange send it back pack this orange based on its vitamin c level you're too healthy we can't have that and you know and here's here's the other thing here right so we got florida we got california we got these jackasses in the the committee that are all talking about limiting and then we have uh virginia who's thinking hey we should probably speed this thing up you know what we should do we should actually have because this has been a very somber episode of cannabis legalization news and there's so many people hanging out so thanks so much and you know give us some thumbs ups and share this with people and be like you guys should check these people out because we're trying to legalize the plan but uh yeah some good news out of virginia governor northam considers speeding up legalization of marijuana in virginia you think it was social justice or do you think i could find a filter for slow motion though because if there ever is a a need for a slow motion filter it would be the legalization of virginia which does not go into effect until 2024. yeah lawmakers are working with governor ralph northern's office to consider speeding up the legalization of marijuana by years possibly by making possession legal as soon as july 1st instead of january 1st 2024 holy crap that's fast yeah 2024 they're going to speed it up and then it's going to be in 2021 i think they're trying to uh make the uh possession legal date as july 1st of this year so don't forget if you're in virginia don't don't be in the slow motion go call your elected officials at the state level both chambers because you're not in weirdo nebraska that only has the unicameral chamber chamber uh and tell them that they need to speed it up i mean they probably saw like washington state survived with the pandemic uh the second largest crop you know for the uh revenue uh you guys i think brought in like 10 100 million so far or some [ __ ] like there's a re almost a billion in sales but then like the taxes are different it was a combined uh cannabis sales for medical and also adult use but there was a lot they like they only anticipated their r3 program getting about 20 million dollars and it actually got like 31. and so it was over it was overestimate so like we we sold a lot but you know what and also if you think about it too i'm thinking okay there's obviously the one metric of the actual revenue that's brought in but what about like also the this is something that can never be figured out because no cop ever like clocked this in but the amount of time devoted to arresting people like for cannabis like for how much time has been saved and money and uh uh in all our legal states like how much uh focus now goes on to real crime you know this that's got to be a huge metric yeah but that's the thing like it's not a real crime it's not it's it's it's not a crime i mean that's the thing it's anything cannabis related is not a crime in my world like that's why the activism has always been easy for me like i understand i understand criminalizing it while you're you're operating a motor vehicle i understand that uh and that's a regulation so like if they want to make that a crime fine but uh if they want to make a crime for you to have a joint while you're sitting on the couch watching netflix no that's not a crime well and you know i can't wait to when we talk to tommy chong because one of my favorite uh examples of like large amounts of personal possessions is a story by him where when he had rated for his bong store uh you know the dea were going through all [ __ ] and found pounds of marijuana in his cupboard and they're like you got what why he's all i don't know you have a pound of sugar at your house what what you know what i'm saying like yeah i mean like that's how it used to be when uh when it was medical here like uh i could afford to have a lot all the time right i used to buy by the ounce and it would it was good and it was large because there was a fair market and all blah blah blah but and then that's what this this this budco stuff because they're from the old medical times and it reminds me i'm like oh man i forgot what good we was like like really good weed that was always in my possession uh i mean i i got i i'm still smoking better than what most people are on any other day because good mids out here are great but you guys have been like you have the industry and the stuff and you have enough growers and operators that you can have a wide assortment of products so that the wide assortment of people that are purchasing the products can find what's right for them which is fantastic and then of course you always should have that type of top shelf product that's out there where you can have like the trophy cuts and then the best uh you know the stuff that was you know hand trimmed taken care of completely through the supply chain uh and you have a great chain of custody on it so the products like good weed that's been cured right tastes way better like way better yeah and it hits like the lungs it just it's breathing oxygen to me you know like some plant you can tell like it wasn't purged right and then but the good one some plants you can't purge that well because like if you're trying to grow in water uh or aeroponics it's more difficult to flush your plants now if you're growing a soil based like i'm kind of biased towards soil based growing because i like weed that tastes good and so if you want to make weed that tastes good show me weed that tastes good that wasn't grown in soil yeah and i think you have a great point with the uh we have such a variety of growers and stuff that you can find that one grower with a great price point in the the quality that you like and accept you know that and that's the thing like i've always thought like with legalization just make it legal and now for the market you have to require testing right and you know we all know like pesticides are bad and also other [ __ ] like i would rather have an organic like you know bugs being used for uh insecticides and all whatnot but the thing is if you you just get it tested and put it out there people will buy shitty weed shitty whatever quality product because people smoke cigarettes good things they're gonna look at the price and look at the thc yeah for the most part end of list now like i'm not gonna do that like i'm gonna like preferably i'm not gonna see a list of its thc or or even it's terp profile and i'm gonna i like to buy like that's 31 flavors you know it'd be great if you could taste them as well not necessarily can but i like to buy like you know where you get to see it and maybe smell it and so you can see it in the jar and be like man what is that one right there and then they'll tell you and you'll be like oh i haven't heard of that genetic can i can i give that a smell holy crap what the heck is the terp profile on that and then that's how i will get stuff and i'll find out it was only like 17 thc but it was an amazing experience that was a point break strength it was a good strength purpley and well flavored well grown well cured you know it was that's that's what buying weed should be where you can have this experience of like um smelling it asking like what you're trying to go for like why why are you using this cannabis like what's your activity for this because like that's the thing you know you can have cannabis for the activity you just don't have regular wheat i mean that was like 20 years ago you just have regular wheat but now you have weed for a particular activity for a particular flavor for a particular experience no no totally i mean that's the great thing about canvas but like and also uh like you're saying how it just uh the the profiles um and you know with that meme that i shared where the winky face hemp is not marijuana right so like i don't know if you saw the the the the most recent chronic taste test i did with josh right right i smoked my first hemp uh delta eight one and i felt really light-headed and really good like a good yeah chill buy which you know you would expect from cannabis right because it's not about the tc it's about the cannabinoids and the terpenes and because right after that we smoked some flour and that was the most horrible flour i ever had which i was kind of sad about like i never met a plant that i didn't like and it tasted like smoking a seed and like how is the hemp better than the the marijuana technically but in the end they're all cannabis and and and you know it was a great experience you're gonna have some really well-grown hemp flour there's some good there's some excellent growers and there's some excellent cure in so there's some great stuff and then they're spinning this d8 from like a lot of the uh um stock what do they call that biomass that was extracted by the cb for the cbd and then the leaders of cbd aren't moving so they turn it into a delta eight they spray the the tasty flowers and so those tasty flowers that might have been moving for like four hundred dollars a pound are now moving substantially higher than that and then not only that now you have delta eight flour which means you don't have to worry about these vape cartridges bands people can have an entourage effect with it and delta eight is not delta nine and i mean it's not you try it uh and you'll see it's just a more chill uh kind of an experience and so that you're gonna be blending it with a cbd flower that's uh i should buy some delta eight flour actually actually uh some of my clients should mail me some delta flour yeah i mean you know it doesn't have the same aromas and everything as as as weed but they're cousins and they're exactly the same plant they say they're exactly the same plant it's just that they're just different types of of the same plant and so like you would have like a class one which would be a thc cultivar and then you'd have a class three which would be your cbd cultivar and then there's even class fours now and there's probably more classes depending on the other lesser cannabinoids that they find out but you know hey that's one of the cool things that we're going to see here next year the 2022 farm bill i wonder what they're going to define hemp as in the future i don't know it's exciting times man i think this whole year this whole administration's going to be exciting here for everything yeah yeah and we just have to keep up the fight to uh educate the people that are running uh the the states where it's i mean it just sounds like it really disconnected i mean it sounds just completely cut off from reality when i hear these types of things coming out of nebraska or tennessee or florida like they don't even know what they're talking about disconnected yeah well it's the same people yelling about regular election so so they don't know what we're talking about hey uh if you guys want to give us some viewer mail that would be awesome and at the end of the show we like to go over some viewer mail questions so drop us a comment not necessarily in the live comments because there's like four million of those but then if you drop us a regular comment on a question or you can go to our uh community page and drop us a question there i might actually be able to oh there it is you can go to cannabis industry lawyer on instagram and drop us a question there or follow mickey on facebook actually facebook.com backslash freethc for all of miggy's uh memes the the dank cannabis memes it's it's two forms of dank memes it's dank dank memes on facebook that's sticky icky that's sticky me yeah yeah so male 1 free the plant said what strains are on your mount rushmore of wheat mine are blue dream grape vape green crap basically anything high in piney thank you for the show that one's top like you know that one is tough because uh there's florida purple sometimes branded as miami punch by revolution genetics uh that one is one of my favs um and then i i do really like revolution's geneticist i like point break as well uh and then i'm a sucker for a good og kush love those ones then um that's really it i mean that's those are the things that i really gravitate toward and then whatever else i might be growing you know yeah i hope to get some growth going on i need some seeds anybody um but yeah i like the uh i got familiar with blue dream during the medical times out here in washington like that was the one plant i could smoke and be like all right this blue dream because you know a lot of people have that that bud but i don't trust flavors and whatnot but that's the one that too hit me home as well as a dutch treat i really enjoy a good touch treat yeah i think i've had a dutch treat i mean i haven't had a blue dream in a while like i i just there was so much of it going around like 10 years ago and it's yeah don't get me wrong and i like blueberry i like blueberry muffins i like purple weed uh but that berry taste uh of the blue variety is just so like old school that now they have all these new flavors and i'm not talking like cereal milk or like you know peanut butter or anything like that with the chocolates not but uh the fruitiness of the flavors and and the the flavor effects that they have on it and like the colors and all these other things but man i just got like some really cool ak-47 that was like crossed up with something and that stuff just is is like a blast from the past like a really refreshing one like a fairly skunky um loud kind of old-school varietal yeah well and then this skymaster i'm smoking right now is pretty [ __ ] awesome yup what's oh i don't know uh maybe do some homework on that one um yeah they're gonna go on the back of the thing now that's the thing like there's so many hybrids and crosses that are out there it's kind of nice to know like where they came from but then you just go to the philos galaxy and spend like an hour there well again i'm just more about the farms and the growers like when i reached out to uh washington buck i reached out to three of my favorite growers uh washington but code trailblazing and uh mad mark and uh because i'm trying to put us me in a position where you know when you do a review you don't want to be obligated to anything cannabis related right so i'm trying to just promote the good we the good stuff you know without like making that my have to be part of my deal you know what i mean i don't know that helps watch any youtube channel progression as as they get more subscribers they sell out so well that you don't even notice and eventually every video is brought to you by squarespace sponsors squarespace totally is the best easiest way to make a website hey what you're searching for use uh nordvpn don't let them know where you're at oh my gosh do you think we get a vpn server or do you think that the the cat filter is

family like cats i am not above saying butt up bum bum at the end of this [ __ ] show though i'm just saying going right now i wish was not a sponsor but only because i i i don't need a picture you're

"4lBu59N17Vs": "recreational marijuana edibles coming to a store near you as of now you can make them at home but it is illegal for anyone to buy and/or sell them to the public Canada's proposed edible pot regulations have been made public and the 60-day consultation process has come to an end under the proposed federal rules a single serving would be limited to 10 milligrams of THC the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis and each serving must be individually wrapped this is considered a low to moderate dose of THC this dosage limit is sugar than in Colorado Washington or California where multiple servings are allowed per package so for example in a chocolate bar each breakable square can contain 10 milligrams each for a total of 100 milligrams pot meant for ingestion cannot have alcohol have limited caffeine and come in a plain child-resistant package the draft regulations say the products must not be appealing to youth and the packaging can't advertise dessert or confectionery flavors so no gummies shaped like bears one of the problems which were legalizing edibles were kids so kids came into the kitchen saw this wonderful nicely colored marijuana edibles and as kids to try it out the proposed rules are an attempt to address one of the main issues with edibles making sure they don't cause risk to public health especially for those who are underage but some are worried the black market will continue to thrive which are strict regulations a major cannabis edibles manufacturing California says it's been difficult to navigate within the legal market because there's still so much competition in the illicit market people that are heavy consumers of cannabis and like to ingest it can ingest you know hundreds if not thousands of milligrams of THC in a day and so if they have products that are available in the illicit market that are much cheaper and have a much higher potency they're gonna tend to go towards that so a problem with edible marijuana is that people are not used to it with edibles the effects can later and the people's oh I have now done this edible marijuana and there feel nothing and they'd more and more to avoid putting people at risk it would be better to start with low dosage and once we have clear evidence the black market is still thriving then we can reevaluate Health Canada confirms they've received 7,000 responses from Canadians industry representatives the provinces and the public health community on the proposed draft regulations Health Canada says cannabis products will be permitted for legal sale no later than

side effect of cannabis its active ingredient thc alters areas of the brain associated with communication and pleasure making you feel more relaxed and chatty so there are two types of wheat we got the sativa which is more of an uplifting high more of a trippy effect and we have an indica it's more of a body relaxer most people in a shop that they go for sativas it's more intense it's very sociable and indica is more relaxing you know when you want to go binge watching and netflix or whatever on the couch have you ever smoked before no no this is the first time yeah still a virgin

high i have been to amsterdam before but i have never been in the coffee shops before i had a bottle of whiskey in my room instead whilst the ladies weigh up their weed options jamie and kelly have opted to have their first taste of cannabis via a vaporizer commonly known as a volcano a large plastic balloon filled with cannabis fumes you heat the cannabis and the moisture is in the balloon and you just inhale the pure moisture without any tobacco so it's one of the yeah most healthy way to smoke cannabis who's the daredevil out of you too like this first all right one of them there we go suck it up that's it through your lungs for the first time uh smoker doesn't smoke anything the volcano is the best option sucking on a big bag it does look a bit strange it should go straight to the head stuck in my throat i hate to think it will happen later you better look after me i will do i have a little bit more help god flirty isn't the volcano i brought the smallest i could find oh you didn't i saw somebody with a much smaller one for the cardiff choir ladies today's amsterdam adventure helps take a long-standing item off their bucket list i like to embrace new adventures for myself and for the choir i want to still do things while i'm still fit and able to do them oh i don't know if i fancy that oh yeah we're not doing all of that i haven't consumed cannabis ever in my life so this is a first for me my children think i'm actually quite cool they are quite pleased that i'm taking the plunge and embracing this new experience what's the daredevil don't do it what should i do stop you can take the bag and then just uh see what she's doing now what do i do is she gonna talk funny suck yeah no she's not sure i'm not necessarily a person that leads people i'm quite easily led sometimes um but i think with music i'm i'm okay at being a leader what does it taste like a thing look at me stuck come on do it just gently breathing you're flashing oh hang on a minute now how many times you're going around is that not many times till it runs out my experience of cannabis it's varied over the years from just a little experimenting when i was young and then using it for pain it's nice to see how they do it properly instead of being a criminal activity are you looking to mirror this right you want to fight the world god and hate myself now i look in the mirror nothing you know what i like what i'm seeing yeah exactly did you always know from a kid i knew from three i was different yeah but i didn't know why i was different but obviously my dad i was playing football i was boxing and i was a member of the street gang then i don't know how my boxing got more i got more fames yeah you know and i just kept going kept the lid on it i i would never admit to it yeah as soon as i was working i was all right yeah yeah but i still read about it all the time yeah but my life at home was deteriorating because i wasn't part of the family you know no no no i was cutting myself off yeah and then my dad got healed so sorry and that was very hard to fight and i just watched this man slowly just sinking away and you know i wanted to tell him but i couldn't tell him i never told him i didn't have the heart because he had me on his pedestal i remember taking his hand to try and tell him and i i i sort of broke down and everything was coming to a hill and i was losing control of my life a week later it was about three o'clock in the morning and i was really bad i was sitting downstairs drinking and i was really crying my wife came down and she asked me what was wrong and i said nothing she asked me if i was having a relationship somewhere else i went no and she said what is it then and i just looked at it and i don't know and i and i and i wanted didn't want it to come out but i couldn't it just came out i went i'm like you and she said and as it came out she's what do you mean i said i'm female and as i just see her face totally oh my god like drain and everything because she was a dead straight one yeah as far as i'm saying i was a dead straight yeah you know i'd have to put the house on that yeah well you'd have lost [Laughter] i found both my wife's attractive but it was hard it was hard because i wanted to be them all i can say is that i did love them but times has moved on and now i am the person i feel i should have always been i don't need that all to me i can't be [Music] smart i have a funny sensation i'm kind of sinking down through the sofa in an amsterdam coffee shop a group of brits are taking full advantage of holland's lacks cannabis laws i'm not going to get table dancing we renounce that the night is young each with their own reason to try getting high i don't like it when it goes all like that this ain't bad stuff do you have another couple yeah top female boxer jamie and sporting icon kelly maloney are hoping the two volcanoes they've smoked go and have a little drop more we'll help them open up about unspoken issues close to both their hearts this is another reason you are so glad to see you because you've done the full transition to come and talk to yourself how on earth did you make that decision i mean that must be one of the hardest decisions of your life it's got to be how did i make that decision i don't think i've got a choice in the ins i'm honest really see me i went to a doctor when i was about 15. i thought okay i'm going to tell the doctor i don't want to be female i hate it i hate it you know what's happened to me the doctor turned around and said well you're quite a weirdo aren't you a lot of gp and that was it for me you know you you come against these blocks as far as you're concerned you're a heterosexual male because when i last saw you you had a partner yes yes you're still together um it will nearly be 22 years come december i live with my partner kelly and our three children are one for three children kelly is completely straight and when a woman is completely straight that means you know they um would normally be going with a full male in all departments i've had major problems with a wonderful relationship because i actually haven't transitioned i've not had gender reassignment for various reasons at this moment in time um you know due to the boxing number one i couldn't take the hormones and didn't really fancy taking the hormones the thing is like with my kelly um we just never got around to doing getting the treatment done i should have got it she wanted the conservatory and it's just we never got around to it you know and the bit down below you could have had mine yeah that's cool so it was hard for kelly you know to um you know and then yeah it was it was it was hard you know sort of got this stuff how are you feeling from it all right but um you then um i've lost track now what's that yes that's this is we better be careful downstairs the choir is starting to feel the effects of their shared volcano who's up for it after 10 minutes cannabis causes the brain to release dopamine the body's pleasure chemical while this creates a euphoric high for many some can feel panicky or paranoid it is a little bit sedating it's just taking me a little bit i don't know if i want to actually because i haven't smoked for years go on so you're not gonna ever do it again don't say fight to hennik fire hazard being in the choir has definitely given me a sense of belonging and made new friends for me because i i live alone and it's quite a highlight for me to go and have a laugh with like-minded people is it really mellowing you down yeah is it yeah yes it's it's melding me down a little bit but i still feel quite happy and jolly which is nice you know i'm normally quite depressive no i i well yes actually i am that's interesting because you always seem really jolly and happy when you come to choir i'm a good actress are you having a bad time well no i just want i want um i want to enjoy quiet and i do enjoy quiet so that makes me happy my daughter lives abroad so i see her a couple of times a year my child has grown up and flown the nest now so i did have a tough few years i know how lonely things can be i'm hoping that having time out together from life's worries um that we would get closer yes and bond and have fun yeah it really lifts me up it really [Music] does [Music] oh i know what's on there so why would you not now give up your boxing and everything so make your last let's say you've got another 20 years 30 years on this planet make them happy i'm nervous of operations anyway and the bits as a male that i could get put on i don't believe they'll be as good as the bits that i've got already you know you can buy bits and pieces technology is brilliant nowadays if you don't transition do you think she'd ever leave you no not for that oh have you ever seen your body name no never never not in a million years i hate to see you naked [Laughter] [Laughter] maybe not that big why haven't you done already i can't believe it no it's been like yeah it's madness but we did definitely decide that it's far better we can buy from the shop but for you to have done this is the most incredible thing i don't think you have a choice do you what's going on it's got a little face it's like nuggets oh just suck at you never so gently to try not to cough it's quite drying yeah it is quite dry it is quite dry especially if you're not used to smoking my throat that's the problem does it damage your vocal cords oh no girls it's marvelous for your vocal [Laughter] [Music] don't come on you are actually enjoying it [Laughter] i didn't like the feeling that it gave me because it just made me giggle over uncontrollably bars of tulips should we sing at this point no cleveland hasn't joined the circle i know that one day i'll be free deep down in my soul i know that one day i'll be i absolutely love the experience but i don't think it's ever going to take the place of a nice class of fears i know for certain general win hands [Music] [Music] down thank you hello so do we have to suck this so there's nothing there how long does it last i don't know in an amsterdam coffee shop a group of brits are getting high to test the alleged benefits and effects of cannabis a little bit easier guys where are you from england somewhere i could see you gotta be careful there the newest arrivals are edinburgh couple celine and oliver you've been together forever and we've been together for just over five years congratulations yeah so oliver's been here before a number of times but i've never been so this is my first time here so everything here is totally new to me like i was saying to oliver how do i actually inhale we have different types of smoke and we can either roll a joint the old-school way or we can use a volcano which is like with a bag and then you vaporize and you oliver you smoke regularly yeah yeah that's a good story all right i'll be back in a sec thank you i'm excited excited i am excited oliver asked me out yeah you did you asked me to be your girlfriend don't i don't actually remember this oh you do you did i remember myself and oliver got our flat together about two years ago two and a half years ago so yeah we've been living together for a year well that looks nice i think ultimately i want to to be with celine for as long as possible i don't really ever say forever but i mean ultimately me and selene are quite a special team i think it's an amazing thing you have that one sort of special person she is she's like one of probably my best friend oh my god oh my god i don't know what i was expecting this is basically so the machine that i've put the compartment on with the marijuana and you just put this on top and then it just fills up with the smoke okay it's really soft yeah yeah that's it you do well [Music] we do tell each other that we love each other every day yeah definitely maybe not every day maybe some days it's just been nah every day maybe really annoyed me every day but you guys have kids or anything no no no i thought maybe on a break no no no this is kind of what we what so what we're what we're going to talk about yeah is it i was hoping that this would kind of mellow the nine times out of ten when we do have a conversation about having kids it does end up in an argument so i am hoping that i'm taking the cannabis that it will mellow the situation i guess we sort of need to figure out which one of us changes their mind all right guys well i'll just leave you to it yeah and i'll see you in a bit thank you thank you take it to the head ten minutes is sort of the maximum it takes for the effect to really come up some people get it after two minutes already or three or four it does vary a little bit but the average is about between five and ten minutes [Applause] milkshake was five it just sounds like the pace [Music] having inhaled two volcanoes kelly and jamie have decided to change tack it's got much more of a kick than anything smoking a pipe of pure cannabis provides a powerful hit which is absorbed into the bloodstream within seconds and should accelerate the opening up effect the pair are looking for i'm all right sitting in it so that's great that is strong have you got an ideal you know like have you got like a knife yeah have you got an ideal me think i know it sounds crazy my dog because unconditional love like for me if i think about sex yeah i only think of women and i would never ever think of i actually don't think of sex i've never actually thought of being intimate with anyone yeah yeah i'd like to have a relationship but don't ever want an intimate relationship i'm actually scared of having sex and i've never admitted to that before that's the strongest one i've had yet yeah well i fear if i'm honest i don't know if i could have someone because of the role i lived previously life could i let someone i'm not gonna say dominate me that's wrong but could i let someone into me i i honestly don't know it's hard you know i remember i met one guy that got talking i said i've got a bit of baggage and he went well i've got baggage he said i've been married i'm divorced i want have you heard of frank maloney and he would that [ __ ] idiot cut his dick off and i went well that's the baggage i carry he actually said do you think i'm a puff i put the phone down no and you know that knocked me back for so long oh my god yeah and that was the only time really that i i'd struggled you know and for a while i wouldn't even go out did you at that time did you think oh i wish i'd not had the change no but it just made me think do you know what the wall around me is the safest thing to keep yeah yeah yeah so really you're you are a virgin virgin can you believe it yeah the truth is i love what you've done i love the fact that you can look in the mirror and you're you now you've got to make them sacrifices in life yeah no that's true definitely having mastectomy done that might make kelly feel better yeah no that's true you are such an inspiration talking to kelly really has to clarify to me that you get a much better quality of life when you you have gone through the gender reassignment and yeah i really want to sort of do the full transition myself because then you do look who you think you are and makes your life a lot easier for yourself and for others thank you it was good to see how jamie's dealt with problems it was good to talk about things i i probably haven't talked about to other people because i felt comfortable with talking to jamie how do you feel right now okay yes okay thank you very much how do you think how your box moves are are you still that fast a little bit of uh yeah yeah feeling of feeling a little bit slower right no i'm not slow i don't think kelly and i would have been quite so open with each other um if we just met um you know in in the coffee bar down the road push who should make so much noise i know i know my new i did feel myself sort of relaxing and feeling comfortable but if you phoned me up and said uh kelly i'd like to take you that was going into a cannabis cafe i'd have to decline i would have to decline you [Music] i don't know if i'm opening up a huge kind of worms here if this is a conversation we probably should just left alone i know so many people that haven't had kids and have [ __ ] amazing lives celine and oliver are on to their second volcano say we want to buy a house we want to do this we want to do that they want to use money to to to use it for a business all these things children come first family is huge to me i think you know family can make or break especially in the relationship there's too many people we don't all need to have children so i mean i like having something to look after i like that's why it's really maybe we should like open a crash you can give the children back we can make money off it no [Music] thank you hi welcome please go downstairs take a seat and i'll be with you in a second thank you very much you're very welcome thank you so sativa is what gets you high indica is more cbd dominant next to settle in downstairs 55 year old builder jeff and his 30 year old daughter abby that's high in both look sixty percent city or forty percent indicator that might be a good mix there are thousands of strains we have about 45 different kinds but they keep changing as well the growing time is what is important to what kind of effect the weed has the longer you grow it and cure it the more clear it becomes and it's more intense i don't want to take anything that's going to make me tighten my clothes off i don't want it to take anything that's going to take your clothes off so don't worry about it my social side of life is a lot going to the pub a lot of people like cannabis and they don't drink little chocolate over there i don't like cannabis and i like a pint yeah might be everybody's different so where are you from in england uh birmingham birmingham staffordshire staffordshire okay growing up our house was fun my relationship with my dad was pretty good usual teenage arguments and such bit of rebellion but we used to do lots of stuff together also family holidays and things it's a lot dressing up didn't you and do little shows in the lounge yeah yep that was a good dad though we had some great one didn't we yeah are you excited to get high hope i don't collapse you won't collapse you'll be okay i can't remember the last time we spent three days together we would normally manage half an hour if we do any longer than that it all goes titsu i'll tell you a little bit about cannabis in general there are two substances cbd and thc cbd is the substance that makes you relax your muscles which is the medicinal side of it thc is the little bit that makes you feel the feeling as well a little high and more chatty and stuff like that a lot of customers come to our shop and they tell us you know why why they want some wheat and it helps for sleeping better concentration anxiety cancer headaches migraine muscle relaxing so what's the occasion if i may ask i use cannabis for medicinal purposes i have fibromyalgia hypermobility i'm waiting for hip surgery wow i actually have a lot of chronic conditions i've been diagnosed with ehlers-danlos syndrome which is a connective tissue disorder i don't produce collagen correctly so as part of that my gut doesn't work properly i have hip pains they have overactive bladder and i've been listed for quite an invasive hip operation and then i'll have quite a long recovery perhaps 12 months to get back to normal because i'm having the hip surgery i'm going to move back to mommy and daddy's all right yeah because i'm going to need a lot of help so i would like my dad to experience it i want this to be an understanding and to support it you can't bring us together yeah yeah we had a bit of a raw about cannabis because i wouldn't normally roll a joint in front of dad let alone smoke one in front of him or with him because i do respect that it is your home oh you said the word he said the respect word he said the respect i don't think my dad fully understands my condition he often feels i use them as an excuse to use cannabis you know we spend too many years rowing over silly things you [ __ ] just get put down on the same level as abby for a bit you know you can only do as good you don't need to smoke the whole thing you don't have to take big [ __ ] thank you [Music] it might take a little while to kick in don't forget to put it down yeah like your volcano back like what like your volcano back i totally forgot what you said there i feel like i've been punched in the head punched in the headboard [Music] are you feeling a bit high everything's more colorful you always notice things are more bright than normal in a coffee shop in amsterdam 10 brits are experimenting with weed to test if it really does have the power to cure ills and bring us closer together i feel rude i'm like you feel welcome i feel that we're rude i'm not even gonna lie i have no idea what you said there i feel a wee bit fuzzy oh my god maybe you're not even real at all in my whole life you're just my imaginary standard he's saying my imagination what did you see tell me what you said i don't know what you said oh we threw it okay it was implanted into your brain that old your dad and your mum just picked a picture and then the pulse you passed sticky in the side earrings and that's it hello dad oh dear this will be waffling oh you've got to i don't know does it come out when you don't press right now no okay celine and oliver hope getting high will help them tackle a tricky subject that usually ends up in a row it's quite interesting because like if you think of your sister like did she did she even like did she ever want kids i just shouldn't plan it i don't know if she wanted but she didn't plan it and i seen that but it's different because like no one would ever talk about that in the past tense of like not wanting it because you should call me and that's that when i see oliver with his niece colley i do feel you know sometimes you make a wee bit rudy it'd be nice if chloe had another baby yeah that would be nice i think that's what i like i like joe i mean i like seeing other people's babies i've seen corny grow up it's like i quite enjoy seeing like the joy that a child brings but with a child i'm like a hypochondriac for the child i love seeing my knees go up we like we we looked after all the time but i just i don't think i could handle it in the sense i would just worry so much put your lips against it make it bubble yeah like that that's it so you'd have to do it like that that was really not like i can't taste anything because there's not oh it's a dry run the bong became popular during the hippie 60s but its roots date back over 2000 years to ancient china a bong is a glass pipe filled with water in one hole you feel the weed you light it up and it's pretty strong it's a lot of smoke that you inhale and you tend to cough quite a lot afterwards and it's quite american that's it you get it compared to a spliff a bong delivers a much more intense hit the bigger the bong the more powerful the potential high because your dad left your mum when you were younger do you feel like that's effectively if you want to have kids or not no i don't think so you don't think it had like any impact on it at all if it has it's like very subconscious you know i mean when he was 15 16 his dad left his mum and i think oliver's always thought you know if if i was ever to have kids what if one day that was to happen to to my child i wouldn't ever want anyone to go through that i just don't speak to my dad i think that does kind of play a part into not wanting to have kids kind of having a skewed relationship with one parent you can't hate people for splitting up do you know what i mean i think i was old enough to like understand all so it doesn't really faze me it's quite interesting it's kind of easy to have the conversation with your child that imagine this was like with a pregnancy test stop watching no i mean because it's just it's such a hard conversation to have i mean it's not something that i'm planning to accidentally happen it's just too much my whole brain's like because we face going redder no you look all right jeff and abby have finished one joint each i feel like i've had two jabs in the head off twice in there keep going also abby and i are very similar i mean i think that's why we clash so much we've got too many jeans the same i think we love each other but we're like a matching dynamite you feel like you don't want to be able to have open debate and discussion it's like no this is my way of thinking and that's that like when i made that chili then you wouldn't even have one one spoon of it and you played it on me no i didn't i didn't put any on your plate you did could have to swap flights i love mate it's as simple as that than an isle of animals it's as simple as that yeah and we're not going to have a rhyme about it now you did you put a doll up on the plate i don't eat vegan food nothing that's sort of overly you know pretentious pretending it's it's a meat the impact the arguments that we've had must have on him must be pretty bad as well i know they've affected me quite badly you know you make me feel like i'm not loved all the time all the time yeah whenever i see it it's like i'm just waiting to have a thought well that's quite a sad i didn't feel like that at all i didn't really follow up right you have to stand on eggshells when you come down i'm frightened to upset you well i don't like that what does tofu stand for [Music] having a child is like that's where i freak out because i don't freak out very much but i love dogs so this is valentine's day and oliver supplied me with a puppy she's definitely a surrogate child doesn't she yeah like i love having movie looking after ruby i love that little like when she does stuff i show people i'm like look what she can yeah what we've realized is we have a child a furry child a furry child if we did the lottery next week and we want mine to know right so whatever if i said i want to have kids would that change yeah because that amount of money is like you know i mean that's why it's easy for us to say that if we had millions and millions of parents like we wouldn't need to work you guarantee your kid it's going to be you know it's going to have everything it needs do you think that you would see yourself as violent material that's what father material a very deep question do you though yeah 100 interesting it's good though to talk about it yeah i definitely feel better good i also feel quite [ __ ] up hi guys she gets to talk about the things she wanted to talk about good i think with oliver referring to the dog as our child that did sort of help him see us as sort of like a family unit you could see it on his face that he was thinking about it more during the conversation my opinion did change i don't know if i could truly say that i'm like 100 against having kids i feel like being able to take cannabis together it did definitely ease the situation we've got one last hit it was massively therapeutic it was very uh yeah it felt like i'd been away having like some sort of counselling and walked out and say yeah it felt far better about it all i'm glad you did this yeah he did say you know if we won the lottery tomorrow i would happily have children which quite surprised me actually so here's the dunawary i feel kippered still what does kippard mean wise dude what has wasted me ready for the bean jeff and abby are 30 minutes into their next smoke do you feel more comfortable sitting with me now you've had a smoke and i've had a smoke yeah because i don't feel like we'll have an argument i feel like we're just going to go and have a laugh now the rest of the day tell me what you're feeling about going in for your operation partly hasn't set in yet for real i'll show up and i'll drop you i know you would because my hip would probably be better than yours no i'm caught up [ __ ] well i'm very upset real going through i bet you feel like you wish you could just fix it because i know i do going to see the surgeon on monday no you want me to come with you fiona i'll come here you know that when you come to ours i'm going to be fine dale come on you you're gorgeous you're beautiful you're our daughter come home and you can stay with us as long as you want forever when we came over here i didn't expect to be talking so deeply and openly certainly opened my eyes but taking this drug does make you open up and feel closer feel all right to war yeah just a bit i still can't really believe that my dad has come to amsterdam and done this with me i'm really proud of him i think it's definitely helped us think about different ways to argue less it's definitely given us a better connection i can't think of a word to say how much i love you i love you more than words there's no words that can describe what i felt for you i'm right back at you and you don't you do my head in but i wouldn't change anything about you i felt like lying down and going to sleep i don't think i can feel anything from the neck down at the minute [Music] you", "icGZxDFddBk": "some mental health professionals are warning Canadians about an increase in cannabis induced psychosis they say that although the drug is now legal that doesn't necessarily mean it's risk-free let's bring in Chris Somerville he's chief executive of this schizophrenia Society of Canada joining me today from Winnipeg hi Chris hello so before we alarm people now that marijuana is legal can you tell me a bit about the numbers how much has there been a spike in people reporting cannabis related psychosis well now that it's legal to talk about it or rather to use it people are here to talk about the use and so the skits of Korean society is across Canada are experiencing more people talking about use and even though they don't have psychosis or schizophrenia I mean people come to us for other reasons as well around depression and anxiety and the main point I think is that no one should think that cannabis is harmless or benign I mean there are warnings for women who are breastfeeding who are pregnant there are warnings about respiratory problems so when we come to the brain a lot of people think that this is some sort of conspiracy the government or the society to keep people from using cannabis what we're all about informing people about safe use we do think harm and be informed about the rifts that can be had with use of cannabis okay so we don't have a lot of time so I want to get right to the nuts and bolts what qualifies as a psychotic episode and who's most at risk the first and most at risk for experiencing hallucinations and delusions in which interferes their ability to understand reality are those under the age of 25 because the brain is Neil Development Green conception and 25 those who use high potency cannabis those who use daily are to greater risk and those who have a family history of mental illness have a 5 infiltrator increase 40% of all psychosis Native Academy ok some good stats there appreciate that but to hear what you're saying or to delve into it a psych on episode is more likely to happen if you are predisposed to some kind of mental illness already that's not necessarily true see that's the great assumption that people think is that you're going to all you will automatically have schizophrenia regardless of whether or not you use cannabis or not schizophrenia is much more complex illness than we ever thought it is a number of illnesses and it's not just one genetic factor we know that people live and impoverished states have higher rates of schizophrenia so environmental factors are part of the development of schizophrenia and so are hallucinogenic drugs just a few seconds left then to tell me what's the messaging you're trying to get out today Chris well before you use learn all you can about safe use try to avoid use until you're in your late teens avoid high potency and certainly do not use daily because those who use daily tea have a two to threefold for your risk of developing psychosis appreciate your time thanks so much you're welcome Chris Somerville joining me today from Winnipeg", "n8ZsEuSiOSE": "to notice it looks

to a lot of the world for decades now and especially those in asia pacific haven't had access to the benefits cannabinoids and cbd in particular can bring so i have it every now and then just for like a bit of a calming effect it's good after like a stressful week and the dog likes it i used to suffer from insomnia and i started taking cbd and it just helped me relax and eat some of my anxiety that i had at the time from the cannabis flower and from the cannabis plant we have two main compounds which are most famous cbd and thc thc is what traditionally people would be looking for in cannabis whereas cbd is the more therapeutic side of cannabis around asia laws vary greatly in some countries like hong kong cbd is only legal if it contains zero percent trace of thc in other asian countries it's only available for medical use and in others it's completely banned there are places in asia where cbd is and remains heavily prohibited such as singapore and we would highly recommend that nobody even considers bringing a cbd product whether free of thc or not to singapore because the penalties can be quite severe what do you think oh you give me a pug for older pets who might have inflammation or sore joints might be struggling a little bit with physical ailments cbd can help with anti-inflammation and with reducing pain and the other big benefit is for pets of all ages is

United States in areas were marijuana has been legalized, there tends to be a bump in the amount of toxic cases in dogs. In Colorado where marijuana\nwas legalized in 2012, there was a four-fold increase\nin the amount of toxic cases that were reported between\nthe years of 2010 and 2015. On October 17th of this year in Canada recreational marijuana will be legalized, so I reached out to our\nfavorite YouTube veterinarian, Doctor Alex Avery from the Our\nPets Health YouTube channel. And he's gonna talk to us today\nabout marijuana poisoning. I'm Ken Steep and welcome\nback to McCann Dogs. (dog barking) - Thanks Ken and hi everyone, I'm excited to have been invited back to talk to you today about\nmarijuana effects on dogs. So for those of you who don't know me, I'm a veterinarian and I've\ngot my own YouTube channel, Our Pets Health and also the\nwebsite ourpetshealth.com where my aim is to help you and your pet to live a healthier, happier life. So let's jump in to\nmarijuana poisoning in dogs. It's actually something that's\nnot that rare in general and you won't be surprised to\nhear that marijuana poisoning, it becomes even more\ncommon in an area when marijuana goes from\nbeing illegal to legal. So CBD oil is all the rage at the moment and you might know that\nthat comes from marijuana, but is actually felt to be safe. So just how dangerous is marijuana? How poisonous is it? Do you need to be worried? Well marijuana contains a\nlot of different substances, with the most dangerous one\nbeing something called THC. And it's actually this THC which is toxic and has this psychotropic\neffects acting on the brain that we associate with marijuana. Thankfully even though it\ndoes have toxic effects, it actually does take quite a lot to cause a serious poisoning in dogs. And the risk of poisoning\ndue to smoke inhalation is really tiny and really\nall reports of poisoning are due to pets eating marijuana with 96% of cases being\ndogs and only 3% being cats. So it still does affect cats the same way but they just don't eat\nit as often as dogs do. The minimum lethal dose, which is the amount that can kill a dog is three grams of THC per\nkilogram of body weight. The average marijuana cigarettes\ncontains 150 milligrams and that means that a\nfive kilo or 10 pound dog would need to eat 100 cigarettes for a fatal poisoning to occur. So the situation is pretty\nunlikely to cause problems. Don't think though that marijuana can never cause problems though. If a dog gets into a large supply or it consumes something more like concentrated medical grade THC butter that might be used in baked products then there's definitely a\nrisk of serious poisoning and deaths have been\nreported and they do occur. As with a lot of poisons and toxins out there that our dogs come across, there is a variation as well\nin how each individual responds so a small amount of marijuana may affect one pet a lot more than another. So you really can't be too careful. The marijuana effects on\ndogs and signs of poisoning are numerous and come about\nthrough the drug's effects within the brain as well\nthe body as a whole. After eating marijuana\nthe signs of poisoning also can stop pretty quickly. So they develop within about 60 minutes. Mild cases of poisoning\nwill be seen as lethargy, a change in the way a dog responds to visual and noise stimulation, behavioral changes and their\ngums might become quite red. If a more toxic dose is eaten, then excess salivation might develop, the pupils will dilate and become large, vomiting may start along with diarrhea and your dog might also start\nto urinate uncontrollably. And muscle tremors will also develop. And in fact about 99% of\nmarijuana poisoning cases there are nervous or neurological signs. Whereas only about 30%\nwill develop intestinal, so vomiting or diarrhea. A higher dose again might\nthen result in your dog becoming unsteady on their feet, their blood pressure might drop, they might develop hypothermia. The heart can slow. And as with a lot of poisons, it will all eventually lead\nto seizures, coma, and death. The effects of marijuana\non dogs can last for hours and they can even last for days. And that's because the THC\nis actually partly stored in the body's fat and\nit's then released slowly over a number of days. So that being said, what's the treatment\nto marijuana poisoning? So while the likelihood of severe life-threatening poisoning is pretty low, as I've just discussed. You'll appreciate from some of the signs that in some cases\ntreatment will be needed to prevent any poisoning complications. Dogs that are severely\nagitated or hyperactive may need to be sedated. IV fluids may need to be given to help just control body temperature, to support blood pressure, and to prevent dehydration that results from vomiting and diarrhea\nand excessive salivation. Muscle relaxant or\nanti-seizure medication may be needed in the case of\nsevere tremors or seizures. And in rare life-threatening cases when large amounts have been eaten the stomach may even need to be emptied, enemas given and activated\ncharcoal administered. Just to try and remove and absorb as much of the toxin as possible. Now the big difficulty with\ntreatment of marijuana poisoning and marijuana poisoning in general, in dogs is knowing that this is actually the problem in the first place. So in many cases owners are\nreluctant to tell their vet that this is what the dog has\neaten or might have eaten. Now there are human urine\ntests for marijuana, but these are actually\nreally unreliable in dogs and so they'll often\ngive incorrect results. It's vital therefore that\nyou let your vet know if your dog has eaten marijuana. Without this information\nit really is impossible to differentiate the\nsigns the dog is showing from many other toxins. Poisoning with different\ntoxins or food items, it comes with different prognosis and different treatment options. And not knowing the cause of poisoning, it can just mean that a\ndog is given unnecessary treatment or it's actually\ntreated more aggressively than they would otherwise need to be in the case of marijuana poisoning. And that wastes both time and money. If your dog has eaten\nmarijuana in any form then just let your vet know. It's really important information and it should not be withheld. As with all poisonings\nprevention is better than cure and my tips for this is just\nto keep marijuana products and that includes edibles\nand baked goods in high pet-proof cupboards\nor in locked drawers. Make sure your pet is not\naround if marijuana is being smoked or consumed and only\nallow them back in the room once everything's been cleared\nup or all smoke has cleared. And finally just never give\nyour pet marijuana on purpose. It's really not funny although it's something some people do do. Now as I mentioned at the start, CBD oil is a different cannabis extract and that does not\nactually contain any THC. So CBD oil is considered non-toxic and it has several potentially valuable medical effects on the body.

MAYBE YOU'VE HEARD YOUR TEENAGERS OR MAYBE EVEN SOME FRIENDS TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED DELTA EIGHT. THIS IS THE HOTTEST NEW CANNABIS PRODUCTS. SOME ARE EVEN CALLING IT WE'D LIGHT HERE'S TOM LYDON OF THE FOX NINE INVESTIGATORS. BEGAN SHOWING UP A FEW MONTHS AGO. IT'S SMOKE SHOPS AROUND MINNESOTA. YEAH YEAH, I'M CARAMEL STUFF AND SELLING OUT FAST. YOU SEE, I'M ALMOST SOLD OUT. OH, YEAH, PEOPLE HAVE. I DON'T KNOW THEY ARE COMING BY 234 WHAT IT'S CALLED DELTA EIGHT. IT COMES IN GUMMIES, VE APES AND FLOWER OR BUD? YEAH, YOU CAN'T SMOKE. OH, YEAH, THAT TZE GOOD STUFF THERE. THE STORE CLERKS WILL TELL YOU IT'S GOT A LITTLE MORE KICK THAN CBD, BUT NOT QUITE. THE PUNCH IS POT AND HOW HIGH DOES IT GO? LET'S HAVE THE STRENGTH OF LIKE REGULAR TOC, I WOULD SAY. AND THE CLERKS WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE. IT'S ALL PERFECTLY LEGAL. IS THAT LEGAL REPEL. YOU SURE WON'T FIND MUCH INFORMATION THE LABELS SO WE TOOK A COUPLE OF SAMPLES TO A LAB FOR TESTING. WE'LL TELL YOU THE RESULTS IN A MOMENT, BUT FIRST A LITTLE CANNABIS. WANNA WANT YOUR PROFESSOR U OF M BOTANIST GEORGE WEBBER. IT DOES TIE TOGETHER ALL THESE DIFFERENT FAMILY PLAN. COMMON ANCESTOR. WE'VE LENDS LAB RECENTLY MAPPED THE CANNABIS GENOME AND DISCOVERED MARIJUANA AND ITS COUNTRY COUSIN HAVE ACTUALLY SHARE ABOUT 90% OF THE SAME DNA. THEY ALSO SHARE MOST THE SAME CHEMICALS 144 SO CALLED CANAVAN OI, DS LIKE CBD FOR WHAT AILS YOU AND T H C TO GET HIGH. ITS SCIENTIFIC NAME IS ACTUALLY DELTA NINE T. H C. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE COME TO FIND OUT THERE'S A NEARLY IDENTICAL MOLECULE FOUND HIM MUCH, MUCH SMALLER QUANTITIES CALLED DELTA EIGHT. IT HAS SOME OF THE SAME INTOXICATING EFFECTS IS DELTA NINE. IT'S JUST LESS POTENT, EARNING THE NICKNAME WE'D SLIGHT. AND THEY HIT THE SAME RECEPTORS IN THE BRAIN. CORRECT. RIGHT? YES, THEY BIND TO THE SAME ENDO CANNABINOID RECEPTORS THAT OCCUR IN OUR CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. IT SORT OF LOOKS LIKE A DUCK QUACKS LIKE A DUCK AND ACTS LIKE A DUCK IN TERMS OF BEING VERY MUCH LIKE MARIJUANA. YEAH. THE DARK. MAYBE A DUCK. THAT'S ONLY HALF BAKED. PROBLEM IS CANNABIS DOESN'T PRODUCE VERY MUCH DELTA EIGHT. NATURALLY SO WHILE IT CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM LEGAL HAMP, IT'S MORE COMMONLY SYNTHESIZED FROM CBD. YOU'RE A CHEMICAL PROCESS KNOWN AS ISOMERIZATION. IN MANY CASES, DELTA 8 MAY ACTUALLY BE SPRAYED ONTO THE HEM FLOWER. L SPIKED. WE'VE BASICALLY AS A BOTANIST, WE BLEND IS DOWNRIGHT OFFENDED BY THE BAIT AND SWITCH. YOU KNOW IT'S EXPLOITING THE INDUSTRIAL HEMP LEGISLATION. IT'S LIKE, LOOK, IF YOU'RE GONNA GROW DRUGS AND SELL DRUGS, LET'S CALL THEM DRUGS. THE FARM BILL THAT LEGALIZED HAVE DOESN'T MENTION DELTA EIGHT, BUT IT MAKES HIM PRODUCTS LEGAL AS LONG AS THEY CONTAIN LESS THAN 80.3% OF DELTA. NINE T. H C. THEN, LAST AUGUST, THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION SAID THE FARM BILL DOESN'T COVER SYNTHETICALLY DERIVED TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL. LT'S THEY DON'T COME DIRECTLY FROM THE HEMP PLANT ITSELF. IN THAT CASE, DELTA IT WOULD FALL UNDER THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT, JUST LIKE DELTA NINE T. H C. IN OTHER WORDS, DELTA EIGHT IS LEGAL IF EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM HEMP. BUT MAYBE NOT, IF SYNTHESIZED FROM CBD. EVEN IF THAT CBD WAS ORIGINALLY EXTRACTED FROM HEALTH. CONFUSED. YOU'RE NOT ALONE. I THINK CONGRESS IS GOING TO NEED TO ASK. CONGRESS IS GONNA HAVE TO DECIDE ONCE AND FOR ALL HOW TO REGULATE THESE PLANT CANNABIS CITY EVEN IN ALL OF ITS FORMS AND VARIETIES. BODY, WIBERG'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE MINNESOTA BOARD OF PHARMACY, THE PICTURE IS JUSTICE CONFUSING, HE SAYS. UNDER STATE LAW, WHICH ALLOWS THE SALE OF NON INTOXICATING CANNABINOIDS FROM HEMP. PROBABLY IS. DELTA EIGHT IS INTOXICATING. ANOTHER STATE LAW MAKES IT ILLEGAL TO SELL A MISBRANDED DRUG NOT APPROVED BY THE FDA. AND CLEARLY, PEOPLE ARE MAKING MEDICAL CLAIMS ABOUT DELTA EIGHT. OH, WHAT KIND OF PAIN RELIEVER? REALLY IN GENERAL. WHAT ANXIETY. ALL OF THAT INFORMATION, ANXIETY, ALL OF HELP WITH ALL. THERE'S NO ADVERTISING NOTHING ON THE LABEL. IT'S HARDER FOR REGULATORS TO PROVE INTENT. I THINK IT SPEAKS ALSO TO JUST THE STATE THAT WE'RE IN WITH COVERT 19 WAS SEEN ABSOLUTE SKYROCKETING OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, AND I THINK MANY OF US. ARE DESPERATE TO GET ADVICE OR SOME RELIEF ANYWHERE THAT WE CAN AND DR STEVEN DAHMER'S OF MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR GREEN GOODS, ONE OF TWO LICENSE PRODUCERS OF MEDICAL CANNABIS IN MINNESOTA. HE WORRIES DELTA EIGHT COULD SET THE ENTIRE CANNABIS INDUSTRY BACK. IT'S FIRED. BEWARE THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GETTING, AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE MIGHT BE INCLUDED IN THAT. WHICH BRINGS US BACK THE SAMPLES. WE TOOK TOW LEGEND TECHNICAL SERVICES IN SAINT PAUL, WHICH DOES TESTING FOR THE HEMP INDUSTRY AND IS ONE OF THE FEW LABS WE FOUND THAT COULD TEST FOR BOTH DELTA EIGHT AND DELTA 90 HC. FLOWER OR BUD IS NEARLY 2% DELTA, EIGHT MORE THAN THE PLANT WOULD MAKE NATURALLY MEANING IT COULD BE SPIKED. ACCORDING TO OUR EXPERTS, IT'S 14% CBD. THAT'S QUITE A BIT. AND TWICE THE LEGAL LIMIT FOR DELTA NINE TOTAL T. H C AT 90.75. BUT LIKELY NOT ENOUGH TO BE INTOXICATING. GUMMIES ON THE OTHER HAND, OR 0.6% DELTA EIGHT AND JUST MINUSCULE AMOUNTS OF T, H C AND CBD.

When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the

karu we're going to get into uh cannabis legalization in japan so let's just get right into it hey karu miggy hi hello yo happy sunday happy sunday sunday hey kairu thank you so much for joining us to talk about cannabis in japan i don't know anything about cannabis in japan uh and and i see you have an at right there karu atkaru thc is that an app for your instagram or what right right it's a stuff a name for like a t uh twitter and instagram and everything i use on the web in the web so nice so cool yeah i'm looking forward to this one too uh i said before i've been to japan and uh that was like 15 years ago in what year were you uh was it oh five [ __ ] man i i'm old bro like yeah yeah well i've been to yokosuka and i've been to uh uh kyoto i've been a couple places in there yeah but you know 105. i don't remember brother that's that i don't know what's that that's where i got it yeah when i went to japan you know you know five i went to kyoto and some other ones it was when i was teaching english in korea oh you would go to japan for like a weekend to get reset on your visa in korea because you left the country for three days i yeah i used japan to re-rack my uh stay in korea but let's talk about uh how we can find you on the internet and what they're doing to shut you down all right so like how long have you been doing youtube i've been doing like almost three years right now two or three years and then the uh this is your second channel you're on right yes this is my second channel uh what happened to the first channel uh personal i don't know somehow it got banned you know like youtube telling me like i'm selling something sketchy you know something illegal but i haven't done it but they just took my channel down is it really how many subs did you lose i was like 5k okay i know it's a lot it still takes time like it took us like over a year to get our first yeah i'm trying to recalling the numbers but it's pretty pretty tough right now yeah the algorithm goes slower before it goes faster so like that like we got up to ten thousand and took forever and then it was just like oh yeah really okay okay i'm not sure if our laws and then japan's laws make for it more difficult for you because like for some reason once joe biden got sworn in they started serving us like on suggested videos and ours started to take off but carol is really a a mystery that you got banded when actually you actually actually also got arrested though for just speaking up yeah right um yeah i have like web media it's like web vlog and i was providing like you know medical info about cannabis and how they can grow it you know how people can grow it because a lot of resources are in english so i just translated it you know and i learned it from the school like from the old sedum and i was just providing the info but they came the policies police in japan came to my place and you know i kind of got raped at so yeah i got arrested because of that did you have any plans uh in japan yeah were you growing no i don't i didn't have anything when i was in japan do they have flour in japan or is it all like concentrates out there oh actually we have like both and then we have edibles too but it's illegal so you know you know what you're gonna get how you go do you have medical cannabis in japan no way no way we don't have oh my god yeah i mean we don't we don't believe like medical cannabis you know most of people do not believe that do do they know what their endocannabinoid system is uh some people like us you know but not like majority of them and you know like you asked me like how illegal that was and i don't know if it's like you know it's a good example but one gram of wheat is like a 50 to 60 bucks in japan so oh my god wow very expensive this is like wow 50 bucks worth of weed in japan it's terrible this is like a very expensive [ __ ] going on seriously garbage but looking at it like man did i screw up that batch oh well yeah i know 50 60 bucks for a gram that's that's bad enough that i just want to do the uh that's why so car like in japan like when i was out there uh they advised us don't get arrested because the family has to bring you food and stuff in japan is that true is that a thing like yoga is law enforcement system well asha you cannot like family cannot bring to food or any anything to like jail system jail so but you can like give like books and i don't know some kind of claws but okay another food i was just wondering because uh i mean that just be more of a burden on like you know uh being arrested or whatnot what is the fine for being what happens if you get arrested for well it depends on what they do what they did but if you get arrested you will get like seven less than seven to ten years in jail time and or maybe you have to pay the fine it's like uh twenty thousand two three thousand yeah in the usd i mean it's a japanese game but it's kind of the same right like yeah right so that's a lot well you're on me bro what do the japanese business people do then because they uh they fly to well they before the pandemic they would fly to the the uh west coast all the time so they they have to be coming back from like america going like no bro it was awesome like you could just smoke weed nobody cared you know damn why why is japan so against marijuana cannabis uh well i have no idea but we have like a health art ministry his health ministry health labor and welfare ministry uh i believe they're doing like propaganda stuff you know a lot so it's not based on scientific [ __ ] i mean it's not based on scientific stuff so we still we still got like brainwashed yeah right that's like yeah we had the we there's a lot of brainwashing still and so like when a state will try to legalize here in america there's always still somebody that's like the children are gonna be stupid and everybody's gonna go bad and and then and then think of the children so you're just really hurting everybody and then you have to be like karen sit down sit down yeah but it's not that bad internationally though like you know prohibition has been like the other great thing that america has exported right like what was it before because there was indian hemp being using ropes and sales was there ever a before time for cannabis in japan wait can i get that christian again yeah no worries like you know prohibition came from america for the most part uh do you win we signed the the what's that agreement uh tom where you know we said hey we're not gonna do business with you unless everybody's freaked out about weed and then uh but before all that you know indian rope hemp rope was used in you know selling uh and when i say indian i mean from india so you know you guys are over there so was there a before time for hemp and marijuana being used oh yeah actually i don't think it's like a public record or anything but we have like a very old picture like we small cannabis in old japan you know and actually it was like a used for medicinal reasons too so i don't know how they i mean i know how they got banned but now it's bound completely sure and can i can i add one more thing about like being brainwashed sorry so this is like this i have to tell you about this but the health ministry tells people if you use cannabis once your life is going to be messed up forever that's what we know i mean that's how we believe to everybody from the japanese health ministry tuning in don't forget to like and subscribe and then in nine more minutes or ten more minutes it's gonna be 4 20 somewhere and uh we aren't going to do it on the screen uh but after five seconds you could see us um or at least one of us i think miggy no you're gonna hit somewhere i ain't prohibited at this moment but i will be later all right well one of us will hit it and then we'll see how violent i get uh after after the smoke break all right all right yeah it's just wild because your health ministry sounds like what we used to get with those psas they ever see like uh you know the the inflated girl on the couch she's all flat out and then the other girl be like becky used to be fun until she started smoking weed like i want becky's weeds what i want and seriously and not only that like these ads that miggy's talking about they're only about 10 to 15 years old so they were like during the bush administration like mid-2000s they had known for over a decade that the endocannabinoid system is a thing right they were just still brainwashed brainwashed brainwashed just like the japanese health ministry they're like oh you smoke weed you will immediately become violent yeah all right just just a second everybody ten more minutes we're gonna see how violet i get rj says that you should be able to get cannabis in the drugstore in japan before world war ii that was that's true oh damn i guess so i guess so i mean there's a place we could get weed but i don't think it's like a dispensary or anything but it's just kind of pharmacy you know like a local pharmacy or something but it was like a pretty pretty old age though i guess well it's an ancient medicine overall like i don't understand how i mean acupuncture all this stuff comes from asia and how like are you guys gonna be like oh let's just get skip this one like how is that even a [ __ ] option i don't know i don't know it seems so uncivilized you know especially you tell me if i'm wrong but like in japanese culture it's a very prideful culture right you want to be the best of the best and for your people i mean you guys are the size of california with three times the population so uh i mean that's a lot of people to put on the same path to like it's not going to kill you so there's a question like why are these penalties so steep i mean you said you're talking about like seven years in jail 20 to 30 000 in fines yeah why you know like how is it classified i i why that's the question i have too i mean that's the question all we have to like this you know 420 people you know i have no idea probably like you know if we smoke we i mean we have like tendencies to kill someone you know that's what they believe that's why i guess that's not just like that's just not wrong that's like like i feel bad for people who think that way that way and they have power i'm like wow you're so stupid and what are you you're the prime minister well hell here in here in the states you know south dakota the the attorney general stopped pros or uh was not helping stop the uh because the south dakotans approved medical and recreational and the ag got in trouble for alcohol but yet doesn't want to help medical marijuana that's that's the same problem almost here right people in power right ignorant it's so [ __ ] wrong did the u.s drug war help influence the policy in japan on cannabis well i hope so you know like recently like u.s not not the us but the whole like risk of you the cannabis right it's supposed to it's supposed to be helping right now but right now we have like a we have like creating we have thinking to create another like another fine penalty for like usage of cannabis which we used to we which we didn't use to have it yeah so it's very messed up right now it's 2021 you know yeah in the future right yeah it's the future you all have internet right right we all have internet and you know we can use google translate or anything you know but still some people i mean majority of us do not know anything about this so i'm here were you arrested for uh cannabis possession like did you have weed on you and they're like hey you're arrested or or tell us about your criminal background with the cannabis plan oh uh when i get arrested i didn't have anything you know i was just providing info yeah because i have this web media and i was you know making video and pop my video is like on public and youtube that's why so like it's like a criminal conspiracy like you're like telling people right facts about weed or were you telling people how to grow weed yeah yeah yeah yeah police think like thought like i'm pushing to people like using and growing cannabis yeah that's a conspiracy to commit a crime i guess that they they could definitely do that but then the problem really is well that statute's probably unconstitutional but um how do they change laws in japan uh how did they lost in japan how did they change laws in japan right now uh actually it's not changing yet it hasn't been changed yet but we are thinking right now they are thinking right now to create new laws it's up to the legislatures they're not up to the people like you can't well i don't think it's up to us you know even though we like do something i don't think they'll listen to us yeah they're not elected officials then right it's official but you don't know whether you know the meeting holds meeting is held in and you cannot like just join to the meeting or anything you know and the thing is like a media company cannot take a movie or anything during the meeting so i don't know what's going on there you know we can read dialogue after that but those dialogues are like a pretty much you know pretty pretty but you know there are some people yeah i'm sorry no science is getting done in cannabis at all then in japan yeah no science it's like a very very few sciences in berbin with our law do you think like for popular opinion could you just be like look we're more like china right now we should be more like america like like i mean because i'd be offensive right because i mean that's oh yeah yeah i'm pretty sure the japanese and the chinese they don't they don't have they aren't the biggest friends personally i don't get offensive you know i don't get offended by the i'm actually i believe china is like more advanced right now you know i think they are doing some kind of research sure but i mean as far as impressing you and putting you in you know free speech yeah like it's not free speech you're like oh i was incredible i don't know if i have free speech right now you know i got arrested so i don't know do i have free speech your youtube channel and so like was it just a whole bunch of law enforcement in uh japan just like flagging all your videos and trying to get you just bumped off i wonder well oh my question sorry hey good who do you think uh helped try to get you cancelled from youtube or like shut down with your first channel oh i am a nurse like people who doesn't like you know who doesn't like cannabis or who i mean like basically haters basically haters because i got one report and got fun i i don't know all my friends they didn't have it like before they didn't have that things like before so come on one penalty got burned i don't know what's going on were you in jail actually i wasn't in jail but there's some kind of place it looks like a jail you know like before i mean i didn't get guilty i didn't get charged as a guilty when i get arrested so i didn't go to court or anything so i just got freed but i was in like similar place that's jail like for 40 days you were detained you're 40 days oh yeah 40 days oh hell no wow yeah i know i know one gram of weed was will found found from my place by 40 days staying there somewhere i don't know damn dude i'm so sorry to hear that i thought i thought japan was within 20 at least up to 2021 not like in 1930 holy [ __ ] yeah i know i know i i was like believing like we are living the same era same age but somehow we are like i don't know living a strong age i don't know yeah no science behind that it would be hilarious if like japan was just like math um because they're they're an advanced society you know they have thousands of years of history higher education all sorts of you know universities and and school is is you know is college-free in japan do you get to go to college or how much is that well actually it's not free but if you well there's i believe there's no free college or university but if it's like a national college or university you can pay less and i think you have to pay like less than ten thousand annually if it's like a national university but if it's private you know it costs more though right but all that education all that learning don't know anything about weed well actually we have like a drug education class too right you know yeah brainwashing stuff right pretty much because you know what what what we are believing is like we still there are some people who still thinks like we need to inject herb or i don't know some kind of liquid stuff to into our veins if it's like a weed or anything you know this is our educational this is our education about drugs so it's horrible do they realize like most of the addiction and wrong that's happening was actually like like in hong kong with the opium dens that had nothing to do with china that was all exported from anglos like like the european like the market and the trades it all came from the early days of people just taking advantage of the lower people saying hey we've got this nice little something if you want to smoke it and then it that that's the origins it had nothing to do with like all of a sudden people are like i found opium let's just do this now right right we did that too it was like taiwan i guess yeah we did just uh horrible but it had nothing to do with like something that's inherent to your guys land like like cannabis can grow and everybody can have an experience it's it's it's it's it's a wellness thing not this you're longering that they're throwing down your throat that sucks dude um lily seitz i don't know what this question means but uh she gave us two dollars and it's for you and then she's asking what are carlo's three sizes i don't know she gave me two [ __ ] so i had to put it up there let me just ask him i don't know is there anybody like who wants to know what my suicides are you know before we get to that let's just go ahead and find a question though we're going to be uh let's let's test the propaganda from the japanese ministry of health uh just a second you know it's it is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] looking great looking great well i've turned myself in an anime character that's illegal right there right now let me let me just try one more try just to see if this one makes me violent [Applause] [Music] science all right all right i think it did like uh kind of made my eyes get a little uh softer you feeling homicidal yet ah no but i do want to go shove people i i think i understand what they were talking about i i don't know why as soon as i inhaled that cannabis i'm like i should push somebody and be like you look at me punk look at me i figure you want to kill a pizza bro uh no i i ate before the show so i'm fine i'm just totally fine yeah so kyra how did you find cannabis in the land of nothing like like how did you be like so how did i find out our first experience uh actually after i went to high school in japan i went to hawaii for college and there's a social study class or social class and you know i took one class and there's a textbook says like know the difference between country and country or something like that and i found out one article saying like cannabis can be used as a medicinal purpose but in the other hand like some countries see some countries see that plant is like a very very harmful drug you know and i was kind of surprised because what we have been taught was like a you know evil drug you know so i started my research by googling it and you know i went to straight i made sure first of all i made sure it's okay you know by myself and i went to street and you know buy something from someone some local dude and yeah i bring back to my dorm tree and i smoked it in the bathroom and that was amazing i was watching like my favorite dvd of my you know favorite band and i was really enjoying so i thought that was like you know what we have been taught was totally live but tom charles made a pretty good joke on it you know that's why they call them the pusher man cause after you get high you want to push people that's a lie but anyway karu let's talk about your youtube channel so people can go over there and give it some subscribes what's the name of the youtube channel man uh the channel name is like the high class the high class check out the eye class awesome yep the high class and i do love your your channel have sometimes you'll just i mean it is all in japanese so i'm just watching it sometimes just for your brain because you'll just zoom in on something that's just like hey i'm here i love it thanks cool i love wheat all right well it looks like we're uh we're eyeing like 20 39 for legal japan weed uh which kind of stinks do you know anything about like land races landlords of japan sure oh i believe i have read some articles like there's a long list from japan and it's in like not in tokyo but it's called hokkaido it's pretty local and cold place but actually we have like hemp with there you know like a cannabis but they're still growing in it but it has like a th zello on it so i don't know if you guys want to smoke it or not but that's what we have does it has anybody ever run any uh coas on that weed to see what its cannabinoid profile is like if it has cbd or thc or they they don't test it they just burn it they're like there it is get it we don't have like i believe like we don't have anything like testing like you know kind of profile you know if we have it i mean we i don't know probably our science got had been better right that it really must have broke your heart though when you first discovered like you had to leave your country to realize you're being lied to right right it's just crazy just and then when you go back to your country they arrest you and they throw because you were disseminating information and you had zero cannabis right right i was treated like very very good way you know in japan so damn dude crazy um so it doesn't even like we shouldn't even ask if there's a bill is there a bill in the legislature for legalizing weed in japan i mean you did say there was some things moving but then it also sounds like it's so the words draconian in the sense that it's just really really stuck in the past and it seems extremely strict yeah is there anything on the legislative side like do any politicians advocate for changing the law well actually we have few people few represents you know but like most of us do not know what we did so you know those kind of people cannot be like uh elected you know right so that's a tough thing it was really hard like 10 years ago even in the united states now it's easier but 10 years ago you couldn't like in the the cannabis the legal cannabis market was just nothing compared to where it is now 10 years ago politicians would give the money back if they found out it came to you probably now politicians don't give the money back honestly and one more thing like we have like celebrity like who was who was actress and she was pretty famous in japan she was a candidate for the election but you know the media like destroyed like completely because you know she well she had it at the time so that's kind of bad though but you know like still you do weird she's that's why she's crazy or something like that so like was there a celebrity in japan that advocated for medical cannabis and the media just kind of like just ruined her career yeah pretty much they ran our carrier not our carriers but yeah celebrities like this century we have like one guy who likes sweet and you know telling like we doesn't ruin your life or anything but like few months ago he got arrested too and you know like media is like attacking him like so much and they're like talking about something it's true or not you know we don't know but just you know totally bsing you know yeah the only bad thing about when you organize the the redditor's mob to do something to japan to either screw up their stock market or legalize oh yeah right right right we need a late test money for sure like you know like breaking our laws or anything i don't know that's what i'm guessing there's no japanese normal i don't think so you know i mean they call it marijuana do they call it cannabis they call it weed what do they call it oh we call it like a weed you know like you guys do and we call that thing like kusa which means just a glass you know yeah for for weed is that you say it's like a graph yeah glass in japanese but you know oh okay yeah that's flying for that or maybe we call it like oyasai which means like a vegetable in japanese yeah sounds crazy though when you say these words are you kind of like being on a slide because i mean like you know it's kind of like lingo because there's no real word for cannabis weed in your language so you're using the alternatives as far as like um yo can i have a quarter pound potato you know i mean like yeah something like that we can use that too you know someone called it like as a tomato or two so so it's so funny that there's no word for it on your in your culture in your language like i mean obviously it's the failing right there i know but the potato cost you like 50 bucks come on yeah per gram yeah 5 gram what kind of expensive potato is that you know seriously third thing like if weed was 50 bucks a gram i'd be like nah i'm fine i'm gonna go have some soju i'm sorry some sake you know seriously though i mean you're you're they're encouraging alcoholism opposed to something that's wellness right i mean actually we have like uh the number of alcoholism people like it's been increasing right now since we have like this kind of it's very tasty sweetie it's kind of a full local thing you guys know for local right it's a booming lino well the pandemic didn't help yeah panda may help like consuming that too for sure for sure i can't you are gonna be advocating for change in your country for a while for decades just like miggy and i were always looking at me dude yeah i remember he had hair like me and he didn't have a any beard i used to be white it used to be white yeah okay dress man really oh man japan so how say like if i'm gonna try and find some weed in japan like where did you go like i mean how do you yeah do that where did you go i don't know why well you said like you were in yokosuka right yeah i think that i love american people like who's in italy and probably they have it or maybe you just go to twitter and you know like saying i want glass [Music] but you know you don't know what you're gonna get like some people are pretty shady i don't know you know everyone is not like very kind so yeah it's i don't sure i can go to japan for like tourism hopefully i don't if i try to speak uh at anything regarding what i do for a living i might get arrested and and then also i'd be like oh you guys got any like you know kush they'd be like huh well you know do you have any uh oh gee kush i i like the string oh um no i mean like every that would suck i don't think i could go back to buying wheat on the street where i'm just at the mercy of stock you know right and japan's got an agriculture culture it's huge i'd imagine you'd have some phenomenal weed right somebody from midwest toker you guys are missing out on marketing godzilla weed like that would just be awesome just exactly though missing market opportunities they can screw with her profiles until it tastes like cherry blossoms oh [ __ ] that'd be a great one good right right damn hey we got cherry blossoms here in washington i should get somebody on that [Music] one of the uh some of the big strain names are cherry like cherry pie cherry wine especially in the the cbd space but that stuff was probably the right thc one what's cbd can you do cbd in japan well actually the cbd thing is like booming right now but the restriction is like very different from other countries so some kind of cbd i don't know what it's called liquid or tin tincture if we have like a more than 0.003 tsc you we cannot like import the stuff from you know you guys so i don't know flower flower yeah no we can't have it wow yeah i mean i just smoked my first cbd this weekend uh delta eight rather yeah because i have access to regular weed i don't get that stuff but i actually enjoyed it and i was like if i lived in kansas or some place where weeds not friendly i would buy this stuff but you can't even get the flower there it's very difficult i mean definitely it's illegal so you know i don't know what kind of flower you can get you know even though you pay for like 50 bucks or something see this is one of the reasons why i'm not an eccentric billionaire also i don't have a billion dollars but if i did i'd be like get the jet or something and then uh get thousands of weed seeds and then just blanket the country right right blossoms are coming up be like okay we uh and we could turn it into a youtube show we might get arrested uh it was kind of like mr beast he always says like i'm here in my friend's house so we're gonna explode it with something foam you know uh i'm here in japan we're about to plant 10 000 weeds well speaking of can you get seeds delivered i mean like here in the united states people get uh we work around the whole novelty thing right like it's just a seed it doesn't weigh anything 1 100 of a gram that whole novelty thing is not legally defensible here's the defense your honor i had 1 100th of a gram on me can i leave yes damn but can you get seeds out there or are they stopping we can't get seeds actually actually but i know it's uh illegal so what about we do importing we we do import from some kind of europe countries you know from england spain probably u.s canada yeah amazon for sure for sure yeah that's what people do over there you know like i got my homeboy hooked me up from um purple city genetics shout out to purple city genetics in oakland california and this is a cross of a banana og and a purple punch so some of those seeds after i get the run that i'm done with now there's six seeds in there point zero five grams that's right so like it's approximately a hundred seeds per gram and most states in america at least have decriminalized an ounce a weed or less so that would be like you know 2 800 cannabis seeds per ounce so yeah you know that would be your possession limit in illinois yeah that's that's a lot of seeds right right that's a lot of seas i mean seed in japan is like a very expensive too though you know yeah if it's like a oto and a feminized flower seas it costs you like a 30 bucks to 50 bucks per seed so yeah one seed one seed yeah and a plant might make well when you're making seed you're making thousands of seeds so uh yeah the seed companies do fairly well that's an interesting thing right and then for some reason a lot of them are sold on the internet for some reason you know you mentioned twitter earlier when i asked you about like how to get uh weed and i think like in in the asian culture like when i was over there in um like early 2000's before the united states cellphones are everywhere kids had cell phones like everybody had a cell phone but not united states not yet you guys always seem to be ahead but i think as far as like online goes uh do you have a japanese discord or anything that you're using to because that's that's what you need you need a network you need to get people together you need to like band together in case someone gets arrested and taken away for 40 days that's what i think you need to do to help move the conversation out there is there anything that you have out there that you're doing that you can let people know well that is that some people who know about this know about know what happened to me and you know like doing something but definitely we have like a only only few people do some kind of stuff you know and then most of us like people who enjoy we like smoking weed they probably do not want to you know like disclose what they what food they are you know to legalize it because they have like risk to get arrested too if we like advocate so it's very difficult situation right now yeah we uh we are allowed to advocate so much we can have a mob of people push down our capital and invade it while they're doing official government business and they still won't get uh impede well he got impeached for it but he didn't get convicted so yeah yeah just saying like [ __ ] up [ __ ] happens they were yeah thank you think about it you could be in russia or even the china thing like like so like because i know in china like like facial recognition is big the whole social programming when it comes to like online digital is that a thing out there too because are you easily ping can they find kyuru and go okay this motherfucker's ip is preaching about cannabis we need to shut them down is that a thing out there oh in japan i don't think we have like such you know advanced technology and uh if we have it i'm pretty sure we cannot use that you know we are very conservative people that's why yeah that's good the japanese are just like rank ever not the japanese the chinese are like rank everyone and record everything so that we can control everything that's the kind of sounds pretty dystopia though you know yeah yeah it's japan not japan china will be the origin of the dystopia oh man i do not have any qualms like i'm pretty sure like in between between china and maybe saudi arabia or like somewhere that's like really really in the past and like you know crazy beliefs that they're just very rigid on those are the ones that you know we have to work real hard all right we understand how to digitize people we can just get rid of them all and then put them into a hard drive somewhere and be like okay they can't blow us up anymore right yeah the black mirror is real really i mean i don't know if you've ever seen the netflix uh episode the black mirror it's a a season or a show like twilight zone sci-fi china's already doing a lot of that stuff the the the social points for being a good citizen type [ __ ] like oh okay okay yeah now i know what you guys are talking about yeah i'm just saying like in if that influences you but you seem more westernized when it comes to your rights personally which is good yeah that sucks for you well it sounds like they have privacy more so than they have in other countries but then they need to learn we need it it's sorely lacking education when it comes to cannabis yeah i think people in japan or like the the people in charge the ignorant ones are kind of like the ignorant people here in america who are still waiting around watching california to fall and collapse from prop 2015 from 20 years ago like they still call it an experiment this is no longer an experiment people has been legalized uh thing like for more than decades you know we know what's going on there so i still can't believe that like burning cannabis in japan though yeah am i off topic am i okay no i'm not good brother in the philippines they just murder people if they find them with drugs you know that yeah yeah that is savage you know it's like hey you you broke the rules murder them i don't know man death or get [ __ ] for 40 days locked up i mean like how do you step away like i mean come on they they take you away put you in for you know for 40 days can you go to work you lose your job what happens it's [ __ ] up yeah man well actually nothing happened for me because i was there in japan i was in japan and i got arrested because while i was waiting for walking visa in mexico so you know i was jobless dude you know i didn't have any jobs so i was okay but if this happened to someone like who had a job who has career those people their lives would be like ruined for sure it's 40 days you know that's so [ __ ] crazy 40 days not one gram a week not one week you know no single nothing i have it nothing i had it but you know just providing an invoice well i mean i'm still trying to test the department of health of japan's department of health's ministry's official uh position that smoking weed uh makes you violent so just a second [Music] [Applause] [Music] let me somebody said snort weed i'm trying they ain't working you stop it you're gonna be like pretty bad person if you smell it that's what we believe that's tasty but uh nope nope still not violent cool cool so [ __ ] crazy

coosa coosa yeah yeah i like new words you prospered yeah i know but i mean if you called it that nobody would know but then that's one more question that i wanted to ask because uh a lot of japanese students and you were one of them like you said that you traveled to hawaii when you were in college and so do a lot of japanese students uh travel abroad to the united states or canada where it's also legal uh for education and university mm-hmm do they why what what was it concerned sorry i was kind of zoned out but sorry i haven't smoked yet but you know sorry yeah i want to know like do a lot of students like you uh travel to america or to uh canada when they're in college oh yeah like i mean it was like a few people doing that but right now you know it's kind of getting english but you know since this like undercover situation we cannot do that though but yeah we have some people we have some people but not a lot and if they went to if they go to canada they definitely like weed you know it's pretty obvious but they go there for that or california yeah i was in california too and somebody else was asking about what are your three sizes damn you really i'm not you know i don't have like that kind of sexy proportions you know i'm not like a regular like small dude from japan so you know definitely making like a normal one but like um is this an actual saying what are your three sizes is this a question that people ask well it doesn't happen to like guys but you know like okay i do like live streaming like kind of every day and some guy like keep asking what my three sizes uh i don't know and i know he is a guy you know i don't know what's going on there but no i love trolls take those numbers take those clicks oh no no we have it it is your bust waist hip measurements those are the three sizes like this being something that i am completely unfamiliar with because i live in like illinois where it's like hey man you're a woman that's cool you can also be equal to us it's like what are your three sizes i'm sorry what are you talking about like you just you don't ask that but uh now i have the concept that japan is a more uh patriarchal society in the sense that like the man kind of rules and the woman's own or subservient yeah so it is that's that's why they can get away with that right right i mean we what are you talking about like sextimating sexism in japan right now no no i'm talking about sexism like you know just the the whole thing of saying like what are your three sizes that kind of that question in and of itself if somebody asked that in america especially at a job interview that company would be sued you know definitely definitely i mean we didn't realize that like lately like we realized that like recently because you know the olympic in japan we were still thinking like like holding that stuff but the some guy first charging of the olympic committee or something he said something pretty sexism said and now it's cancelled like completely because of like the thing what he told so yeah we are very very i'm not sure like where advanced countries you know like you guys we have like a lot of systems going on still so oh we have uh people as well have you ever heard of q anon yeah i know that i know that it's booming in japan too i mean no i know and the thing is like we have like some kind of people like talking about politics about u.s i mean which is not related to our lives directory you know we actually we're stupid awesome i mean i i don't know i don't know you know we got impaling like something really nice from you guys too but yeah some kind of you know kind of idiotic things we are importing too i'm sorry but you know you get such a nice country though yeah you should try our weed it's

you know you should do no don't try to communicate just relax see what happens we know from animal experiments that the endogenous cannabinoid system is very important in regulating motor activity that very type of activity that is impaired in Parkinson's disease from animal experiments we also know that boosting certain branches of the endocannabinoid system is helpful in relieving symptoms of Parkinson's finally from anecdotal information we know that certain patients who smoke marijuana experience relief of their symptoms I think you're calm down amazing he used just a single drop and his hands afterwards were rock steady and the dyskinesia left I bet it works most of the time oh did you guys see much oh yeah like we could really easy I wanna yeah please pretty angry that thank you my home state the number one frustration that I have is knowing that there is this untapped potential comes from what marijuana state is teaching us to generate new medicines and being stuck because of financial issues or politically issues that is extremely frustrating we now know that medical marijuana controls dyskinesia and yet it's not it's not available to us", "HMcaV3V8Z1U": "warning the views expressed in this video are not necessarily the views or opinions of the sponsors i am not a doctor or a lawyer always consult experts when making medical decisions i am a legal licensed medical marijuana patient in my state this is an educational video intended for viewers that are 18 or older in today's video we are going to be talking about delta 8 thc specifically hemp derived delta 8 thc is it really legal does it really get you medicated what's the difference between delta 8 and delta 9. i'm going to tell you everything i think that you should know about delta 8 in this video stay tuned [Music] good morning everybody my name is nate and this is nate on cannabis and today we are talking about delta eight i am sure by now you have heard of delta eight over the last six months or so i've seen it everywhere all over the internet and to be honest i've been extremely skeptical i have a lot of history with hemp products and while i do love full spectrum cbd oils and full spectrum hemp products there is a lot of snake oil salesmen out there when it comes to cbd not all cbd and hint products are created equal and even the really good hemp products that i found and there are quite a few while some do a very good job of relaxing you and relieving stress and anxiety none of them get you stoned none of them get you any kind of inebriation there is no intoxicating effect with any hemp product that i've ever tried that is until now i finally broke down and tried some delta eight thc hemp derived delta a thc and my experience was very surprising as a matter of fact the first time i tried these so these are 25 milligrams a piece right i was so skeptical about getting stoned off of a hemp product that i took three of them my normal dose from delta 9 thc is about 20 milligrams that is personally where i like to be i took 75 milligrams of delta 8 and boy howdy there is not a whole lot of difference between these gummies and the gummies that you would get at a dispensary there's a few differences and we're going to talk about it but before we get into the video i have to show a little bit of sponsor love this video is brought to you by elevate holistics elevate holistics is a telehealth clinic offering medical marijuana recommendations right here in missouri and if you need your medical marijuana card and click the link in the description you can get your medical marijuana card for just 75 now that is an affiliate link but i do not get paid if you click that link and sign up elevate holistics is a sponsor on the channel already i already got their money but if you use that link in the description it will save you fifty dollars off the normal 125 card which means you can get it for 75 dollars and saves you a little bit of money so shout out to elevate holistics link in the description all right back to delta eight so so i was talking to the manager of cassfield dispensary a while back charlie who is quickly becoming one of my favorite people now she knows that i suffer from an anxiety disorder and because of that i'm a big fan of edibles gummies they are longer lasting i don't have to medicate every 30 to 45 minutes to keep my anxiety in check i can take one dose now and go off to the depths of walmart which if you have an anxiety disorder going to walmart is insane if you don't have an anxiety disorder going to walmart is probably almost equally as insane so i'm a huge fan of gummies but she has suggested that i try delta eight because gummies are kind of expensive and i'm not always a big fan of being so medicated that you can't function sometimes that's fun i enjoy it occasionally but most of the time i need to find some kind of relief to keep my anxiety and my panic in check so that i can go out into the world and function as a normal human being so i got some of these delta eight gummies from native hemp and then shortly after i got these i was sent some delta eight gummies from top shelf hemp now this has been about two weeks and i've had a chance to really dive into them so what is delta eight thc well it is not much different than delta nine thc which you should already be accustomed to if you consume cannabis or are a medical marijuana patient here in missouri delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol is the molecular compound that gives us the intoxicating effect when we consume cannabis right so when we smoke or vape it it gives us that intoxicating effect when we eat it in an edible or consume it our liver turns that delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol into 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol which is a complete different compound of itself which gives us a more inebriating effect it lasts longer when you take inedible it's a little bit stronger it doesn't take as much to get you where you need to be so there are already different types of thc that you should be aware of delta 8 is another one now delta 8 is naturally occurring it naturally occurs in cannabis and it is derived from hemp hemp is just a legal definition for marijuana that has less than 0.3 thc in it so all of the delta 8 on the shelves that are being sold in stores is hemp derived it comes from plants with low delta 9 thc and actually low delta 8 thc delta 8 doesn't really grow in abundance in any plant whether it be hemp or marijuana they actually extract it by isolating and extracting cbd and once that cbd is isolated they use a process that includes acids they actually convert that cannabidiol into delta a thc so it comes out cbd then they turn it into delta eight thc and then put it back into products so they cook it into edibles or they put it into a mixture and spray it onto hemp flour or turn it into a distill it into a concentrate like delta eight dabs or delta eight vape carts and because they derive it from actual hemp legally grown him and because delta 8 is not delta 9 it's being sold all across the country but how legal is it actually is it going to stay legal what if you want to sell delta 8 gummies should you be concerned if you possess delta 8 gummies and you're not a medical marijuana patient should you be concerned well to give you a little bit more information on the legality of delta 8 here is matt gunther with the american cannabinoid association congress is the law making body with constitutional authority to write laws and pass bills so the 2018 farm bill which was crafted by congress and signed into law by the president clearly establishes legislative intent that specifically protects hemp as currently defined now this protects the plant cannabis sativa l and any part of the plant including the seeds derivatives extracts cannabinoids isomers acids salts salts of isomers whether growing or not as long as it's below 0.3 delta 9 thc on a dry weight basis this is important because regulatory agencies do not have the constitutional authority necessary to change this law until congress passes an amendment or updates the language of the farm bill in 2022 this federal definition of hemp that protects delta hthc and other emerging cannabinoids remains the law of the land secondly the language of the interim final rule doesn't target delta 8 thc instead it references synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols now while delta hthc is structurally considered a tetrahydrocannabinol the language of the farm bill specifies that its congressional protections supersede the classifications found in the controlled substance act furthermore delta eight thc isn't usually synthetically derived now while it can be chemically synthesized from non-hemp derived precursors it is generally derived from hemp via the isolation of cbd again not only is delta 8 naturally occurring in the plant it is also derived from the hemp plant both of these characteristics make the compound federally compliant under the 2018 farm bill you can expect delta 8 products to remain legal till at least 2022. now will the federal government change the farm act that remains to be seen that's if we don't see federal legalization of marijuana between now and then which is still kind of what about urine tests what if you work a job where you're kind of afraid to become a medical marijuana patient because you don't want to fail a urine test or maybe you're on probation and parole and you think well i'm going to take some of these delta 8 hemp gummies that way i don't fail on that urine test when my po pops me are you gonna drop hot the answer is yes you are probably going to drop hot you are going to fail your analysis test if you are taking these gummies because even though its delta hthc going in once your body metabolizes that delta eight once your body metabolizes thc in general it all comes out the same most panel tests are testing for thc metabolites so delta 8 delta 9 doesn't matter what's going in it's all coming out the same so if this is something you're using to get by on that account you might want to rethink your strategy people say that it is the same high without the paranoia or anxiety that some people get from taking edibles or overdoing it when they take edibles it does seem to be a less intense experience so if you are a new patient that wants to try edibles maybe you have a medical marijuana card but you haven't tried any of the brands that are out there yet because you've heard the horror stories of people calling 9-1-1 because they thought they were going to die in some cases they thought they already were dead no charges have been filed against a police officer who admits to confiscating marijuana from suspects and then baking it in brownies and once he and his wife were full and high they thought they'd overdosed and called 9-1-1 i think i'm having an overdose of this still as my wife overdose of what marijuana i don't know if they had something in it can you please send rescue did you guys have fever or anything no i'm just i think we're dying how much did you guys have i don't know we made brownies and i think we're dead time is going by really really really really slow well instead of being charged parallel sorry instead of being charged the police department let the officer resign his wife was not charged either so far police officials have not commented on the case now how do you follow a story like that those are funny stories but they can be scary so if you're worried about having an experience like that delta 8 is a good intro into it for me personally i started taking delta 8 because i can't afford dispensary prices all the time i just can't most people probably can't either delta 8 is about half the price of delta 9 thc it's actually a little bit less depending on where you get it these 250 milligram packages of native hemp delta 8 are actually only about 25 and if you pick them up at cass fill dispensary you can get them on sale right now for 19 so if you are looking for a good intro into edibles delta 8 is a good place to start in my opinion or if you're like me and just can't afford to hit the dispensary all the time delta a really gets me through in between those dispensary runs or caregiver drops delta 8 is a good replacement or if edibles tend to give you over anxiety or panic attacks like they do some people then delta a might be something that you want to look into for that because it is it is less intense i feel less anxiety less paranoia all of that that they used to advertise delta 8 i truly experienced just at a less potency than you normally would feel so just to recap delta 8 is hemp derived thc it is made from converting cbd into delta a thc it is 100 legal for now it will make you drop on a urine test so if you're on probation parole or you're in a job or that's a problem i wouldn't recommend using this or any other cannabis products but they do work and they do work as described as always this is a subjective opinion this is my personal experience so let me know in the comments have you tried delta 8 products what did you think about it i am becoming a huge fan and with the current price of edibles at the dispensaries these may be my new go-to for quite some time as always thanks for watching if you enjoyed this video give me a like comment or subscribe it really helps me out and if you like the hoodie you can find it on my website cured.tv shop thanks for watching", "GshuNm0rvkM": "what's up i'm with my

[ __ ] again it's gonna taste like ass no it tastes pretty good i mean it's [ __ ] gummy worms let's see how it goes but um yeah so for those who don't know delta 8 is actually 66 percent the psychoactivity of delta 9 but i mean 500 milligrams you know oh man he's just down and look at that how's it taste [Music] yeah so these are the sour gummy worms so you just downed it we're probably gonna check back in in an hour it's gonna take two hours to kick in but we'll check in every single hour to see where he's at you're gonna he's gonna be drunk yeah i know he's gonna get screwed up

__ ] fried you're gonna be [ __ ] up i'm hoping i'm like paralyzed that's what i'm hoping for so yeah [Music] those taste like real gummy worms though that [ __ ] well no they are real gummies yeah but normally like if you infuse like a cookie with thc and you can still see guy should be [ __ ] up it will be worth it though dude perhaps you're doing that i mean it's not like it's not like you know i mean you don't have to work tomorrow right he's underplaying it dude yeah i'm unemployed baby you're good you're good 25 minutes how do you feel better cousins not bad not bad i don't think it's i feel like it's not hitting yet all right we'll check back in it's a placebo effect right now i his eyes are getting kind of red man i'm baked let's make that right here let's go to the light a bit so these uh people can see how red the eyes are um so guys um i shouldn't say guys i don't like that hey you look at those eyes right there that's what those edibles do after one hour that's 500 milligrams of delta 8 thc um edibles man they're frying me already hell yeah it's been what are you expecting in the next 30 minutes sleeping probably so we'll see if we get any more of this are they sativa indica or what just distilling distillate oh so [ __ ] blacks is that what that is i guess you could call it delta 8 wax i mean wax is desolate um i guess but there's different methods of extracting it like co2 and bho and i guess the consistency determines what you call it but it's just distal it's just super thick and sticky and uh basically the gummies just regular gummies and they actually spray it with the actual thc oil oh wow so you're when you eat the gummies you're literally eating the straight oil on the actual gum that's insane i don't think i heard like a word you said because i'm just [ __ ] just going in and out of my eyes oh okay [Laughter] you feel [ __ ] up oh [ __ ] i can't feel my lips oh no like stuck to my teeth so wait you what do they feel like they feel

peace", "4g7eI5kmFs8": "well what's been great for us is we we primarily invest on the private side and so what you've seen this past year has been a major correction in the industry both on the public side and on the private side having said that I think that we've been stating all along that we think that we've hit the bottom I think that the regulatory agencies of the larger states California particularly message that more effective regulatory efforts along with reduced taxation on the companies that are doing this the right way will lead to a tamping down on the black market but until that happens the black markets going to thrive and you will have situations where the companies that are that are public right now are being judged on pathways to profitability and not just license aggregation like they were you know year year and a half ago we haven't and we have found in California for example the regulations have been so stringent or confusing that many small companies trying to to you know get involved in the recreational pot market have found it very difficult to comply with some of these regulations and that in part is the reason that the black market is still flourished there are we over doing the the regulatory framework when we're trying to allow an industry to grow at the same time now you're absolutely spot-on I mean but but the but the what states like California to realize that reduced taxation is the main problem here if we can get lower tax rates on the companies that are again are doing this legally in the right way then you will have a lot more companies be successful and you'll have a tamping down at the black market but until then the black market has no reason to go away they're just going to continue to do this until they get caught by the same token though are we being too impatient expecting these stocks to provide a return when let's face it this is going to take a while to get various governments state governments provincial governments to accept legalized recreational marijuana you know it's not likely we're gonna hear anything on the federal level for quite some time so it'll happen eventually I guess but we just have to be patient with it right I think you're right and it's both on the public key and the private side you have to realize that without institutional investors in the in the pub in the in the public game you've got a lot of retail investors that don't have that patience and so I think that as and more institutional players are starting to realize that this is an undeniable industry it's not going away and it's just taking a longer time to convert the illicit market into legalized one but as that happens this industry is going to thrive on the legal side and we do need more regulation at the federal level the the house passing the safe banking act was it was a big step in the right direction but you know we have some some wood to chop left on some other pieces of legislation that are coming down the pike very quickly I think one of the biggest hurdles the industry faces is the banking industry itself in this legal limbo they find themselves and where banks don't want to do business with them because it's still illegal federally how do will they get around that can they get around that and where do you see that going we've got 47 companies in our portfolio across three different funds and site and co-investments every single one of them have a banking relationship it just it just isn't easy it will get easier but I got to tell you this is we are as excited as we've ever been about investing in the industry as our our limited partners and we think 2020 is going to be a fantastic year to take advantage of the opportunities that have been like I said earlier brought back down to a more realistic level well we will see you", "-LiSl6f-olQ": "[Music] i'm not a morning person dedicated to being passionate about it bodybuilders have become more lazy people have always thought i lift fake weights iran and the united states you take responsibility for that you know a question we get sent a lot and i think a lot of people want to know um what is the secret to if you want to block up you want to you want you want to have the frame on you but you still want to maintain your shredded abs what's the secret to like bulking but but not getting too fat what's the you know i'm saying how do you do that yeah i think it's it's not it's not bulking bulking it's like a depending some people think about bulking i'll get off my face and just get as big as possible right you're gonna get fat if you do that i'm gonna get fat if i do that like for real some people have good genetics but me if i eat whatever i want like i tried to do that kind of with like uh when i went to 3 30 and uh i was eating a lot of clean food though it wasn't junk but i would add some junk over it it wasn't a good look i think it looked like a big ogre it's like it's not had abs because of my genetics but my back was like you could take my love handles like oh there's a lot of stuff there you know so uh yeah you i don't think bulking is the right way of seeing it it's like i think uh because right now with my coach we're gonna do like we're gonna add some muscle for the olympia but we're gonna use scarb rotation and super high days with it so i think you need to get your body at a good pace where you digest food really well because it's all about digestion if if you don't digest you're gonna the food's gonna sit there you're not to gain a muscle you're going to have a blowing waist it's not good you have a good digestion you figure out your food figure out the digestion and then you start feeding them if you start feeding the the body and then you're going to be always a little bit hungry if you have hunger and the food gets digested really good you can start adding food and your metabolism goes up into carbohydration and i think uh a lot if you do like if you're not hungry you you ate your food if you do a walk after your meal like 10 minutes walk the strong man people do that too keep their appetites up you walk 10 minutes outside on the treadmill you're going to get an appetite so you got to keep your appetite up if you cut your appetite you won't be able to eat getting muscle this is going to be all weird going to hate food and you know and i i did do force feeding when i did my bulk to like 3 30 let's say call it bulk but you know i would never do that again i would never do that again so the thing you got to do if you want to stay lean you just keep your metabolism really high and then use super high days and then cheat meals to like fill back up so you uh you get a little boost but then you go back to your base diet a little boost and then you try to see like uh you play with that and you sleep you get gain if you lose and then if you have like a body fat you got either increasing cardio or sometimes because people they add sugar they have sugar in the diet like too many sugar and it gets you fat and and also if you eat a lot of fats it's going to slow down your digestion so me i like it better low to moderate fat high carbs low sugar and medium protein is pretty much what i've been doing and then we rotate the carbs so yeah if you want abs and you know you want to bulk up at the same time it's kind of the best of both worlds you know if you ever figure it out dm me because you know it's always a given day because to gain weight you have to eat more than you burn to lose weight and have ripped abs you got to burn more than you eat it's counterproductive so you're going to find a bad like pretty much your maintenance weight and then you with training and food you're going to build your body and then high days you jack up your fullness a little bit and then you go back to like uh you know constant thing you have to kind of monitor right constantly because i think the time where i gain the most muscle i look my best is when i do carb rotations when i prep and then and then i can really see the new size where you stop prepping and you actually add more food and a few cheat meals you're like oh [ __ ] yes i'm i'm way bigger than when i was uh i was 268 this morning i said when i was 275 yesterday i 275 yesterday compared to 275 before the prep i mean i'm way bigger now of course there's more things involved as we know you know in the pro level you kind of have to take some stuff and and stuff but yeah so there's that involved also but with that people also if they think like bulk more is better they're gonna their health so that's another thing you know i want to ask you something um because you know you got a drug addiction so i want to get your opinion on marijuana in bodybuilding lifestyle yeah i don't want anything acceptable in bodybuilding lifestyle for appetite for different reasons but do you think it's one can go with the other or do you think it's people should not do that well in canada it's legal and also it's a natural plant it's just a smoke might be bad for the lungs but if you like get two edibles to sleep uh i don't think it's it's i don't think it's bad for you but the thing is like if you're addicted to it and it's ruining your life it's making you lazy yeah it is bad for you if it's making you lazy it makes your training like sloppy and just slow and you don't have to drive to do anything yeah if you're if you did anything if you can't stop you're ready to weed yeah you're addicted you're a weed junkie i guess but if you're um just somebody who like takes edibles or or just or vaped to sleep or something and you wake up you feel like energized or and then you do your day and then you sleep again at night like everything is perfect in your life i don't think it's a problem i did hear that it can increase estrogen i'm not sure if it's true or not yeah i heard that you know but i don't know it's true i just heard that sometimes it can happen so it depends you know like i don't think it's bad personally for me it's like you know what if it's your it's your own body you're a grown man you can do whatever but then again if you're suffering and you can't stop then it becomes a problem right so i think people can do whatever they want as far as drugs if you're not hurting anybody else and you're not suffering you know it's okay but then if you can't if you're suffering then you can't stop then it becomes a real problem it all comes down to your personal genetics and how your body reacts with things that's what i really realize you know in life yeah before we like you said that i think it's such a mild thing the only thing that i've seen a lot it makes people lazy so if you're if you're the thing is because kids will smoke weed your brain is not involved until you're 25. so if you if you take all this drug in your brain it's going to it might hurt your development you might become lazy forever i don't know so it's like uh the best scenario for drugs like don't do any until you're 25 and be reasonable but it's kind of hard to do right you", "lLhz4FCyY6Q": "this puppy was off to say the least poor

what impact the drug has on their mental health and intelligence experts have been unable to make many definitive statements health authorities can only really say marijuana might do harmful things to

marijuana use on the brain is offering fresh evidence that a chronic users brain undergoes significant structural changes for those who've used marijuana regularly over six to eight years what kinds of changes using MRI scans researchers compared the brains of 48 3-point marijuana users who took the drug on average 11 times per week to those of 62 non users the yellow area on this MRI scan shows

same time the MRI shows the marijuana users have greater activity than the control group in another section of the plane called the forceps miner this is the white matter that connects the brains frontal lobes that means according to researchers the pot smokers have more connections to facilitate communication between these lobes and the more efficient communication makes it more responsive to the environment why would marijuana users have higher connectivity and isn't that a good thing not necessarily the report suggests this part of the brain may be compensating for gray matter losses however the study finds that over years of regular use those increased connections wither away meaning the brain may be losing its ability to compensate for lost gray matter then what happens eluding marijuana scientists not involved in this particular study says these longtime users could be at increased risk to be driven by immediate rewards and not looking for more long-term gratification and may be more vulnerable to mood and anxiety problems the authors of the study admit they found no correlation between an individual's IQ and reduced gray matter in the orbital frontal cortex they don't know whether heavy pot users had less grey matter to begin with making them more prone to using the drug and if so whether marijuana made those structural deficiencies worse yet again the public is told more studies are needed so at this point setting aside the emerging consensus among researchers that pot is harmful to the developing brains of adolescents in places where it's legal do leading scientists think there should be a warning label on marijuana some do here's what crystal is Dahl of the University of wisconsin-milwaukee would have it say high THC marijuana can cause subtle cognitive deficits brain structure abnormalities mood and sleep problems daily use is not recommended not recommended at least until the science becomes more conclusive that's the short answer", "27dIDqrHsFE": "[Music] hey everybody dr john here with uh extract lab i'm going to be talking today about what is delta eight delta eight is a form of thc that really is a little bit different from a delta nine thc delta nine thc everybody knows that's the thc that makes you guys has some psychoactive effects it's also the main psychoactive ingredient within the marijuana plant and what delta eight is is it's a form or an isomer of that delta nine thc the reason it's been talked about a lot is because a lot of people are using hemp and derivatives of him to create a delta eight thc and they're doing this with some organic synthesis jiu-jitsu really in the laboratory and they're taking cbd and converting it over to delta 8 on thc the reason they're doing that is because the delta atfc of course has some of the same psychoactive effects that delta 9 phc has albeit they can be quite attenuated from delta a lot of people would say it has like a mellow effect so they're using hemp derived materials um they're hooking it up and they're processing it to the point where it now is converting into a delta eight thc molecule that then they can formulate into vapors or gummies or whatever that is that they're looking to formulate for so that's really what delta eight thc is when you look at it just look at it just look at it it's actually an oil and it looks a lot like a cbd oil or it looks a lot like a thc oil you've seen some nice golden pictures of some of that oils as they're flowing out the oil itself is a little bit more biscuit so it's very very thick hard before you need to really heat it up in order to pour it if you want to make products associated with a delta eight a couple different things you need to be thinking about the first thing is you gotta make sure that there's no delta not in your product because the law says that you have to have less than 0.3 delta 9 thc if you have a delta h thc and you have too much delta 9 in it you're not going to be able to use that product for your vapor or you need to dilute it down so that it doesn't have too much delta line in it that really is delta eight how you can use it the oils they look beautiful for them and you can formulate them into different products like that so really guys that's what delta 8 is all about please subscribe to our channel on youtube like us on instagram we have all kinds of calculators for you guys to use on our website we have guides i don't know a lot of people don't know this but we have guide after guide after guide for you guys we have extraction guides we have distillation guides we have a hemp curing guide go to our website you'll see that there's a lot of products there for you to really look at when you get to the point where you need help with formulations give us a call alright this is dr john thompson for extract lab thanks a lot and take care you", "surc7tlcLW0": "[Music] hey everyone and welcome back to another video in this video i'm going to be discussing the cura leaf nano drops my top two favorite flavors are the unflavored and the lime so i'm gonna be talking about those today and telling you about the taste of the product how it works what do we do with it etc so let's keep watching if you want to and let's get into it so the nano drops are meant to be mixed into a beverage so that you can drink your thc one milliliter and the dropper does show you on it how much one milliliter is you can see right there one milliliter contains five milligrams of thc the retail price for one 150 milliliter bottle is 30 so first off i want to tell you something interesting about the nano aspect of these drops i read the blog from kira leaf about these drops and it told me this about nanotechnology the way that this works is with nanomolecular technology which means the cannabinoids are so small that your body doesn't need to digest them in order for you to feel the effects they're water soluble because they're so tiny so you're able to mix this into a drink that's how you're supposed to use it and you can drink the cannabinoids and you can feel the effects much faster than with something like an edible or another type of oral consumption product i thought that was interesting about these products because i kind of just thought okay it's i didn't really know what nano meant i thought that was pretty cool so it's basically really tiny tiny molecules of cannabinoids and that's why they're able to be water-soluble and that's also why the nanotechnology makes them faster and more readily bioavailable now let's talk about the product a little bit more what does it taste like how do we use it and all of that good stuff so you want to use this in a drink i prefer sparkling water but basically you're just going to want to mix this into a drink it comes in a bottle like this so you've got your box then you've got your bottle the bottle is 150 milligrams of thc in the entire bottle and that is 30 milliliters of product in total i would say this is going to be a good product for somebody who likes to micro dose or use smaller amounts of cannabis in their daily life you probably don't want to add too much of this to your drink or you are going to start to taste more of this flavor than you might want to and what this flavor tastes like it depends on whether you get the unflavored or the flavored with a taste in it but all of them even the unflavored one are kind of sweet so when you put them into your drink they have a little bit of a sweetness kind of like the sweetness of like a diet coke it's more of like a sucralose so like a artificial sweetener type of taste all of them have that flavor all of them are even the unflavored is on the sweet side so just keep that in mind when you're mixing this the way that i usually like to use it is i will pour about an eight ounce cup of beverage so basically just a cup of my beverage and i usually use sparkling water so i'll usually add like half the can into a cup all right so we've got our cup of beverage and then i just take two droppers full or i actually do more like 2.75 droppers full so not all the way up to one milliliter but just up to that 0.75 mark and i just do two of those into my drink so that equals out to a little less than 10 milligrams of thc i just mix it together now let's try it yeah definitely tasting that sweetness from the drops i'm also tasting some of the flavor of the sparkling water and also the flavor of the lime that i just put in there and i'll just sip it until it's gone just like i would with like any other kind of drink i just sip this guy whenever i feel like it and that can be during the day it can be at night time and i do feel like the effects are pretty strong and pretty fast like i feel like once i finish drinking the drink i can already feel the effects that's how fast it kicks in for me and what i usually look for with my effects is just am i feeling an overall sense of calm am i feeling good and am i feeling overall positive and feeling good i usually just try to use as much cannabis as i need in that moment and then stop when i'm feeling like i got my my amount that i need like there's no need to add more on top of that but this is a great product i think for people who are going to use more like a 10 milligram dose in each drink um and you can always you know drink a couple of drinks back to back if you need to but i just wouldn't recommend putting a lot of the liquid in a drink and drinking it because it's just going to taste really sweet and not very good so i mean you could probably you can but just i would just advise against using like don't use like the whole bottle at once or something like i just don't think that's a good idea that's just my take though i don't know um so anyway have you tried these products what have you what do you think of them if you've tried them let me know in the comments i'm really curious to know i've been using these now for a few weeks and i just love them i love the effects i love how easy it is to use them i like the taste i don't think it's too bad um yeah i'm overall a big fan of this product so i could definitely see myself buying it again in the future i think i prefer these drops in a liquid form as opposed to like there's a powder out there from another dispensary that i tried and it was okay but it didn't dissolve as well as this does this dissolves really well in your drink and you just you don't feel like you're not getting it mixed in it's definitely getting mixed in pretty well when you use this product with a drink so anyway thanks for watching and i'll catch you in the next video and i hope you liked this and i'll see you next time also i am going to be getting back to weekly videos um at least i'd like to do more than a weekly like i'd like to do more than one per week so we will see how that goes i don't want to get ahead of myself but keep on coming back because i'm going to be trying to make new videos every week all right i'll see you next time bye hey there just a quick editor's note i wanted to give a big shout out and a thank you to vectrix1 who did a great job on these portraits of me he makes awesome vector portraits if you are looking for something like that then i recommend that you hit up vectrex1 because he did a great job on my artwork so thank you for that vectrix1 and i hope you guys enjoy it so yeah i'll see you next time thanks for watching [Music] bye [Music] you", "F7pphiwz_LE": "[Music] hi there buds let's talk about my outfit really fast i bought this cardigan when i was like incredibly stoned asos was having like a semi-annual type sale and a lot of [ __ ] was parents and i saw this and there was like a video of a model wearing it was a nice tall guy and he kept swaying his arms and it looked so neat and i was like oh that's fashion like i need that and then i bought it and it came in and i was like what the hell was i thinking like how much did i smoke before i decided this was something that i needed in my [ __ ] life because now i'm highly embarrassed i've had this sitting in my closet for at least a year it's even got fringe like all the way around i've had this just like sitting there and i'm like what the hell like when am i ever gonna wear this and so i was like you know what i'm just gonna have to i'm just gonna have to make myself wear it so today i was like oh i want something new to wear something spicy so this is what came out you guys i'm not gonna lie though as ugly as it is i do have an amazing time waving my arms around in it and watching all the things just move like it has such great movement like this would be something great to go dancing or something i don't know i kind of i kind of enjoy it but anyways i hope you guys are all having a great day today i have something new that i've never tried before i saw this at the dispensary it's weed bubble gum i'm like you guys know i'm a sucker for anything new at the dispensary that's an edible i'm like i've never tried weed gum before and that sounds amazing this is bubble gum flavored by a company called joy gum it has 10 milligrams of thc per serving and there's 10 pieces so 100 milligrams of thc and i thought we would try it out i mean hopefully it tastes good hopefully the effects are really long-lasting i love the idea of using a gum as an edible because you can just sit there and chew on it like all day long maybe have like a gradual release of thc all day that's what i'm hoping for i've not smoked today so i can get a full feel of how this gum is going to affect me so i'm ready to dive in let's get into this [Music] open it up pretty easy just to peel off packaging [Music] it smells like straight up bubbles like [Music] there's no other wheaties at all you cannot tell that this is infused at all it just smells like bubbles it actually smells like really good bubble gum like almost like um i'm trying to think of the name of it the one that comes in the tape fruit by the foot oh it was at this moment that he knew he [ __ ] up oh my god my grandpa used to buy this for me when i was little and i used to just have pockets full of candy and the bubble tape bubba take i don't remember what it was called the tape like gum somebody out there knows exactly what the [ __ ] i'm talking about and i probably will be able to just google a picture and put it right here what i'm talking about but that's what this smells like anyways [Music] oh my god it has their logo on the go hope that focuses it says joy gum right there that's cute and on the back of that it has a little thc emblem just to show you that it's weedy all right i'm excited about this like they're super cute they smell good so we'll see we're gonna just do one first just for a little taste test and then i'm gonna chew this entire package all in one sitting because you guys know i like to i like to go boss to the walls cheers oh my god [Music] the taste is so familiar it reminds me of chicklets that gum in the 90s that was like it came in the yellow package and they were super duper tiny that's what this tastes like if i try really really really hard i can kind of take some weaniness but like you really have to focus on it overall first impressions the gum tastes incredibly good i'm gonna go ahead and put another piece in and another pretty soon if this is actually effective this will be a really cool way of getting some and with it being 10 milligrams it's like not too much for each piece you could easily just have like a piece of gum before you go to work and then be in like a little bit of a better mood than you normally would be without being like super stoned or repaired i like that but i like that they give you 10 pieces in a pack so that if you are like me and you want to chew like 100 milligrams of thc you can i wonder if it'll blow bubbles like i wonder if it's like a bubble gum let's see i don't ever think this is bubblegum but i'm gonna try again [Music] the texture of this gum is like one of those gums that kind of melts in your mouth it becomes really really really soft because all gums get soft obviously but you know how some gums are like they damn near feel like they're gonna disappear in your mouth that's how this one feels it's very very thin i don't mind that at all all right i mean i'm at 30 milligrams i mean it's only been like what like i've probably been recording like five minutes but i'm not afraid of 100 milligrams at all like i feel like that's not going to be bad for me so [Music] that's the rest of the gum [Music] i'm so sorry if this smacking loses about my god i feel like i'm spitting i'm really surprised about extreme this much come because it's like a lot i'm not gonna lie though it's pleasure like it tastes so [ __ ] good i'll be honest with you guys i don't feel anything yet like nothing yet nothing oh my god i'm gonna knock that over don't feel nothing yet but normally it takes edibles about 20 minutes for me to really build something oh my god like talking with those i'm going to do my heart maybe i fit in my cheek while i talk normally it takes about 20 minutes for like an edible to affect me so i guess i'm gonna sit here and shoot my gum circle the web a little bit probably get on my phone and um i'll give you guys a status update on how i feel after chewing 100 milligrams of thc [Music] [Music] all right it's been about 10 minutes and i already feel it like i definitely feel a little something my body feels relaxed i'm starting to feel relaxed like my mood is starting to feel relaxed i feel like this is gonna be a good one you guys like i'm really excited because i i don't feel like i normally feel effects like this quickly or this strongly i would say that i feel the same level as i did after drinking that whole 10 milligram soda already right now so [Music] i'll be back in like another probably 20 minutes 30 minutes and we'll see how it is [Music] i also noticed on the package that's zero calories so there's that and it's made in aurora colorado so it's like a locally made thing which is me [Music] edibles i feel like sometimes make me out of breath or maybe it's just all this to me regardless i'm out of breath then i'll be back [Music] i'm gonna be honest you guys i feel sick like i feel queasy i feel dizzy this isn't good like it doesn't feel good like i feel dizzy like i don't feel good at all and i feel like i'm sweating a little bit but i don't want to take off my cute little tassels because these are so much fun but like i don't i don't know i i don't know i don't know [Music] i don't know i don't like it like it's just like i don't know like i seriously feel like the room is spinning and i don't like that and i feel hot like i almost feel like i'm gonna get sick like i'm gonna get like like i'm gonna throw up or something but i know i'm not going to throw up like i didn't eat anything and like i'm in my mouth like i'm not gonna throw up i'm not gonna lie [Music] i'm just gonna tell myself this too shall pass and do few breathing exercises [Music] we're just going to power through this and see how it is in another 20 minutes or so [Music] also you guys i'm feeling a lot better like 100 better i don't feel dizzy at all i will say i do kind of feel like i don't know it's not shortness of breath it's almost like do you guys know when you get super stoned and you feel like something's almost sitting on your chest that's how i feel right [Music] now [Music] so it's like it's not like the best feeling in the world but like overall i'm gonna say like it's not bad so far like not horrible we had a little moment we breathed through that now we're in the little chest weirdness feeling but i'm starting to feel the like mental effects like i'm starting to feel strong a little bit which is kind of nice because i feel like edibles like they kind of go weird for me like some of them will affect me and only my body like i'll feel tingly all over like whatever and then some will affect me mentally and when they affect me mentally they affect me mentally like like really slowly so i'm starting to feel those effects a little bit like i feel a little spacey very relaxed still don't focus on my breathing just because it's so weird how when you get stoned you really focus on your breathing and then you're like i don't know particularly when you get that feeling and i know other stoners out there comment below if you've ever had that feeling because i know i know other people and i have it now i do feel tingly in my arms too my arms feel really deeply all right i'll be back probably in another 20 minutes or so again for another update i don't even know how long i'm going to update this because i think i'm going to shoot this stuff all [ __ ] day long because i want to say it was 15 there's no price on here but i thought i think it was fifteen dollars and if that's okay fifteen dollars for a full day all day so i hope that it lasts the full day and i'll see you guys around for whenever the next update is i'll be sure to let you guys know how long it's been i thought right now i would say probably i'll be back in another like 40 minutes or so but i don't know once you start to get to this level of your stone that's not the word that i was trying to go for once you get to this level of your high i feel like things get unpredictable like you tend to do things and you sometimes don't and it's just you know what i mean so i'll be back when i'm back and i'll let you know how long it's been [Music] it looks so much further down [Music] i work so much better as bubble gum after you really chew it for like a good hour or so because then it gets even softer and it works so much better bubbles anyways now we'll be back in like 20 minutes [Music] i feel like i should just fly off with these i'm like i looked at the mess i was like getting off here and i was like i want my transition would just be like and then when i come back i can just fly [Music] back what would you call this look you guys like what the hell would you call this for some reason it gives me like very mariachi vibes but it's like i don't know why i think it's because it kind of reminds me of a pinata i feel like i look like a pinata like i seriously feel like i could be on dancing with the stars with this outfit like what was i thinking i'm back it is now about 4 p.m i've been chewing on this gum all day long i haven't even taken it out for a break like i've some water with it but that's about it i will say the flavor of the gum it's like the flavor of a gum that's lost its flavor if that makes sense like it has that like mmm there used to be flavor here but there's not anymore and it tastes kind of like blend that's how it tastes right now the gum definitely shrinks over time i don't know if i'm just like accidentally swallowing it or something but like it definitely felt like a huge wada gum in my mouth before now feels like just like a slightly oversized piece of gum [Music] it does blow bubbles better now now to the effects i will say that i think that it's still effective like i still feel slightly stoned right now [Music] i don't feel like this was a frame frame i do feel like it was at first like within the first like hour it was really really really strong after like the first hour and a half like two hours kind of like a little bit so like i still feel like if i like chew on it a lot and actually like focus on chewing it i do feel like a little bit like i do get a little bit of like a revamp of the high like i do think that this is to in order to get the effects you do have to like sit there and chew and chew and chew and chew and chew because if you just let sit in your mouth i don't feel like it does as much for some reason would i buy this again yes would i use it all in one setting no because i felt like that wasn't necessary i feel like i probably would have gotten a lot better of an experience off of this with using half of it and i probably would have felt probably the same i would i mean like that's just my guess i feel like this was a little overkill for what it is particularly because like the effects don't last long like or like longer i mean they do a little bit because it's a gum and you have to chew it to get the thc to come out it is like an extended release in that aspect but that thc actually goes pretty fast i feel like like i feel like you get 70 of the effects of it probably within the first two hours and then after that you're just getting like a little twin to look the last thirty percent i'm definitely gonna chew it through bedtime but i don't expect any different results if i do have any different results i'll definitely check in and let you guys know but overall i would say i recommend it um for 15 you can split this up in probably like three or four different um sessions and that would make it like a little bit more affordable and not so expensive because for a one-time treat 15 is a lot but i'll definitely try this again i wonder if they have different flavors i would be interested in a mint um the bubble gum like it just loses its flavor and then it just kind of is like and i feel like with minty gums when they lose their flavor it's not as bad if you know what i mean um anyways thank you guys so much for watching this video if you like it give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below let me know if you've ever tried joy gum if you've seen this in your dispensary if you're gonna try it now let me know because am i the only person who just gets enticed by all the little things in the dispensary i literally feel like a kid in a cannabis candy store every time i go in there and there's like something new and i'm like anyways thank you guys so much for watching and i'll see you guys around for whatever shiny activity or video i come up with for next time and hopefully i'll be in a better outfit than this or if this is your definition of good then hopefully i keep this bar hi thank you so much for watching bye guys", "ATvB4nB4ALs": "ah hi everybody sydney here welcome back to my channel today today i'm going to be going over the math on how to actually figure out how much thc how much thc or cbd is in your oil how potent it is um a lot of questions i know in the last video i posted honest let me be real with you guys really quickly i posted that video thinking maybe if i got lucky like 15 people would see it so it wasn't my best work just gonna put out there it was my best work a lot of you guys have not seen the video i got a lot of comments on it a lot of questions all the concerns mostly great comments so thank you guys for keeping it positive i appreciate that let me preface this by saying i'm not an expert i don't know all the answers i'm just a girl making cannabis oil in our kitchen just like a lot of you guys i do know a little bit of math on how to figure that out i know in the last video i said i was going to give you the math and i kind of tried to in the comments but you know it's easier to just see it done so that's what we're going to do today we're going to visually walk through this when i have my levo machine now levo corrected me that's how you pronounce it levo my level machine is sitting here i made a new batch of oil so we're going to be doing the math on this particular batch what i have in here essentially is a cup of coconut oil i infused five grams of cannabis into this oil it's very concentrated very dark in color i don't know the exact percentage of the flour i was using so i'm gonna just ballpark it in like the 15 range just because that's pretty average for cannabis so let's say it's 15 it's always good to also overshoot it a little bit especially if you're dealing with thc just so you don't really overdo that and then obviously you can trial and error the amount of milligrams on your own personal body to see where you're at before we continue to go make sure you subscribe to my channel thank you for liking this video and watching well thank you for liking it if you like it please like it thanks for watching and keep watching if you want to know how to decode and figure out how much thc or cbd you're actually consuming when you make your own oil let's freaking go y'all okay everybody so what i have here is my piece of paper a pen and then my phone over here is my calculator and let's just freaking go into this thing oh and hello let's just like take a moment and just look at the beauty look at her oh look at her so to start things out i'm gonna write down the amount of oil that i used so up here i'm gonna write one cup um of oil the amount of cannabis that i use which was five grams grams of cannabis canna and those are the two numbers i'm going to start with if you'd like to convert your grams to milligrams one gram equals a thousand milligrams you can write that on the side one gram equals one thousand milligrams that's just for further conversion um and if you want to find out like per tablespoon you can also convert that i don't know off the top of my head so i'm just going to keep going so from here i have my one cup of oil and my five grams of cannabis oh and i know that this is 15 let's say it's thc for the fun of it 15 thc if you're using a hemp flour you do the 15 or 20 or whatever percent of that in cbd is those are the numbers you need to start with those three numbers right there you have three numbers your amount of oil you're infusing the amount of cannabis that you're using in the percent of whether it's thc or cbd they're using into that oil to do that i multiply my five grams of cannabis times my .15 so because if you convert you move the percentage over two decimals and that converts it to the percent or to the decimal rather and that would equal because i can't do math five times point one five equals point seven five so zero point 0.75 grams of this whole 5 grams is actually my thc that's present in my cannabis so from here in my whole cup one cup of oil i'm now once i'm done infusing going to have 0.75 grams of thc so .75 grams of thc into my oil i want to convert this grams into milligrams so in order to do that i just cross multiply so i have my one gram at top per 1000 milligrams i cross multiply you get rid of the grams and so per one cup of oil i actually have and then i multiply these 0.75 times 1 000 i have 750 milligrams of thc so in this entire little guy right here because it's a full cup there is 750 milligrams of thc in here okay so if i want to know let's see i'm using this for baking per tablespoon let's say now i would just convert this into tablespoons so let me look up really quickly what how many tablespoons are a cup cup two tablespoon so there's one cup so let's write it up here in our conversions one cup equals 16 tablespoons so that's another conversion you should know one cup of oil equals 16 tablespoons i can again cross multiply cups to cups and then there's 750 milligrams of thc per i mean this was a long way around just like honestly just switching out the numbers but just so you guys are more visual with it 750 per 16 tablespoons and then i want to find out how much per one tablespoon one tablespoon at the top and we don't know this answer we don't know this answer that's what we're trying to figure out and then you have 750 milligrams per 16 tablespoons pretty much you want to make sure these are always on opposite opposite sides of the line so that when you cross multiply you can actually just um cross it out and that what's that's how you get your numbers i don't know i took math a long time ago this is just what makes the most sense to me hopefully i'm explaining it in a way that makes sense to y'all uh unfortunately i don't know if i am 750 oop 750 why can't i do this pretty much all you need to do is take 750 and divide it by 16 and that'll give you how much thc per one tablespoon so we're trying to figure out this number right here so 750 oh my god divided by 16. so there's actually 46 milligrams of thc in a tablespoon you can also further convert this and you know figure out if you're using a cup in like let's say your entire cup in a recipe and it makes eight slices then you can really go in deep and figure out how much cbd thc whatever is in your slice but other than that that's really the math um screenshot this i hope it makes sense to you guys i mean i made a video about it so again it's just a lot of cross multiplying a little bit of conversions with this up here and then really it's just this percent of whatever you're find trying to find th c cbd whatever it may be and making sure you just take that into account in your total amount of cannabis cool y'all and that's it i hope that that was really helpful if it wasn't if i confused you more i sincerely apologize i am not a mathematician i took math a long time ago i'm just trying to use what i learned in essentially middle school and applying it here but hopefully that explains things a

girlfriend will you do [Music]", "U_x7bGEwoQA": "welcome to placing gear reviews today we're reviewing the topical aid spray from apothecary [Music] [Applause] the spray we were reviewing is the extra strength topical pain spray from apotheca what you're getting is a topical mist with infused pain relieving plant extracts such as arnica peppermint juniper and of course cannabis it comes in a two fluid ounce or sixty milliliter container with 50 milligrams of THC and five milligrams of CBD and cannabis oils this topical spray is not intended to ingest in any form it's only intended to be used externally on the skin the applicator cap has a somewhat involved process to accessing the spray nozzle you do this by pressing the safety lock button then shifting the teeth on the top of the spray button to rotate it to the proper point of operation the applicator cap is pressed onto the container neck for a secured non removable cap Apothic Anas cannabis infused skincare has essential organic oils and plant extracts which focus on relieving pain through the skin this cooling topical spray is packed with powerful plant extracts such as arnica peppermint spearmint juniper and cannabis these flower extracts provide fast-acting your leave from pain and irritation usage is easy first spot test with a half a pump application if no irritation or allergic reactions occur then continue on spray one to three pumps on sore areas swollen joints and problem skin you can let it air dry or rub it in however be aware of the degradation from rub off and be advised that if you touch the oils with your hands keep your hands and fingers away from your eyes because irritation will occur upon application you will immediately experience a smooth and deeply cooling feeling as your skin is absorbing this topical treat allow 5 to 15 minutes for pain relief effects to occur while the cooling heat continues apply it respectfully as needed be advised to stay away from open cuts or wounds and discontinue use if irritation or discomfort is present the pros of the Apothic Ana extra-strength pain relief spray are is that it's fast-acting it feels great the child lock system is secure to keep it away from children and it's also a clean and secure appearance that keeps a peace of mind when you're applying it in public areas and you also get a lot of sprays out of one container the cons are is that the safety lock system although effective might be a little hard for some people with hurting fingers to use and also the labeling was not consistent on the two bottles that we had one of our bottles was labeled at having 50 milligrams of THC and 5 milligrams of CBDs while the other otherwise identical bottle was labeled as 50 milligrams of CBD and 50 milligrams of THC overall I give a path econo extra-strength pain spray 5 out of 5 blazin pot leaves in my opinion Apothic anna extra-strength pain spray is a great organic all-in-one body pain spray relief that relieves pain from your extremities down to your lower back if you'd like to learn more or to purchase one please ask for Apothic anna at your local medical marijuana dispensary I'm sure they can provide it for you or at least offer a comparable cannabis infused pain spray hope you enjoyed this episode of blazing gear reviews if you did please like comment and share this video with your friends also subscribe to roughhouse studios for more cannabis culture videos made just for you this is Matt at roughhouse studios thank you for watching", "ODVX4f3eEDo": "[Music] hi there and welcome to the cannabis kitchen today I thought we would make some CBD infused muscle rub so muscle rub is a tough thing because a lot of people have their favorites but a lot of times they don't really know what's in it and so it's nice to have something a little bit more natural and it's also nice to be able to add the benefits of CBD so today we're actually going to be using two different types of CBD it is absolutely not necessary you can use either CB oil or you can use CV flour today we're going to use a little mixture of both just to add a little bit more liquid to the mix so what we're going to start with is our dry ingredients so what I've done is I've got a little bit of cheesecloth here and we're gonna put all our dry ingredients into it and form almost like a little tea bag so that we can drop it into the mixture and it will be a little bit less cleanup later on so what I've done to start actually is I've made a double boiler so I have that turned on and running right now the heat is just on low I just want the water should be hot I don't want it to boil underneath there and boil away on us so now that that is ready to go once we add all our ingredients that will start to melt together and we'll leave it sit for a little while so I have in this container this little glass I have 10 grams of CBD flour and a little bit of shake as well in there so we're just gonna add that onto our little pile here there we go the next thing we're gonna add is some cloves so cloves actually have a slight numbing feeling so that will definitely be a good add to our mixture here so I have I want to say 15 yes 15 clove pieces in here you can use clove essential oil as well I just didn't happen to have any in my kitchen so we're just gonna pop that on the pile the next thing we're gonna add is some cinnamon so cinnamon as you may or may not know has lots of anti-inflammatory properties I'm just using sugar from my kitchen or sorry cinnamon out of the kitchen but you can use cinnamon sticks or you can use cinnamon essential oil this is a little bit powdery but because it's going to be mixed in with everything else I don't think it's going to go through the cheesecloth so I've used about a quarter of a teaspoon of cinnamon powder and the last dry ingredient we're gonna add is some red crushed red peppers so crushed red peppers are gonna add a little bit of heat to this mixture so it's going to be kind of a cold hot kind of a feeling once you put it on your skin we're not adding a lot I happen to have an allergy to peppers so I can get away with using a little bit but not very much plus with all these ingredients that we're going to be adding a lot of them anyway they do have some irritants if you happen to rub your eyes or touch other parts of your body things like you like to put it in your mouth or on your lip so a little bit goes a long way so again I'm using about quarter of teaspoon just under a quarter of a teaspoon of crushed red peppers perfect so now all we're gonna do is gather this up as best we can and we're gonna make a little tea bag I guess you'd call it squish this up just like that give it a good squeeze we want it nice and tight there so now what I've done is I've just cut a little piece of kitchen string this is what you'd normally used to like tie a turkey at Christmas or Thanksgiving so we're just going to wrap this around this is just organic cotton so it won't add anything that we don't want into our mixture and leave a little bit at the end so we can tie it just like that perfect there you go so this is all of our dry ingredients ready to go and now we can start to add our wet ingredients the first thing we're going to add is I haven't here a quarter of a cup of melted shea butter I only melted it to get my measurement right but inside you can put it in as a big clump if you want to not a big deal either way so we're going to add that right into the bowl on top here there we go perfect ya know there are also obviously some benefits to shea butter shea butter is full of fatty acids which is really really good for your skin it has a very kind of high concentration so it's actually excellent for your skin but also it has some alien flare anti-inflammatory properties so of course it's the perfect addition for what we're making today the next thing we have is a quarter of a cup of sweet almond oil so sweet almond oil also very good for your skin it contains lots of vitamin E so it's gonna keep your skin nice and soft so we can't leave that out so pour that in just like that see if this will fit in here there's so much air as we can go good so now I'm just gonna add this little tea bag in as well just because we've got some liquid here so we're gonna put that in and we're just gonna kind of get it nice and saturated if we can and then we can get that started perfect all right so the next additions are small ones we've got lots of little containers here now I will put links on the website for all of these things so what we're using is some camphor and some peppermint essential oil we have our CBD oil as well I'm using the aurora and so the other thing we're adding is some eucalyptus oil I didn't happen to have any of my usual essential oil left in the eucalyptus so I just picked this up at the drugstore it's gonna suit the purposes the eucalyptus oil is and 80 and flama thick so like you can smell it in there it's gonna do just fine sometimes you have to just go with whatever you can so we're going to put all these in here there's only little bits of these as well this isn't a super big recipe so we're adding 45 drops of camphor we're adding 20 drops of eucalyptus and 30 drops of peppermint essential oil there now we're gonna add our CBD oil the CBD oil I'm adding is a hundred milliliters so about four full droppers out of your bottle if you have a 30ml bottle go perfect now the last thing we're gonna add is some beeswax pellets beeswax pellets are going to help sort of hold the whole mixture together but we're not using enough to make it back into a solid as these actual beeswax pellets we're using a lot of liquid in this recipe so when we're finished it should actually have quite a nice easy rubbing consistency so we're just gonna drop those in as well and we'll get up that all melting along so this is going to be done the same way as any other infusion with decarboxylated the flour that we're using which we always do and now this is just gonna sit and melt all together for about four hours and then we'll come back and get it put into some little containers and it'll be ready to go all right so we will check back in with you in four hours okay we are back it has been four hours and we've got our mixture all ready to go so we're just gonna pop this out of the water it's still a little bit hot so we need to be very careful so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna take this tea bag we're going to squeeze it out and get as much out as we can so I picked up this cool little contraption at winners one day and I think it's gonna be perfect for the job because I don't have very strong hands so this will help me maximize it so we're just going to pop that in there I'm gonna give it a squeeze there's so much stuck in there get as much as we can there we go I think that's pretty good there we go so here's our mixture let's put that down we've got our mixture here there's not a lot here like I said but we're going to put this into some containers and then it's gonna be ready to go so what I've done previously is I sprayed these containers out with some rubbing alcohol just to make sure that they're nice and clean inside and so now all we need to do is just pour this mixture let me just get a little scraper there we go now it does set fairly quickly so it shouldn't be too bad I'm not sure we're gonna need to but put all the extras in there and it's already starting to harden in the bowl so you got to work a little bit quick and if it does cool down and start to solidify again you can just pop it into your hot water and that should soften it back up okay so we are back and our muscle rub is all hardened it actually has not too too strong to smell it's quite nice actually and when you go to use it it comes off fairly easily so it's nice and easy to rub on your skin just like that wherever you hurt and it rubs in quite nicely and easily so there you go you got some homemade CBD infused muscle rub which is awesome if you keep it in the fridge it'll probably last you about a year if you don't use it up first and also if you buy some nice little containers they make nice little gifts for people as well so let's fit on nice there you go you can get some little stickers to write a little label on them and I can already feel it starting to work so that is really nice and I think you'll enjoy it too so thank you very much for joining me in this episode of the cannabis kitchen I hope that you enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed making it it's a nice easy recipe I will put the links in on the website if you go into the cannabis infused recipe section at www.canadianoutback.com look into doing that for you as well we actually had this one in the works to make and somebody did request it so that worked out good so whoever was looking for it I hope you enjoyed this particular recipe you can make changes as you wish you can add more camphor which is really good to reduce inflammation you can add more CBD or less just make sure that you're not messing around too much just because you don't want to mix up and get a really runny batch or a really really hard batch that you can't rub on so play around with it enjoy it if you have anything that you would want to add to your balm then by all means let me know in the comments I would love to know how you guys make yours and again please join us on our website Canadian wheat farm calm we've got lots of really great people there it's a really great community

learned about sex i figured i'd celebrate my almost two year anniversary for writing one of the my most viral articles i ever wrote on medium it was called i've had the best orgasm with weed lube and have data to prove it i wrote it on a whim but it got picked up on reddit and like the wellness section of medium at some point and it blew up and at the time that was the first time i ever shared my orgasm data so i was like a little semi horrified that one day not only would my mom read that i was using a weed loop but also she could see my orgasm data but now at this point who cares i think i have to emphasize that i live in california i acquired cannabis lube from legal dispensaries very legally and this this is really only a suggestion for people that live in legal states or countries so this is kind of what i would call like a typical normal session with no other factors really involved it's really really i'm like pretty very steady in my pelvic floor movements and then the orgasm is the ocean wave pattern with the rhythmic up and down and then here's one using the weed lube so in comparison you can see there's a lot more movements lots of different sensations that happen and your pelvic floor is like squeezing and relaxing very intensely so for these particular two data sets in comparison some things i've learned is that with the wee lou my orgasm was nine times longer than normal um the orgasm was way more intense and then the whole session itself was about three times longer than normal so some faqs and some most common questions that i've gotten about uh we lube so technically thc infused lubricant is a pre-lube so you want to use it like 15 to 20 minutes before you do anything um so you apply it all over like the vulva and vagina so internally and externally like 15 to 20 minutes to let it kind of soak in personally for me and most people report that you don't get a psychoactive high because it doesn't really have enough ways to enter the bloodstream through the vagina but if you have like drug tests or anything important like that um if you accidentally ingest some of it or it enters anally you will absolutely get a psychoactive high and it does enter your bloodstream so highly do not recommend so the most common question i get is does it work on penises and from what i understand the answer is no since the it doesn't absorb through the skin the same way it does through the vagina um but you know if you have a special friend that has a vagina why wouldn't you want to make that person feel amazing anyways that's something that's personally worked for me that i've seen really huge drastic changes in my linus data everybody's body is completely different so what works for me might not work for you and i'm not here to try to tell you how to live your life but i don't know if we're all stuck in shelter in place it could be something fun to try and you can pick up some other stuff from the dispensary mom i am so sorry i hope you are not

you fail a drug test find out on this episode of weed easy by the growth of drug tests that look for cannabis analyzed a urine sample and screen it for marijuana metabolites since CBD derives from the cannabis plant you might rightly wonder if I use CBD can it cause me to fail a drug test for cannabis on its own CBD actually cannot produce a positive result on a drug test for cannabis that's because drug tests that screen for cannabis are looking for just one cannabinoid and that's THC a or tetrahydrocannabinol ik acid or the inactive form of THC click the letter I in the top-right corner of your screen to watch our episode on decarboxylation to learn how to HCA becomes THC and why that process is so important so if you only use CBD are you in the clear well it depends if you're using a high CBD strain of cannabis you'd likely think it's safe but this can sometimes cause you to fail a drug test many of these strains still contain high amounts of THC which will still set off alarm bells on a urine screen however if you're using hemp based CBD oils or pills these generally contain just trace amounts of THC at about 0.3% these products should not cause you to fail a drug test as long as you do not consume extremely high doses a false positive on a drug test can occur with doses of a thousand milligrams a day or more with CBD products though most people consume about 120 to 160 milligrams per day keep in mind that many CBD products are unregulated and therefore may contain cannabinoids that could get you into hot water for that reason we suggest sticking to CBD products that are lab tested and keeping your dosage at a recommended level while using CBD on its own cause a failed drug test no it won't but it's important to be aware of the factors that potentially could

get it crackin I never did Luke what kind of [ __ ] Wow she's going for it we're gonna put it into the pie crust any something I'm trying to cook over here oh look at these the times element is kind of what's our challenge now the mad dash to kind of finish everything [Music] tge level is six milligrams per dumpling while the flavors of this is insane that's awesome second is the highest I've been all month time's up can I get enjoy or something [Music]", "tyBoGZkdmZs": "what's going on stoners cubans here and on today's video we are taking a look at a metered dose inhaler with 400 milligrams of thc in it now i've been seeing the inhalers for a little while since i've moved here but i haven't tried them yet i think only one store has them and i finally picked one up and this is the higher thc one it has about 415 milligrams of thc and a little over three and a half milligrams of cbd i think they also had a one to one or it was like 200 and 200 but i went ahead and got the higher thc one because i wanted to see if it could get me high and i think a lot of people were confused on how many pups but it says right on here delivers approximately two milligrams of active product per activation and if it's 400 milligrams that's about 200 activations so pretty interesting this thing has close to a half a gram of thc in it and the other ingredients are that you would find in an inhaler it's got tetrafluorethane ethanol sorbet pan the triolet cannabis derived terpenes and polysorbate 80. i know all those words but i looked them up and that's just what they put in regular inhalers so pretty interesting note you will not see any exhaled vapor no clouds guys this is this is discreet though could you imagine you're [ __ ] anywhere and you're just like well i'm just going to in my inhaler [ __ ] nobody's going to be like there might be weed in there [ __ ] nobody even me and i've seen these things i have one in my head i will never think maybe unless i see the [ __ ] dispensary logo or something i'm not gonna think anyway let's hit it back clouds oh i think that was 10 seconds it's kind of weird it's just you hit an inhaler you know it says that's cannabis derived terpenes in here but i don't i don't know if i'm tasting them two milligrams and i have to hold my breath for 10 seconds i don't know how it works but we're gonna see if we can do a bunch of hits on this and get high i'm just gonna get right to it but first if you haven't already check out my other socials your boy posts a lot of content a lot of places we do a live sessions on twitch every night i post pictures all my hauls on instagram and stuff just check them out i'll figure it out alright let's get high i'm gonna get high from holding my breath but let's keep trying i feel like i can do like a few puffs on one inhale without really [ __ ] up i don't think i can just just keep pushing in my mouth is that gonna work it's surprisingly uh kinda harsh it's not terrible and i i would say the first couple of hits out of this maybe the first ten or so or harsher than this i wonder if it has something to do with how well it's shaking up or whatever i'm getting high but is it from holding my breath [Music] okay oh oh my mic is way up there i'm moving my mic down uh that's gonna be fun editing the audio i don't i really don't we're just gonna keep hitting it it's not like i'm not i'm not super harsh after a hit i could just keep going i feel like because it's not actually it's got like a little bit of a harshest it's not that bad the second ingredient is ethanol i wonder if that's why [Music] i'm gonna breathe next to it away from it breathe out away from it so this thing is 400 milligrams for the whole thing i had somebody ask me is it 400 milligrams per hit and i mean that's like a genuine question but could you imagine if you push this [ __ ] and it squirts out a half a gram of thc into your lungs could you just imagine if it really was 400 milligrams of phd per kit that's close to a half a gram could you imagine how thick let's keep it going inside of me hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] now holding for about 10 seconds is is like the whole part of it all right let's keep going [Music] uh i don't quite know how many milligrams we're at now but i'm feeling uh i i think i'm feeling kind of high but i've just been holding my breath for like 10 seconds every 20 30 seconds i think it's that but let's keep going and then i'll chill for a second and then we're gonna we'll get an assessment if i'm high but let's keep going because we're not quite there yet all right this is gonna be the super one i think i'm normally doing three we're gonna see if we can get five on this one even though i don't know if that's the best way to do it foreign oh okay i actually saw a little bit of vapor there that was a big one i'm gonna i'm gonna see if i could do that again it just like i need to click it faster and keep a nice steady inhale i think that's the trick but i feel like i feel like i just took a long rip after that one like not not the the same level of harshness but i feel like i just got a lot of thc wretch i think we're getting there i think the highness is working okay yeah let's let's keep it going making my eyes water all right we gotta wrap this up soon holy [ __ ] all right so i've been chilling for a little bit just so i could uh get an idea yeah this gets me high is it my preferred method of smoking no i would think based off the dosage and how and how it really delivers i would just need to sit there and hit it a hundred times for me to get there but this is definitely great for somebody with a low tolerance somebody that doesn't like smoking maybe can't smoke this might be a much easier option for you it probably feels the same as a regular inhaler if you've ever used one i think it was only like 50 bucks for 400 milligrams which is about what you'd pay for a cartridge with the same amount of thc in it so not a terrible price it's just interesting to see the technology what you could possibly do having this metered dose inhaler somebody's trying to take exactly six milligrams one two three puffs and this is about two each easy way to do it i'm probably not going to be buying a lot of these in the future but it is something that's kind of cool to have and uh very discreet if i really do need to get some thc in and i'm somewhere where it might not be appropriate to do it this might be the way so pretty cool thing overall but makes me excited to see what else we can come up with dangle stoners

Canada ruling expanding the definition of medical marijuana it now means pop brownies cannabis oil all legal for people with a prescription it was welcome news for some parents including Alex for Patsy whose daughter Gwen has epilepsy he's been giving her cannabis oil three times a day to help control her seizures she joins us in studio today thank you for coming in to talk about this so essentially you've been doing this but it's been illegal yeah we've been we've been doing it for eight months legally obtaining the dried cannabis with a prescription note from doctor etc etc it's been illegal to convert it to oil she doesn't smoke so it's the only choice and tell me about your daughter's life before you gave her a medicinal marijuana and after so if I rewind nine months to last October she couldn't really do much she could barely sit on her own she was still having seizures she had been on eight different medications anti epileptic drugs none of them controlled the seizures she was having massive subclinical activity so it's basically seizing constantly in the brain so subclinical activity meaning seizures are going on you may not see it you don't see it at all no but they're happening so it's basically turmoil and chaos all the time and throughout this your daughter's ability to grow on all levels you know emotionally physically is stunted yes her development basically halted we're continuing the therapy but she wasn't acquiring skills almost at all you were your wit's end we certainly were and then you decided to try this medical marijuana and at first what did the doctor say you know when you said you wanted to do this well I actually thought about it about eight months before that or a year before that and maybe 14 months and doctors initially were kind of like no there's not enough research I presented them with a lot of logical arguments academic sources of data anecdotal reports and one of our doctors was kind enough to take the time to comb through all of that and decided that although he can guide me on dosing he didn't feel it would hurt her in any way and nothing else was working so he gave us a prescription and how did how soon did you notice the difference well we started her on a low dose after I made the first batch of oil and got the lab test results back the second day she had a minor seizure this was November mid November and then after that she has not had a seizure since even a subclinical nothing we had a her seventeenth eg in January and it showed no seizure activity at all nothing yeah how does that make you feel that this is you know something that you've provided the quality of life for her however it's great I mean she's now she's crawling she's learning to walk she's playing with toys she's feeding herself she's bothering her brother her quality of life is a thousand percent increase you know probably fair to say as a parent you're gonna do whatever it takes of course do that legal or not legal but now that it's legal how does that help you out well I was willing to do it before and I did but now that there's no fear of prosecution it takes a weight off and hopefully opens the doors to two other people having better access and research yeah well it's great to hear the Quinns doing well thank you also coming in to share your story you're welcome", "5MXhjRljHKg": "hi everyone my name is Lauren Gao and this is life above the clouds and today I am going to show you another great method of making a cannabis infusion you can use this with olive oil which is what I'm going to do today but you can also use coconut oil or butter right now I have a piece of cheesecloth here that's folded in half so you make sure that it's double layered and I also have a little strip that I've cut off already and here is half a gram of decarboxylated cannabis so I have my cannabis in the middle of my cheesecloth and I'm just gonna fold it up like a little present so make sure that it overlap and this little packet so I'm just gonna take my little packet and tie it up with my piece of cheesecloth I'm just gonna stick it in to my jar and I'm gonna fill it up with oil give it a little shake make sure it seals and here I have a pot of water it's not quite boiling yet we want it to be at 200 to 225 degrees so I'm just gonna carefully placed it in clear you also don't want your jar to be touching the bottom of your pan or your pot if you have another lid from another jar you can place it underneath there you can place a dish towel underneath there I actually have this really great metal basket that came with my pots and I have the water about halfway just one enough cover the level of oil in your car so we let this go for two hours I pulled it out and let it cool down and now it is time to unseal this we're just going to fish out our little packet squeeze out all the oil we can see this is about as much as we can get out of this guy and there you have it you're finished oil so you can use this oil by itself like you would any olive oil you can use it to cook with in your pan you can use it to make salad dressings or you can use it to bake with which is the first my favorite thing to do if you liked this video be sure to give it a thumbs up and share with your friends and don't forget to subscribe to my channel thanks for watching [Music]", "B46D3lrP3C8": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel and if you're new what's up my name is Vinay strick thank you so much for being here as you can see by the title we are trying out cannabis infused makeup I really wanted to do this video to not only learn about what cannabis and beauty products even means like what are the benefits is it even worth paying extra for and I wanted to do that research with you guys so we could learn more about it and then I also have a couple products from two different brands that have cannabis in them and not only do I want to see like what it adds to the makeup but just as makeup products in general I want to see if they're even worth your money so I really hope that you guys find this video interesting I hope you find it helpful and I also hope that you do love this video and if you do please make sure to give it a big thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to my channel to join my squad let's get into it alrighty guys so I it's interesting the days we're living and I did not think that we were gonna be doing a video like this I hope it's not you know controversial or anything like that obviously we're not doing anything illegal here but I will leave some timestamps in the description because I first wanted to like talk about the benefits of cannabis and then I'm gonna test out the products because I feel like a lot of people don't really understand like why is there like cannabis and makeup like what does it even do so I found some information online that I kind of wanted to share with you guys in case you are interested but if you're not interested you can always skip to the actual like reviewing the products if you want to so definitely go in the description and I will leave timestamps but it's a quick disclaimer I obviously don't condone any illegal activity nothing like that I just feel like with any trend I feel like makeup companies really every company at this point kind of hops on a trend and sometimes some companies will slap on a name or just add an ingredient or a graphic and make that like more sellable like a palette like this so obviously CBD cannabis all that has been pretty trendy ever since been legalized and there has been so many benefits that's been found from it so not only do I want to like learn more about it but I also want to see like is this actually a good product or is it just like trendy and it's not actually worth the hype this is not the only product that I have I have products from makeup revolution and NYX let's get to what I found I've been reading up a lot about it I wanted to give you guys a lot of information I didn't want to just test out the products I actually found a website that I learned a lot about so I'm actually just going to be putting on the screen what I'm reading but this is from the brand botanics and I believe it's just a skincare line that has cannabis in it and I found some parts of their website that really like explained what it is why it is in products and things like that so there's gonna be a lot of reading so like I said I will put it right here and just to start off a lot of people are like well what's the difference between marijuana and hemp and CBD and all that stuff because I know for a while you have probably seen like hemp lotion and things like that so I found this thing right here that says that understanding the differences between cannabis hemp and marijuana can be confusing because marijuana and hemp come from the same plant cannabis sativa the distinction is a variety of the plant so in the case of cannabis the varieties differ in the amount of THC that they contain THC in a plant is what makes people feel a certain way and what's actually illegal in most of this country so hemp generally contains very little to no psychoactive effects so that's where it differs you know I know a lot of people might think if I put this on my face I'm not gonna feel weird like just remember that that ingredient the THC is what makes people feel different if you know what I mean I'm trying not to get like do you monetize this product specifically I'll say that they're infused with cannabis sativa I noticed that in all these makeup products it says specifically that they have cannabis sativa seed oil so I really wanted to know like well what are the actual benefits from that specifically so it says that this oil and skincare product have grown popularity over the past few years as a result an increasing customer interest in using the power of plants in skincare formulations which is actually one of the reasons why I'm so interested in this it's from a plant it is natural and I love anything that's natural and not like chemically made so it says that this is a naturally Green oil composed of 90% omega fatty acids I did not know that and unlike CBD oil the cannabis sativa seed oil is mainly found in skin care products thanks to its powerful hydrating properties and abundant antioxidants we're almost done with reading I can leave the extra sites that I have up here for you guys if you want to pause it and keep reading I just don't want to bore you guys anymore but pretty much it says that stress is often the part of everyday life that can affect your skin in very many ways which can be like visible signs of aging dehydration to irritation dullness and uneven skin tone and texture so cannabis sativa seed oil tackles the signs of stress skin by calming and smoothing and reducing the appearance of redness so it also acts as a super moisturizer that intensively nourishes and regenerates sensitive and tired skin and helps to support the skin natural moisture barrier it contains properties that will soothe calm skin unlike other oils it will not clog your pores and it is suitable for most skin types so I think that's really really awesome and lastly it also says that it is non acne genic and it can help balance out oily skin hydrating it and regulating the skins oil production so like I said there's so much about it and you know if you want to just keep reading I can link the website down below again they actually sell skin care which I actually have never tried but I really wanted to know more about this because I guess the whole point of this video is do the makeup products that were testing actually like make a difference if it has that oil or are we just paying extra because of it and you won't really see your difference so that's kind of the whole point of the video and also are they good products or not actually tried a lot of these products out already because I wanted to give you guys more of a review but there will be some first impressions so NYX actually came out with a whole collection I can link it down below but there are a lot of products I kind of wanted to test out different products from different brands but let's take look at this spray so this is called the bear with me prime set refresh multitasking spray it is ten dollars and it does have 4.4 fluid ounces okay so it does say that this multitasking spray is infused with aloe and cucumber extract and this is also sensitive skin friendly for again priming setting and refreshing it's supposed to deliver a dewy burst of hydration with every spritz I am on the actual collection website I will put this up here it does say that the products that do have the cannabis sativa seed oil is for soothing hydrating benefits it is infused with hemp derived soothing cannabis sativa seed oil and centella se tikka I don't know what that means extract for 24 hours hydrated happy skin I have been trying to spray out and I really really enjoy it look at the spray on this I have actually have been really enjoying it I feel like this setting spray is a really good just like a go to setting spray it definitely adds hydration to my skin but it doesn't make it super dewy and I think that's awesome actually because I do think that this would work for a lot of skin types I think it gives you hydration without making you greasy or dewy and there's no shimmer on it it really has such a fine mist it really coats your face so evenly and beautiful I never get splotches I actually think that that's a really good price considering it has four point three nine fluid ounces I do think that this is a pretty big bottle I like the setting spray it's a good primer a good refresher and a good setter guess that the seed oil is what adds to the hydration and I really like it like I said it's a really nice hydrating feel without being like overdone so I do recommend this and I think it's great and I like it I don't think it's overpriced and I really like it so next let's move on to makeup revolution because this is actually the my favorite product that I have tried this is actually the makeup revolution high brow gel cannabis sativa and I did get the shade medium brown so under evolution website says that this is $7 the colored formula comes in three shades not a good shade range but it does come in brown medium brown and dark brown your brows will peel fuller and infused with cannabis sativa oil will help to nourish and protect the hairs vegan and cruelty-free this is what the seed oil is going to help so it's going to help nourish and protect the hairs so like I said I do like the beauty products that are actually doing something I guess what I'm getting at is that I don't understand what a eyes shadow palette will do by having those benefits but we'll get there in a minute so I've been trying out this brow gel for about a week or two now and it's actually like my new favorite it is so so good I really wish it came in more shades the brush applicator is tiny which is something that I love and it's also skinny so it's not super chunky formula is really really nice it is very pigmented very easy to work with the brush is super super easy to work with and I've actually tried this out multiple times to go to the gym with and this is like completely waterproof I don't think it actually claims that it's waterproof but or you know maybe sweat resistant I don't want to call it waterproof but anytime I go to the gym and I wear this it doesn't come off at all and actually for fourth of July I wore this and I did swim and it didn't come off and it's so so nice something else that I noticed that I actually do like is that this makes your brows a little bit stiff which have only found some drugstore broad gels to do that mainly the high-end ones are the ones I like make them super stiff I personally do prefer that because once you put them in place they stay as of now I haven't reached for any other brow gel because this is just so so good and seven dollars again it's very unfortunate that it doesn't have more than three shades do give this a thumbs up and I think it's cool that the oil will nourish my eyebrows why not I'm actually going to apply my eye primer and I'm going to apply the mascara so you can actually see it and then I will apply the eye shadow so I am going to curl my lashes if you're wondering I do use the Kevin Kwan eyelash curler and I just want to give you guys a disclaimer I like to give these disclaimers all the times in case I do have newer viewers I do use an eyelash serum for my lashes so you might think that the mascara is good but I just I personally have pretty long lashes if you're interested in the last serum that I use I will link it down below with all the products so this is called the blow out mascara with cannabis sativa and here is the brush so this is ten dollars it has 25 reviews in there all 5 stars on the revolution website also on the Ulta website were actually bought it it had really really good reviews so the description is that this is a volume mascara that is a must-have the jet-black formula is enriched with cannabis sativa the dense bristle brush layers each and every eyelash creating thicker and more voluminous lashes and it says tip coat with a couple layers for a more dramatic powerful eye look and it is cruelty free so this is two coats I'm going to be honest with you guys this is the third time that I've used this mascara and it's not really my favorite a lot of people love this mascara so you know just because I don't like it doesn't mean you won't first layer will give you a very pretty very natural feathery wispy look if you're into that then you might really like this but I prefer something a little bit more dramatic but when I do go in with the second coat I don't have yes can tell but I do get pretty spidery lashes which is fine it's just not my preference since the bristles are so flimsy it doesn't actually separate my lashes very well in the second coat it does start getting a little bit messy so if you're more interested in a more natural wispy feathery look then you might really like this and you know with the seed oil I'm sure it conditions your lashes but for me it's just not something that I will reach for probably at all unfortunately it's just not very good for me I will pass on this one so let's look at this I think the packaging is really pretty I love the colors that revolution has done with this whole collection and I also like how NYX kept it like super clean and classy so I love both but here's the packaging it does come in a tin packaging this is what it looks like obviously as you can see a lot of green shades and a couple transition shades and it does have mirror do you guys know me at all you know that I probably would never buy this palette I bought it for video purposes but I don't ever look for green shades I don't really do a lot of colorful looks but I know that some of you guys do like colorful looks and some of you guys love green so that's kind of why I bought it just to tell you guys have it's worth your money it's actually pretty affordable so again it is a makeup revolution forever flawless chilled with cannabis sativa shadow palette it does have 78 reviews and has 5 stars and it is $15 as a teen earthy toned matte shimmers and press glitter powder shadows it is infused with nourishing cannabis sativa seed oil powder shadows have a strong buildable pigments it didn't really say what the cannabis sativa oil is for and that's kind of like again that's kind of like what annoys me it's like tell me why you put it in there like what are the actual benefits but like I said if you just like the packaging and you like green shadows I'm just gonna let you guys know if it's worth it so I kind of want to swatch just a couple shades just to see what we're working with so use a little bit of a close-up you know swatches don't always look the best but you shouldn't judge a palette by its swatch I'm gonna speed this part up from the video because I don't want it to be too long but I will be showing you all the shades that I'm using [Music] [Music] [Music] okay guys I am back I had the hardest time applying fake lashes over this glitter my obsessed with the palette no obviously like I said this is not typically my shade range but even aside from the shades I do think that the shimmers are very pretty as you guys can see they're very reflective the only thing I had a little bit of trouble with are the matte so these shades right here are they're very nice very soft and buttery but they do take a lot a lot of layers to build up so if you don't mind that then I think that you will like this palette but if you like pigment right off the bat with the transition change it will take you a lot of building up I do think it created a really nice look I think it has really good transition shades to work with green shade I will say the glitters are very very pretty please use a glitter primer I figured I would just try it on its own but it did get everywhere am i obsessed with the palette no do I think it's a good palette it's $15 it has a cool design and like aspect to it sure if you if you're interested in this palette for more than just the formula I think that it's worth it but if you're looking for like the best formula of green shades I would probably skip out on this one but I think as a whole I do think it's affordable it's nice it's pigmented and it's cute so we have come to the last product which is actually from NYX this is the NYX bear with me cannabis sativa jelly cheek color and this is in the shade rum punch look at that but this only has three stars out of five on the website and it is $10 you have six different shades says that it is a hydrated flush face just to tap away with this product it is infused with hemp to bribe cannabis sativa seed oil known for its soothing and hydrating benefits this buildable cheek tint features a gel formula that feels amazing on your face as it does on your fingers I've actually tried this on my bare skin I liked it but I felt like when you rubbed it out didn't really leave a lot of pigment so this is like kind of scary it literally is a very very soft jelly like nerve you guys can tell I do have concealer foundation and cream bronzer and I haven't set anything because I've actually have never tried this over makeup only on my bare skin you start blending it out and it kind of almost blends into nothing so obviously you could stop blending at a certain point but if you do want to get like a blended look you have to keep keep on blending but like I said I haven't tried it on with makeup I'm kind of scared I'm not gonna lie grab a little bit on my brush and maybe put it on my hand a little bit like this okay it's definitely showing more up on makeup oh okay okay this is looking pretty cute actually it's just like I said on bare face it was really like blending out into nothing but I feel like since I do have makeup under it's like it has something to hold on to obviously this shade doesn't go with this makeup look please ignore that but guys I put on a very very very small amount and it is giving me a really pretty flushed look so literally I that dent is from my nail so I literally barely touched it so I feel like this could last you your literal lifetime I do like looking burnt okay so that is what that looks like it actually is giving me a lot of do but what I like about it is that it's not super shimmery I like it matte or luminous but not shimmery so this actually looks really really pretty alrighty guys so makeup is done I am quickly going to set the face so first let me just tell you guys what my stand up products where I think that my favorite favorite product from everything that I tried was definitely the brow gel I know it's just brow gel but it's really nice it's a really long-lasting it's very pigmented and it comes really great packaging something else that I really liked was the setting spray I just think that if you're looking for a primer set a refresher that's not going to alter the outcome of your makeup maybe just add a little bit of hydration without looking greasy I really enjoy this I think that this will work for a lot of you and then the other product that really surprised me was this blush because I truly thought because it was so jelly like that it might mess up my makeup but honestly I think it looks really gorgeous and I actually didn't even put any highlight on and I think it gave me such a beautiful glow from within like I didn't see the need to put highlights like this really looks really beautiful so I guess my final thoughts on this cannabis infused dealio is I really really want to try out some skin care that has CBD or cannabis stevia oil I just said stevia sativa because it has so many benefits and I definitely want to test them up for myself and when it comes to makeup I think that if you're really interested in the benefits of the seed oil try products like this that will actually go on your skin or products like this that will nourish your eyebrows like I said with the eye shadow palette I don't necessarily see where are you getting these benefits from so like I said if you think this is cool and you just want to buy it buy it but if you really want to get the benefits I say be more strategic with what kind of products you do get overall I am very very happy with this video I honestly learned a lot about CBD and cannabis oil that can be really really helpful and really nice especially in beauty products and yeah like I said I liked a lot of these products so I really hope that you guys enjoy this video I hope that you found it informative I hope you enjoyed it and definitely comment down below like always come say hi and just let me know your thoughts let me know your thoughts and your knowledge and your opinions on this and yeah I hope that y'all enjoyed it thank you guys so so much for watching I love you all very very much thank you for 60,000 subscribers and I will see you guys in my next video bye", "2IZa69rdR0U": "[Music] we are here at CES 2020 taking a look at the latest we'd check around so right now I'm in front of a booth for a company called pax and they have had a vaporizer out for a number of years now but today they are launching their new AeroPro it's a new vaporizer that actually connects with these specific pods right here to be able to give their users more specific precise information test results on the CBD content the THC etc in the strains that they're smoking not only does it give you more transparency in the information but it also lets you personalize how you take hits so right here you can see that you actually get to personalize how hot you want to smoke a given strain and also you get to choose how many doses you want to take for every inhale not only does it give you full transparency on the test results on the strains that you're smoking but it also lets you personalize how you smoke it straight so that app actually stores your preferences for each strain so maybe one you want to burn hotter and one you want to just sip on over time right and basically by storing that information and sort of adapting over time to how you smoke you gain sort of a more personalized experience to you're smoking houses right and the arrow Pro actually provides haptic feedback so when you inhale you get a certain amount a certain dosage and if you inhale hard or soft it actually still tries to give you a sort of adapt it tries to give you about the same amount and it actually vibrates it gives me kind of haptic feedback when you finish the dose so it's kind of a cool contraption here it adds it a lot of transparency a lot of smarts it's really cool to see this shift over time where they're adding so many smart and so much transparency to this burgeoning industry for more of the latest tech at CES check out our youtube channel otherwise thanks for watching [Music]", "mlQ9AFjsVK8": "so what it is you got in front of viewing what you're about to do well I am in quite a lot of pain right now my chest really hurts my legs sounds weird to say but they're nothing but painful at the same time generally not feeling that great so I'm just about to medicate myself with some cannabis I mean this is kind of the newest and most effective and efficient way of getting cannabinoids into my system quickly here I have some hash oil that I made so this is basically just the concentrated trichome heads of of cannabis plants so it's without any other plant matter just the cannabinoids just the medicine and this is a rig this way is very efficient because it's very concentrated and it's also much healthier than smoking it because you don't have any of the combustion that you'd normally have of all the plant matter there is no plant matter here it's all just can have annoyed so it's much healthier in that one little bit there's the same amount that it would take me you know a whole joint and then there for half an hour maybe two smoke right of this you get it in one concentrated here I can understand why people might be a bit put off by the way that this looks like it doesn't look like this is medicine this looks like this is drugs but no this is this is the easiest and best way to get the most amount of cannabinoids into my system so that I'm not in pain anymore so that you know I have a better quality of life and you know it works and that's a dad I'm Clark and I'm 27 years old I live in Redding in Berkshire I'm an ancient history and archaeology graduate and I was diagnosed with MS in 2010 I'm literally like I can't escape it and like if I want to be well and I want to feel like a man or you have to use cannabis well I have tried lots of pharmaceuticals and they make me worse than made me feel like [ __ ] but I found that across the board cannabis helps with all of my symptoms it means that my legs are less tight so helps with my spasticity it dramatically reduces my pain it improves my mood and blows my my depression it and brings me out of like like really low times and it can stop me from having tremors and spasms when I have them it generally can like pretty much pick me up when I'm just really feeling awful I can often I can consume some cannabis and then I feel much better to extent where I'm not in as much discomfort completely not in there near as much discomfort gives me something back that ms took away it has just that much of an impact it does improve my quality of life undoubtedly I had a treatment of cannabis oil in America and I've you know experienced the level of of remission that that gave me like it meant I didn't need my walking stick again it meant that I could I was like here I struggle with a craft the Hera's climbing up cliffs see that was the difference so when I was over there I was using it orally so I was taking it in capsules so like the recommended course is a gram a day for 60 days and that that's what I did I came back and I didn't use a walking stick for quite a while as well I was definitely feeling better for some time after it's like in the long term I'm hopefully going to be able to make it so that I can use the oil again and therefore I think it's not unreasonable war I'm realistic for me to say I well I want to be in the 20% and I get there because I know that there's a medicine out there that essentially gets me better so yeah that's what I'm going for I think the law is wrong I think that it's an unjust law it's not based in science is based in stigma and you know used to be accepted that a woman didn't get a vote it used to be accepted that we could have slaves it used to be accepted that we could be abusive and gay people in prison for me I was standing up for my rights to live under standing up for my right to be myself like and if that means that I have to go to prison for to stand up for that right and that's something that I do because ultimately that's more important to me then subjugate myself to someone else as well when I disagree with what they're trying to tell me we're not well when I know that what they're trying to tell me is a lie why should I do that why should anyone do that why should anyone have to do that I'm not saying everyone should take cannabis that's not what I'm saying I'm saying to reduce the harm it needs to be taken out the hands of the criminal black market and through proper harm reduction techniques through legalization and regulation through licensing and probably you know kids can't get hold of drugs if they're sold by a licensed person that will lose their license if they sell them drugs just like alcohol you know it's easier for kids of a certain age to get hold of drugs then it is alcohol simply because they don't have to show ID to a dealer know yeah I think when a law is wrong you have a moral responsibility to stand up to it it's wrong it's unjust and that's what I'm doing you know since I was diagnosed haven't really been able to do as much and I guess what I enjoy doing now is his activism really generally that's kind of what I live for it's what I wake up and I check that's what I do it makes me feel like I can't do that much but what I can do is actually worthwhile or might not be able to spend as much time doing it as of what as someone who was well but through being able to have access to the Internet it has given me you know a sense of purpose in life really I guess I'll do activism because I think it's the right thing to do things have changed things are changing one day they're gonna turn on and go oh I was wrong I can't wait for that day it's gonna happen wait when will that be I don't know you live like that's a difficult question in the UK it's a very difficult question because we don't have the ability to change the laws like certain states in the u.s. are able to change local laws and get cannibus legalized on a local level but for us it's either all or nothing so it's you know it's gonna be difficult and the cannabis campaign movement is really quite young although we have had a history of campaigning in the UK is kind of done it died out and lately is only just I had to be reignited things only just starting to like come together and people were getting organized and trying to make things happen again so to be honest I'd like to be a law-abiding citizen of other than cannabis I don't break them or you know I don't go robbing people we don't go Steven things or or breaking into people's houses or no no I do you know I mean it's just I use a hub to treat my illness but apparently that makes me a criminal so it would be nice to not be a criminal but not be considered criminal by my government because I don't kiss in my crib myself a criminal I'm in it yeah however long it takes no politics because I messed doesn't go just go away like I'm but I live it every day I can't I can't not be in it live it every single day [Music] I instantly got involved with the activism stuff when I found out the truth about kind of if I was just outrageous but how could I have not had this medicine given to me as such when it when so many people around the world already know about it when it is a when it could be available when it used to be available in this country my own illness would never have been as bad as it was if I had been able to access cannabis Crohn's disease is like waking up every morning but the most intense nausea that you can imagine a lot of the time you do throw up a lot of time you have to wake up and you run to the toilet because you're gonna have diarrhea and you will for the next two hours in me I hope having really bad unfortunately I do have access to go and make access to myself with cannabis and that helps me keeping reassuring but it can be really awful [Music] the gaffer just got me on the radio and said Follow the Leader ease get the mobile number how many people expected so we need to know because people wait in the sidelines GPS gets bigger than 50 plus then we'll be coming down on this smell kind of bees that gives us browse to search it okay so what's your name we don't want to lose not only fast we still want people to turn up who doesn't want anyone to get in trouble or anything so we're just gonna carry on we can still have a protest about cannabis without having to have it to smoke here cannabis is what's called a Schedule one Class B drug so Class B means that it's the penalties that you attract for possessing it are up to seven years in prison and up to 14 years in prison for dealing it Schedule one means that it has its considers are having no zero medical value [Music] we've distinct the current law surrounding cannabis and the way people who use cannabis we just think they're it's wrong Dickerman tires were criminalized just for using a plant which is scientifically proven to be safer than alcohol or tobacco they're both legally recreational drugs from it for me life um if I'm having like pains or cramps it's like within seconds they'll just they'll just disappear it makes that much of a difference like without cannabis I might have to go to the toilet 20 times a day there's certainly a growing movement at the moment of people and organizations who want to achieve legal access to cannabis for adults and legal access to cannabis for medicinal purposes for everybody and people want that for a variety of reasons I mean one is that people are using cannabis at the moment sadly illegally with a threat of prosecution you know as a medicine but I am pushing it forward because I decided that the time has come for awareness and I think the law needs to be examined to grow my own organically to medicate myself wait you have to get [ __ ] know people my name is Michele Michele and X I got I couldn't get my head around it it was like it was an illegal drug you know you can't do this it you druggie you know you're wasting your time taking drugs and other people would be like you know if I was in your pain I'd want to get high all the time you know it's like that's what you they think we're floating around in some kind of like hazy hay world you know all as a camera you know but it's not true it doesn't affect us like that it it doesn't affect us in that way at all all it does is bring clarity to what we're already putting up with but just get non-consumers to also say you know yeah I don't consume it myself but I have no problem you know I would accept it if the laws were changed I have no problem with people using cannabis so that's what we really need there's so much stigma around us and there's that sustained a stereotype which sort of alienates us from from normal society so it's the case of normalizing it so that people feel that it's more acceptable for them to say oh well I agree with what you're doing and I think people need to need to see this and need to be aware of it and this is certainly one way of you know individuals coming together locally and showing their support for a national and a global movement which is gaining momentum day by day she the major flaw with prohibiting any substance is that if people like to take that substance for whatever reason somebody will supply to them people like to think of this as the war on drugs I think it's actually a war on people by alienating them by criminalizing by a punishing room for something that either is not doing them or anybody else any harm and that's just unjust my name is Luke was he come down here from the protest to try and reform the laws of the cannabis at the moment I've opened D skinned up a joint front of police and they decided to me I mean I have tried to discuss with them the fact that we're not causing any harm you know I've covered a lot a lot of the topics about the issues around it and that smoking cannabis and growing cannabis and using cannabis certainly for personal use should not be a crime it should not be illegal it should be at the very least decriminalized if not legalized and the police I've you know the police don't want to give us their personal opinions because they are here representing the police force so that's the way it is [Music] this is an issue where the political realm isn't going to take the lead so the grassroots activism is so needed it couldn't be any more needed it's held reform happened in America she's just cogent responses to the problem something has to have gone wrong somewhere where there's a criminalization on people that are already suffering and they're already on the fringes of society the fact that they're having to put themselves out there open their lives up like a book just so that people can take a quick glance and assess oh yeah you're you're worthy of not being a criminal it's quite a horrible position that the law is puttin them in so you know we're nowhere near there where we need to be yeah any situation which is as big as the as Canada's prohibition is it's not gonna change overnight and it's not gonna be solved instantly but we've definitely taken a few decent steps towards the right direction of trying to end it and trying to do something about the fact that we all think cannabis prohibition is wrong so Clark his life is now kind of painting for himself and others should not be a criminal and it's the same as anybody else that's got cancer MSME crimes I just don't want to be a criminal for taking something that completely enhances their life and it is it really boils down to a life or death issue it may not be a in terms of a fatal position but when you have an illness which is a living death anything to get you a little bit of relief on that given day it's something you have to give serious consideration to [Music] but they found a lesions in my brain and they then did a second MRI scan few months later which showed more lesions in my brain which I basically completely proved it's definitely a mess the first feeling when I was when I was speaking to the neurologist and when you go money actually said you know you you do have MS I'm sorry to say you do have MS I was like right cool what do we do you know I was kind of finally relieved that I wasn't making it up you know there was actually something wrong with me and from this point on I could do something about it rather than not knowing my mom and my dad split when I was 1 and then my mum remarried when I was 7 to my stepdad Richard and Richard had multiple sclerosis and my mom also has multiple sclerosis so I've kind of lived with the disease and seeing it in the people that closest to me like all my life [Music] Oh as digested also I'm upset it's not there the time has been loving with this but then I was I'm gonna do it he Matador I got it from but he's got to be great from me so that's it sighs killed I feel my speed I forget they'd have messed up his life unfortunately when I was 11 Richard passed away [Music] is definitely the biggest influence of my life anyone he's medical cannabis around me when I was a child and I saw the difference I made if you know this when you didn't live with someone that has and that's that badly and you see and you see I'm being an agony you see them not being able to move you see the legs tightening and shaking and then you see them go out smoke joint can then come back in and be normal be able to converse be able to like just talk normally he's a massive part my life without like I don't know so I would don't think I'd be the person I am if it wasn't him but before I was diagnosed with illness I did have quite a lot of things and I did do a lot of different stuff I used to be pretty active I used to be live music promoter doing degree and in a band you know we went around the UK playing shows it it wasn't you it was fun you know but since it has made life a lot more difficult and it has meant that I've really had to kind of pick and choose but the things that are most important to me and do them and when I can actually do things so we have been friends going on 12 years now so I think of him like a brother you know if he feels something he'll just he'll just say he's quite sharp and straight to the point and I like to about him you know if he gets bit down or whatever I try to remind him of that like that personality that quality he has of just being able to sit someone down even if it's not a good conversation or anything but he's not scared to do that he will and he's always got a point you know so you kind of like listen to him because usually he's right he's been so positive and so dynamic in a way looking into trying to find the truth as a boy he believes and he puts a lot of energy and thought into a third a couple of his meetings about standing up could be 80 people or so yeah anything he talks so we use our being so clearly and so positively do you know if you're gonna get better or or worse no I don't know that's part of the problem they have of everyone with MS faces is the fact that nobody knows like it is it is more likely that it will get worse then it will get better and it's also could just stay the same so I think there's about a 60% chance it will get worse a 20% chance they will get about our and a 20% chance of same thing so I'm going for the 20% game better he really gets on his life now I'm here in London to the UK I take medical cannabis prescribed by my doctors in the Netherlands and this is medicine this is standardized it's pure it's consistent each pot you open is the same in the UK the only medicinal form of cannabis that has been licensed is Sativex and Sativex is an extract of a particular cannabis strain and it contains THC and cannabidiol it's indications are quite limited it's only limited indicated for spasticity which which but it wears it probably does have a broader impact on other symptoms of multiple sclerosis particular like pain and sleep but the regulatory system in this country is so constraining that it was only able to get his license form for spasticity here I have chronic pain syndrome which means that I'm in constant pain 24 hours a day seven days a week I have a permanent you detach that shoulder there is no cure there is nothing that will ever help the only thing that does relieve even the remotest bit of pain a little shape just a little trip going up well I fly out to California from my third time now I'm going to have a look at the industry again like and and meet up with old friends and one enjoy myself and get some access to some decent medicine and to immerse myself from the industry because I think that's what's giving me a lot of the drive to do what I do is go into California and seeing the industry working there [Music] [Music] my name is Chris Haggerty I'm an assistant manager of the trim crew which is as you see everything behind us and now where we're going is strictly outdoor nothing but outdoor and these are the big plants these are the big boys I have to walk through the jungle a little bit all right this is the plane we're gonna be taking down it's called ISS which is just the abbreviation for island Suites go how it starts off as it comes out from the outdoor we get the big plants and then we hang them up we weigh them and after we weigh them we cut them down and we bring them to the trim table behind us that does the D leafing and the sweet leaves that they used when they cut the weed and the Leafs are falling into the tray they take those Leafs and use it for to make hash so every part of the plants getting used so what they're doing is they're taking their scissors and they're going and cutting all the Leafs every leaf has a point on it and they have to be tipped and there's also stuff that we call crow's feet or whale tails on the bottom of the plant so we have to take those off as well because they're not they don't have any medicine use or anything like that it's more trash so they're using the Fiskars they're called and they just sit there very meticulously and get every single leaf off as fast and efficient as they can and making it look - when you go to the dispensary and you buy it you're seeing what they do like that's the finished product that they come out with is what people are buying on the shelves [Music] I'm a hand trimmer I cut the buds by hand with my trusty scissors I do enjoy the hand Sherman just because it's a it's a it's a strange experience it's a zen-like experience too really get in the detail of the bud and get a manicure each piece I also enjoy like thinking about how many patients are gonna get to enjoy this bud like how many people that this is gonna make its gonna make their day better I I go through like 1,500 to 2,000 grams of trimming per day so it's gonna be that's gonna be making a lot of people happy and then what we do is we enter it in a computer so we have you know access to it at all times and then after that we could rack it up and while we while we hang it on the racks is so that every plant is wet when you cut it down and every plant needs to be turned upside down and when it turns upside down it's taking all the THC and everything and bringing it into the buds and out of the stems so by doing that it's hanging and making the wheat stronger more potent and that's why we do that and then stick it in the Cure and then they cure the wheat until it goes out on the shelves [Music] so basically here we have river rock the whole the actual real dispensary what the patients see what they deal with when they come in it's just it's a shopping experience the patient can come in and talk to a budtender and they can ask to see very specific things and about 10 it can pull that out and let them get a closer inspection of it in the first case of the medicine we have the top flight strains then you have a case full of just the indicas and a case of just sativas to kind of to separate everything for patients in a very easy way [Music] [Music] my name is Tracy I'm 27 years old I have lived in Denver for about a year and a half now and I absolutely love it I actually moved here for medicinal marijuana and moving here and being able to have access to medical marijuana has been a pretty amazing experience for myself river rock actually helps me through a lot of bad times like whenever I'm feeling that or down or so I come in here the employees in here are really nice they joke around make me feel like make me feel good about myself instead of trying to put me down or stuff like that and they have the best weed in Colorado when I say you know I'm having trouble with anxiety or I'm having trouble sleeping they know exactly what to pull out they have that education and that knowledge I use cannabis because my back I have a slip disc in my back and I and I had a tumor in my head I was when I first came in here my tumor was golf-ball-sized now my tumor is so uh peanut size being able to come somewhere like this instead of you know in some back-alley crazy place where someone I don't even know this is this is a much more comfortable family type environment they know my name they they know what my problem is and they take care of it had a quite an in-depth tour of the entire process we got a chance to have a view on and it was really really interesting really good to see and really really inspiring to make it happen back home it was like a pharmacy but for cannabis and it really was and it's really good to see patients getting a medicine that worked for them and getting the choice that they have they're like you know you go in and you've got 50 different strains of flowers to choose from like any patient is guaranteed to find something that's gonna work for them and in that range like they've got edibles they've got tinctures they've got concentrates they've got everything under the Sun that you could imagine that would be made out of cannabis they pretty much got it and patients in the UK should have that access and that level of access to be well because there were people here but if they go there it's cool river rock wellness for a reason because they make people well again you know I don't really want to go home to be honest but I guess I have to my stay is is coming to an end soon so [Music] [Music] medical marijuana legal in the state since 1996 the industry as you see it now I began probably around a decade ago when there was a state law passed by the legislature following up the voter initiative made it not entirely legal but a little bit more legal to have storefront dispensaries here in San Francisco you had Dennis Franz selling cannabis openly before the medical marijuana law passed at that place in that and at that time you in the Castro in the early 90s would have been politically infeasible to crackdown on marijuana entirely and so that's how people like Dennis were able to do what he did even though in flagrant violation of every law on the books local and state but people in San Francisco yeah there's absolutely a living legend of the cannabis movement alive and well right now at the Castro Castle and we have AIDS in San Francisco from a six by six radius of this area in his house 38,000 people died they had what they call a wasting syndrome where people who aren't hungry they didn't eat now I want to give him the munchies and it ease their pain so over that purposes it was great for AIDS patients until 1996 yeah dude every new everything I did was to legalize marijuana the medicine I sponsored proposition 215 that would be wife medical marijuana initiative now it's 20 states and I believe in marijuana and most people like it I believe in it look because people are going to jail sick people go to jail this is wrong I am I am the guy and led them to ever it's the swamp the prohibition and Blair Georgia returns I'm proud of it and I hope they continued on to the end of prohibition we never seen again in California all you need is a recommendation from your doctor nothing more than a piece of paper saying that they recommend marijuana for a serious medical condition [Music] I'm Juliana and I'm the founder of auntie Dolores co-op based here in California for a medical cannabis bakery people love edibles especially if they need higher potency medicine and they're maybe not getting what they need by just smoking or by just vaping it's a way to kind of supplement your intake and so we always kind of tell people that's a great way to get the medicine in your system and have it in there for a good six to eight hours just because for pain management alone I do feel it's a bit superior to just smoking for us it's great because we get feedback from patients and I mean from MS patients to cancer patients you name it I mean we get emails you know seeing how much cannabis has helped them and I mean that's why we do this it's just it's amazing [Music] well if you're using the product as medicine you need to know what you're putting into your body you need to know how strong the products are you need to know the the CBD and the THC levels so if if you're only using the product for recreational use then CBD really has no benefit for you if you have a social disorder and you need something that really gets you out and gets you interacting with people then you're gonna want something that's higher in THC so you're gonna need to know the balances in those you're gonna need to know which products are better for you for your ailments just knowing something is there that you can't see is a big thing for our patients right so if you were to go to a place that doesn't lab test and they look at a product that looks pristine and then it goes to the lab and it fails the mold test you have no idea that what's going into your body if it wasn't tested so if you were getting that product off the streets or if you were going to some of the lower market clubs that aren't testing their medicine that as a patient that's something that you need to know [Music] three years ago I could barely walk I was needing a wheelchair just to get to my hospital appointments I was diagnosed with MS and I was given the option of using Tysabri a form of chemotherapy which is usually reserved for people with MS I've had it for over 10 years as a second-line treatment you know I could barely do anything I could couldn't hold my bladder or my bowels I couldn't you know its stammer and talk barely be able to sleep I I could I couldn't walk I would be on eleven different prescription medications probably more now from all the different ones that they would have given me to counteract all the side effects from those medications but you know I didn't take that option I didn't go down that that route I knew there was a better a better way I knew that cannabis was a medicine underneath that cannabis could help me and and Here I am three years on well able to walk again and I'm gonna walk over the Golden Gate Bridge just to prove that cannabis is a medicine and just to prove that I can do it and just to prove just to prove that we need it back in the UK the truth in general has had massive impact on me I've learned a lot of things from meaning of the people that I've met and I've also been a lot better personally like in my own my own illness and my own problems dramatically reduced since I've been here and had full access to medical cannabis I've stopped using my walking stick that didn't take didn't take that long for me to stop using it and stop needing it really I've pretty much taken it upon myself to ingest as many cannabinoids as I physically can and that has had a had a massive beneficial effect on meal I feel much more well I feel able to do a lot more yeah I still have my bad days and it's not perfect by any means but my level of no my quality of life has dramatically improved dramatically improved we're close to halfway now my legs definitely aching but I'm determined to carry on going yeah it doesn't feel great if I'm honest but [ __ ] it let's do it I've got I'm doing this to try and prove right I've proved a point so I can be a little uncomfortable along the way I expected it [Music] all the things that I want to want to see in the UK happening here like money is spending on cannabis and then that money is taxed and then that tax money then goes into how all the people of California so actually helps the economy it stimulates the economy it provides jobs that provides a lot of jobs for a lot of different people across the board [Music] so making the impossible possible the story of the Golden Gate Bridge pretty thing right now we were just walking past a little display about how it was pretty impossible for them to build a bridge and that kind of resonates with me right now because it was pretty impossible for me to walk over it so there we go it's just interesting making the impossible possible [Music] you [Music] I'm Neil watts I used to be a police officer I spent 14 years working undercover on drugs operations well police same drugs in this country costs us 14 billion pounds a year the biggest proportion of that 14 billion pounds is actually policing cannabis oh my my my name is John Lee playing I'm a medical cannabis patient I've suffered most of my adult life from anxiety and depression I'm 47 years old I have a wife and child and I benefit and manage my symptoms with medical cannabis I was I was just sat down watching some football over there there was a really really big big big bang on the window just there and I was getting I to be honest I can't remember the exact words but I think it was something along the lines of open the door open the door we can smell cannabis open the door the phrase that is used right across the country by briefing sergeants everywhere is course on fear go in hard rush in lots of shouting don't stop shouting until you've secured the place everyone in there is trussed up and handcuffed and you've got control of that place and you know you've got control of that premises and as soon as I got that far I had it hang tough metal and Katherine [Music] and basically they wrestled me to the ground in there and I explained yes I am growing cannabis in the house so I admitted this right away and I explained that I use it as medication they had to search the house I was arrested and taken away and stuck in a cell for 20 or so hours while I let them know that police station that I suffered from anxiety and please because I was gonna have a problem being locked in the cell you know without some form of medication I asked them a little bit cheekily whether I could have some of my grow back because that would be perfect but nevertheless asked for the nurse because I would have needed to talk about my anxiety and there didn't answer my call for the entire evening you know in the entire night they just kept me locked up the law does not distinguish in any way between the organized crime groups who are using violence to intimidate and they're growing for the profit that they can get and somebody and there are a great many people who grow cannabis as medicine the law doesn't distinguish between the two and yeah I probably told them everything that they wanted in it and I was probably totally and utterly over honest because all I want to do is advice and my solicitor tell them everything so did what if they charged me with something that is going to result in a in a jail sentence because for the crime and that I may have committed you know they can they can put you down for up to 14 years what right have the police got on behalf of the government to interfere in the private lives of individuals now clearly they have got the right if you're talking about stopping somebody from assaulting another citizen or from stealing their property but I think we've really got to ask ourselves the question have they got the right to break into somebody's home if they're growing a few cannabis plants to deal with their multiple sclerosis or to ease the pains they've got from cancer to help them regain their appetite and this seems to me to be completely against the spirit of what the police are there to do one statistic though I was drawn to recently is that there is estimated 300,000 cannabis grows in this country that's to cannabis grows for every police officer so the idea that you can actually stop it is ridiculous should we really be deploying our police force there to serve and protect on this hugely expensive task which isn't delivering benefits but is damaging hundreds of thousands if not millions of lives every year it's a very very serious question that we need to address now why should point out is the vast majority of cannabis factories are actually run by organized crime the same organized crime groups prey on those individuals who grow themselves they follow people from color from grow shops they pay people for information of who is ordering stuff by mail order they prey on people who are trying to medicate themselves I had a small little tent in my spare bedroom in the house that I was living in at the time it's about midnight just before midnight as a knock at the door I could see a couple of figures through the glass and I just thought oh it just must be somebody unknown the as soon as we touched the door handle that was it as soon as they heard that click bang by four people in balaclavas through my front door yeah they sort of forced their way in I did start fighting trying to hit them back and stuff yeah ended up getting sort of punched to the ground I couldn't breathe and I yeah by generally that was the closest I think I've ever come to thinking I was gonna die or actually dying or being seriously hurt you know all for a few ounces of weed the real genuine unpleasant crimes that are going on within the world of cannabis can't even be reported because if they did they'd incriminate themselves so vulnerable people again are getting abused by gangsters and they can't even be protected by the state [Music] so this was my first ever time at spannabis I've never been before and I wasn't really quite sure what to expect of I've heard that it's quite big but I was quite blown away with how huge it is it's a huge Convention Centre just full of the cannabis industry there we counted and there was 45 different seed companies that had booths there that's just the seed companies you know there's hydroponic shops there was different grow light technologies there was nutrient technologies there was like people advertising different Expos they were across the board the industry was there representing and it was it was huge it was massive there was thousands of people there on the Saturday it was so busy it was it was insane so it was really great to see and it was really proved to me that how massive the industry is gonna be once we do end prohibition of cannabis in the UK because here where they have slightly better rules where the law is slightly more able to provide people with cannabis you know it's not legal here completely but it's much more tolerated and much easier than it is in the UK in Spain in order to legalize the consumption and possession of cannabis it must be based in a private location whether is your private house or a private club an association is pretty much that a private cannabis club and that's a way that the law in Spain allows consumers to legally acquire and consume cannabis contrary to what many people believe the possession of cannabis on the street it's illegal in one respect everything is legal from the door in but then on the other hand we keep playing cat in the mouse with with the cops it's not a perfect situation here there's still a lot of work to be done but it's a lot further than it is in the UK and it does mean that people do have access to cannabis and it doesn't mean people do have places to go where they can consume it and kind of know that they're safe consuming it there it means that there's a level of quality control it means that there's no different type so you you know you get a menu of different strains with different concentrates with edibles and all that kind of thing in the allows for that which you know simply we just don't get in the UK but there's lots of different things from the different systems that I think need to be put in place and none of them have got it perfect that's that that's the thing that I think I've taken most from from my travels and from seeing all this every Association in Spain is a nonprofit organization so we're not or not II know what you were not in a position to pay taxes even though even if we wanted to the the model of the Association may not be perfect but one thing is doing is is pretty much eradicating the black market in the head of the cannabis black market in Spain and it's eliminating the connection between the drug the average drug dealer that was handling also cocaine and MDMA and it's pretty much disconnecting that from cannabis I love the way you have the clubs here work I love the fact that they're more discreet like whereas in Amsterdam you know the coffee shops are very in-your-face very like you know they have their doors open their windows open the smoke billowing out and it smells all on the street here it's not like that at all yeah the club will have a little logo on the front but you're gonna have to go through several doors to get in it's going to have a ventilation system so that it doesn't smell outside and it gives that kind of level of respect to the neighborhood which I really really like and I really really think that if we do have what sorry when we do have cafes or coffee shops or whatever we are going to have in the in the UK that's something that really feel need to be implemented [Music] believe or not cannabis is not actually legal in the Netherlands what we have is a tolerance Act so the Cadore bolide or goodwill Act essentially made cannabis tolerable what that meant was it's not legal but there is an agreement that police will not arrest you and you won't go to jail for using cannabis I can go to a coffee shop they are allowed once again not legal but allowed meaning no one will be arrested to sell me five grams of weed and they are allowed to have 500 grams at any given time now the weird thing is and it's kind of tough for some people to grasp and even tough sometimes for myself to grasp um coffee shops are allowed to sell weed no one absolutely no one is allowed to grow weed and sell it to a coffee shop the way it went when I started in in my first coffee shop was in 1991 in the first weeks a hundred percent of what I sold was smuggled into Holland hash on Jamaicans anti weed and then after a couple of months I too like my hands on some good night a weed from Amsterdam because there was not enough being grown for the Amsterdam coffee shop so you really had to find it and then I started to get some people interested to grow it for me and things like that well he is later 75 percent of my cells was homegrown marijuana instead of a hundred percent a contraband that meant that the money that went to Morocco and Afghanistan was getting less and the money that were being made by growing marijuana stayed in the Dutch economy though that was a very good thing coffee shops they either just magically get their weed I guess if you're see no evil hear no evil or the reality is the coffee shops thereby have to be supported by so-called criminals because essentially anyone who cultivates cannabis indoors or on a commercial scale is a criminal you know I'm not like saying we are the example for the world or whatever but we bring in 400 million euros in Texas every year and I think that all the European countries especially the countries in crisis should benefit by legalizing marijuana that unique growers you need people in outlets whatever outlets to sell it so it employs a lot of people and it brings in tax money why don't you legalize it and tax it like in California it was bankrupt and they're coming back alive because they allowed growing of Mariano in Texas what's your relationship like with me and my dad had a very kind of strange relationship at the moment I mean for a few years we were quite close and we did speak to each other quite a lot but but more recently since I've been more involved with the Canada stuff he's kind of step back a little bit and doesn't really doesn't really like or approve of what I do I mean I honestly thought it to be brutally honest when it came to me being diagnosed with MS he wasn't there for me you didn't see how bad I was he didn't see the fact that I needed a wheelchair to the to my hospital appointments he didn't see me not being able to like get to the toilet whatever he's called me a day druggie before and that cut deep so since that I don't even know if he realizes how much that hurt me since he called me that I've kind of liked being a bit switched off towards him as well I got back from California and I had a little booklet called multiple sclerosis and medical marijuana so I tried to get him to read that just wasn't wouldn't have any a bit like my sister's like had completely turned off to the art to it as well like you know they go you know that's all you ever want to talk about it's like well this because my it's my life what else can I talk about when my entire life is actually changed by this plan you expect me to not talk about that you expect me to be quiet about that and it frankly the fact that they don't believe me just shows how little respect they have for me because if they actually respected my opinion maybe they go or hang in a minute if he's putting his entire life into this maybe there might be something in it maybe we should trust him maybe his blood maybe his family and maybe we should actually look into it at least because I miss my family I miss them I want them to support me in what I'm doing I'm still Harper on the political liaison for normal UK we've been here having our annual AGM so if the past couple of days what we've been doing is we've arranged for people to travel from all over the UK and what we've been doing is even having discussions about the various types of issues that are involved in the cannabis community saying the last twelve months we've had quite a bit of progress and we've we've getting a bit of more information out there and we did manage to gain quite a lot of local media coverage protests picnic protests that we held across the country we had about 13 of them and all of them going the local newspapers some have got on the radio one of one or two we've got on the TV that gave us the opportunity to engage with the authorities and get them like to understand you know we're here we're not actually just a bunch of stoners misfits that you think we are so we've been talking about medical news we've been talking about underage use we've been talking about cannabis social clubs and then what the best way is to set those social clubs up within the UK over the course of the next year before next year's AGM what we intend to do is to have at least 10 registered clubs that are active in their local communities what we'd be aiming to do over the course of the next year be to help those clubs to grow their numbers to help other clubs that just want to be involved digitally because there's about 60 UK CSC clubs at the moment so the idea is to be to give people help and aid not in breaking the law being helping them set up a club yeah it's been very useful we're always is to be able to talk to our members and our affiliates and it enables people from all different walks of life medical users who aren't normally able to leave their house or people that have particular medical conditions to come together in a friendly environment and to not only talk about cannabis but also in the case of a lot of the medical users being able to use it free from worry about harassment from the police or any of the authorities they lived here with my mum and Richard my stepfather when I was growing up it is a quite historic part of reading and during the Industrial Revolution it was a big brick and tile factory and it was one of the things that reading was most well-known for bricks beer and and the other be what's the other be biscuits this is the house here like yeah that's obviously the garage where Richard used to medicate I know that he he was medicating a long time before I actually realized or caught him or found out or anything like that and then eventually he got really bad and stuff you know he had progressive MS it just constantly goes down and downhill you know he was drip fed he could barely talk like it was a point is it you know it was horrible it was horrible cannabis was a big thing in his life because I mean it got to the point where you can really use his hands and the water couldn't roll for himself and I can remember I used to I used to pick up and they'd come like pre-rolled so he'd get like a bag of like 50 joints or whatever and whoever it was I don't know who but there was someone around this area who was helping him and they would roll them all for him before before they gave it to him and stuff like that so they never complained he never was was by oh [ __ ] my life he was never like oh we don't want to be here I don't want to be alive what can i what how can I print it words like how amazing he was and how much I've been impacted I don't know like I can't cuz it's I would've be me if it wasn't him the strength that rich has shown in his determination is a definitely a major reason why I feel I have to stay in the UK because he didn't give up so I feel like is it's not my time to give up I would love to move to Barcelona inevitably if I was in Barcelona I would have a much better quality of life I would be able to socialize a lot more I'd be able to have access to the medicine that I need and then with that full access to the medicine I need I think I would be able to have a job in the industry so I know Richard would be proud and they would be proud and they would this is now my new home say Brian I guess the main thing that I've been up to has been the launch of the United patients Alliance medical cannabis event tonight medicinal cannabis event with Caroline Lucas medical cannabis event Caroline Lucas tonight well tonight is the United patients Alliance launch night and I'm just out in the daytime trying to fire get a few more people down to the event our aims are to raise awareness of the medical benefits of cannabis and our goals are to raise that awareness both in the public and political spheres so that's the main goal and we really feel that once the evidence is raised and talked about it's inevitable that things will change so that's that's what we're doing with her from the United patients Alliance medical cannabis event medical cannabis event tonight so long now what's the time mahai is racing [Music] Sophie [Music] yeah just rushing about just trying to make sure obviously we are here to talk about a very serious issue an issue was really affects a lot of people a lot of people's life so tonight we really like to bring you the story then around August 2 a my doctor told me I end stage liver cancer with approximately three months to live he put me on a transplant list and in November two I received a liver transplant in the end they gave up and send me home to die with a large bag of morphine my wife Tina she helped me when I was scared she soothed me in the middle of the night when I was wracked with pain administered more drugs because my hands were shaking too much through the haze I could see very little and prayed now that I would die to end this suffering I managed to find some oil through some fluke or other and began taking on the 25th of April 2013 I began to sleep any better and after three days I stopped taking the morphine a couple of months later I thought I was cold enough blood okay someone went and bought me a microscope and software package to go with it but in hooked up to the computer although it's on to the screen and basement I photograph what I saw and with the aid of a software I was able to search and see what it was people simply contain this criminals for using a drug that's been used in the thousands of years and has proved his healing power is not just wrong this is preach about human rights and we will change the laws that's why the United patients Alliance was formed to give people a voice so they stand under that one banner and heard [Applause] [Music] [Music] it's not allowing access to this medicine to people that need it it's something that makes me very very angry this was the area that I feel most passionate about so they're all I've been given at UPA as political director I mean I think you do have to be conscious a lot of activists they feel obviously they've got one thing on their mind which is whatever they're activists about and therefore they've got 100% of their focus on on their side of a story whereas obviously a politician an MP has got everybody within their constituency that they have to listen to and they have to they have to be open to listen to all sides of an argument and it pays to be conscious of that came across a site called first time in prison calm which is kind of useful and gave you an idea of there's the sort of things they tell you that you can have and then there's a sort of things that you actually really need and I mean stuff like the pen and paper so that you can write letters I've been feeling increasingly ambivalent for the last last four or five days I'm finding myself actually in one of three states of mind that I'm either in a devil-may-care let's enjoy this experience and find out what will happen sort of view another one where I'm trying to think rationally realizing but this is a very very very very serious couple of days in the future of my life and I could lose my freedom and and that causes me a lot of emotions including anger but then I think about not being with my daughter for a while and I think about that and and I I can very very easily slip into being rather upset about it oh hello sweetheart it's lovely to see you how you doing darling well you've been up to today okay you were just joking that's alright thanks there was so much for calling darling love you now that so many people remind me you know remember you have a 9 year old daughter and without a shadow of a doubt it is absolutely the primary concern in my mind but alongside thee am I gonna get locked up for six months is do I really want to teach my daughter the lesson of do as you're told even if you think something is wrong I have to incorporate an element of no I want to teach my daughter that it's okay to stand up for what you believe in for me to capitulate and stand up in a court and say sorry and and illustrate that to my daughter just not a lesson I want to teach I want to teach her that actually when there's an unjust law that there are ways that you can stand up and be counted and try to make changes and try to make the world a better place that's as important as me actually being ever present I've never really been a hemp festival in the UK so product earth they decided that they were going to take on the challenge day but this really amazing show together it's a very good example and a very good cross-section of what the industry has got to offer live music outside businesses and companies from around the UK and Europe exhibiting order of their product a lot of people have come in and said whoa it's like spannabis like the visit in the UK so it's better the point about this is these are all cannabis related businesses not doing anything in lieu you're look at America what has been outer driving board its businesses getting behind it and turn it into a legitimate business that people paying tax on and this is all the fringe of the things that are involved with the cannabis culture and it brings all the people that are interested in in these things and in cannabis together all in the same place at the same time it's a unification event at the end of the day isn't it people are happy and impressed with what's going on in activism because they're prepared to pay their businesses and their reputations on the line to a host and event that is progressing our movement forward [Music] it's it's fantastic we're here we're all getting on with it anyway and we're all agreed to work together which is really nice as well and the more of that the better really I think that's that's something that we we really need to be working together as a community we need to get this sorted out we need the law has changed for everyone how do we you can take upon where it is now how do we take this enthusiasm and turn it into something that is gonna benefit us and the rest of society at the same time I think it's been a really quite a big struggle to get things going on over here and I found a know we're difficult at times so keep keep the momentum going because it is hard to sort of like keep pushing away and plugging the same things constantly because if people aren't seeing that progress like as fast as they want to see it they can lose interest and that's that can be disheartening the our movement has made a reach through the rest of society I'm seeing it now and all these little groups that contacted me two or three years ago I'm interested in doing it they started up the little page but now they've got a whole group of people that are turn up to events all around the country that's a huge change that is an actual progress and to be part of it is something special and for me it's really encouraging it makes me realise that he is worth it when you see things like that are we making a difference you know other people who are interested in reform having an impact the answer that is quite clearly yes but until everybody who uses cannabis stands up and wants to make a change then I think we're going to struggle we need everybody right into their MP every single week and you keep doing it every single week but we need to turn cannabis legalization into an election issue because at the moment they just don't think it is an issue and if they can get away with not talking about it they will I would argue that cannabis is the oldest medicine in the world it was a medicine in this country of course until 1971 when the Parliament decided to stop it being a medicine there no venca okay how can MP's decide what's a medicine or not you can't leave decisions about medicines do politicians who were clearly in the process of getting reelected cannabis users are always gonna use cannabis you're never gonna stop that you know our laws clearly shown that prohibition does not prevent people from wanting to use cannabis what we need to do we need to make using cannabis as safe as possible currently under prohibition there is no regulation you know we don't know what people are smoking we don't know what people are buying with a controlled and regulated market there is an opportunity to tax that market so do you have regulated licensed production paying taxes and those taxes could either be earmarked for specific benefits to the community or obviously just go into the Exchequer [Music] [Music] making cannabis the medicine is dead straightforward oh I used to happen is the Home Secretary she needs to write a letter to Parliament saying I have decided on the balance of evidence that cannabis has legitimate medical uses therefore it should be a schedule 2 drug instead of the schedule 1 and once they do that doctors can prescribe it job done that's all it takes one letter from the Home Secretary the disability care center downstairs who know that I have MS have made a complaint against me about the smell of cannabis so I've just basically been threatened with eviction from my home for the smell of cannabis what you've been through today is something that is something that you have to think about it's something that you have to deal with and it just adds that extra level of stress they just don't need I don't need this like I haven't I have a hard enough time just purely dealing with the fact that I'm inspired to be in the prime of my life and I'm oh I'm all the time well now I feel completely uncomfortable in my own home [Music] let's be frank I don't have access to the amount of cannabis that I need why I need a lot I need so much that it's just impossible for me to get it and afford it or or you know I just can't get it here it's infuriating because if I was in a place like California if I was in a place like Colorado if I was in a place like Barcelona if I was in a place like Amsterdam all these places are thin I could get it and I could have the amount that I need hello how's it going I'm Clark a founding member of the UPA and I am a medical cannabis patient I want it I need it and I need it now but I can't wait I can't wait for the law to change I can't wait for the government to suddenly realize that they shouldn't be looking at the evidence and change their minds I can't wait for that I need it now this is my life if anyone wants to donate for the running of the room that would be awesome yes so my dad's came down to Brighton to visit me about a couple of weeks ago now and we had we had a conversation about cannabis and about the past and about the things that he has said to me previously and he basically said I'm I'm really sorry and he said he said that he was really proud of me and they understood why yeah why I do why do yeah hi I'm mark obviously I am Clark's father from Clark's point of view I totally understand why to give him a day to die I don't today life sometimes I'll define our relationship quite distant and I have tried to connect more with him more so probably recently but I still I do fine at times it is it is it can be difficult because of that barrier between the right you're not a legal side and then the an illegal side it flashes out to California couple years ago now you know that Clark went back to the Golden Gate Bridge well I know you went back there to America yes I do know why I don't like boy he went with me which he won't vote post No I'm just pretty bad it's a great cruise that we need it making the impossible possible I'm proud of him because I am I told him that the word challenge isn't the right word he's he's done something for his self own self-esteem and he wanted to do that to prove it to himself yeah to prove it to himself that he's worth more he's a human being to be stigmatized by my own family it wasn't nice it wasn't Pleasant and it put a real barrier between me having a relationship with my family they have a breakthrough moment really I can convince my dad to convince anyone that's a really positive thing that's happened a really positive thing and a really positive change like something that I don't need to worry about anymore one thing that I contemplate a lot is what would you do like given my situation given my position given the fact that you know you know that cannabis helps you give what would you actually do bike would you stand there and do nothing would you or would you stand up and get your voice heard would you be stigmatized and be marginalized and accept it would you say no no I'm not going to have this no I'm gonna stand up and I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get to where I need to be to look after myself what would you do because that's a choice I get given every day they would choose my help would do I choose the law I have to choose my health I have to fight against the law that's not what I want to do I want to choose my house and be healing myself and have my energy and my focus on that healing but I'm forced to fight for my right to just be myself so what would you do if you were me what would you do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "zyrq11rNcL4": "so Perry if I have severe back pain what cannabis products should I consider using well it's interesting each the statistics are 70 to 80 percent of the US population at one point in time is going to have back pain fruit for whatever reason whether it's a compression of your discs nerve roots bone sticking on there so there's lots of different ways to approach this the first one of course is topical because if you want to put something directly on your back either as an ointment or as a patch to be able to put on there that's probably the first thing I would try of course you have to remember with an ointment it's not going to get absorbed deeply into the tissues to be shown in a urine sample with you have to test for THC a patch might be because it's just most none of it gets evaporated all of it gets absorbed into the system again a combination of a THC CBD type of ointment or patch on the back is one way to go another way to go quite interestingly is a product rectal suppository of cannabis by company forea makes a suppository that really is used primarily for women having a pain during their menses however it seems to help some people with back pain because it's in I guess the general area of the spine and it has 60 60 milligrams of THC and 10 milligrams of CBD the interesting thing about that product I've actually taken it for back pain it actually did help me and my lower back pain is that you don't experience the the psychoactive high even though it is 60 milligrams it's true most people seem to get the effect that it doesn't affect them that way however that being said it has been said that it does show up in a tox screen if someone urine a state THC is going to be shown in there of course that's a lot of THC and obviously the the next way way you might go is actually vaping or smoking a marijuana strain correct correct and that way that would be another way to help relieve pain in general whether it's your back or pain in any other part of your body but you know a back pain is interesting because it'll work to a degree however there is some physical problems with your back that no matter the amount of cannabis you take you actually main something else done like surgery at some point in time if you have an actual impingement on your back from a piece of bone sticking on there so if the pain continues and you start getting terrible numbness etc it's probably best at some point in time to get evaluated by a physician about that obviously and then anecdotally I find it interesting that we have heard from so many people here at home MD who've been in auto accidents where they've had surgeries and they've gone through all of the diagnosis and they still have major back pain or nerve pain and it seems that a lot of the people have said that smoking marijuana on a daily basis has helped them live a healthier life and get off of opioid wait well that's a whole really you know pain getting off your opioids is a whole other issue having to do with cannabis and yes kind of seems to help people decrease their opioid use if they had been taking opioids and take their place of that and help them with their pain for sure mm well that's great thank you so much you're welcome you", "NLRgAVod3kQ": "well it's about that time again time for another spin of the bangle of buds here we got two delta nines on here we got the palmetto under the other shred the tropic

apple to it maybe here we go let's see come on delta nine impress me so close delta nine is there any more in there fuck it's just underweight by 0.01 wait a minute did it get over no it didn't i thought it did but that was just the air no so it's just under it's as small of just under as you can possibly be there we go look there's a couple little scraps in there little bits and we got these four tiny ones this small one that's medium one and this other medium one wow does it ever look nice though look at that look at the cool purples and all that stuff and i can't wait to check this out with a microscope very cool anyways let's check it out with a microscope so this is the outside of the apple fritter and it is nice looking very nice looking it's almost got a nice glaze on it like an actual apple fritter a donut which i love um [Music] [Laughter] it looks really awesome i love the purple man that looks so cool that almost looks like a black leaf right there might be like black mamba or something that's one another one of my favorite strains black mamba i was had that long time ago so good yes here we go some more close-ups here of uh these things see there's like they kind of look kind of old all crinkly and stuff but you know whatever it smells nice this stuff so um delta nine's been around for a long time it just recently showed up in ontario so the weed here is probably not super new it's probably just packaged recently who knows though it looks decent looks good yeah so maybe i'll break open this one here and uh we'll we'll see what it looks like and um we'll see what it looks like when i break it open here we go wow nice hard hard nuggets so here's a look inside these things looking pretty good look at that look at all the tricoms they're clear mostly on the inside some more looks so cool looks so cool look at that wow there we go got some nice close-ups here on these guys oh my god look at these guys look at that that's so cool looking yeah the inside mostly clear the outside mostly cloudy very nice looking very nice smelling so awesome anyways i'm gonna go and try this out now i can't wait i love apple fritters and i've been waiting so long for this delta nine stuff to show up so i'm gonna go check this out and i'll be right back so i just got in from this delta nine apple fritter at 20 what was it 21.46 percent and um i can't believe it but this stuff actually does taste like apples or have like an apple sort of taste to it um it's kind of like i couldn't figure out what type of apple it was either i was like i was kind of leaning towards granny smith but at the same time it's a little different it doesn't have that same little sourness to it or whatever but um it kind of reminds me of like apples but also at the same time apple trees it's kind of like the smell that you have uh when you're uh in an apple orchard picking apples so i'm just freaking crazy that it tastes like apples i can't believe it i didn't quite get the fritter but i got the apple part yeah anyways wow impressive taste as for the high on here though it says 21.46 but it sure doesn't feel like it's quite a low sort of between low and medium the high on here it's a little disappointing in that area so the buds are real nice they're like really super hard see [Laughter] and they uh they sure look nice this one here in that one breaks up decent and uh yeah it's not overly dry it's not wet it's not super dry it's good but at the same time high is just a little disappointing so i don't know i think i might if would i buy this again probably not but um i'm not saying it's bad because i i've i'm really impressed by the taste uh it's just that it doesn't quite get where i want to go it's not powerful enough for what i want which is unfortunate because i wish it was if it was i would buy this a lot because the taste is so cool and it looks so nice it's just too light for me anyways what is there like three more things on the uh the bangle of buds so come check it out there if you want uh hit the subscribe button and the notification bell and they'll send you a message when the next video comes up and that's it for now so

to the legislative process but before the hearing on wednesday governor pete ricketts would tell anybody that would listen the medical pot is a bad idea so this is a dangerous drug that will impact our kids if you legalize marijuana you're going to kill your kids that's what the data shows from around the country those are strong words coming from governor pete ricketts a longtime vocal advocate against cannabis he'd want to back up in his opposition including former husker head coach tom osborne one key argument made is that the fda has not approved it and it's still a schedule one drug there will be examples of various types of illness that people will make claims but the fda has not made that claim and i think that should carry some weight osborne reflected on his own player's pot use when he coached the huskers saying he was forced to dismiss some who couldn't kick the drug others like former senator john keane say calling pop medicine is ridiculous nobody pulls a beer out of a six pack at the end of a long stressful day and calls it medicinal budweiser however the similar type of logical disorientation applies when we label marijuana but downstairs in the hearing room parents of children with debilitating diseases like epilepsy say marijuana is exactly the medicine their child needs including krista eggers his name is colton consistently suffers from seizures what you cannot see is the damage being done to his little brain these repeated seizures are damaging and killing my child the bill is not as broad as some advocates may like a nebraskan can get marijuana if they have a written certification from a doctor for any illness a medical professional deems appropriate they'd have to renew it every 90 days it also bars pot from being smoked or eaten in food instead it would need to be used in a tincture oil or a pill in a bit of dichotomy one of tom osborne's former players grant wistrom spoke in the hearing it's a port of passing the law thank you going against his former coach i started medicating with marijuana early in my nfl career i noticed that if i consumed marijuana after games i slept better felt more recovered dealt with less pain and was able to begin to prepare to play again more quickly than without it senator anna wishart who's been passionately pushing the bill for years says there would be only one reason it fails fails to pass it is because of political pressure from a few who wield their power to stamp out the will of the people after the hearing i spoke with a parent who's seeking medicinal marijuana for her child she told me that she was insulted the governor ricketts would insinuate that marijuana kills kids reporting in lincoln john kepper 3 news now", "RLlkrP77mls": "[MUSIC]", "lJQWfTPBSEA": "good morning this is dr dr patrick live and this morning we're going to talk about something that's highly controversial because here's what we know people who choose to use cannabis right are advocates of it anytime there's anything negative about it they slam it they attack it they you know they have their point of view and and i understand that right because for so long they've been ridiculed attacked and the research just is in its orphan stages right it's just sort of beginning infant stages and so there's not a lot of research to back up what it is you're doing then there's the people that believe there's no purpose to it right it's illegal it should be high classified drug there should be nothing about it right and then there's this middle group that tries to say what's the research right what can we prove what do we know so i kind of fall in the middle right i'm not an advocate and i'm not an opponent i'm somebody that wants to know look if there is research that can help somebody then we should be helping somebody so there is research right whether it's about cannabis or cbd oil right there are some uses for it right and you know i've done a couple of videos on that but today we're going to talk about one of the dangers you know back you know i'm 55 right so when i was in high school and people used cannabis right there was no way you could get addicted to it it the the thc levels were so low right that there wouldn't be a lot of permanent potential damage but through time right people have learned to raise the level of the thc and the thc levels now are you know through the roof it's much more potent as a result in the state of colorado there's people who have od'd on marijuana right on cannabis and people would say that's impossible but they did it primarily by using edibles they ate too much because with an edible right there's a delay before it gets kicked in and then it kicked in and it kind of slowed them down and they just died right and that's documented so it is possible right that that is there well that alone right says okay something has changed about cannabis right but as bad as that is and that could be bad right there's another thing that's starting to show its ugly head so a few years ago right i had this client come into my office and they were basically hallucinating all the time right everything was fine except everywhere they looked they would see spiders and they would feel spiders and see them on themself when they did the research and tried tracing back all the stuff that had happened they realized that she had used cannabis and for whatever reason it had created this psychotic break in her mind and now she was dealing with the psychosis and it was ongoing right it wouldn't end right and so we had to help her kind of process through that i had a 13 year old right who had an episode like that he had been smoking and then all of a sudden had the psychotic break right and now he had the psychosis and he was doing things seeing things that weren't there there was a guy that was walking down the highway right and he was naked and he was out of his mind and he had been smoking and he had been smoking for a long time but this particular day it kicked in and now he was in this psychotic episode so i see quite a few people right who used cannabis and some of them will swear like i've always used cannabis never had a problem then all of a sudden one day they do and so there's a diagnosis that they received called cannabis induced psychosis cannabis induced psychosis and what cannabis induced psychosis is is that because cannabis is in a hallucinogen right a lot of people when they use it will say they're more creative and all kinds of stuff because it does kind of open up that weird kind of part of your brain it can also kick into gear to things that we don't really want it can kick in psychosis and we don't know why we don't know who we just know some people will use it and experience the psychosis and it's not because of hey it's been watered down or there's another drug in it yeah that can be terrible but the thc itself can cause psychosis in some people we just don't know who we just know that some people will have it and then they have to deal with it if you've had the thc psychosis right that means you can't use thc at all ever again because now your brain is going to be going in that psychotic way right and some people don't like that fact but that's a reality so that's one aspect there's another aspect that within all of us are some aspect of the schizophrenia gene and for some people using thc will activate that gene and really move us from having a normal thinking pattern into schizophrenia and once you move into schizophrenia there is no moving back now your brain has permanently changed right so this cannabis induced psychosis can lead even worse right to schizophrenia so you have to be aware that this is a possibility and so you have to be extremely careful and if you tip into that psychosis you have to understand you're done no more use that's just the way it is you can get online google read the research on it right it's becoming a bigger and bigger issue for a lot of people thc is a very potent drug right just like every drug even though it's natural right it's not natural in its state that it intentionally was right normally when in its natural state the thc levels weren't that high so we took a natural substance right and amped it up that's what we do right we destroy the goodness of a lot of things by creating um like lab versions right and so the lab version isn't it affects what the real product was so if you could go back in time right there would be no psychosis but now there is and you have to understand that is a real disorder so if you know somebody struggling with it right pass this video on to them educate them help them to understand there is a real disorder that's connected with cannabis you have to be careful so look if you have any questions put them in the comments we'll do our best to talk about it um if you think this video has helped you like it subscribe to the channel if you want to learn more we really talk about all kinds of issues affecting the brain some issues of faith even some issues of just like how do we get through life right and hopefully a little humor thrown in from time to time just as a break because sometimes that's just too heavy also you can check out our tick tock channel the tick tock is i don't know how many people viewers on it you know some it's just different short consents but it's there right it's also dr patrick live so and instagram as well so anyhow um more than anything remember that you have the power right to encourage another person so whatever you do right when you come in contact with another person seek to encourage and uplift them because together we truly can change the world so hey peace duck out", "2RMNuglsUAc": "[Music] it's a weekday afternoon in Los Angeles the epicenter of cannabis in the United States this busy dispensary is open for business but if everything looks normal it isn't this is in fact an unlicensed illegal dispensary part of the booming black market in California and around the country it's what the cannabis industry says could be the biggest threat to sky-high expected revenues Aysen Point California early projections of more than 1 billion dollars in annual cannabis tax receipts in 2018 are far from the three hundred forty five million dollars collected that's in large part because the illegal market can easily undercut the costs of running licensed dispensaries it's not hard to see how a team of CNBC producers equipped with hidden cameras visited ten illegal dispensaries throughout LA most aren't hard to find and they're open day and night some have signs others do not but they all have one thing in common they are brazenly breaking the law operating with no license selling potentially untested products and allowing customers to openly consume in this illegal dispensary down the street from the University of Southern California customers are dabbing smoking a highly potent cannabis concentrate and if you want free weed this store and others are happy to give it away as a sign say all you need to do is write a positive review on weed maps an online site that lists both legal and illegal dispensaries around the country [Applause] [Music] despite a daily limit on the amount of cannabis stores can sell to a customer you can buy as much as you want at many of the illegal dispensaries we can get as much as the black market has a huge problem in some states it's 70 to 80 percent of sales and it's a big threat and so a lot of states are thinking about how do we alleviate it the two things is price and convenience attorney Patricia here is the founder of cannabis law digest taking a lot of the profits away from operators and therefore from the tax revenue from a party in Toronto to Miami and New York City the tone is decidedly upbeat at cannabis conferences that optimism faces this reality an estimated 70 billion dollars in illegal marijuana sales nationally 7 times the legal market and know where our legal operators feeling the impact more than in California the country's largest legal cannabis market where voters passed Proposition 64 in 2016 businesses had to be in compliance with a license by January but as we found that clearly didn't happen we found illegal store after store selling cannabis at deeply discounted prices the parking lot is almost full as our producers enter this dispensary that openly advertises on the side of the building thank you we can go in this regular customer says he's a student at nearby USC at another location CNBC producers walk inside our asked for their IDs then our buzzed in a clerk offers a first-timer deal on a popular product called gelato there are more customers dabbing something our producers were told as common in illegal dispensaries elsewhere there are more perks at the illegal stores and easy to see why they are thriving with all the discounts offered we do not buy anything from the dispensaries this store is open past the state-mandated closing time of 10:00 p.m. another convenience for black market sales we showed a compilation of our video to Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer any surprises to you no I know that there are lawful dispensaries operating in the city it might be that some of the locations you just showed me are under investigation right now how big of a problem is this it's a very significant problem and from a public health and safety standpoint it's especially crucial that buyers of cannabis only go to the licensed shops and yet we see a number of illegal dispensaries opening up because the profit motive is so significant an illegal store can rake in ten to twenty thousand dollars a day authorities say so far 151 illegal dispensaries have been shut down with more criminal prosecutions pending is this different or worse than going after the guy in the corner selling weed before legalization oh no it's it's qualitatively different the amounts of money at stake are much more significant for example turning off utilities is a routine tactic as seen in this video shot by a witness during a recent raid at this illegal store in East LA the location was permanently closed but just over half the stores reopen within a week according to police on weed maps we found listings for 229 illegal dispensaries the Los Angeles Police Department puts that number even higher at 259 but no one knows exactly how many are in business there are just 186 licensed dispensaries in LA weed maps was hit with a cease and desist letter from the state of California last year for aiding and abetting in violations of state cannabis laws because it allows unlicensed businesses to advertise weed maps told CNBC it provides patients and consumers with valuable information about all things cannabis and businesses can post their own listings the company says targeting online platforms won't solve the unlicensed dispensary problem in California the danger in these illegal stores is potentially unregulated products like these sold to unsuspecting customers illegal dispensaries are required to sell regulated products which are tested the City Attorney's Office has attacked the problem with a recent civil complaint seeking millions in damages from one illegal dispensary and we've alleged in our complaint that the product contained a toxin something that is used as a pesticide on golf courses this is exactly why legal store owners like Cameron Wald executive vice president of project cannabis is outraged at how bold the black market has become we're facing especially in California and in LA specifically an illicit market that is extremely strong we're outnumbered three to one illicit operator to legal operator so you know we have outrageous price compression that we have to see at our stores how much easier do you think it is to operate as an illegal dispensary compared to what you go through it's a lot easier they have no compliance standards they had no permitting process they had no documentation no no legal process that they had to go through so they're breaking the law potentially threatening the health of consumers and they're threatening your business correct and they're doing this in plain sight in plain sight an illegal dispensary Walt says can charge close to forty percent less than project cannabis which has four locations in LA and must pay cannabis excise and sales taxes well thank you none of the illegal dispensaries we visited responded to our request for comment which isn't a surprise to david welch an LA based attorney who represents the cannabis industry California is the largest market in the world just based on population and consumption rates they are unable to actually realize the profits that people anticipate they're going to make because you have such a large illegal market statewide California's Bureau of cannabis control has issued more than 3900 cease and desist letters to illegal dispensaries and delivery services compare that to a total of 939 legal retailers what you find are dispensaries are not being enforced against even when they're enforced against they simply go and they open up the next day because the penalties are so low it doesn't dissuade them from violating the law and as we found in all the dispensaries in which our cameras captured illegal activity it appears the boom in the black market in cannabis isn't going away anytime soon", "D_4Ey_W7Q48": "MANY USERS SAY IT WORKS WONDERS AND SOME DOCTORS REMAIN WORKS WONDERS AND

You may have noticed that the\nnational conversation around weed is changing, and the beauty\nindustry in particular is abuzz with excitement around a particular\ningredient called Cannabidiol, or CBD, the non-psychoactive\ncomponent of the cannabis plant derived from the stalks and stems of hemp. Thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties,\nbrands have been infusing this stuff in anything from salves,\nto lotions, to facial serums, touting its ability to\nsoothe aches and pains and treat skin conditions like acne,\neczema, and even wrinkles. I have been absolutely inundated with\nemails around CBD-infused everything and now I have tried my\nfair share of CBD products, some that I love and some\nthat I don't love as much. But when I found out that\nHungarian facialist, Ildi Pekar launched a CBD facial,\nI knew I had to give it a go. I tried it out, obviously, and spoiler alert:\nit was the most relaxing facial I've ever gotten. But before we get into the nitty gritty, make sure you are subscribed down below Beauty With Mi comes out every Monday at 11 AM. I've done a few stories on CBD in the past,\nbut I wanted to learn from Ildi herself who's been using the ingredient for years. When I got to Ildi's spa\nhere in New York City, we immediately sat down to talk shop. So, I want to ask you all about CBD because obviously I am going to be\ngetting your CBD facial today. So, CBD is a great ingredient,\nCBD is not new, it's been in the market forever. They used them in the '30s,\n'40s for medication. CBD is made for anti-inflammation, so pretty much\neverybody has inflammation and it doesn't matter if it shows\nup in your skin or shows up in your head. So, taking it or putting it on\nyour skin, it has a lot of benefits. You know, a lot of people think\nabout CBD is it's a drug. CBD doesn't necessarily have THC anymore. If you're looking for a CBD product,\nwhat's a good little threshold of how much CBD you should be\nlooking for in a product for it to be working. I recommend to do research on the company. There is, I think there's\na lot of companies that they don't extract the\nplant the right way. They come in different strengths,\nI'm sure you saw 50 milligrams, 250, 500. There's a lot of information\nout there and it's confusing to know how much you should be using. Very confusing, so being just\naround 250, max 500 is fine. If you have kind of chronic illness,\nyou could go above 500. So, I'm about to get your CBD facial. You should feel really, really relaxed,\nyou should feel really calm, you're gonna be a very good\nperson to be around today. Not that I'm ever bad to be\naround any other time, right? They're not saying anything. They're not saying anything, yeah. Once I was clear on what to expect,\nit was time to start the treatment, which Ildi described as more of a full\nbody experience rather than a facial thanks to CBD's ability to\nsoothe and relax muscles. Unlike most treatments, Ildi started\noff by giving me a gentle massage using her CBD-infused massage oil. Then she gave me an optional tincture which Ildi created to allow\nher customers to ingest CBD orally. Wow, that tastes really good. Tastes good? It doesn't taste like bitter at all and I've tried other ones before. Stevia takes that bitterness away,\nso it's easier to swallow it. Then we got to the facial portion\nwhich was pretty standard Ildi started with a gentle cleanse\nand then a nice chemical peel. Once my skin was all exfoliated,\nthough, that's when things got a little weird. Ildi brought out an electrostatic\npolarization machine, handed me this like\nmetallic rod that was meant to ground the electricity in my body, put on these like white glove\nthings and started massaging my body using electricity. The device is designed to send vibrations\nthrough your skin and muscles to improve circulation,\nsoothe muscles, and drain lymph. It felt really strange,\nit didn't hurt at all. I will say, I was nervous\nthat it was gonna hurt. She handed me the metal rod and I was like,\n\"Oh man, this is gonna shock me.\" It didn't at all, it\nactually was super relaxing, a very gentle massage through my body. I just felt vibrations all over and it was a very zen experience. Once Ildi had done a full pass\non my neck, arms, and face, she did a little bit of LED therapy\nand brought out the big gun. Ildi applied a CBD-infused\nmask all over my face and then used oxygenating machine,\nwhich uses negative ion therapy to do everything from relax\nto balance your skin's pH. Now this machine was super weird,\nand it was probably the machine that I was most excited about. It looks like a space helmet. She took this big plastic bubble,\nput it over my face, and told me that it was gonna be pumping oxygen in,\nI was gonna be super relaxed, and I might even have to\nfight the urge to sleep. Once I was in the cocoon,\nshe put on the vibrating gloves again, massaged me more, and I fell into this really deep, beautiful nap. Now I know that I fall asleep in pretty\nmuch every facial that I ever get, but this one was different. It was the most relaxing\nsleep I've ever had in a facial even like in massages. It's really hard to describe because Ildi basically predicted everything that\nI would feel before I felt it. She was like, \"You're gonna feel\nlike you're floating in the bubble, you're gonna feel like your\neyelids are getting heavier, you're gonna start-\nyour speech is gonna get slower.\" She turned on this beautiful\nmusic and the massage was so nice and then, I mean, I started snoring,\nwhich I don't think I do. I've asked my boyfriend many times,\nand he says I don't snore so. But anyway, I woke up after 30 minutes feeling so rested. It was just a really nice way to wake up. It was nice I mean, I don't know. Then Ildi put on some of her skincare just to protect my skin and moisturize, and told me to drink a lot of\nwater, and sent me on my way. I totally agree with Ildi when\nshe says that this facial is more of a full body treatment\nthan it is a true facial. Sure, my skin was definitely\nless puffy, less red, more even after I emerged from the cocoon. But it really was the deep\nsleep and the relaxation, the muscle work that she did\nthat made it so unique to me. Sadly, though, CBD is\nan expensive ingredient. Ildi's facial is not cheap at $400. While it is legal to sell CBD,\napart from making sure that there are appropriate levels\nof THC in the CBD itself, the stuff is largely unregulated. And there's obviously\na huge placebo effect that can happen when you're\nusing products like this. That being said, though,\nthere's a reason why so many people use CBD for everything\nfrom sleeping disorders, to period cramps, to eczema. There's still a long way to\ngo when it comes to CBD in beauty, but it is still an exciting field nonetheless.

Bye!", "qqvJOAV7oAc": "it was 2012 at the age of 12 that you then became one of a very very exclusive club one that you never want to get into one in seven billion five people on the planet have Langerhans cell sarcoma what's that there's not a lot of research into it so I'm not too sure on what it is it's it's very confusing yeah so that should treatment you were facing that the doctors recommended was a bone-marrow transplant yeah it was extensive chemo radiotherapy and then yeah and then bone marrow transplant and you didn't have just one transplant this was three that you had to have and and how did you get on with that well they failed until the first free yeah they were not - it's not too trouble so it's not it's not a big problem to have and then after that this isn't as a mum because he then really began to suffer ya have to watch himself and how bad was it um well after the fourth transplant they told us that you know the first three had failed and and literally all they had was one more chance for him they had one more bag of his own cells no more they were there you know they'd stress the the the thing to us that there was no more chances after this and and unfortunately three days after he had his final transplant he tracked his fingers down side of the bed and then picked up some infections now obviously infections with no immune system whatsoever and no way for an immune system to even even start to build within his body he was literally being kept alive by antibiotics that's what they told us he did get incredibly ill throughout his whole treatment he'd been very happy and smiley and he'd always been tried to be quite jovial but actually those last those last couple of months are very very difficult he was in a lot of pain you would given I think three days three days a week at most is what they told me when I asked him the the timescale you planned your funeral haven't you yeah to what extent all of it we're gonna do it was gonna be fancy dress and I'd chosen all the costumes for people and it was gonna be quite embarrassing for some of the people though yeah who actually said you want you wanted to go yeah I did he was looking forward to it after four years of treatment it's enough enough was enough so this story then takes at him yeah entirely different turn how did that happen through lots of research I've done lots of research on to see when his secondary cancer arrived and it was so unknown I then said I turned to the internet inside looking and and over the over the following months and couple of years afterwards cannabis just kept popping up people kept emailing me you need to try this you need to nice if he hasn't got cancer you know the cancers have gone this is now a completely different issue it won't work for him is no but I would dismiss it and dismiss it and actually came to the point where I was in hospital with Darren and he was so incredibly ill and really on a high dose of morphine he was actually now on fentanyl which they can't go any further than that and it wasn't working against his hand and and the other issues he had with his stomach and I asked the doctor for bedrock on which is a cannabis based pain relief so it's available in Europe and because I've done I didn't you know I don't know I wanted to go through the proper measures and she actually told me we can't because it hasn't been licensed for children so you know and and more of it came out but people just kept saying and I thought you know what what to lose and you've got nothing nothing nothing to lose it that's dying anyway you know so they just rejoin your antibiotics at this point there was no other treatment so you took this yeah and you asked him and you said yeah yeah I was happy to what did you notice how quickly to think oh my god I mean I honestly do the effect of it blew my mind it wasn't what I expected all I expected too it's done live a research and some people use cannabis to kind of alleviate their anxiety and and some pain and that's what Devin was really experiencing on day 17 when they said there's definitely nothing in his bone marrow there's nothing there you've now just got to wait seven got very anxious and said well how much longer do I have to wait they started to trying up the morphine introduced sleeping tablets and so that's when I actually gave it and within half an hour's hours it administered under the tongue sublingually it's just a tincture it's it's it's not the oil that people talk about it was just a teenager then what we know it's within half an hour to an hour but he was just chilled out he just relaxed the anxiety stopped he no longer was panicking and he was able to just he was able to be compas mentis which he wasn't able to be on the belly always the health-wise I mean actually things being tested against you your white blood cells began to go up yeah after five days or C they told us nothing in his bone marrow so gave it to him five days later when the bandages came off his hand and we saw a healthy fingers which we were told there was no way they were under there when we saw a healthy finger see the doctor started panicking this was now based 75 after the transplant and he was then Tony be there for three three days yeah and nobody has ever engrafted after fifty days so day 75 and all of a sudden his white count has appeared the doctors start running around frantically doctors from Bristol Children's Hospital were called in to do some more blood tests which I said well there's no point you told me on your week ago there's nothing there and obviously in the blood count it was there it's very small but it was there and to test the theory you actually withdrew the cannabis after a little while and the blood count started to go down okay so where are you now how are you now perfectly healthy I'm glad you're normal you stress this is this is this doesn't work for everybody this is not a cure no this is something that worked for you and you could be prosecuted let's be honest well the under current laws in England the world's cannabis is not registered as having any therapeutic value anyone using the drug if medical reasons could be charged for possession possession carrying a maximum sentence of five years in jail or an unlimited fine fascinating story it was so happy that you're here and healthy

"hi there buds i'm back to try something for the very first time with you guys i feel like it's been so long since i've gotten to try something new in the weedy space like i've tried a lot of different vaporizers we've tried a bunch of different edibles but i've never tried a product like this before and i've always been curious about it so i finally decided today i was tired of smoking i was tired of dabbing we're gonna try a new way of getting stoned today and i saw this at the dispensary and was like i gotta have this like i have to have this it is a weedy patch like legitimately it's called a transdermal patch by mary medicinals and it has 20 milligrams of thc in it indica thc by the way i'm really excited about that and it's supposed to last like 12 hours which i'm really really excited to see will this actually give me an effect will i feel it for 12 hours like i'm really excited because i've tried topicals before but only cbd topicals i've never tried a thc based topical wait i take that back i did when i first moved to california and i first got my medical marijuana license i ordered some chapstick from a dispensary that just opened and it was her first batch of making this chapstick it didn't even have labels on it or anything and i was so excited to try it because legitimately every time i put it on and i would taste my lips i felt stoned i still have a little bit of the chapstick to this day because i use it so sparingly because i love it so much hold on let me show you guys this chapstick oh my god you guys this chapstick it looks so weedy it's like straight up green and it smells like straight up weed but when i tell you guys my lips get numb after this like it is so neat how effective this chapstick is so let's hope that this patch is equally as effective because i'm really excited about this i want to feel stoned without having to smoke for 12 hours you know when i picked this up at my local dispensary the bartender told me these were best after a long hot bath so i actually just got out of a hot bath and it's supposed to be put on a venus part of your body preferably the top of your foot or the inside of your wrist i think i'm going to use the inside of my wrist right here i mean that has a lot of veins on it and i feel like if it's going to be effective anywhere it should be effective on my wrist right the instructions say to clean the area thoroughly and allow to dry prior to application which obviously i've already done i just got out of the bath press the patch firmly onto the skin after removing the clear plastic lining the patch has a lasting effect of up to 12 hours and should be worn continuously well let's cut it open [Music] oh that's still not open dang i guess i have to cut it lower i'm trying to like not cut too deep into it because i don't know how large the patch is and i don't want to cut the patch you know why is this still not open i just have to cut down even further i'm like scared it doesn't seem like you should have to cut down this one okay okay got it open [Music] it smells like okay this is the weirdest smell ever like the fact that i'm going to call it this smell i hope that some of you guys out here know what this smell smells like do you guys know what bubble solution smells like like when you're blowing bubbles like with the bubble wand the solution that soapy solution that's exactly what this smells like like 2a tea it smells like kind of soapy kind of chemically i don't know when you open it up i guess this is the patch [Music] it's not super big at all which is probably a good thing so it'll fit on my wrists well i wonder if this is clear or i wonder if it's going to be opaque let's see basically you guys can see the patch is perforated right here and that's so that you can take off the clear plastic strips just like that right here and then i just place it onto my wrist and that's how it looks okay here's what i will say um i really wish that this patch was clear it's so weird that this patch is not clear like wouldn't it be so neat to just have like a clear patch right here and be able to get stones like the fact that it's an actual patch is kind of lame i'm not gonna lie because like who wants to have this white square like on their wrist and i know you could put it on the inside of you or on the top of your foot but i just feel like it's probably gonna be most effective on my wrist i don't know why i feel that i think it's just the most venous part of your body like i feel like this would be the best place to put something like this i might be wrong i'm not a medical doctor who knows at least i'm wearing a sweater and i can kind of cover it up and just go about my day like this and see if i get stoned i guess i'll be back in another i'm gonna give this an hour and a half to maybe two hours and then i'll come back and tell you guys how i feel and then i guess i'll continue to do check-ins throughout the day until we get to 12 hours jeez this is going to be a lot of check-ins but i'm genuinely curious if this actually is going to be effective for a full 12 hours because if it is this is really good for like a good bang for your buck as well as being a super healthy way to consume thc because you're not gonna have to smoke anything all right i'll be back in an hour and a half for two hours hi there buds honestly i didn't expect to be back this quick with an update but it's only been 30 minutes and i'm definitely feeling this patch i feel like overall just like a sense of like calm like i feel like extremely just like chill my body feels my body feels really relaxed sorry about that and overall i just feel good like i feel like i don't need to dab or smoke like i don't feel like super duper stoned yet maybe that will happen in a bit more time or maybe that won't happen at all because this is only 20 milligrams but if this is how it's gonna fill the entire time i really like this like it's super relaxing super chill definitely noticeable it's more of like a mood elevation and like my body feels really good than anything else it's like not like that super stoned intoxicated feeling at all like i feel like i could totally drive with this which probably probably aren't supposed to but i feel like i totally could like i don't feel intoxicated i just feel like slightly relaxed slightly sedated not anything like overwhelming but definitely noticeable i'll be back in another i'm gonna give it another two hours and see how i feel in that time um but overall i really like this the one thing that i will say is that i did sweat a little bit like when i first like was feeling the effects of this patch after about 20 minutes like i feel like i'm like sweating a bit more but aside from that i'm feeling really good so i'll give you guys an update in about three hours or two hours or so we'll see how it goes i'm feeling pretty chill this patch has me feeling pretty chill all right you guys it has been three hours with this patch on and let me tell you there are a few things that i've noticed that i like about this patch and there's a few things that i don't like about this patch mainly just one thing can you guess what it is um i didn't pick it up like when i first got this patch but just look at it what's wrong with this patch do you guys notice anything visually okay i didn't notice this on first inspection i thought that this patch was just like purely 100 white like a piece of paper it's not it's like caucasian skin color which i find to be just like slightly problematic okay so like if we're making a patch why are we only making it in a caucasian skin tone like it would be different if this was white like a sheet of paper but the fact that they did make this skin tone i just don't like that i personally find that to be really problematic and i just 100 percent don't like that if they're going to make a flesh-toned um patch then they need to make it in all skin tones because not just one skin tone should be able to have a patch be invisible in fact it should be clear like i said to begin with nicotine patches are clear i don't understand why this is not clear i've seen these in other brands and they were clear so i don't understand why theirs is just caucasian skin tone like i just i really don't understand that i just i just really don't like that i really really do not like that at all now when it comes to effectiveness it's actually feeling just as effective as it did 30 minutes into applying the patch and it's now three hours later so that's really good i think the only thing slightly weird that has happened since wearing this patch is that sometimes i feel like a really cool sensation from where the patch is like it feels like almost like a icy hot is there or something like that i don't know if that's just the medicine penetrating into your skin or if there's something in the patch that provides some type of tingling sensation but there is a slight tingling sensation and it's not there all the time it kind of comes and goes in waves which i find to be really weird i also noticed that this hand falls asleep way easier than normal like i cannot just leave it like sitting down normally or my hand starts to fall asleep actually this whole arm kind of feels like a little bit like it's asleep to be 100 honest and it's not just for me holding up my arm like this the sensation is not uncomfortable at all it feels fine and i still feel like nice relaxed i feel like it's taking the edge off if that makes sense it doesn't make me stone but it just makes me like have this overall sense of well-being like just calm which is really really nice to be 100 honest and i love that the patch has not moved like it kind of bends with my skin if you guys can see and it doesn't like come up it just bends with the skin it doesn't come off which is really nice i thought for sure it would come off or like start to peel up a bit um but adhesive seems to be really strong i'm curious to see how easy it will be to remove since it is staying on so well um but we are only three hours in so let's see if it holds up for the rest of the day and if it stays as effective as it is now and i guess i'll see you guys in another three hours and i'm back another three hours later i would say it's still just as effective as it was before just like this overwhelming sense of calm and well-being don't feel super stoned don't feel super intoxicated i do feel like it is still working and i'll be back in another three hours for the final update let's hope that this lasts all the way until i go to bed because i have another probably four hours with this so i'll be back in about four hours and i'm sorry if the lighting is bad now way later and i decided that i was filming on natural sunlight which means all my lights are like hacked away and i'm not gonna unpack them for one little clip so this works and i'll see you guys in another four showers alright so here we are 12 hours after putting on this thc hatch and i have to say that i still feel like it's just as effective as it was when i first started overall today i can honestly say i felt like this overall sense of like calm i haven't felt stony at all from this patch at all um but i have felt a little tired i will say it has made me a little bit lethargic it makes my hand continually fall asleep i kind of get a tingly feeling where the patches occasionally um it comes but yeah let's take off this patch and see if it's sticky if it comes off easy i'm just curious because it just stuck on very very well it's it's definitely pulling my skin i'm gonna try to i'm gonna pull it from the other side there we go so that you guys can get a good um oh oh it's pulling my hair oh no i gotta pull it from this side oh oh i broke it okay so you can't pull that hard or you will break the patch [Music] it's legitimately pulling up my skin it feels like [Music] oh my hair it's gotten like two arm hairs in it right there oh my god i feel like i'm waxing myself oh my god oh my god that was the most unpleasant thing ever it felt like putting on a fresh band-aid [Music] oh my god my arm like it has a mark on it from where it was i'm gonna have to get my other camera to get a close-up of this because this is like pretty drastic oh and it hurts like it really really hurts i can honestly say that was like on a pain scale of 10 being the highest and one being the lowest that was a nine that was a nine it really really hurt like still stinging and i really do feel like i'm gonna have a bruise like that let's just go over the entirety of this product and how i feel about it overall for 15 i would say it's highly worth it it was incredibly effective for the full 12 hours and i really did like the effect that it gave me like i would love to try additional brands of this i don't think i would repurchase this brand just because it is this caucasian skin color and i just i don't know i find that to be just i don't know i don't like it i don't like it i just wish it came in more skin tones or it was clear i really honestly would prefer this patch to be clear just keep skin tones out of it 100 completely and just make it a clear patch just like a nicotine patch um i also hate obviously the removal because that was absolutely painful and made any of the pleasant experience that i had all day from it go away because now i have this huge bruise on my arm that hurts and that was not relaxing or pleasant at all so it kind of negates the whole mellow vibe that i had going on and it was kind of like the worst thing to do right before bed because um i was feeling super mellow and good before with the patch on and now i'm like going to bed with a huge ass bruise on my arm which is just like not the five um but yeah overall mixed feelings about this product too i don't know what's going on with me am i becoming like a better reviewer because i'm getting to be more mixed like as far as like my opinions on things go i don't know if i'm just getting to be more critical or if i'm just like more detail-oriented i don't know but this was just like not it it just didn't feel like a medical grade product to be 100 honestly this just feels like plastic it rips really easily um and it feels like having a piece of like tape on your arm which i'm just not about and as you guys can see there are a few of my arm hairs in it which was also incredibly painful um to rip out of the follicle with this it felt like waxing and i wasn't trying to wax my arm um i know that you put this on the top of your foot like it said on the back of a package but i don't know i just felt like the wrist would be the most like um effective part and i'm glad that i did on the wrist because i had a good experience um other than the whipping it off part and the caucasian square on my arm all day um so yeah overall i'm just like this was a mixed review too and i'm sorry you guys i hate giving mixed reviews because it's like when i watch a review i want it to be either positive or negative um like tell me do you want me to buy the product or do you want me to not buy the product do you like the product do you not like the product and with something like this like i'm not gonna repurchase it i will look for other brands but um if you're interested in a transdermal thc patch check them out at your local dispensary because this was a neat experience and i will be trying them out again um but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video if you liked it give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below let me know your experience with transdermal patches let me know if you tried any other brands let me know with how effective they were um and let me know your experience with trans circle patches because i'm genuinely curious if other people have had just as good of experiences i've had with them or what's the t on that because i have to say i found this to be more effective than i think i would have found a 20 milligram edible and um i feel like the effects were just there all day which i really really liked i don't know if that's just because it's like an extended release of the thc but i really really like that i felt the effects all day um but yeah thank you guys so much for watching and i'll see you guys around for whatever story activity or video i come up with for next time and hopefully it doesn't leave me named bye guys i'm going to bed good night [Music] you", "Qy6tpCD49Ec": "( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )\n>> Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY!

WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH \nJOURNALIST JESSICA YELLIN.", "iJ_WKCsh1No": "Can cannabis be used\nfor glaucoma treatment? In this video I will answer that question. Enjoy the time of vignette, please Like\nthis video and subscribe to the channel. Hi, I'm Dr. Honassys R. Rocha,\nophthalmologist. Author of the book, How To Treat Glaucoma. In this video I will talk about\nCannabis Sativa and glaucoma. The goal of this video is\nto clear up if this plant can be used in the\ntreatment of this disease. As a base, I used readings from\nseveral scientific articles. These articles are\npublished since the 1970s and you will see some of these links\nin the description of the video. Cannabis has several\nindications in medicine. And perhaps the greatest example is the treatment of\npeople who have seizures difficult to control. Some people don't have proper\ncontrol of these seizures with traditional medications. And for these people, in Brazil,\nthe use of Cannabis is allowed for the treatment of seizures. Cannabis sativa is a plant popularly known as weed or marijuana. It has more than 400 substances and what interests us\nin relation to glaucoma are only two. The THC,\nwhich is the Tetrahydrocannabinol, and the CBD, which is Cannabidiol. The THC is responsible for\nthe psychotropic effect, for the pressure-reducing effect, for the appetite stimulation, and it is also responsible\nfor the red eye. It was demonstrated in one of the\nstudies of the decade of the 70s, that the responsible for the\nreduction of the pressure is really the THC. And the duration of the effect\nof reduction of the pressure in people who smoke weed\nis from 3 to 4 hours. The CBD, on the other hand, has the main effect of\ncontrolling seizures and also has a very\nimportant effect here because it is considered to offer\nneuroprotection from glaucoma. The great problem of THC\nis its psychotropic effect. The person can lose some of\ntheir consciousness level, some of their cognitive capacity and in the long term, they can have a reduction\nin their reasoning speed. And besides, THC can cause tachycardia. The CBD, on the other hand,\ndoes not reduce intraocular pressure, but it has a very important\nneuroprotective effect. We remember that\nneuroprotection is also present in some medicines like Losartan and I suggest you watch the video here to learn more about it. Losartan is used in people\nwho have high blood pressure. The neuroprotective effect\nis important in glaucoma due to the increased resistance\nof the nerve to high pressure. An ideal formulation to\neventually treat glaucoma would be composed of a part\nof THC and a part of CBD. The THC would offer a\npressure reducing effect, while the CBD would offer\na neuroprotective effect. This has been tried many times and it was not possible to find\neye drops with good eye penetration without leaving an irritation on the\nsurface of the eye, like the red eye. This topical formulation\nhasn't been achieved yet. In practice, what is available as\ncannabis extract is the oil or spray which can be used sublingually. In Brazil, the medical prescription is\nallowed for this use, for this purpose. Only your ophthalmologist can\nprescribe cannabis eventually for glaucoma treatment. The use of cannabis can\nbe considered in people who already use medications, the four medications in combination\nfor the treatment of glaucoma, maximum therapy. The person who already\nwent through all the lasers and that at that time\nalready has a surgical indication. It occurs that if there is any\nrestriction to the surgery, if this surgery has any contraindication, the use of medical cannabis sativa\ncan be considered in this case. I hope you share this video with those people who can\nbenefit of this content, with those people who have glaucoma and especially with those who have\ndifficulty controlling glaucoma.

Before they were like, \"Josh uses cannabis for his epilepsy, I don't know about that. It sounds like, you know, some kind of home remedy that's not going to work. And, you know, he needs to be on his medication. This is not right.\" And now full circle, a whole decade later, they're saying, \"Buddy, we're sorry ever doubted you.\" If you had an average garden that had, let's say, one light in it, that one light for all the other gardens I would see would produce anywhere from at the time at the early stages like a half pound of cannabis. As the years went on, it was more like a pound of cannabis and then a pound and a half of cannabis. Throughout that whole time, I was busy growing three pounds of cannabis per light. First of all, no one believed it. They were like, \"No chance. You're not doing that.\" Unless I showed them. And when I showed them and they'd be like, \"How are you doing this?\" And they said, \"Hey, you know what? We don't believe that you guys had three pounds of light.\" And I said, \"Schedule a tour. How much time you got? You want to come see the spot? I'll show you any day.\" These girls are getting ready to go to war. Looking good, though. Their officers came through and they were like, \"Josh, we've never seen anything like this. How soon can we start discussions around an acquisition here?\" And I said, \"I'm all ears, guys.\" The age of 14 years old, I had a seizure at the breakfast table just before school. I woke up in an ambulance and that same day found out I do have epilepsy. I had to take an incredible amount of medication and then continually daily take an incredible amount of medication. My seizures were going away, but the side effects were coming in heavily. It started with weight gain, hair loss. When I was about 22 years old, I stepped into realizing that I can no longer continue running into these side effects, especially with the list that was coming from liver failure to other things that you just don't want to deal with in life. CBDs have played an instrumental role in me not taking my medications. I would not be comfortable not taking my medications without CBDs. So I don't want to give it 100 percent, but I would absolutely give it 90 percent. My neurologists, they completely disagreed with me and said, \"You should not be doing that, Josh.\" But at the same time, here I am eight years later, feeling incredibly healthy. My liver works great. I'm very seizure free. And furthermore, everybody's really excited for what's to come. Because I feel as though federal legalization is the next step that needs to happen and how our businesses can play a role in that and how quickly we can achieve the revenues that we're shooting for

it difficult to get reliable information on cultivating a high quality crop in thailand so we're on our way to meet an illegal grower called daddy dump it up island far from bangkok daddy dumb whose real name is has been secretly growing cannabis for more than 25 years he remembers a time when cannabis was commonplace on the island i was born on the island which is growing marijuana a lot at that time because fishermen they need some kind of relaxation to go and work in the sea rough sea is very stress yeah and using cannabis smoking bone it's helped them to stay out in the sea without fear he too has embraced cannabis medical properties he gives out the oils he extracts by leaving stashes at the local kanji shop for those who need it but earlier this year he was arrested for growing

i not harm any anyone a devout buddhist he gives out his advice and his oils for free it's those seeking profit who worry him they start to do business they start to sell and then they lost their way um this plant is is gift from nature people should should learn how to grow how to use and how to help other people not to make money because if to make money is it would be bad to to our soul our

that it will lift farmers out of poverty are unrealistic what do you tell the thai farmers now don't grow don't grow even if the rules and regulations are clear you got to ask yourself who am i selling the products to i feel bad for a lot of people that are being lied to right because everybody wants it's like it's like the gold rush right everybody went in and says gee let's go dig for gold

eight to nine weeks of germination you can expect a THC concentration of between 25 and 28 percent at number four there is wedding cake which is at a keen price for such a THC rich strain this plant will give you a great sativa hide and you will find that her little goes a very long way at number three Cali glue Auto joins the list with a more than healthy THC level of around 23 percent we also like this as it flowers within 60 to 70 days and can cope with wide temperature fluctuations it was a close call but at number 2 we have Bruce Banner with origins from Colorado it was registered at the u.s. Cannabis Cup with a THC level of 28% which was the highest at the time pride of place and storming in at number one comes hulk burry the alter ego of the incredible hulk with a THC level of 27% and slightly lower than Bruce Banner this took the coveted crown because of its fruit berry and hint of citrus aromas that makes it a little bit extra special what about you have you experienced a mind fog like no other from a particular strain of cannabis if so let us know in the comments section below providing it was legal to smoke cannabis where you were time and of course if you enjoyed this video make sure to subscribe to our channel so you too can become a cannabis expert", "IaPj9BhzTK4": "STATE LEGISLATORS ARE AT A STANDSTILL IN TALKS OVER LEGALIZING RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA.

going to be using 2 cup of water for one cup of sugar [Music] so i have my one cup of sugar and i'm going to be using two and a half cup of water so the reason why i'm using two and a half cup of

weather is just perfect you know what else is perfect the date April 20th or in this case 420 now what some of you may not realize is that 420 is the most famous staple in the marijuana industry however some of you may not actually know the true story behind 4/20 you see one day a group of high school students known as the Waldos had secretly hidden a stash of marijuana somewhere around their campus and they would always have the time when they would go out and begin their weed smoking adventures can you guess what time it was exactly 4/20 so yeah so this sort of became the code phrase for when these Waldo's would go out and start smoking this marijuana and pretty soon the whole town was aware of their actions and there was even an article about them for the high times now looking out into the crowd right now I see some faces of shock or disbelief from some of you well why though just because I'm talking about marijuana just because I speak about it with such ease you know I've noticed how our country has become so conservative and afraid about this one topic that they considered talking about it a giant taboo however marijuana is not something that we should fear if we were to look past all the bad rep and controversy that marijuana has received in the past we would Seeley we would truly see the truth the truth of how marijuana is not a menace at all and that is what I'm here to talk to you about today the real truth behind marijuana see now if I'm going to explain the truth you all I'm going to start from the beginning the earliest traces of marijuana can be found in 8000 BC Taiwan and it was used as courts for pottery and other local artistry it was so old in fact that some scientists have even speculated that marijuana has had a tenth in development of modern-day society from Taiwan it diffused all around in the world from South Asia to South Africa to South America and even a Middle East finally arrived in America around the nineteen hundreds it was brought to America and mostly diffuse around the southwestern regions of the United States from Mexico you see marijuana has been was brought to Mexico from Mexican immigrants who were fleeing from the Mexican Revolution of 1910 to 1930 R of merit the true American fear of marijuana had began you see Americans at the time were so afraid of the minority race which was the Mexicans that they associated everything and anything that was related to them evil or hazardous and this included marijuana and because of this by 1931 marijuana has been banned over twenty-nine states across the country but I believe it was banned wrongfully yes sir ladies and gentlemen because what people during the nineteen hundreds filled to realize is that marijuana can be very beneficial and helpful to our society and health and medical benefits allow me to elaborate you see over the past few decades marijuana has been found to be the key to many disease to the cure of many diseases and illnesses take for instance glaucoma you see glaucoma is a condition for the eye that consists of pressure that causes a reduction in the peripheral vision and even blindness the only way to lessen the effects of glaucoma is to lessen the inter ocular pressures with him to eye and wouldn't you know what marijuana does just that you see marijuana contains an active compound known as THC and THC is a type of cannabinoid which you didn't if you didn't know how would have sort of psychoactive effects in the body in the mind and this is sort of where the hi comes from that everybody's this associates marijuana with so the conducted a study conducted by the National Eye Institute revealed that marijuana has been found to be the key to the reduction of the internal air pressures with the eye furthermore marijuana has been found to be the key to the stop of cancer sells because you see cancer cells contain a certain gene known as ID one and ID one is responsible for the replication and multiplication of marijuana across the body and throughout your cells now if this cell were if this gene were to be turned off then the spread of cancer cells would solely dissipate and even kill them as a result and again marijuana does just that you see a study conducted by the California Pacific Medical Center in 2007 showed that when breast cancer cells were exposed to marijuana their id-1 expression had lowered and had overall killed the cells now as you can see marijuana has been found to be very beneficial and could really save a lot of lives if it was more accepted by society however I'm not gonna be I'm not gonna stand up here and defend marijuana marijuana's negative actions in society from gangs to crimes to many negative factors in our society I know in times such as these high school students such as myself have not been able to achieve their full potential because of marijuana however we as a society can change that if we were to band together and put the positive side of marijuana first and push out the negative side then we would truly have a better future and a way to do this is if we were to restrict the use of miracle of medical marijuana to just medical uses and to put a more strict hold on the recreational side if we were to do this then basically all the crime and negative factors of marijuana would slowly dissipate and our society can started anew by then we would be able to start and better and brand new society by then we would further our society to new levels and I'm not afraid to say it I believe that marijuana can take our society to a new high sorry bad plan backfired anyways my name is sa Parkman runnin and thank you for letting me speak to you today [Applause]", "BauIG0oJCDo": "thc and drug testing here's what you need to know let's not pussyfoot around the elephant in the room and it's a pretty big elephant in many countries the smoking of cannabis is illegal but the state of play seems to be changing and in time the laws may well change however here we are talking about today beyond legality there is also the question of being fit and capable for work there are a good number of companies who require staff to take random drug tests what we wanted to do here is to simply inform you how long thc can linger in your system and how for some it can pass through more quickly than others we should also point out that thc can remain in your body for up to 30 days after you have ingested cannabis especially if eaten as opposed to smoked beyond this and this is where forensic science comes in your hair will contain traces of cannabis that will remain for at least 90 days if there is a possibility that a drug test will include hair follicles our advice is to keep away from cannabis for a long time thus unexpectedly shaving your head prior to a very critical and rigorous interview might just give the game away first thing to note is that because thc is a lipid soluble overweight individuals will retain thc in their system for longer than their thinner companions worse still if you smoke cannabis don't go for heavy exercise just prior to any urine test as when fat is broken down thc is released into your system and will come out in your urine however before you think that going for a run might also get you stoned on that thc the levels are detectable but minuscule and have no psychotropic effect tests for thc are actually for the metabolite thc cooh or tetrahydrocannabinol carboxylic acid though that's a bit of a mouthful you should also be aware that thc can build up in your system over time so regular users are more likely to retain thc in their system for longer than newbies who have a relatively pristine metabolism light use would be up to three times a week medium use would be up to five times a week and heavy use would be seven times a week and chronic heavy use would be frequently every day for a urine test and as a rule of thumb light users should see traces of thc disappear after three days but heavy users will need up to 30 days plus if you have to undergo a saliva test then allow 3 days if you are a light user 7 days for a medium user and 15 days for a heavy user but again up to 30 days or even more if you are a chronic heavy user for a blood test the rule is up to two days for it to remain in the bloodstream but thc has been found in blood tests 25 days after smoking cannabis so unfortunately there is no definitive answer we'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter and of course if you enjoyed this video do like and subscribe so

From caffeine, cigarettes and alcohol, \nto more extreme drugs. But as the most commonly used illicit drug in North America, where does marijana fit in? And how exactly does it\neffect your brain? First, we need to understand how the brain functions. Your neurons are the cells that process information in the brain. By releasing chemicals called \"neuro-transmitters\"\nfrom the axon of one neuron to the dendrite of another. They change the electrical charge of the receiving neuron, \nconsequently exciting or inhibiting it. If excited, the signal is passed on. Though it sounds simple, these signals work together and the effect is\nquickly compounded into complex configurations within milliseconds, flushing over the entire brain. This is what happens every single time you think, breath,\nor move. So what is going on in your brain when you \nare smoking marijuana? Well, unlike alcohol which contains molecules nothing like those in our body.\nCannibis contains molecules that resemble those produced in our very own brains. Cannabinoids, though naturally these cannabinoids circulate in much lower quantities\ncompared to the large influx imposed by smoking. Specifically the chemical Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, resembles a\nnatural transmitter called Anandamide. These cannabinoids are specialized neurotransmitters\nreleased by neurons having just fired. Neurons temporarily becomes unresponsive after firing, to prevent them\nfrom overreacting or being to dominant. This allows your brain to function in a calm and controlled manner. But cannabinoids interrupt this approach\nin some parts of the brain. Instead, they remove the refractory period of neurons,\nthat are already active and cause your thoughts, imagination and perception to \nutterly magnify itself. This means once you begin your train of thought,\nit becomes the most significant and profound thing ever. You can't see the big picture or even recall your last epiphany,\nbecause you are caught up in the momentum of a particular idea, and your neurons keep firing. Until a new idea takes hold, and you go off on a new tangent. These cannabinoids also effect the levels of dopamine \nand norephinephrine in your brain. Often leading to a sense of euophoria, relaxation,\npain modulation and general enhancement of an experience, \nthough sometimes causing anxiety. Furthermore, there are cannabinoid receptors in areas controlling short term memory, learning, coordination,\nmovement control and higher cognitive functions.

I was willing to try anything [Music] hey we're at ro Nels house and Rennell has a dog named Marley and Marley has a couple conditions I get treated with CBD oil which is something a lot of people didn't know you could do with dogs so how did you come to get Marley somebody was had him up for adoption and they said that they had little kids and they couldn't handle him which I thought was crazy until I got him home and I found out why cuz he just wanted to be held and he's under your feet he couldn't be by himself I was like having a baby so it was like it was terrible if he got really upset he would he'd go to the bathroom in the house and it got to the point where was like you can't have that so yeah we were gonna have to find him another home we take him to a groomer and I just happened to ask one of the ladies that takes care of him there if he behaves as badly there as he does at home and she said that we should consider using the cannabis treats because it would help with his anxiety and that the Prozac probably was not helping any longer because he'd been taking it so long oh so he was on frozen crows I Fedora hmm they do what was the difference between the Prozac behavior in the CBD with the Prozac he was calmer but he still was a little more anxious with having people come and go in here so often he had to calm down because he was just barking like crazy and just going on and on so now he just sits and hangs out with everybody but like I said didn't change his personality at all which was nice because I was afraid it was gonna make him just you know with our Jick and lay around and do nothing so he still runs around with the kids and plays with them and does all that so changes to mean and oh yeah exactly that's exactly right CBD saved the day they did I did well I'd heard about studies on the effects of CBD in dogs this is my first time seeing it in practice so we're outside of it Lydon right now it's one of our nails favorite places to come get everything Marley needs so we're gonna go inside learn a little bit more about CBD and pets and see what kind of goods they have to offer hi Trey hi I'm Leah nice all right so you guys have quite a number of products which ones are for dogs all right so we do have a product that is CBD base or hemp based and it is a pet CBD whole plant tincture CBD is known to be non psychoactive or what we say is non euphoric so you're not gonna get that high it can help with ailments such as stress anxiety pets dogs namely also have what's known as an endocannabinoid system humans and pets have this so CBD can help pets as well for my dog I use it once a day in the evening to kind of chill him out not that it takes away his personality or anything it just is a nice he's not so anxious it's really great and your dog likes it oh yeah absolutely while both THC and CBD compounds are found in cannabis plants they behave very differently CBD doesn't have psychoactive properties so it won't make you feel high it's important to remember that CBD products for dogs aren't regulated so you should try to talk to a vet about what brands and quantity to try for your pet CBD also hasn't been thoroughly tested in humans or animals but some early studies have shown that CBD has a lot of potential medical benefits including a calming effect which is a natural alternative to prozac that can help marleah so let's see a shape before using take four drops per 10 pound animal wait twice daily how big is my early about 8 pounds about 8 pounds yeah that's about like three four jobs all right let's see what you think about this mm-hmm what do you think not sure if I you somewhere you eat so I find I'll eat it [Music] but if I put it on something you'll take it with me think let's try it there we go so today we learned about CBD and dogs CBD might be a good alternative for your dog or your cat or other pets as opposed to going through pharmaceuticals so yeah maybe your dog or your cat will like weed as much as you do [Music] you", "03xWNtjbbMY": "what's up it is 2 p.m on a wednesday afternoon thanks for tuning into the cannabis legalization news where we explain marijuana laws so you can change them today we're going to be talking about cura leaf's entrance into the european market we're also going to be talking about several bills that are making their way around i mean there's bills popping up all over the country but one in florida is not very cool so we're going to be talking about that and we're going to answer a question from uh dm we received from windy city growers about lobbying so let's just get right into it hey tom hey mickey happy birthday i tell you though that florida it's terrible when it comes to their laws about limiting the thc concentration but the florida crosses uh the florida orange crosses from revolution just smells so nice hey guess what we got on the show next week everybody oh my god i can't wait yeah highness himself the highness smash the likes and hit subscribe and then you'll get noticed next week when we uh go live with tommy trump and i got my first sponsor my first weed sponsor which just means free weed what what's your first weed sponsor dude washington butco is gonna so i hit up three uh my favorite we grows because you know doing this thing the the influencer slash whatever you know people are gonna question like sponsors and and promotions and whatnot but honestly dude you can do a win-win you can you can promote a product and not sell your soul like the product i.e being cannabis but uh you know i got the washington budco is going to be hooking me up and i can't wait to share their product on the on the show yeah washington budco is is nice i'm sure uh i i'm not going to be able to play smell-o-vision with washington bud co next week but just fred and then we'll also have to see what tommy's smoking on uh he'll probably be joining us from la hopefully he's got some wonderful and why wouldn't he why wouldn't he have good wi-fi i mean it's a pretty pretty good show tune in we have a lot of news that came up and uh we passed 20 subscribers on this uh on this little ship of the channel that's so funny dude i mean just this little you and me i still wanted to call it two guys in one mic but it's all right that's fun you know what we're getting so old now that that uh two girls one cup or two guys you know one cup one mic uh those types of references are going to get less and less obvious to people which are fine with me i do not need people to know what that reference means but let's get back to it though i mean curly's entrance into europe european cannabis markets it's kind of a big deal right 280 million dollars oh my god this is one of the reasons why oh let's let's get to the stock news we have a we have a cut that we can do on this let's uh let's do our little bumper with the stocks uh moving into the stock news yeah currently enters the european cannabis market in a 285 million dollar deal uh curl leaf holdings which is of course the largest market cap of all the cannabis stocks that you can buy right now over the counter uh and currently market valuation is i believe 11 billion in change and so yesterday it was up like 17 percent uh and then today it's down about five percent and all the pot stocks have just started to dump off a cliff since it became obvious that they are not going to be legalizing at a federal level anytime soon and that's one of the problems with these types of weed stocks is it's just so speculative you know this this thing comes up is this going to have any real value because like the the the european cannabis market's really not that big no but i think the potential for what they have it's going to be greater than the united states because they can travel so uh kira lee's holdings agreed to buy a mac life sciences ltd for 285 which i think is kind of a low entry bar to this industry when it's already been producing billions of dollars in tax revenue right like like currently if only like i clipped i think like 184 million dollars worth of medical say or cannabis sales last year so we pull up the curl leaf chart and see what their quarterly results are to determine whether or not they have acne like year-over-year growth to be able to um account for like a 17 pop in the stock in one day uh however it probably isn't going to be much of anything um we'll see you know curly can immediately start selling his cbd products in europe's and plans to bring thc products and its select brand oh yeah the curry leaf select brand never heard of it but markets through the deal yeah but you know unlike in the u.s where the company can't move federally illegal cannabis across the state lines kiriley's products can be shipped anywhere in the euroboc through the emac their their network so uh appropriate licensing i thought they could only move their cbd products not their uh thc products well i imagine uh this was in bloomberg so i'd imagine there's there's they're working on it you know because in spain uh they have uh like what spannabis it's a huge you know canvassing new out there it's i mean as much as the ignorance still prevails you know you still have gw pharmaceuticals and all these other people you know making a [ __ ] ton of money out there and they're not so ignorant or stupid i guess over there oh we'll see you know it's one of those things where these licenses they tend to become uh less expensive over time and so it implies which you know this isn't necessarily the best implication ever that there would be fewer licenses and limited markets in the future but they just raised all this money and then they spent all that money to acquire this and then it makes the stock go up because why oh they have the right to buy stuff in europe now yeah i mean that's all that is that look at that so that's your home group that's uh oh that's yeah that's some homegrown that's some florida purple homegirl right there medically cannabis right medically hungry yeah that's right medical homegirl it's the way to do it in illinois then uh so we also got a biden's usda secretary gives final approval to hemp rules despite ongoing industry concerns yep the emp rules have been finalized and so we saw those final rules come out there's actually some really nice uh some really nice changes that happened to the final rule from the interim rule and therefore it could be worse it could be worse by a few leaps and bounds because the final rule allows for a difference in the um level of negligence and so the level of negligence has been moved from point five uh percent thc to one percent thc which should provide for like the vast majority of the genetics that are out there as uh as hemp cultivars and then of course the disposal and remediation and so now let's say your hemp comes in a little hot and by that i mean like you're you're over the point five percent total uh you know just throw some more um stalks in and chip it all up and put in some more fan leaves and then test it so that it's it goes back down like your total cbd count might go from like 20 down to 15 or something but then your thc count might go from like 0.5 down to 0.1 which is nice and so now they are allowing uh the hemp farmers to be able to recapture uh and remediate their non-compliant plants with that remediation they're gonna also be able to you can do an extract right and then and create that limit of whatever potency you think it should be uh i don't think they allow you to do the extract i think just allow you to mix stuff back in and then retest it and then once you have then you have to do the extract yeah well still what a painting has though it's like you fill a test like at school they give you a second chance you're like come on i got i know all the answers were right there but it's just it's just the regulations it's just the regulations that's really the problem yeah yeah not exactly and then yeah that's what we call nice things man yeah yeah that's one of the problems all right we have it's agriculture secretary tom vilsack so we're actually going back to the future he was um barack obama's agricultural secretary as well and he's an ally of the hemp industry and so this this new reg takes effect on march 22 as originally planned so this crop year it appears that we're going to be under the new usda regs and so they released these rules yeah so they released them back when did they release that rule i want to say it was august of last year or something like that because they had public comment periods and all sorts of things and they came up the final rule uh the final rule was released back in january so yeah you see like even if we had um federal reform for cannabis it would be like this it would take years after the law has changed because then they have to come out with all the regulations because marijuana is not him marijuana is not him that's right sthcn wait wait wait yeah they are both yeah in the end though you know the process is long and so here in washington the homegirl lost again it's gonna get wide it's just got buried again never made it out of the committee so yeah it takes a long time to shape things up to have that infrastructure it'll be a bit so we also have chicago or do you want to go stay on the uh on the uh the hemp topic no we'll go to chicago all right let's go chicago weed giant illegally took pot to arkansas in whole food salad containers federal suit claims ronald holding okay uh well i just think it's hilarious that verano and verano are they're probably getting torched right now i mean all the the cannabis companies are getting torched right now on the uh the trading floor for the stocks today but yeah chicago company worth roughly 3 billion with sued monday in federal court as part of a sweeping racketeering complaint that accuses the company of illegally trafficking marijuana from illinois to arkansas well how so they're sued but no one like raided what what what what what is this how civil but like isn't there a person behind verano like let's this was my thing about legalization and recreation was huh sammy dwarf is his name i'm just saying rich people don't want to go to jail so if they fix the freaking law go to jail this is freaking ridiculous well actually tom and john could talk about that rich people still go to jail oh yeah he wasn't the biggest fan of it you know he wasn't the biggest fan of jail i don't think anybody goes yeah granted jail like but he had some great stories about him and jordan belfort and you know him riding in wall street in jail while he was serving with tommy chon but uh anyway the lawsuit tireds dozens of cannabis executives and companies including our verano ceo george archus and harvest health and recreation and eris an arizona firm uh harvest is like one of the largest operators out of arizona that attempted to acquire verano for 850 million in march of 2019. uh i do not have a copy of the complaint if anybody wants to get me a copy of the complaint i can read it and be like this is what the state is asking for in their prayer for relief uh i'm not currently involved in litigation and i'm fine with that but i spent about a decade in litigation i'd be interested though but like like again back to why are they being like you know a business should be rated it just it just hurts my brain that you have a federal state to state case here that should involve verona being shut down period not not not being litigated over court or like you know they could lose their license you know if this is a federal crime uh and then again like in the future when these types of things break make sure that we get a copy of the complaint for them so that i can read that and be like this is what they're asking for that's one of the problems with like newspapers is that they're not staffed by lawyers uh and and so then you can't you know necessarily get the the kind of analysis you get from like actually reading complaint and so there's actually a plaintiff so nicholas nielsen worked for the cultivation center in newport arkansas which was managed by harvest as the company worked in lopstep with verano as the acquisition was pending this sounds like a butt hurt investor that's trying to take action to squeeze or exert some type of influence from the actual license holders but uh we'd have to see and so like you know from the way that i was reading it i'm like all right first is this a federal suit and by a federal student is this prosecution right here that is prosecution it just seems like it's a contractual b for some type of beef between these two people it's another reasons why i'd like to read the complaint you know before i well the accusation there is is of course that they're they're also uh diversion right like like this person's saying i'm i'm growing a bunch of plants for this big company worth a billion dollars like it does seem like a petty employee really it's not not a a federal case that's being uh you know government coming after them it's not a federal case the government's not coming after him it's this nicholas nielsen guy and so he worked for the cultivation center like where does he fit in how much stock did he open or own and then it says the 2020 police rate of nielsen's home uncovered 28 harvested pot plants in his garbage can all right cool and so now did he like bring them in he's like hey police this wasn't me it was these guys but you know i have no idea and so like neil nielsen was then arrested and charged after the cops found two more plants inside his home oh that's terrible two whole plants humanly christmas call the dogs uh this claims that those plants were actually being cultivated for harvest greenhouse while awaiting approval from state officials that's very convenient the stude claims that the nielsen's home was allegedly grown from clippings brought to arkansas by michael frontier a verano employee who was allegedly instructed by his employer to take young cannabis plants from an unnamed verano facility in illinois and transport them to arkansas that's derelict in the sense that why aren't these uh genetics like at least stabilized in some forms of seeds uh why are you gonna be flying clones you know coach that doesn't make any sense but why arkansas too i'm just trying to write a highly limited market and so verano probably used its um money to get a license in in arkansas i mean a lot of the illinois operators use their money to get licenses in arkansas cresco gti revolution uh probably also verano and so that you know there's three million people that live in arkansas it is a limited market state for only medical really kind of sucks so if like arkansas ever goes wreck it will be dominated by those five companies well i got you but again it doesn't seem like a diversion issue or it could be a diversion issue if you think about it like but and all these recreational and all these markets recreational medical that that initiate right that they always have this grace period right where everything magically appears the seeds the the cannabis never existed before until you signed that law in place that's right until the uh the zoning commission and then the department of agriculture or the cannabis regulatory commission they give that stamp of approval and your license becomes operational magically cannabis just appears a stork brings it very often you know like just like babies you know they just happen and so the stork comes in that's what it looks like it looks like this is uh some guy named nielsen gets popped for multiple felony charges in arkansas and then for him to get leverage against that um prosecution against him brings in uh verano and harvest health as uh probably had to join them in a suit and then and then but then what he would have to remove to federal court to like get jurisdiction over these other um uh of operators that aren't native for or residents of arkansas again like well nilsson by reading complaint is one of the most important things that a lawyer can do when he's trying to explain to you what's going on yeah well it says here nielsen who's facing multiple felony charges in arkansas has told law enforcement officials that he would definitely testify against frontier verano so it seems like ron's been putting it on their employee as far as like a like a front right like a like you're you're going to help get our business started oh [ __ ] you got caught um i don't know you bro you know it's all good then uh oh here's that one though that we were talking about the uh the beard bros article uh about the al said mid-men zex the new gig represents everything wrong with corporate cannabis and this is about you know uh the beer bros had a great how before actual the structure of recreational um uh cannabis uh you know your reputation precedes you whether you grow good weed and your weed spoke for itself or if you had shitty weed or if you were a shitty uh business person uh you know there was a network and people talk and they still do technically but unfortunately like how do people like people part of men men that started out this this shitty company that had no success and yet still probably acquire another six-figure salary right how do you [ __ ] up and still get a job that bad well it depends on how well capitalized you are but why like what gets them the foot in the door was that you think they paid for the pay to play yeah that you raise money from investors right but so are they just dumb investors i mean what's going on here that these guys yes there are dumb investors out there and so like they you know probably raised some money from some less than smart people uh and uh there you go but you know it's just one of those things where uh you know it not every cannabis company is about operations a lot of them are about acquisitions and assets and so like you know um those types of companies that are about acquisitions and assets and the image and like appearance and it's all real estate play or or what have you uh then you get your amendments right and that's what i mean like the the industry that you think like as a um somebody coming from a traditional market legacy market uh that experience uh you know you have these like you know that cannabis is commodity i paid 25 to save for an eighth so then a quarter is going to be fifty dollars uh a half a hundred and a whole ounce two hundred now and then of course you negotiate with your salesman sometimes you're like hey the more i purchase can i get more of a a refund right this is like the learning basics of business without any uh taxes and all that stuff so i think most people have an idea that any cannabis company that starts is going gonna be a reputable grow slash someone that's there for the plant itself and it's unfortunate when you see these like i want to say shell companies because they're not there's no substance to this there's no actual culture there's no um it seems like it's like funnel money like like hey i'm a rich person i need to funnel some money i know you're gonna [ __ ] it up that's okay it's expected like this is what's wrong with the world man yeah there's a lot of these uh and they're quite great at raising money it's kind of like you know curl leaf what did they do well they raised a whole bunch of money and then they spent it buying all these licenses in europe and what's the value of those licenses yes yeah but don't don't people google we can google around people there's no it's it's just greed and so it's called accretion they use words like that value-add that's another big one or like you know accretion where they they say oh the the sum of these two parts it's not gonna be two plus two equals four it's gonna be like nine and then um you get you get that type of stuff but uh so what is this beard bros company i see that med men is a um a real estate company that dabbles in the cannabis markets but uh you know uh so beer burns got a great blog i think they they're actually a store in a garden down there the thing about the california culture is a lot of these guys have uh uh uh blogs like uh one time uh rest in peace mickey martin was a uh in the early days of medical had a blog called weed activists and uh guy was just savage and just call people out left and right and uh that was the essence of like because he was also in edibles and doing all sorts of things so beer bros are just another legacy um grow that i believe in the recreational market now so they're a good source for california culture and news oh okay so then um beard bros says it's hard to argue that there's a less popular cannabis brand these days than men men how much do you think med men paid for that for the publicity or that for that blurb no good these five bucks 20 000 it's hard to argue yeah i mean it's just they had such great promise right they got the the spike jones video that represented like the the new cannabis culture the new consumer they were trying to they had a lot of blah blah blah intentions but there was nothing of fruition that came out of them except for one little video like i just don't get how these people still succeed in the industry like like it's just it's it's sad and frustrating to see wealthy people where we're like they're saying here in the article a lot of your legacy people can't even afford half these license they can't even get their foot in the door i don't know i don't know tell you what why don't we take a 420 break and then let's look at that verano lawsuit there's actually a pretty interesting chart and graph that we can go over to like point fingers at people and then we can keep ripping on med men or we'll we'll move on to the mexico news probably move on to the mexico loot news but just a second here's the lawsuit um it's a civil action in the united states district court for the first district of colorado again doesn't make much sense uh because like then whoa why do they follow in there well this is kind of normal um and it's not necessarily the worst nose bleeding um uh chart that you'll ever see when you have an mso and so then you have you know marijuana profits marijuana profits going to and from uh the first circle right there is verano llc the the one to the far right is harvest health inc you can see one of them is not an llc and then at the below it's natural state wellness enterprises llc that's probably the um uh the arkansas uh company that was right there and then it's it's just where they they move all the monies and and so those monies kind of go around allegedly according to these um charts and graphs there and so like they siphon off profits they provide uh financial and operating capital uh for people off of them and then uh you know it's it's one of those deals where it'll be interesting to like actually read this whole thing to see exactly what he's alleging and why and then it's it's a rico action uh a private action in rico and so like this guy's getting prosecuted pretty heavily in um uh arkansas sort of like try to offset whatever type of risk he has there he's like all right well i'll bring these people in but now these guys get to like appear and then their lawyers will say oh this should be dismissed and so like this litigation will now get exceedingly expensive uh including for uh with the plaintiff here which is a nicholas nielsen who's also being prosecuted in uh arkansas which is gonna make like affording this a little bit difficult because lawsuits can go on for years if not decades and and be thoroughly briefed before you can actually get to questions of law to get you actually out of those but that's very interesting he's got uh some emails uh attached here and then you know uh some other allegations in the complaint about the transporting across the state lines frontier airlines i'm assuming huh or is frontier one of the the actual things that was defined earlier on if you like this sexy uh mso content you gotta like subscribe right that's right don't forget that where we get to go over um uh more more fun stuff about uh okay who's fighting for what and and how uh but you know that's some news that's going on and that's some litigation that'll probably continue to happen yes they try to enforce the laws in a particular state and somebody gets arrested and then these other msos were playing fast and loose uh well allegedly playing fast and loose uh and we'll see how the facts bear out on this yeah no kidding that'd be interesting to see that that's definitely going to be one of those ones that might uh set a precedent right for how to operate in a multi-state right i mean it could be it could be interesting in the sense that you know these uh operators are trying to get their genetics in various other locations from one state to another and so like how do you do that like if you're if you're an operator that's got a licensing agreement like you know if you're a cookies because cookies keeps opening new shops in new locations so how do those cookie strains get into that state you know we'll all be in california right and pixies fairies of course pixies ferries and also the stork brings all the genetics straight to the dispensary without any questions and uh and then there's these types of questions so it's kind of interesting i mean like this is one of the reasons why you're gonna eventually i don't know when it's gonna be but eventually you absolutely need uh federal legalization because you have this this dual nature of the plant and so like it's quasi-legal in these jurisdictions but it's still also criminalized i mean it's it's medical it's not full adult use well if you think about it too you're setting up in a monopoly for for these companies that have enough money to to litigate their way out like this is wrong on so many levels for the citizens period but meanwhile mexico is gonna might be getting ears right mexico's moving which uh is surprising for me i'm gonna have to issue a retraction from last week or i'm like yeah they're always calling wolf but no the full chamber of the mexican lower house is expected to discuss and vote on the bill this week that just criminalizes cannabis in a move that would make the country one of the largest the world's largest legal cannabis markets then they're going to build that wall so we can't go down that's right well i'm assuming then they're going to like start re-exporting all those wonderful mexican hazes from the 70s um however i don't know if that will happen uh how and then the other thing is they're gonna i think they would be the largest legal cannabis market because there's more mexico uh people than there are canadians like canada right now i think is the largest and there's only like 30 million or so 30 to 40 million canadians you know if you think about this too it doesn't have to be cannabis that once they legalize this in cannabis as a recreational use there's they're opening the the floodgates for hemp like for being a number one producer because since the united states is still behind the curve as we regulate our own stuff we're too busy saying the farmers are bad they're gonna they're gonna press on and create their own hemp and you know because that right now canada is our number one outsource for him and then south africa i think so there you go i mean they have some wonderful mexican hemp coming in but there's almost 128 million people that live in mexico and so there you go it'd be like the largest cannabis market by a mile if that happens and it's been it's been scheduled to happen for so long and it's been delayed for so long once they actually get there and i'm not sure if they're gonna get there this time or if they're gonna get there next time but it's it's moving that's like homegrown for washington you guys still have homegrown for medical it's just you want homegrown for adult use right america i want my rights freedom and so yeah that's we don't we also don't have home i mean like the home grow that we have is medical home grow and and i understand the argument for that when it comes to access to supply but then you know there's a profit mode of argument which i don't like it's like hey uh you shouldn't have access to supply if you just want to smoke weed you should have to pay yeah but that's still shitty argument because the you know home brews haven't put budweiser out of business you know hasn't put restaurants and everything out of business so it will only add to the variety of life god damn it i yes like you know you're not wrong you're not wrong it's just that the um the people don't care yeah well the ones in charge don't care that's that's what it is yes that's one of the bad news stories that continues to be on the radar too uh i'm not sure if that was the one that we had signed up next no that was the true leaf one let's talk about that well there is some more bad news eventually once we get to the florida news yeah yeah trinity team teams up with morehouse school of medicine though on medical cannabis research that's pretty neat that is yeah true leaf cannabis corp turned up with an hbc morehouse school of medicine on a medical cannabis research and education initiative about time that they're going to do some cannabis research dude i'm looking forward to the day i can actually go to the store cvs and buy uh you know a two to one ratio uh cannabis uh extract something you know uh pill anything to add my you know like anywhere i already kind of have it with the legal stores here because we watching is kind of ahead of the curve when it comes to products but still everybody should have this opportunity yep yep and so the florida cannabis company that's truly signed a research education and development agreement with morehouse school of medicine medicine under which true leaf georgia will assist with the school's cannabis related research operations and offer educational courses now this may also play into the lawsuit that truly filed against georgia to get its application in for its medical cannabis cultivation license and now it announces this new partnership with the morehouse school of medicine i wonder if that was an aspect of the cannabis application that they put in it had to be you know you know they're they're right now litigating going but we're gonna be in a medical study that's right you gotta let us in because we're right here all this jack going straight to your educational facility seriously we've got doctors yeah such [ __ ] i mean god damn it's brilliant [ __ ] strategic planning but [ __ ] you for [ __ ] having that kind of money hey gotta pay to play man so that's that's great and it provided if oh can you imagine if they don't get the license are they gonna come through then you know because they haven't announced who's won these because there's only two licenses up for grabs and then there was four licenses for the the tier two the fifty thousand square foot operating facility and then there's two licenses for the hundred thousand square foot operating facility and you know they want that they thirsty for oh god yeah yeah isn't the the requirement still says citizenship right in georgia you got to be resident oh sure there's all sorts of chicanery and relationships with um the residency requirements or like the doing business for the time requirements all those types of things um and then they they were nitpick the truly people were nitpicking regarding like how they uh implemented the application relative to the rules whether or not the administrative department overstepped its bounds when they were creating the the list of the uh the application which another fun thing you know that'll happen sometimes yeah you know the collaboration is considered as being one of the first steps in creation of a personalized medical cannabis treatments that would be a wonderful future yeah totally um there we go well yeah leading to the medical though colorado colorado bill requires schools to store cannabis-based medicines for student use so when the school board refused to let her daughter marley receive her cannabis derived medicine from willing teachers sarah and mark porter made the difficult decision to pull molly out of school on october 2019. in 18 months since marley has been able to take her prescribed medicine regularly while learning her at home keeping her crohn's disease more manageable than it's ever been her parents testified to colorado legislators crohn's is horrible man there's a lot of that so uh senate bill 21-56 aims to make life easier for kids like marley and their families it would require schools and school districts to have a policy allowing their employees to store and administer medical cannabis recommended for a student by a doctor thank god sb 56 yep but i mean this is a crohn's disease patient that's trying to access her medical cannabis and and it's been this is even in colorado and so like the one of the bastions one of the first states for this has still had these types of regulations in place to prevent cannabis medicine from being at schools well washington had the same way we just did it three years ago i believe just recently i know the gentleman that was behind that bill his daughter uh passed on a beautiful little girl she she had something way worse than crohn's and all that stuff but he pushed this bill through for all the other kids it was pretty awesome so yeah i know it's great that uh this so this can be called jack's law and i think i followed this guy's case for a little bit hey or no it builds off of jack's law which allows school districts to let parents or guardians administer medical cannabis to their children on campus in jack's law medicine must be administered in forms of oils nasal sprays or capsules no smoking can you imagine that but the light you're also certain nasal sprays and stuff so at least they have some type of aerosols so that it could actually be um you know so yeah you could get it titrated quicker and so you could get into the the the system faster that you know but the smoking aspect is just just us i mean like they're like oh my god there's a hint of smoke somewhere oh no any smoke at all don't even know what paper you know no it's ridiculous the the the the expectation that like you have to say the kids can't be smoking like no parents can rolling doobies for the kill i mean i mean mr older but you know if it's a medical issue a medical treatment god they're getting titrates they're getting tinctures getting oils they're doing all kinds of stuff they're not rolling up dubies for the [ __ ] kids they would probably prefer to not have to use the medicine to be honest it's one of those things you know usually when you have medicine very often you're like man i wish you didn't have to use this but i'm sick you know yeah there's a kid out there calling because you know colorado had a uh it was the mecca for a lot of the uh uh parents leaving their states uh you know uh charlotte's webb was the uh the initiator of all that right um and uh funny thing about this the because i i give the uh charlotte's web the brothers uh credit for creating that conversation you know keeping it going forward but looks like i gotta answer it text my bad all right well you do that you know colorado also has quentin's amendment which allows school nurses to administer medical cannabis at school for qualifying medical conditions and with a doctor's approval well that's that's a good amendment to have clinton but the left the law left out an opt-out clause for districts that didn't want their employees giving kids the medicine senate minority leader chris holbert a republican from douglas county said sb 2156 is more important to him than any other legislation he sponsored this session seven lawmakers in the education committee approved the bill unanimously on february 24th and now goes to the appropriations committee for review on a yet to be determined date and that is again how laws are made you start one committee hopefully you don't die there then you get out of another committee hopefully you don't die there you get some floor action hopefully you also don't die there and then there's a vote and then you pass if this is nebraska that's it now every other state besides nebraska then you have to go get passed in the other uh legislative body let's say you started in the senate you have to go to the house side of the house you have to go to the senate and it has to be the same one uh and then let's say you get all through all that and then they've been reconciled so it's the same bill and now it goes to the governor's desk and if that governor is mario cuomo yeah sure he might sign it but if that governor is uh gnome i believe is her name in south dakota oh she's vetoing the crap out of that bill and and that sucks and so that's one of the reasons why cannabis legalization news will be here for a bit because these things won't play out over the course of like a fortnight it's it's going to take years miggy is still on the phone so let's move on to the next thing no more urine tests no more urine tests proposed california law would end most workplace marijuana tests again i mean just so dumb just drug test right like yeah i mean the point they have to do random drug tests proves that you can't identify a a consumer of recreational drugs i mean as an employer unless that person's [ __ ] up and then if that person's [ __ ] up then you you take other precautions but writing rejections just don't find [ __ ] nope they you know i mean if they really want random drug tests i think that's fine let's start with the legislature see what they're on and then after that we'll see if we could do it to the people that aren't making any money or like getting a whole bunch of subsidies from the federal government in the terms of um pensions and other fringe benefits okay new legislative bill that's ending a common employment practice five years after californians voted to legalize recreational cannabis in which privacy companies can require workers to test for marijuana use it's assembly bill 1256 introduced by assemblyman bill quirk a democrat of hayward and he has intended to prevent employers from using past evidence of marijuana use such as hero or urine as justification for discrimination against an employee such as denying or terminating employment yeah zero tolerance is a shitty policy overall it's been a shitty policy you know since the reagan era like that it it's why what well a lot of the times it'll have to do with like where does the company get its money from if a lot of it is coming from the federal government they may still have to do the zero tolerance policy as conditions of getting uncle sugar's money and a result of that that's one of the reasons why those types of tests are still done prevalently a lot of people just don't like wheat no i get it it just it bothers me because like my son he asked me or he was saying you know i wanna because he wants to go in the military when he graduates high school and uh he's like i can't wait till i joined the military and hopefully by that time uh the perception of cannabis because of everything that he sees me talking about with morocco and everything he's like maybe it'll be legal then i was like you know i was like even if it's legal tomorrow still another five six years until attitudes and you know zero tolerance happen overnight it's it's [ __ ] up that it's harder to free a man than it is to create a law to put everybody behind bars yeah it's it's harder to get people to accept facts like there's no like this isn't this isn't something to debate and we need more research it's like no no uh we discovered a nandabide in in march 22 fourth of 1992 it's only 29 years old we figured out how this plant worked fairly recently and now we are dang sure this is how it works and look at all these recreational legal states right the zombie apocalypse hasn't happened planes aren't falling out crashes aren't happening everywhere i mean economies are actually thriving but i i i mean we live in the family including painkillers by the way uh you know pizza use is up yeah domino stock [ __ ] goes up [ __ ] i mean it's a win-win baby man people feel great people feel great but it's one of those deals where you're dealing with people that don't know the actual objective facts and and you're trying to just get people to understand facts that's it opinions you don't i don't care what your opinion is on marijuana do you know how it works let's have that conversation and so then once you get moved past that conversation they should be like oh well our laws are really [ __ ] stupid right but if they if they don't understand how cannabis works then it's really easy for these losses to continue yeah yeah and they don't understand also why can't prohibition exist like that you know we have to constantly educate like yes it's all based off it idiocy nothing scientific based it's all racial uh propaganda uh there's nothing legitimate about why prohibition exists like there's no saving the people it's about controlling the people you know it's about controlling the people and uh speaking of control though or no longer uh be a judge of your moral character when the administration marijuana would not count against immigrants good moral character under new congressional bill thank [ __ ] god i mean this is immigrant submission to prior marijuana use can no longer be used to deny them u.s citizenship under a new congressional bill representative brandon boyle a democrat from pennsylvania filed the legislation on monday it addresses a part of the federal immigration policy that's concerning concerns establishing good moral character because yeah everybody already hears good moral character as part of a national application yep they were using our cannabis laws in immigration for decades as something to justify uh you know revoking your uh your visa and deporting you yeah so i'm glad to see that they are introducing uh bills to try to change that this is one of the aspects of the more act that gets into it so like now it looks like they're you know breaking off that piece because the more act is a very large you know bill that they contemplated and and it was going to amend the immigration naturalization act to uh get rid of a lot of the references to marijuana which can prevent people from you know getting their visa or becoming naturalized and they said they're also going to have another the congressman's bill specifically cars out an exemption for applicants who admitted to have using possessed or distributed cannabis and then it would also remove another stigmatizing question that the united states citizenship and immigration services asked you on some of those forms when you're trying to get naturalized have you ever been a habitual drunkard which will no longer appear on uh the questions as well that's an old-timey [ __ ] holy crap have i been a habitual drunkard well yes but like my job was to be a drunk at uh disneyland and it's it's what they paid me for you know i'm the town trunk okay i gotta jump out for a second all right you do that and i'll say uh you know boyle the the rep that sponsored this he said these questions are wholly unrelated to citizenship and it's extremely troubling to see federal applications like this that continue to use a harsh and antiquated terms such as habitual drunken this careless language only serves to reinforce societal stigmas and misunderstandings about substance abuse and it's time that we matter modernize the process that is pretty darn awesome uh let's let's move on to the new vaporizer shipping band impacts the industry and high times is now reporting that the preventing of online sales of e-cigarettes the children act which approved by the congress last december states the ups can no longer handle vape product shipments check out the video that we've done on this it's called the delta 8 vape ban and so the delta 8 vape ban we're going to do some more content on in the next uh two three weeks because it goes into effect on the 26th of this month however it will not really really start catching up to the people that are probably going to continue to sell these things online for another 90 days or so it's not like you want to be on that list tune in for more on that and so yeah what they did was they defined this electronic nicotine delivery system in such a broad way that it would also encompass for no real good reason uh uh vapes and this is a delta eight vape find them at your local head shop that'll probably be where most of them are being sold in a month so they're saving the children that's awesome save those children no longer will anybody be buying e-cigarettes online especially children you know that's one of the reasons why i have not given my daughter a credit card yet because kids don't know how to get into the goddamn uh dark web which i know they know like this is a failed attempt again being another [ __ ] daddy state you know whatever you want to say and then like you see how it's defined and you're like ah crap this is gonna fall straight into what a vape cartridge is and did they intend to do it no they didn't but like it's one of those things where it's so overly broadly defined and says that this nicotine electronic nicotine delivery system is any product that delivers nicotine flavor or any other substance to a user inhaling from the device delta 8 or cbd um so does this mean so like the product itself like the empty cartridge the empty battery cartridge right empty no product in it can that not be shipped to you then as a company because really this doesn't really affect any recreational markets because they're not doing interstate commerce anyways right but no it's basically what it means it's not going to be able to be shipped to you uh using the post office there's maybe like one very small exception but that's kind of like if you're shipping in between friends uh and you're only going to do that like 10 times a year and it's like very small uh and even then they might give you [ __ ] if you try to like mail it but there's going to be uh mail regulations that are coming out about april 27th and then we'll see uh yeah i just anticipate a lot of the and you're seeing it right now like all the delta eight products are starting to evolve a little bit away from the vape carts for example now they're taking a lot of cbd flour and then they take the delta eight and they spray the cbd flour uh and so now you have this blended product where you have delta eight plus you also have cbd for the entourage effect and and what is it it's flour you can mail it but it also delta eight so it's in demand or you're seeing drizzlers uh you know which is essentially like the liquid stuff in here but then you're going to have to be like trying to refill your own vapes and that's going to get frustrating so you just go down the street to the vape shop and buy yourself a delta egg cart well i'm saying like well someone in the recreational market that i see you know they're i don't think there's any change to those guys like because they're not shipping their [ __ ] out there's we don't have any mailing options so you know washington's safe in that market yeah i think you know i mean it just seems like it does hurt all the cbd people who are trying to be on that gray market on the edge right it seems like you see it's either you're in the uh recreational market or you're traditional or you know that's it yeah the healthcare market is uh we'll see we'll see the next farm bill you know in 2022 farm bills coming out we'll see if that addresses delta yeah thousands of california marijuana convictions officially reduced others dismissed good stuff man last month with the stroke at penn san diego county superior court judge eugene a gonna kill it i hire a bead nearly 26 000 people with belly utility marijuana convictions on their records had them reduced to misdemeanor convictions i wonder if i'm one of them i wonder if i had to apply for that that's where most of my arrests were at night in addition to the thousand people rested i'm so proud of you for being arrested for weed well underannounced was a misdemeanor when i was younger so twice twice well you know that would make me a social equity applicant yeah in the first time uh i got pulled over and i've always been honest with cops like my activism comes down to like good policing and stuff like that like uh the first time uh actually three times i got pulled over the first time honest the cop cop lets us go takes our bag and dumps it out but gives me back my pipe it says don't smoke and drive uh second time uh i got pulled over for an out brake light and then i had five cop cars come up in my car after i was already honest with the cop with an eighth like hey this is what i got you didn't catch el chapo and then next thing i'm in the back of the car freaking out like what the [ __ ] i was honest with you and uh he's like i'm gonna kick you in if you keep it up then uh yeah i mean just these just petty stuff you know the third time again under an ounce so they're not gonna like take me in they're they're looking for the bigger boys and uh you always gotta like know your role right know your rights type [ __ ] yeah let's talk about your rights in florida you know where rights can very often go to die go florida not only not only can your rights go to die there but good luck trying to get unemployment in florida so let's let's talk about florida should marijuana legalization limit thc probably not but it's happening according to forbes uh thc of course is the most famous cannabinoid out there however a lot of these types of states are trying to cap thc they try to do it in washington state with extracts so state legislatures in florida have proposed a 10 thc limit on smokable flour and a 16 thc limit on edibles still sold in the state's medical marijuana marketplace let's talk about why that is ludicrous go for it oh governing nature i mean just the whole nature and so you're going to force people to pick it when it's not ripe which again that's not necessarily going to help the patient achieve the uh entourage effect of the whole plant that you're looking for moreover it it continues to like over emphasize the importance of thc you know that even a 30 thc plant is fine hash has been around for thousands of years and so has keith for thousands of years and been way way stronger than uh 10 or 30 percent flour we've been fine and then the 16 thc limit on edibles is that by weight because that's insane you know because if this thing weighs a gram does that mean that i can have 160 milligrams of thc in there that is like an elephant-sized dose of an edible right there and florida's had medical for how many years now uh florida's had medical for i have no idea i want to say it was about the same time that illinois maybe a little no 2016 i think they actually finally passed it because they had to pass it twice because they had to get over 60 percent so i think it was 2016 and like all the licenses are not that old like 2017 and stuff and then truly just access to capital and took over but why is florida so florida like i mean like what's the point like what happened who got hurt here that like now we gotta capture it like what is going on and you're gonna kill the genetics of florida like i think don't think people are understanding like your state is legalish you are you have a chance to be on the forefront of like genetics and appellations like we talked about like if people were to start like okay we can start having this florida sunshine or whatever you want to call it you know there's prime opportunities for your state to pull in a [ __ ] ton of money right you're not going to do that with limiting goddamn thc caps and [ __ ] [ __ ] regulations right i mean like the only thing that that thc cap would do is make the illicit market just fine they'd be like hey i'm going to go back out to the street to buy it why because that stuff will get you high this stuff gives me a headache because they're going to have to do something to that flower to get it down to there i mean like a one-to-one blend maybe that's all you would be able to get and then you have to be watching that ten percent um and so there's there's that aspect and then it's like some of these medical patients need higher thc concentrations i'm glad that they have it inedible but they probably want to also be able to inhale it yeah dabs i mean concentrates or anything uh straight back to the weed man you know yeah that's it i mean uh where's where's moral beach at myrtle beach i always thought was in south carolina but i have no idea okay because uh i don't know if uh because we're getting close to the end here but the horrible story you're talking about is the uh the war on weed leaves one myrtle beach man paralyzed cost 11 million in landmark civil rights case wow so home surveillance video showed in april 2015 a team of heavily armed officers used a battering ram to enter julian benton's myrtle beach home to execute a search warrant three officers fired 29 times [ __ ] kid johnny mccoy julian benton's attorney said they hit him nine times effectively crippling him paralyzing him he had multiple surgeries and still can't walk and then they lied to cover it up yep south carolina south carolina's finest demonstration of not understanding that weed is harmless now this is this is just horrible uh i don't know if you're familiar with j cole the the rapper uh he had a song called neighbors and uh he actually uses actual video footage from his house of officers raiding his house because they thought he was a grow operation opposed to a rap studio is what he had in his goddamn basement so they thought the power was going to growing weed as opposed to growing beets yeah yeah i can't wait to nicholas i'm looking forward to the high mighty i gotta get the puns out now i don't want to embarrass myself when he gets here i want to be all a fan boy some of the questions about 1985. you know uh let's go let's do chong's weed through the decades so we're going back to the 60s where were you smoking all right were we puffing on that i could imagine that you remember blueberry coming into the scene and then i wonder what his criteria though for having to grow now because you know part of what the circuit he's going on is he's got the uh the new chong line out and uh and then chicha says has a line too if we could cheat each other after chong and then we'll be like john was blaming you for everything is that true right and then we'd ask to teach the exact same goal that never mind we'll have fun but like hopefully enough hopefully enough yeah that's pretty fun man to it man it's going to be a lot of fun this is our first show we did over 20 000 subs you know yeah we can't we can't stop until we have more subscribers in peoria illinois hilarious and so we're talking i think 115 000. so like what in a year it depends like i uh i got sick there last week or last month and then um and now the website's down so don't visit us at campus legalization oh canvas industry lawyer cannabis legalization news is still online uh and so you know in a few more months hopefully we can start messing around with more um shows that are like directly related to trending national news uh yeah that's one of the ways that you get a lot of suggested videos and just a crapload of views and so you know if there's something that comes out that we think it'll actually break you do a quick video about it or or um other videos about how to get licenses those get smaller views and then they're more localized but it helps us like you know find visitors or viewers that are in those particular jurisdictions that want to get this game oh yeah and then you know uh yeah and then i can't wait for the site to find it up because i do like to do the word stuff right like for people who like to read you know the video thing was just kind of a happy stance of what i like to do like you pulled me into this and now i'm in this dark web of [ __ ] and you know but the words come come visit the website once it gets rocking it's not rocking right now it looks like it looks like it's not pretty right now that's all i can display into it it's not she's not she's under construction folks just just go to the canvas legalization news and be like in work you know but uh you know one step at a time and the the site was pretty big and so like it was going really really well and then i just tipped over and dived uh which is terrible you know but at the same time it's a lot of fun that we still gotta have the channel yeah no this is great i mean [ __ ] we got 90 people hanging out with us and i [ __ ] love it you know i look forward to our moments you know i mean there's gonna be lots more news coming and uh just take it one day at a time man that's it there's always something to talk about i told you man yeah like that was one of the things do we already talk about the bakery licenses no ah the bakery licenses i can't wait for these things to be a thing like you know everybody's like oh i want to open up a weed restaurant you know where you can make these types of infused dishes and i'm just held on there bro uh that's not how this works they all have to be pre-packed and like you know pre-dosed and all that and then there's really not a consumption lounge license type that's out there yet like where do you go in washington where do you go in seattle down the street to smoke a bowl with your boys or like your friends you know like where do you go yeah no there's no place uh you know and in uh the park right like i mean i'm endorsing public smoking but it's it's decrimed here at the point that's what i'm saying like that's why prohibition is so important ending prohibition is so important so law enforcement can worry about the [ __ ] that's important and not some guy smoking a joint with his friends in the corner of a park you know well and then the guys would have an opportunity to smoke their joints somewhere else yeah yeah if i had if we had well we used to have lounges during medical times but it'll happen again you know so but yeah that's the next step there's a lot of levels to this uh regulation that needs this infrastructure that needs to happen uh want to take the listener mill all right let's do one question if we have one question but then i got to have a call about the websites yep we got whitney city gardens on instagram ass i find myself in the new illinois speaker of the house's district do you think there's any value of lobbying him to fix her cannabis laws any strategic tips to change this [ __ ] because honestly the cannabis regulation feels like it's poorly written and being poorly rolled out um all right so the new speaker actually introduced a bill on this and uh well he introduced a bill that would have increased the ownership of amounts of craft grows from three to ten and so if anything it would have allowed fewer operators to own all of those licenses which are the most accessible cannabis cultivation license currently in the state of illinois uh that's not a good sign if anything it looked like that was an mso bill like you know multi-operators like hey one craft grow that's that's okay but that's only 14 000 square foot flowering i want um and so can i own ten of them is that okay if i can own ten uh and and that's the bill that that representative ford introduced i can't remember what h b it is off the top of my head but it was like ew ew did he introduce a bill that says hey 5 000 square feet is too much we need a micro cultivation license of only 500 plants no he did not he wanted to increase the amount of ownership to essentially allow for greater m a amongst the uh current caps of three licenses he wanted that raised to ten what's the small do you guys have small associations there like like they do like they did in rhode island where they fought that one no nobody has license just seems to me that you guys need more um uh we call it uh community gathering type things you know we do there's a lot of work to do in illinois but uh i know we gotta get out of here so thanks for tuning in everyone make sure you like and subscribe to keep up with all cannabis legalization news we'll see you on sunday you", "AXRpft2eDFE": "hi I'm Jackie childs and today we're cooking with cannabis I'm making cannabis infused brownies with cannabutter your butter your coconut oil whatever you're infusing whatever sort of fat throw it into the into the crock-pot let it melt then add your D carbs cannabis to D carb this I've ground it up lightly you don't want to kill it you don't want to pulverize it just lightly grind your cannabis this is three and a half grams and I put it in the oven on 240 for one hour this is what it looks like when it comes out of the crock-pot now that is the infused butter like so this comes off that's my butter the infuse this is what I cook with and you can put it on bread like bread and butter whatever this is the actual psychoactive THC infused butter okay I'm just gonna preheat the oven if I can find it there we go to 350 so while I'm mixing the ingredients the ovens preheating a lot of just a lot of edibles that you make with cannabis get really dry so you're gonna you need the extra oil coconut oil or butter spray everything if you're making edibles brownies cookies whatever you're making make sure that everything's sprayed so I'm gonna mix my dry and now this is my brown sugar and I have a one solid it's a packed cup of brown sugar into the bowl and my flour it's 3/4 of a cup of flour four ounces of semi-sweet chocolate my brownies will work out to be 10 to 12 milligrams each and anything under 10 milligrams is considered a micro dose I'm gonna add my pinch of salt to this 2 tablespoons of cocoa when you're cooking with cannabis there is often that weedy tastes that taste so the vanilla helps break that down a bit and it's not as not as noticeable and I'm adding 3 a 3 large whoo this is my half a cup of infused can of butter I'm just gonna give this a quick microwave because it should be melted to blend in oh it's perfect so this is a half a cup of infused cannabutter [Music] you can use a mini ice-cream scoop or a melon baller spoon works just fine this is going to make two dozen brownies 350 for 15 minutes so I'm gonna let these cool for 12 to 15 minutes because they still sort of they rise they still are baking so I want them to settle and to cool down before we transfer them to the plate and I add a little bit of icing sugar and like I said earlier the icing sugar and the vanilla is sort of to offset if there is any really taste to them [Music]", "9-8Etzgd-lc": "with cannabis edibles and extractables becoming legal later this year there's going to be a wide range of new products hitting store shelves with an exclusive look at what we should expect this October we're joined now by B and M Bloomberg's David George cos you've got a great piece on our website with all of these details but tell us what to expect so Canadians should expect a big laundry list of new products to hit the cannabis store shelves this October when they should be formally legalized a total to be exact of 17 new products and that ranges from concentrates beverages edibles and topicals there's a very long list I'm not going to say what every one of these 17 products are although we have something that you'll see up on our screen right there but this is going to really dramatically increase the scope of the cannabis market here in Ontario and we've been talking about for the past several months on the sluggish start there's been supply shortages there's been issues in terms of retail rollout but now the the actual amount of products we can disclose is going to expand fourfold from what we currently have on the market that's going to be great for producers in terms of sales figures and and the interest generated by that but it's also going to square up the legal market with the illicit market so there's been a lot of discussion how the illicit market the black market is still flourishing but once you're gonna have the same products that the black market already has in place these will be formally regulated you know great hopefully great products that will that we'll be able to squeeze out that black market player and and really generate a lot more revenue for for these cannabis producers I have so many questions please okay the first one is I understand a producer making cannabis and then selling that cannabis but when we're talking about chocolates and candies are the cannabis companies we talk about like all these hot stocks they know how to make chocolate sinan how to make candy they're learning - okay sure and and we've got facilities and they're doing that and they are yeah that's right one example I just want to bring up is Organa Graham which is a Moncton New Brunswick based cannabis producers one of the top ten in Canada and of their their capacity they've hired a specialty kitchen and they're building a special chocolate food processing plant for this particular product to have cannabis infused chocolates hit the market this October and that's just one example can't be growth the biggest cannabis company in the world is putting the finishing touches on their bottling line in Smiths Falls Ontario \u00e1free\u00e1 down in Leamington has a very high-tech automated facility to process a lot of these concentrate materials such as rosin and wax and Shatter descriptions you can read in my story I don't think we have enough time to really describe what each one of these are but but there's going to be the second wave of Canada's products it's going to be very exciting for the industry and now we have a little bit of clarity on what exactly these products are going to be and then what about the marketing like we did all this coverage around what the products could look like when we had legalization and there are some restrictions from the government on what what things can look like they're about candy and chocolate or like we're moving into an area where it's all about the packaging and the colors and the fancy titles what's the balancing act they're like well as it stands a lot of these packaging requirements are going to be that that we see for flour products are going to be set in place for these edibles and extractables nothing's really going to change as far as the proposed draft regulations go you're still going to have a very significant warning label as well as a very you know large warning sign that this is a cannabis product which is going to be bigger than the actual brand itself there is a lot of lobbying going on right now between these producers and the industry and the government to see if there's a middle ground that they can say look we get it we don't want to make sure that these products are going to be marketed to children however you have to be a little bit flexible in terms of how it can actually market this to the Canadian consumer this is a huge thing I think about I mean as much as there's demand for it I do have this fear about you know kids somehow mistaking this stuff the other question I wanted to ask you and I'm serious about this a lot of the CEOs have said they're not cannabis users are they trying these products because if taste is important now with edibles shouldn't they be like seeing if this stuff tastes good isn't that going to be the first thing the people who haven't tried edibles before think about when they're consuming this can of yeah that's tastes good it's like when you're the king and you have like a royal tester to make sure that the soup that you have is employees in there you want to make sure that so these are good so you know it's it's that's a hard question for me to answer I just they're gonna be out there they're gonna talk about how great their product is but if they haven't tried their product so so I did a story a while back for the BNN Bloomberg website we're about two-thirds of Canadian cannabis CEOs actually do use cannabis okay so a lot of that being said every one of these companies also has a very significant Quality Assurance Department where there's someone hired and their only job is to test all the cannabis products out there the company's own as well as their competitors yeah to make sure that their quality is up to stuff and as well that they're you know they're competitors aren't doing better than they are so there are people out there and making sure that what they what they're producing is actually good product I was going to say in fairness like we're talking about Tyson Foods earlier I didn't say does the Tyson's food CEO eat chicken or meat but I'm just curious about it", "Aotdu2xu6lc": "hey everyone my name is Lauren Gao and this is life above the clouds and today we are going to talk about decarboxylation I know that sounds really complicated but it's really just the process of heating our cannabis to release THC in a form that our bodies can use one of my favorite things about cooking with cannabis is that we can use the buds and can use the leaves we can use the stems we can use everything so here I just have some trim and I'm gonna spread it out into my baking sheet that's already lined with foil we can actually just think of this as roasting herbs to maximize their flavor if you really want to learn about the science of decarboxylation I will leave a link and the description below so we have our trim spread out nice and evenly I don't like to grind my trim and a food processor beforehand I actually like to have pretty large chunks I just want to make sure that all of my pieces are roughly the same size when you grind in a food processor I find that you're gonna get some pulverized dust along with some larger chunks so personally I like just breaking it up and my hands and spreading it out and this looks perfect to me so we are going to put this in the oven at 225 degrees for 60 minutes that's it you can store your decarboxylated cannabis in an airtight container for up to six months and now it's ready to use in any of your cannabis infusions thanks for watching life above the clouds be sure to

series my name is chef Cody Lindsay and today we are making tincture cannabis tincture is the oldest form of dispensing cannabis as the medicine and it's super simple all it is is alcohol 80 proof or higher with cannabis added into it the THC will dissolve off the flour into the tincture and off you go today we're gonna be using shish kebob as well as CBD God bud so any kind of alcohol you want to use right now we're gonna make that two different kinds we're going to make a clear one and then we're gonna make a dark one and we're going to use it in two separate applications that they should show you that you're gonna use in your cooking so we're gonna start here with the dark rum one cup and then we're gonna go with gin I chose gin because it's a nice fruity kind of flavor it's not too overpowering it's the same thing a cup so we're gonna use the CBD in with the dark rum because the application that we're going to use in we're not going to want it too high in THC so we're just going to add that in there 3.5 grams of cannabis into the one cup of dark rum and then we are also going to add 3.5 grams of cannabis into this one cup of gin and that's as easy as it is all you do is put the lid back on give it a stir put the lid back on give it a stir strain after 24 hours and you're done we're gonna make some beautiful vanilla extract we have our dark rum here kind of in the same way that we made the tincture is the same way we're gonna make the vanilla extract all we're gonna do is cut our vanilla beans in half dump them in close the lid about a month later you'll have the best vanilla extract you've ever tasted in your whole life and the next one we're going to create cannabis infused sugar so we already have our gin tincture ready to go we're gonna take two tablespoons of our gin tincture add it into our two cups of sugar and that's going to give us cannabis infused sugar add that in and then just mix it all around you can see it's starting to come together starting to get a little wet so you simply take that sugar add it onto a pan this is what we're gonna do is we're gonna dry it out we're gonna evaporate some of the alcohol and then we're gonna come back and have it ready now it's ready to be put in a 220 degree oven for approximately half an hour oh yeah perfectly good see the alcohol is evaporated of course the sugars gonna stick together a little bit it's been wet it's been added to some heat to your sugar dish so there you go two tinctures two additional recipes to use of those tinctures and multiple multiple ways you can use them thank you very much for joining us today if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe and share and please visit the walnut soldier calm where you to find many recipes and our cooking with cannabis cookbook then again thanks very much [Music] you", "FSdjvEnyRzk": "what you're watching right now is mark zarlor committing a crime that helps his daughter who cannot help herself 17 years ago Christie's art ler gave birth to twin girls Keely her twin came home first and then three days later Cara followed her and they began the difficult years long task of learning how to treat Cara's cerebral palsy and severe autism this is an anti-psychotic there are antipsychotics and enzymes and sleep aids but few things helped fight off the worst of her symptoms that could sometimes go on for hours pretty much on a daily basis we have some sort of episode when it's heating up I turn off the fan I have a level eighth of a teaspoon when Mark found the one thing that could stop his daughter he made this video to show the world it takes six deep breaths and a father's dedication [Music] let me up okay [Music] are the videos the truth right that's typical of what we see a neighbor first suggested years ago that cannabis could ease Kara's symptoms mark then found that by grinding marijuana buds and heating them to 410 degrees Fahrenheit it created an immediate rescue response to his Donner's most violent behavior and by 10 she's usually back out here enjoying annoying life again for several years we were in fear of using it trying it giving it to her having it but now there is no fear for those artless who risked everything by posting the video of mark illegally treating Kara that more than 12,000 people have seen and by talking to us I just I got to the point where we looked at the law and said the law is not going to change unless somebody Gamble's in his post mark asks the Texans call their state senators demanding a public hearing on Senate bill 269 it would expand the access of patients with debilitating illnesses to use medical marijuana for Kara that law could make moments of calm come legally and if showing what works for her puts mark in jail so be it [Music] just saying if we want to make a difference for ourselves and for you know other kids like Cara we just hit somebody has to take the risk he's another father who'll do anything for his daughter [Music]", "PtzodN8zSxU": "- No question, the cannabis industry is ahead of almost every other industry\nbecause of its general youth and pure bred entrepreneurship. You've got your perspective. I just want to be happy. Don't you wanna be happy? I love starting with the macro and then going into the micro. My college friends are\ngonna laugh their asses off that I'm on the cover of your magazine, because literally their four-year quest in college was to get me\nto smoke a blunt with them. So this is unbelievably deja vu for me. I grew up not drinking\nbeer, or wine, or alcohol, yet, I became an\nunbelievable expert at 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, on the consumer of that product. So it's unbelievable to me in the macro that it's so obvious that the\ncannabis industry is heading in an incredibly\ninteresting consumer place over the next half century. And I'm not in a rush to make predictions or known everything just yet, 'cause this is a real marathon for me. I'm 42 years old, and I think that some of\nmy most intriguing thoughts or observations, or accomplishments within the industry literally may happen in 30 or 40 years. - [Andrea] So, Gary, are both\nof your folks still alive? - Yeah, they are. They're pretty young actually. They're 64 and 62, so they're young. - [Andrea] What will they think about you being on the cover of a cannabis magazine? - You know my mom was\nsuper propaganda'd out by Nancy Reagan. So she was super hardcore, like, say no to drugs. And so I think, look, I think my parents know, first of all, the great thing about my parents is, and I just spent a week with them because of vacation. They're very thoughtful, meaning, like, I genuinely believe with my heart and soul that cannabis is a far better\nthing for so many human beings than a lot of the things that are legal in the United States, on a federal level. And so my parents are thoughtful that way. My mom can get caught\nup in the stigma of it. I think right now if you actually\nlike lie detector test me, here's what I would say, my mom would be like, \"Hmm.\" And my dad would be like, \"He's a genius. \"That's gonna work out.\" Which is really interesting, 'cause that would be\nliterally the opposite of almost everything else. My mom is my greatest cheerleader and thinks I'm a genius. But I definitely think, I'm telling you Nancy Reagan got to her. - [Andrea] Well, Nancy\nReagan was a smart lady. She had a message to\nsend and she did it well. That's for sure. - No question. - [Andrea] So, at some point before 2012, you had the realization\nthat corporate America was slow to pick up on\ncontent strategy trends. Do you think cannabis is\nmaking a similar mistake? - No, actually I think cannabis, from my observation early on, is really good at it, because you have such young entrepreneurs who are native to that communication. I think the platforms;\nFacebook, Google, and such, don't let them advertise in all the ways they wish they could. But actually I think the cannabis industry is going to be the teacher\nof innovation to a lot of, I view the cannabis industry the way I view Procter\nand Gamble and Coca Cola, consumer package goods. And I think that from, you know, obviously\ndepending on what happens at a federal state level, but I think they're going\nto innovate and show. I mean, I'm very comfortable\nmaking this prediction. In 2040, cannabis companies\nare gonna be the ones influencing the way diapers, and tires, and soda, and\nshampoo is being sold. - [Andrea] So you often say\nthat people aren't marketing in the year that they live in. Any advice for cannabis companies wanting to market their\nbrands in 2018 and beyond? - Well, you know, again, they can't run the paid\nadvertising on Facebook and YouTube that I want them to. So it's about influencer\nmarketing and organic creative within the Facebook, since we have Snapchats of the world. The end. And I'll say this again. No question, the cannabis industry is ahead of almost every other industry, because of its general youth\nand pure bred entrepreneurship. - [Andrea] You said that one thing that scares the fuck out\nof you are nice watches and Ferraris. What is one piece of advice\nyou would give to someone who is motivated by material possessions? - You know, to really create\ncontext around that statement, anybody who buys a nice\nwatch, or a Ferrari, or a big house because\nthey're disguising insecurity, is my great fear. Using material things to put a bandaid on your emotional\nshortcomings is very scary. And so my piece of advice is, figure out that buying\na $900 Supreme backpack isn't gonna trick the smartest people. - [Andrea] And I was watching, I think it was your South\nby Southwest talk last year, or might've even been in 2016. And you often talk about the\nmarathon versus the sprint, and how building a plan\nis more advantageous than spreading your, and focusing on one location, but trying to, essentially,\ngrow too big for your britches. I guess I'm just curious on, I'd like to hear more, like the importance of branding and what advice you'd give, and how people can do it well. - You know, I think you and I share this. And I'd be lying if I didn't tell you that I'm aware of a lot of the people that are in the industry, and that my voice is uniquely\nbeneficial to this industry, because you have an\nenormous amount of people in the industry right now that are so obnoxiously short term, that you want your\nforefathers to be good, right? Because then you have healthier industry. And, so, it's funny. I look at emerging markets, whether it's the emerging gambling market that we're gonna see because\nof the Supreme Court ruling, cryptocurrency, cannabis. What happens in these markets, is often times you get 3% to 4% pioneers and 96% hucksters, right? And there's an obnoxious\namount of hucksters in the cannabis industry now. A, because they just like smoking weed, and they think they're gonna be fucking the Mark Zuckerberg of weed, or, two, 'cause they see it as a trend, and they wanna cash in fast. To me, it's very simple. It's a simple as this: life is actually a marathon. Wouldn't be a good idea\nto train for a marathon? You know, it's that framework. Like be patient. Don't like invest all\nyour money on something that seems like this is the great, this new formation of cannabis\nor hemp is gonna be like, people are chasing a lottery ticket instead of thinking about what\nI want them to think about, which is you have a ton of\n24 years old in the industry, 30 year olds, and saying, \"Okay, I'm gonna\nbe in this for 20 years. \"20 years. \"How am I gonna do that?\" And so that's what I do, right? Like, VaynerMedia is now in year nine. I've only really run it for seven years. I've always thought about it long term. And now it's 900 people. And now it's hundreds of\nmillions of dollars in revenue. And now it's a big thing. But a lot of people that started companies in 2009 through 2011 with me, my homies from Silicon Valley and others, even though they raised\nmillions, and millions, and millions of dollars, their companies are out of business now. Short term thinking. And this industry is, in the same way that the\ncannabis industry over-indexes on really progressive marketing, it also over-indexes on\nunbelievable impatience, and way too many people\ndoing it for the lifestyle, not for the business. - [Andrea] You talk often about the ways to communicate with the world. Like, so, you write, you've got audio and you've got video. I don't think, for me personally, of course this is just my perspective, that this industry has\ndone a very good job of any of those things. And so what would you like to see? I mean, as an investor in this arena, now that, you know, took up ownership in Green Street, what would you like to\nsee this industry do as far as, you know,\nwriting, audio, and video, to educate the masses, and get people to realize\nwhat cannabis is all about? Because it's different\nthings for different people. - There's two things that aren't\nhappening to your question, one, there's just not\nenough people creating, they're not doing. They're not fucking working. And number two, they're being too ideological and romantic instead of speaking truths. I'm one of the most popular entrepreneurs in our current society, no question. Super proud of that accomplishment. I also find it intriguing\nthat I'm probably the one that talks most about the\nshortcoming of entrepreneurship, and how many fake entrepreneurs there are. I'm not getting high on my own supply. - [Andrea] You're not? - I'm not. You know, I think I'm being\ncritical and thoughtful about the game. And I think that one of the things I see in the cannabis industry, is that no matter what conversation I have with somebody about it, they're one Team Cannabis without seeing any other part of it, right? It's blind buy in. So what I would say is more\nwork and more articles, and audio and video output, and more authentic conversations. Like what are you actually thinking, not what's in the best, like, do you know how many\npeople are just saying things that are in the best\nfinancial interest of them in the short term? - [Andrea] Too many? - Most. - [Andrea] Well, yeah, I mean, so, it's interesting, we're about to start a big project here, where we're gonna really\ncriticize the cannabis community. We're gonna do thick\ninvestigative articles, where we're gonna dive in deep, and we're gonna say, you know what? When people legalized cannabis, they voted for it. They did so under the guys\nwho promised a lot of things. And, so, are we living as a community, and as an industry, and as a sort of new industry, like are we living up to the promises that we put forth? And it will be very\ninteresting to sort of put people's toes in hot water, and asking them hard questions. Because it's very easy\nto sort of sit back, and say-- - I wish you could see the\nsize of my smile right now. I'm so proud of your guys, because it's very hard\nto be in an industry that's this young, and not just become the press\nrelease for the people in it. But what you're actually gonna, is actually bring value to it. I mean, I'm telling you right now, my creative curiosity, my entrepreneurial curiosity, and the fact that I know I\ncan bring real tangible value to this industry, is the only reason you and\nI are talking right now. - [Andrea] I mean, I appreciate your time. I've listened to a lot of your videos, your podcasts that are out there, interviews. And I think you've definitely\ngot something to say. That's for sure. I keep hearing you say\nthat you don't like being sort of pegged as pundit, or a guru, or a motivational speaker. Why is that? And why not? - That's a great question. I don't want that because\nit's not the truth. I spend 85% of my time being an executive of a 900-person, four-office company. And I think it's important, because I only think the truth wins. And so that's number one. Number two, the reason I don't, is 'cause I respect execution too much. And I think that only being a speaker, only being an author, only being a pundit, is pontificating and not doing. And I love to pontificate as\nmy extracurricular activity to my actual doing. I also am even more exciting\nthat my pontifications come from the outputs of my doing. Very simply, I think it's a lot better to take advice from somebody who's done\nthe things they're fucking talking about. - [Andrea] Well, fuck yeah. - Right? It's super hard for me to get fired up about a 20 year old life coach, when they're lived 20 years. It's super fucking, I have a lot of cynicism for somebody who writes a business book when they've been a professor\nat Yale their whole lives. - [Andrea] You talk a lot of about empathy and sort of compassion. And not sort of getting\ninsulted by what other people think of you. Specifically, you always\nsay, like your parents. What do you say to\nsomeone who is constantly very aware of like what\nother people think, and sort of subscribe to that ideology of sort of people-pleasing? I mean, how do you get\nsomeone out of that mindset? - To me, I think the\nonly way you get anybody out of any mindset, is to paint pictures for them to look at that are different from the pictures that they're looking at. And, so, for me, I'm on\nthis constant mission to make people understand, the quickest way to be unhappy in the life is to let somebody else\ndictate your emotions. And the truth is, the people that dictate your emotions tend to be the people\nthat are closest to you, starting with your parents. I mean, it's just fucking real. I mean, are you kidding me? Everybody's issues, everybody's issues is with their parents. Like all of them. Obviously, not every single person. But I'm talking, like, I don't know, 90-something-percent. I mean, it's a real thing, you know? - [Andrea] At one point, when I did my research on you, you sort of critiqued the creatives. But they're necessary. And we need people that are creative, and then we need sort of the test people, so to speak. But what advice, I mean, we're in a creative industry, what we do here at this magazine, there isn't one single person here, maybe other than our finance person, who isn't creative. What advice would you\ngive to creatives in 2018? You know, there's so many options. - Yeah, make more stuff. People less subjective. Recognize that your ego and power trip is the reason that you're\ntrying to be perfect or spending too much time on stuff. We live in a world where you\ncan get instant feedback. We can create a lot more content. There's a lot more distribution. Wrap your head around it. You can't be a creative that\nlives in the subjectiveness of your own point of view. Otherwise you'll become\nobsolete in the environment we now live in. - [Andrea] We don't know much about, like during your personal life, and if you don't wanna\nshare that, that's fine, but what the hell do you do for fun, Gary? - Well, I mean, first of all-- - Other than working. - I mean, I love the New York\nJets more than breathing. So, 16 Sundays during the\nFall and Winter, I love that. I'm a weirdly passionate garage sailor. Like, literally no joke, one of the things that's\nmost fun to me in the world, is to go garage sale-ing and\nbuy shit for like a dollar, and then flip it on eBay for nine. - [Andrea] So you're still working? - What else? I like documentaries. I like playing basketball and tennis. I love spending time with my family. Like uncomfortably. Love that. I love hiphop. - [Andrea] If your wife\ncan tell us the thing that she thinks is the\nmost annoying about you, what would it be? Like do you leave your\ndirty socks on the floor or something? - Yeah, it would be like\ntypical fucking husband shit. Like I'm not paying attention. Like I don't throw out the trash. Like dumb shit. Cliche shit, I think. I mean, look, I travel a lot. So that's real. And I'll tell ya another thing, like no joke. I didn't answer it this way, 'cause I feel like it was a little cliche, but then I'm always drawn to the truth, 'cause I always think it wins. You can't imagine how fucking fun my professional life is to me. You don't understand, I'm a pure bred entrepreneur for real, for real, for real. Like documented. Lemonade stands. Baseball cards. DNF student. Long before this\nentrepreneurship thing was cool, like I was on it. It was me. It's who I was. And I lived the first 20 years of my life scrutinized by adults\noutside of my mom and dad, who said I wasn't good, and I wasn't gonna make it. Instead of entitlement, I was brought up in adversity, which became my strength. I was told that I lost from the get by every adult outside of my parents. So imagine how easy it is for me to deal with adversity, and negativity, and trolling, and setbacks, and pressure, it's the fucking dirt that I come from. - [Andrea] So I read that, yeah, the lemonade stand, baseball card thing, I heard that from you. And you said that you focused on more on making good lemonade stand signs than you did on actually\nmaking good lemonade. Is that an testament to\nwhat you do at VaynerMedia? - No, that was a young Gary. But I will say this, I will say this. I'm gonna answer it a couple ways. No. Over the last 37 years or 35 years, since then I've realized the best product is a very good way to go. However, I've also learned\nthat only the customer gets to decide what the best product is. How many cups of sugar do\nyou like in your lemonade? - [Andrea] I mean, exactly. - Right? So, I think that it's both. And I think that learning\nthat was really good. Does that make sense? - [Andrea] Yeah. So listen. You're gonna be on the cover\nart of our technology issue. It's our inaugural. The first one we've ever done. In that vain, I mean, tech, like, what is something that\nwould like our audience to read on our first ever tech issue? - You mean what else should I, where else should you guys\nlook to fill out the issue? - [Andrea] Sure, yeah. - You should definitely focus\non podcasting and audio. It's very, very real. The other thing is, I do think\na lot of the advancements in the industry have been around the units that are delivering the cannabis. I think there's been a\nlot of innovation in that. I think that's a very good\nplace for you guys to think about like 10 best delivery mechanisms, or however you want to kind of call it. - [Andrea] We're actually\ndoing an article on that. - I love that. I'll tell you. There's a lot to do there. Design of the hardware\naround the industry, I think is very interesting. Even the containers in which the cannabis is being delivered now. Like in drops, and what forms. I think there's a lot\nof technology in that that people don't realize. - [Andrea] The delivery method? - Yeah, just like the vapes and all that. Just the delivery mechanisms, right? And, so, I think there's\na lot to do there. And I would say, I definitely do something\non like 25 best influencers on Instagram around the industry, who aren't hucksters. You know, just being thoughtful, and maybe it's nine or seven. Hey, guys, I actually, uh, I've got a little bit of an emergency I've been holding off for like 10 minutes. If you need more from me, I'm happy to do another\ncall later in the week. I'll have my team set it up. But I've really got to run. I apologize. - [Andrea] Nope, you already gave us more time than we were promised, Gary. Thank you so much.\n- Thank you guys. Take care, bye-bye. - [Andrea] Bye-bye.", "faqr7tt-iwQ": "[Music] hey everybody whether you're a patient of ours or not you probably find some of this information helpful what we did was we just compiled a couple of questions that we get you know more often than other questions we get a lot of questions but these are some of the more popular ones and then this relates obviously to if you're a medical marijuana patient or a prospective medical marijuana patient in Florida home so we can only speak for the state that we you know do registrations and final prescriptions and which is which is Florida there you go dr. Jen if you want to read the first question we often have people come in who have a lot of questions and just confusion about the whole process every state does something a little differently so we get a lot of people coming from other states and that was done a certain way and they come here and it's completely different here so but one of the most common questions we get is it's always preceded by I smoked a joint when I was in high school or I smoked once when I was in college is the medical marijuana the same and will it get me high probably the number one question we get and it's not you know you would think easy yes/no question but it's actually not everything's so regulated compared to years ago when you got whatever you got now it's down to the milligram and the percentages and the strength so you can really dial in exactly what works best for you but just an easy yes or no question if you use enough THC yes you will have psychoactive effects yeah and usually so the conditions that we see you know we see people after they've tried CBD from a gas station it it didn't work for them so they need something medical grade the stuff that works is psychoactive period that's the short answer to that if it's gonna help you with ms yeah it's gonna be cycle because the other thing it's competing with you know our host of strong medications right if you want to compete with a host of strong medications including painkillers and everything else you need something psychoactive so that's the short answer for that and in the state of Florida they make us do umbrellas under or like normal or high THC and low THC anything under low THC is consider the CBD product so those are non psychoactive that's the the one answer to this that's know that yeah you can get medical grade CBD with a medical marijuana card and it really just depends on whether or not you know it's gonna work for you we can't tell you if it's gonna work for you because the research is kind of all over the place so it's a trial and error type of system you know you're kind of the patients in control of their own treatment after we registered for the Carter probably the next most common question we get down here in Florida because of all the snow birds and the part-time residents is can I travel with it absolutely not if you're crossing the state line there are two ways actually getting trouble this way one is if you go into airplane where it's federally I guess federal jurisdiction then it's illegal because federally it's still illegal and two if you're in a car you draw across state lines then you have now gone into federal jurisdiction as well so you cannot travel with it even if the next state is okay with it if you're going from Florida to California you have to buy separate products when you're in California so third question is can you grow your own no can i but wait can kids can my buddy grow some and give it to me in like a little baggie but since I have a card for my doctor says I can smoke weed right can I can I can I do that if it is not in the container from a dispensary than it is illegal okay any product that you get has to be in the container received in for it to be legal also there's a real questions that I get and as he was saying earlier when can I grow mine actually not for there's no gray area with that in Florida and all that right now will there be the future maybe but as a right now no laws tend to work really quickly they do as a right now the law is you cannot operate machinery within two hours of using it so just be mindful of all the walls and stuff and grow with it especially if you're one of the patients that you know are brave enough to come out here and get it here in the beginning we're gonna do another video which I'll link up top and that's going to go over the difference between percentages of THC difference between CBD and THC ratios these are all things you're going to see when you go to a dispensary you're gonna see them on the prescription seventy five percent thirty percent one to four nine to one what does this all mean but click the link and I'll explain we did a whole video just to explain that yeah that's for everything else check back with us regularly and we'll keep you updated [Music]", "fNMQZbsJp8k": "So we're back with my guys\nfrom Canndescent, and we having\na taste test. -What's up, guys? -Going on?

This is -- Think indica all the way down to sativa,\nwhich you got there. Have you ever looked up\na trichome? -With the magnifying glass? -Yeah. Oh, yeah. I do that all the time. Oh, right, right, right. -Good. Good. Good. -I do it every day. You got to go\nright up to your eye. But -- I know. You know I know that, man. Ooh! They got frost on. Okay. So that frost,\ndo you see the little ones -that look like dew drops? -Yes. They are the glandular\ntrichomes, and it's not -- -The genital area? -I'm s-- What's that? -Glandular. -The glandular.

Let's try that one, see -- -You'll like the vaporizer. -These two, I'm-a try these two. -Cool. -Excellent. All right. -So this is --\n-Now what? This is a really cool vaporizer. It's super rugged. -Cheers. -Oh, okay. Cheer, cheer. Hmm. So how much would something\nlike this cost? So this would retail\nfor like $300. It's got 5/8 of flower,\none of each of our types. Our standard 1/8 box would go\nfor about $60 at retail. Hey, man. All this mine, right? -Yeah. -No, I'm serious. Are they? -Absolutely. Yeah. -Are they? For real? -Yeah. Taking care of you. -I'm cool. I'm cool with it.", "hwyhxIThFmg": "hey guys Nick with precision here and today we're gonna be talking about terpenes so we want to understand these compounds what they are how they occur in nature how we're extracting and isolating them so the first thing that I'd like to bring up is terpenes are actually a variety of organic compounds and these organic compounds are naturally occurring in all sorts of areas of nature the main things that you will find terpenes are in is cannabis conifer plants like pine trees spruce things like that are one of the most abundant sources as well as a variety of insects and even some mammals now it's it's interesting these compounds because they serve a variety of different purposes so in plants they're mainly signaling it's signaling for a predator to stay away or for a sweet you know delicious smell to be eaten by a certain mammal and there's kind of this underlying communication standard with these terpenes amongst everything in nature and in the universe and if you start looking at these compounds and where they're placed and what they do it's it's quite amazing the the matrix of what's there with that all being said you have other terpenes that are produced by insects that are produced by by mammals and these are actually produced in some cases biosynthetic aliso in many cases humans produce terpenes biosynthetic Lee meaning within our own body they come endogenously produced and our signaling receptors not only are they signaling mechanisms but they're also biosynthetic building blocks so a good example of this would be squalene and the steroids that are derived from that and things like that you can look into that but it's very very interesting so understanding these molecules and what they do is very very important to understanding why they're valuable to an extraction process and why they're valuable to the cannabis plant and with understanding all of this it's really important to know that they are anti microbials they're anti virals to help keep your body into a homeostasis into that balanced state that we've spoken about before so in many many cases there actually have a lot of similar properties that they exhibit on humans the same way cannabinoids do and the key to all this is that you get this entourage type effect and it's almost like nature's produced and packaged to this perfect little plant and this perfect little combination of terpenes and cannabinoids in order to aid a variety of medical conditions and bring your body back into balance now what we do at precision is we're highly focused around the extraction and isolation of these terpenes the extraction of isolation of these terpenes is a very special process because the molecules in and of themselves whether they're monoterpenes or sesqui terpenes or triterpene there's a bunch of different types of these terpenes but in general they're all very delicate when I say they're very delicate they're very prone to degradation they're very prone to really being diminished or their molecular structure being changed with any sort of heat any sort of excessive stress will say to that molecule without getting into overly technical terms so what we're trying to do from an extraction process is extract these very very gently extract them in a very low temperature and and do that in a manner that is going to actually render that molecule unadulterated in that extract well we commonly end up with as a process for extracting cannabis and extracting these terpenes that uses a very light hydrocarbon mainly butane or propane but most cases moving more towards a propane dominant blend not only we do do we do do that but we also actually take the plant and harvest the plant when it has peak terpene content and the peak terpene content ultimately is extracted with these very light hydrocarbons and we get this soupy sort of saucy type mixture and the key to this is being able to remove that solvent because that solvent is a very light hydrocarbon for example propane can boil off at negative 41 degrees and what we'll actually do is we'll just apply a very light heat so it'll be enough heat to remove the solvent but not enough heat to disturb or degrade any of those terpenes ultimately we can centrifuge those terpenes and separate them from the cannabinoids because the the two layers obviously separate able by the centrifugal force and we have a purified terpene compound and there can obviously be further from chromatography purification steps and things like that but isolating and extracting these cannabis-based terpenes are a key value stream and it's interesting to know that you can isolate these terpenes from many different types of plants now one of the things I said when we when we started out was conifer trees were one of the most abundant sources of terpenoids or terpenes in the in the world right now that that we know of and basically you get very high levels of Alpha and Beta Pi Neen that's why a pine tree alpha and beta piney and you can obviously put that one together but they also have things in there like limonene and lena law and these other different terpenes that kind of make this perfect package and turpentine ironically is mainly alpha and beta pining and it's used as an in cleaning a cleaning agent antiviral antibacterial and insecticide and for a variety of other uses works really well as a solvent in addition so the question is why can't we just isolate these terpenes from these high concentrated areas like say conifer trees and combine them back into cannabis well the answer is is that many state laws actually restrict the use of outside terpenes or non cannabis derived terpenes to be entered back into a cannabis based product so for example in states where we have like a metric system that has a traceability throughout the entire we'll call it seed to sale of the of the cannabis value stream they want those terpenes to be extracted isolated from the original cannabis crop and them to be re-used and re-entered into ultimately that suite of products that's going to be sold so understanding terpenes what they are what they do this level of science how to extract them isolate them refine them very very important to an extraction business it's very very relevant particularly in the cannabis space because most states don't allow for the use of outside terpenes to be reconstituted into a cannabis based product for traceability purposes so with that all being said I really hope you enjoyed our short talk today on terpenes hope you have a better understanding of what they are how they're relevant how they can aid in human health and conditions and how they are specifically relevant to the cannabis industry and how we use them within canvas thanks so much for watching we'll see you on the next video", "hOybxMsJIkk": "welcome back in this video we're going to be taking a look at different cannabis etfs so we're going to be taking a look at six of the largest cannabis etfs the reason why it was so important for me to make this video is because the quality of these etfs varies very significantly so unlike other sectors where you can buy different etfs and have relatively similar performance in cannabis you can buy one etf and do very very well and then buy another and do very poorly so we're going to take a look at all the different etfs within the space so the six etfs that we'll be reviewing here today will be mj we'll be looking at msos we'll be looking at yolo hmmj and thcx so without further ado let's hop into this and what we'll be looking at with these companies we're going to take a look if they're actively managed or if they track an index uh we're going to take a look at the management expense ratio how much you're actually paying to hold the etfs we're going to take a look at how much each fund has under management and most importantly this is what we'll be mainly focusing on is the holdings in the fund i don't mind paying a higher fee if the holdings are higher quality so ultimately that's going to be the determining factor of how these funds rank and as always i'm not a financial advisor this is not financial advice this is made to be entertaining purposes only so to start it off might as well go in alphabetical order here starting off we have hmmj management expense ratio of 0.86 with assets under management of 684 million fun fact this was actually the first cannabis etf ever launched uh so what we're going to be looking at here we're not going to be looking at uh if the fund is tradable or the short-term opportunities we're really going to be focusing in on the long-term sustainability of these funds we're going to be taking a look at the actual fundamentals of the underlying holdings within these funds so because hmmj is listed on the toronto stock exchange it actually limits them from owning companies that operate in the u.s but we will still look at this objectively for what it is which is a canadian fund so starting off with their largest holding canopy growth definitely the best canadian operator seemingly the only canadian operator with a meaningful strategy to enter the states uh through acreage and terrace end so without a question the best canadian operator in my opinion uh aphria not super crazy about afria not a terrible operator either uh i'm kind of neutral on afria kronos only thing holding this company together seemingly is the ultria partnership other than that company doesn't seem like it has too much going for them uh gw pharma definitely a great company no complaints there same with iipr big fan of that company these are gw pharma is more of a research related company and ipr is a reit in the states uh that is listed on the new york stock exchange uh scott's miracle grow not really a cannabis company more of a fort fertilizer company only one third of the revenues actually come from cannabis then we have tilray which is merging with aphria village farms probably one of the highest quality cannabis operators as well and then everything under that is relatively small holdings just looking through it we have aurora hexo organogram sundial none of these am i too crazy about um so those definitely take away from the fun but the top holdings are all looking all right as far as canadian operators go next up we have hmus listed on the neo exchange that's when you don't hear too often this is also managed by horizon management expense ratio higher at one percent so now on the flip side from hmm j's uh fund uh hmus is actually 100 in the states so this one i am a much bigger fan of if you're looking at the holdings uh they own some great multi-state operators you have columbia care green thumb true leaf cresco cure leaf paris and jucie all of these names i am a big fan of uh charlotte's web i'm so so on acreage as well uh tuscan holdings is a spack as far as i'm uh aware uh you have air and liberty which are going to merge hopefully within the next uh within the next quarter uh but just looking through the holdings here everything looks fine i'm not seeing anything that sticks out as a really bad holding other than med men at a very low weighting of 0.75 so overall this is a great uh fund only thing that i'm not crazy about here is that it is uh traded on the neo uh so definitely a lot less liquidity than some of the funds that would be listed on the toronto stock exchange or on the new york stock exchange so now next up we have mj for some reason this is the largest cannabis etf in the world assets under management of nearly 1.8 billion with a management expense ratio of 0.75 percent so aside from hmmj which i feel did a great job building a canadian portfolio uh mj we'll take a look at their holdings here uh so you have aphro tilray as a quarter of the whole portfolio not sure why they would have that above canopy grove but they have that as the top holding then we have gw farm growgen that's all fine and then that this is where we run into a hiccup we have chronos aurora hexo and organogram as relatively large positions in the portfolio which i'm not too crazy about now to take a look at msos managed by advisor shares this one currently has assets under management of 684 million which has ballooned since they initially launched with a management expense ratio of 0.75 now if we look at msos's holdings it's actually very similar to what i have as my top 10 cannabis stocks for 2021. i'll actually link that video down below so you can take a look but this is very similar to what i have here so this portfolio is a hundred percent listed in the states and it's quality so you have green thumb cure leaf true leaf and cresco as the big four those are forty percent of the portfolio and then you have all your tier two names that you'd want uh so you have ayer you have tara send columbia care harvest health and juicy then you have the ancillary place as well grow gen and ipr this portfolio is great this is pretty well everything that you'd want i think i couldn't have done a better job allocating this myself and next up we have thcx this is actually the smallest one on this list with assets under management of 126 million and a management expense ratio of 0.95 uh so same thing here they actually have their top holdings as the afria tilray combo uh then you have grogen canopy growth village farms and gw farm which is definitely a fine uh those are all fine names uh but then here's the thing again you have um you have organogram you have aurora you have hexo you have supreme down there so this one's a little bit more spread out it's less concentrated towards the top and it has it's more spread out again uh among some of the uh smaller cap names which are lower quality which i'm not too crazy about and then finally we have yolo also managed by advisor shares an actively managed etf uh this one has assets under management of 367 million and a management expense ratio of 0.75 percent now this one here is a hybrid of both canada and u.s companies uh the thing with this one here is it seems like their weightings are just upside down uh so you have the kind of top names in canada you have vff you have uh gw farm you have aphrya cgc grojan these are all fine names but then the thing is is after these names then you have cure leaf you have harvest health ahead of true leave and then you have cure leaf columbia care cresco labs so it just seems like the waiting on this is a little bit backwards so if we were to rank these etfs from best to worse the way i would rank them is the us names at the top so you would have ms os as the best hmus as number two then the hybrid play which is yolo as number three uh then i would put the best canadian etf which is hmmj as fourth then thc x and then mj so that's my list again not financial advice this is strictly my opinion overall i'm a much bigger fan of the u.s market over the canadian just because you have 10 times the addressable market overall much bigger fan of the fundamentals in the states the canadian names could do better over shorter periods of time sometimes you see short-term outperformance but usually it's just based off of trades and hypes us really delivers the long-term fundamental value the youtube algorithm absolutely hates me so if this provides any value to you at all please consider liking commenting and subscribing so i can fight this youtube algorithm and get to a wider audience but overall thank you so much for watching very much appreciate it and have a great week you", "_9GRtUCa_II": "[Music]", "LrQfGr8yGWE": "welcome in this video I will explain what you can use cannabis oil for how you can use it and what the benefits are of cannabis oil made in cold methods furthermore I will explain briefly how I came to this method cannabis oil can be used for many projects such as cancer skin problems patents on digestive problems rejuvenation of bones and even your brain cells to name a few for skin conditions like eczema or skin inflammations or skin cancer the use of cannabis can be very effective and very soothing to for people with cancer the use of cannabis oil is very beneficial and ensures that our body can relax and it gets the ability to heal itself in addition it is a pain killer in his entire inflammatory it strengthens your immune system and has an anti-tumor effect it reduces the damage the femur therapy can cause to the nerves and brings the body in a more balanced state in the case of colon cancer laboratory studies show that it really works with lung cancer the sputum production will decrease and it prevents choking cold oil is highly recommended for Parkinson projects the raw oil has many active ingredients that are very beneficial to Parkinson when taken regularly this effect is also noticeable when ingesting Cokely obtained juice from the leaves of the cannabis plant how to use cannabis oil the application of cannabis oil can be done in a number of ways for two are the most efficient the one is on the skin and the second one is under the tongue the oil can be rubbed in daily on the affected area like a kind of ointment it's best to dilute the wheat paste with castor oil instead of other oils in the preparation process because castor oil is a bit thicker and easier to apply and it helps the wheat oil to pet deeper into the skin in the case of any other conditions the cannabis oil is taken orally you can do this in front of a mirror so you can see easily how many drops you take then drop the oil under the tongue and leave it there for a couple of minutes before swallowing it this is done because under the tongue the oil is absorbed by the body much quicker the dosage it's advisable to take the oil every day and to continue the treatment for as long as possible for paint projects it's convenient to take the oil every few hours to keep the analgesic effect constant when it comes to treating a tumor or preventing a cancer from coming back it's enough to take the oil once a day because every oil has a different strength it's very useful to test your daily dose with every new obtained bottle of oil you can do it very easily by taking for example three drops and the next day take four drops build it up slowly every day with one drop until you get slightly high if you're slightly high you know you have to take one or two drops less to set your dose if you become very stoned during this process it's best to relax and enjoy it the effect will decrease sometime the advantage of cannabis oil made on occult meth is compared to the heat of method cannabis contains at least 200 different potentially active medical ingredients other than THC and CBD because there's little research done about these ingredients there's also little known but what we do know is when heating it a lot of it will be lost this inspired me to do a little research on cannabis oil made in a cold method the most common cannabis oil is made with the use of heat this process is called decarboxylation and ensures that the THC acids are converted THC the THC and CBD strongly stimulate the cannabinoid receptors that are naturally present in our body these receptors activate human system and heal the body an additional effect is that the intoxicating effect of the oil is strengthened and therefore more suitable as an anesthetic painkiller in cannabis oil that is made without heating air the assets from the THC are preserved as well as all the other ingredients that are present in the plant the THC acids have a similar effect as the family let alone Aveda the pe\u00f1a from our body which is a balanced riparian molecule this molecule provides an analgesic and and diplomat ory effect it has a positive effect on the immune modulation of our body and takes very effective role in protecting the nerves in chemotherapy the pe\u00f1a itself is also stimulated by the use of unheated cannabis oil my personal experience in the use of unheated cannabis oil my personal experience with the use of cold oil is that it works very well it keeps and makes the body healthy if you want a stronger effect you can even use to both oils at the same time because they work in a completely different way I hope this video has given you more clarity about the use of cannabis oil if you have more questions you can use the comments or go to my website feel Ofcom thank you for watching you [Music]", "iwMgD51_zEk": "first off I just want to give a little disclaimer saying that I do not condone the use of any legal or illegal mind-altering substances the contents of this video are created purely for education it's inevitable that there will be people who consume these substances therefore it is extremely important to educate people on the effects and how to properly use them so edible pot is a lot different than smoking it it's more potent it's processed in the body differently and the effects lasts longer the difference with edibles is that the active ingredient the chemical that gets you high THC is processed in the liver before the user experiences any effects the original THC from the edible is converted in the liver into a more potent metabolite 11 hydroxy THC it's estimated that this compound is about four to five times more psycho active than normal THC and because the edible has to go through a portion of the digestive process before effects can be felt it can take 30 minutes - as long as two hours before a user feels any effects because of this people who don't feel any effects after an hour so might want to reduce only to have the entire thing hit them like a train all at once an hour later so my advice just wait it out it may take a while but it will come on and unlike smoking cannabis in which the effects last about two hours and gradually drop off after a quick climax right after inhalation edible pot takes its time before it reaches its peak in effect and this peak lasts longer typically the effects of edibles lasts four to eight hours when it comes to the effects there are certainly similarities between smokeable and edible weed but there are some properties that appear to only occur strictly on edibles there are two main reasons someone would want to consume an edible the first is for medical benefits such as aiding symptom relief of stress or anxiety or to help one sleep and the second is simply just for recreational purposes just to have a high and have a time aside from these two reasons there are actually a few people in the psychedelic community who use edibles and very high doses in a similar way to what one would use LSD or magic mushrooms for but we'll touch on that aspect at the end of the video so now we are going to get into what you can expect to feel from the different doses of weed edibles but firstly it's important to know that tolerance is everything tolerance plays a huge role in your experience and if you're an everyday pot smoker you'll likely have to take a much larger dose of an edible that someone who has no tolerance to THC in order to feel the same effect so take the following effects of doses I give with a grain of salt as this is just generally what you can expect to feel when you take this particular dose so first off we have the micro dose and this ranges anywhere from one milligram to about 2.5 milligrams of THC it's unlikely you'll experience any active effects from this dose but it is possible for people who are hypersensitive to the effects of THC this dose is more just for purposes such as mild relief of pain stress anxiety etc people who Micro's THC edibles might also report increased creativity and focus the effects of this dose are pretty passive you likely won't feel any different fundamentally this can be somewhat compared to people who micro doze LSD and magic mushrooms who do so for similar purposes next we have the low dose which ranges from two point five milligrams to about 15 milligrams and the two ends of the spectrum can be very different especially for people with low tolerance to th see someone consuming the edible for medicinal purposes will experience stronger symptom relief and this dose can also be used for people who have trouble sleeping you may begin to feel a sense of euphoria and that classic high feeling where coordination is slightly impaired and overall perception is altered but if this dose the high is unlikely to be overwhelming and because of this this may be a good dose to try for a first-timer in my own experience there isn't a significant difference between this dose and edible in your average smoking weed high the medium dose ranges from 15 to 30 milligrams someone with a decent THC tolerance still may not be feeling heavy effects here but for many vistas can make them pretty high it's at those dose that people may start to feel negative effects such as anxiety and paranoia you might ask if people use weed for relief of anxiety stress then how could this dose bring on anxiety and stress well THC has biphasic effects which means the substance can have opposite effects in different doses anxiety can be reduced in lower doses but can actually be stronger in higher doses so if you're taking edibles for symptom relief it is important to be aware of these biphasic effects the drug in half coordination and perception will likely be altered at this dose that agree to which it is altered will likely depend on your tolerance some people might start to get the classic red eyes from being high maybe some people experience close eye visuals for me personally I tend to have a close eye visual on low to medium dose weed that looks kind of like this let me know if you have experienced the same type of visual in the comments the high dose ranges from 30 to 50 milligrams this dose will likely bring a significant high even to someone with tolerance and for someone with low tolerance this can bring an extreme high their coordination will definitely be impaired somewhat you might feel a strong euphoria maybe you'll feel very laughy some people's mouths get very dry and get cottonmouth this is due to THC mimicking a naturally occurring chemical called an and amide which binds to cannabinoid receptors in our saliva glands which causes saliva production to decrease you might also get the classic munchies and just want to absolutely binge eat it's important to remember that the effects of THC impacts everyone differently so no two people's high will be exactly the same and you likely will only experience some of the effects I listed not all the very high dose ranges from 50 to 100 milligrams I would say it's more likely than not that you will probably experience some negative effects at this dose but the high may become so intense you may feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed people often experience a rapid heart rate panic nausea in headaches at this dose so definitely don't venture into this realm if you don't know what you're doing for someone with an extremely high tolerance this dose might not be too heavy but for the average person this will likely be overwhelming there are still medicinal benefits at this dose but is only used for people who really need it as this dose is sometimes using cancer patients to boost appetite and is also used for people with certain inflammatory disorders personally any dose at this range or above just completely puts me on my ass the come-up is nice for me as I feel very laughy energetic and social but once the effects really start peaking I honestly begin to struggle to stay awake and wish to do nothing else but to find a cozy place to lie down and fall asleep this may have been due to the strain though as THC isn't the only psychoactive chemical we it's just the most prominent CBD is the chemical that aids with sleep and this chemical also plays a role in the overall effects of the weed and the amount of CBD in the strain will most definitely impact your experience and finally the extremely high dose is going to be anything above 100 milligrams I've heard of some edibles having 250 milligrams some having 500 and even some containing as much as a thousand milligrams obviously the effects will get significantly higher as those increases a 100 milligram edible might not be incredibly strong for someone with a very high tolerance but certainly 500 milligrams is going to put anybody on their ass be very careful of consuming edibles this powerful as there will certainly be negative effects due to the intensity it's in these very high doses that have experienced visuals reminiscent of a psychedelic trip on say LSD the visual might be something kind of like this and speaking of psychedelics there's many people who report having psychedelic like trips from high doses of weed edibles the world-famous Joe Rogan likes to discuss edible pot as along the same lines as psychedelics such as LSD psilocybin mushrooms and DMT saying that edible pot can take you down the rabbit hole there's a comment I found from someone on reddit that I thought described as similarity of the psychedelic feeling on high-dose edibles perfectly not long ago I did a hundred milligrams of THC edibles and had zero tolerance on my couch my eyes closed and no music it was awesome and the peak was over three hours I swam through the psychedelic mind a tunnel with many doors and behind each door was a memory of mine I went through them and had Total Recall I could recall past memories memories of being born my first laugh before thinking and the experience that my first thought as an infant the pure thrill of thinking now the effects of THC in the brain is nowhere close to resembling that of a psychedelic classical psychedelics interact directly with the 5-htt to a receptor in the brain and cannabis does not do this from doing research it seems to be that weed edibles tend to resemble psychedelics more often for people who have already had experiences with psychedelics in the past it's likely more often that this psychedelic feeling is also associated with strains with higher THC levels and lower CBD levels as CBDs antipsychotic effects will likely lessen the psychedelic effect but if you find yourself feeling like you're in the middle of an intense psychedelic trip I'll say what I've always said before let the experience consume you surrender to the substance let your mind flow freely and try not to attach yourself to these thoughts just simply observe don't make any attachments so that's about it for this video hopefully you have a better idea on what you can expect to feel by the different doses of weed edibles if you're new start low THC affects everyone slightly differently so see how you react to the substance stay safe consume responsibly and you'll be fine if you seek to support my work on a deeper level consider joining the patreon I run a book club on there where we read one book a month about topics we go over on this channel if that interests you definitely consider joining as always guys have a great day and peace [Music]", "vu1RKWQtN-M": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I have a very exciting video that's been highly requested and I'm sorry it was taking so long I'm going to be showing you guys how I make my extra strong green dragon picture this photo has one cup of liquid and 10 grams of wheat and then I reduced it to 1/3 of a cup meaning that now there is 5 tablespoons in 1/3 of a cup so every tablespoon is 2 grams of wheat you're gonna need the carbs wheat for this recipe and I'll post a link of how to do that below here's what you're gonna need alcohol that is 95% alcohol or higher some coffee filters or cheesecloth a funnel some mason jars and 10 grams of the carb to read the first step is to freeze your Dakkar bleed for at least 24 hours I have already done that and now that it's been over 24 hours I'm going to pour in 2/3 of a cup of vodka that has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours the instructions for this can still be followed even if you're not using the same amount of wheat that I am which is 10 grams all you have to do is pour enough vodka to fill just to the top of the weed now you're going to shake it aggressively for 5 minutes then you'll put it in the freezer for at least 2 hours I ended up leaving mine in the freezer for about 20 hours there's no need to leave it for long within 2 hours I did that simply because I ran at a time now I'm placing a funnel into my mason jar and I'm going to poke some holes into my coffee filter so that it flows through a little bit quicker if you don't have any coffee filters you can also use cheesecloth then place that into the funnel now you can take your weed and vodka mixture out of the freezer and shake it aggressively for another 5 minutes pour your mixture into the filter and try to avoid spilling it over the edge like I do here then wait for it to filter through this can take a while sometimes even up to a half an hour you can see how slowly it comes out of the bottom and then once almost all of the liquid has gone through I'll move the weed around to try and facilitate more of the liquid to be filtered through I put some gloves on because if your fingers are touching the weed and vodka it can absorb some of the THC and we obviously don't want that because that would be a waste now that all the vodka has gone through the filter I'm going to scoop back the weed into the jar you can see how much weed is left in the funnel because I spilled it when I poured it in so again try to avoid doing that if you can [Music] now I'm going to pour in 1/3 of a cup of vodka that again has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours and then I'm going to pour it into my jar weed that I had already filtered once now again if you're using different proportions just use enough to just cover the weed you can just pour it straight into the jar I'm just using the funnel so I can try and get some of that weed that's stuck to it the first time now once again I'm going to shake that jar aggressively for five minutes now using that same jar and same filter that I'd use the first time I am going to pour in the mixture that we had just shaken into the jar that we first used [Music] now this step is optional but I'm going to pour in a little bit of that very cold flash-frozen vodka to get the remnants out of my jar again you don't have to do this but I don't want to waste anything so every little scrap I can get I'm gonna take now once again we're going to let that filter through and it is going to take a long time just like the first round did [Music] once that's all dripped through we're going to place a clean funnel into a clean measuring cup or mason jar as well as a new clean coffee filter and we are not going to poke any holes now we're going to pour it in and we're going to wait for this to drip through this step is not necessary but I like mine very clear so I like to filter out any imperfections if you like you can do this step twice but it does take a long time so I only do it once and I find that the one time is sufficient to get it very pure and clean I'm also going to take the filter with the weed that has been filtered already and press it out as much as I can of course make sure you're wearing a rubber glove so that your skin is not absorbing at all yeah and just try and squish oh as much as you can and then that little bit of leftover that is on the parchment paper there I mean if you're just using this for yourself you could just lick it up I don't know if you don't want to waste it anything works yeah so just squeeze out as much as you possibly can it's been about a half an hour and almost everything has filtered through and we have a total of about a little bit under a cup of liquid because some of that vodka is lost in the extraction process [Music] now we need to reduce our tincture to a smaller amount and we're going to use that by using a double boiler thing which I don't have so I'm making my own version and I'm just using my instant pot so that I can do it in the living room where I have better lighting so I am wrapping some tinfoil around it so I can contain the heat as much as possible and I'm just going to put my measuring cup on to the side of it and then wrap the tinfoil kind of around it that way not too much water and heat is evaporating all you want to make sure is that your bottom of your mason jar or your measuring cup like I'm using is not touching the water so same concept as a double boiler so I both to put it in there but I just have to show off how beautiful it looks it's so clear so golden absolutely beautiful I hope you guys appreciate how wonderful it looks because a lot of my friends and family don't really feel the same way as I do so I just love being able to share this stuff with you guys online please make sure you do this any well-ventilated area so I have all windows and doors in my house opened as well as if your dreams on the stove have your hood fan on there is no smell at all so unfortunately my instant pot broke part way through I don't know what happened so I moved it to the kitchen and I made this sort of contraption thing because I could not put the measuring cup on the edge of the pot because I don't have anything deep enough where the bottom of the measuring cup wouldn't touch the water so I just put a metal strainer on top and then created some insulation with the tin foil kind of like how I did it the instant pot so while you're watching it when it's bubbling a lot like this that's a little bit too much so turn your heat down a little bit you do want a little bit of movement but not that aggressively now I reduced it down to one third of a cup and that took me about an hour and a half I believe you can reduce it more or reduce it less it just depends on how strong you want it to be now it's ready to pour into a jar to save you can use this with a dropper or you can put into your gummies or into your drinks there's so many different ways to use it hopefully you guys will check out some of my gummy videos and try it out in one of those recipes and here's the finished product which is absolutely beautiful thank you so much for watching with the measuring cup I didn't want to waste any possible tincture so I heard some iced coffee into there and now I'm drinking that so that's a good way to make sure you're not wasting anything if you guys enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe and please let me know if there's any videos you would like to see me record because I would be happy to do that thank you guys so much for watching have a great day [Music]",

way for us to get high on marijuana and it definitely has nothing to do with why Noah's not here today hello dear friends it is me filling in for noah glutton who definitely isn't too high to be on camera right now I'm sure you guys have all heard of scissor and lean thanks in no small part to your favorite popular rap songs well there's a new scissor out there that replaces the codeine with THC for your health a company called active list has created grape scissor with cannabinoids which they first introduced via free samples to the public on 4/20 I'm not sure why they picked Hitler's birthday for their pot sauce premiere but let's move on active list is a pun on the company activists were the folks behind the original prescription codeine syrup that you've heard you know little Wayne or Miley Cyrus or you know just whoever rap talk about see activists is pulling their stuff from the market because people are keeping way way too [ __ ] up on it seriously man that should kill you so legs the state way so active list swooped in and created their own medicine which is supposed to be a lot safer than lean they're touting it as a healthy alternative like soy milk but it still has the same purple color and goopy consistency it's $45 for two ounces which is up to two doses although some people just down the whole thing in one go cuz they're rebels and they don't care it seems kind of pricey to me since the high is over in about ten hours do you have any idea how much meth you can get for that kind of money guys the gentlemanly asking now we can get this stuff here in LA because pot is basically legal here but they are working on a THC free version so it could be shipped across state lines I don't know what the point of a THC free version of this would be but hey why not knock yourselves out active list there's a pretty good chance the activists people might try to sue ACTA bliss for a copyright infringement or something but they haven't done it yet and active list is just hoping they won't while still preparing for the possibilities I'm not sure who I'd pick in a fight between someone stoned on codeine against someone stoned on weed but let me know where you put your money in the comments I michael truly subscribe to taste it where you can find out about all kinds of ways know a gluten is definitely not getting high right here on the food fear", "6zXyFJJ8KSk": "buyer beware that was the message this week from the Tarrant County District Attorney regarding CBD oil it is illegal in Texas except for certain medical conditions with the doctor's recommendation stores though are still selling it but will it show up on a drug test David Schecter verifies have you heard of CBD oil it's growing in popularity as a natural way to treat epileptic seizures and more broadly anxiety and insomnia the issue is how close CBD is scientifically to marijuana verified fast facts marijuana is rich in the compound THC which gets you high CBD is not marijuana but it still has a tiny bit of THC in it which has some people wondering can CBD oil cause you to fail a drug test for answers I'm looking at what the law says and I'm reaching out to one of the largest lab testing companies in America quest Diagnostics maybe you've peed in their cup dr. berry sample is the director of science and technology and yes that's really his name can the use of CBD oil cause you to fail a drug test CBD itself on our test would not be confused with either THC or THC metabolite number one so analytically we can clearly differentiate the two substances so you've passed last year with the 2018 farm bill Congress permitted the interstate commerce of hemp products like CBD that contain not more than 0.3 percent THC a very low level doctor sample is saying that amount of THC is so low that a test won't pick it up case closed right wrong as a product CBD oil is not regulated in the United States that means the government is not ensuring the level of THC remains low and in fact research in the Journal of the American Medical Association tested a variety of CBD oils and found 43% had more THC in them then labeled doctor sample says that's a big problem if somebody is using a CBD oil product that contains residual THC in it they very likely could test positive on a urine drug test not because of the CBD itself but because of a contaminant that is in that oil so CBD should not cause you to fail a drug test but in reality it could if you've got something you want verified send me an email [Music]", "YkJbSZotFnQ": "[Music] good afternoon and congratulations you did on October 17th cannabis will be recreationally legal in Canada way to go it's already legal in some American states nine of them including California Colorado and Nevada and in one country Uruguay but if you're one of those people who has a naysayer if you are opposed to legalization or if you're still opposed relax because guess what cannabis can make you healthier sexier and richer we are learning how cannabis can be used as a medicine treating all kinds of ailments from epilepsy to the nausea caused by chemotherapy seniors are using it to improve their quality of life we are becoming friendlier more creative and more relaxed cannabis affects how we interact with one another because it can create a greater sense of empathy it can provide us with a higher level of sensitivity so that the food we eat is tastier and the sex is better cannabis cultivation dates back 12,000 years making it one of humanity's oldest crops and the business of cannabis brings with it so many opportunities cannabis is a disrupter it's going to change the entire wellness industry it has a history of medical use exceeding 5,000 years and now it's finally legal again there are many ways in which we are discovering how cannabis can make us healthier but we don't need to smoke cannabis or even get high to enjoy its benefits CBD is a cannabinoid which does not make you high and it can be taken in so many ways through supplements such as CBD oil tinctures and edibles or it can be applied and absorbed on the skin we are putting CBD in everything these days creams in our makeup in shampoo in teas and other drinks even in pet food and for good reason every part of your body has CBD receptors just waiting to come in contact with CBD and when they do cannabis stimulates your body to produce more of its own endocannabinoids which help your body's cells regulate themselves improving your sleep your appetite coordination and boosting your immune system it balances and aligns your body's metabolic processes cannabis is an effective painkiller it's an alternative treatment to opiates the active ingredients in marijuana calm the secretion of pain signaling chemicals in your body when you're experiencing pain cannabis signals your body to stop hurting and topical creams are being used now to treat pain to treat soreness and to treat inflammation even chronic pain such as fibromyalgia athletes use CBD to ease inflammation cannabis especially CBD oil can treat anxiety in people and believe it or not in pets cannabis is being used now to treat autism ADHD schizophrenia epilepsy social phobia and PTSD we know there is so much potential in what CBD and THC can do and cannabis can make you smarter THC and CBD are antioxidants that help prevent damage and degeneration of brain cells cabin noise protect an aging brain so cannabis can help in treating diseases like Alzheimer's multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's but cannabis doesn't just make you healthier it can make you richer here are some interesting statistics on why you should invest in cannabis right now US legal cannabis sales is expected to rise by fifty percent this year to ten billion dollars but the actual estimated US market including the black market as it's not currently legal everywhere in the u.s. is fifty two billion dollars a year and there is some that say if the entire US was legalized that sales of marijuana would top cigarette sales which are currently at ninety three billion dollars a year cannabis is big business so the hype around cannabis stocks is not surprising it's definitely warranted as the industry really is just getting started there are already six multi-billion dollar cannabis companies but there's still plenty of room to grow in August 2018 Constellation Brands one of the world's largest alcohol brands owning Corona beer made a five billion dollar investment into one of the world's largest cannabis companies canopy growth bringing that company's market capitalization to over thirteen billion dollars and it's not even recreationally legal yet I get asked all the time where should I be putting my money in cannabis is it too late to invest or how do I invest in a cannabis stock before it reaches a billion dollar valuation I'm gonna share a secret with you it's called the Canadian securities exchange on that exchange sir over 80 cannabis companies listed many of which are at the very early stages and any of which could be the next billion dollar enterprise every once in a while we find ourselves in the right place at the right time now is the time to buy cannabis stocks in Canada although there are several billion-dollar companies out there you want to look for the companies that could be targets and could be acquired so buy into those CSC listed companies this is what you need to look for look for companies that are pursuing an international strategy with assets in other countries as recreational cannabis becomes legal as it will hopefully all over the world and look for companies that are growing CBD are conducting research and development to find out how cannabis can heal us and look for companies developing strong brands whether it's in flower edibles or topicals an example of a strong brand that I like is a company I found it called the yield growth Corp and we're launching a cannabis line called urban juice if you want to look at a company that's entering new territories around the world take a look at crop infrastructure it's a public company listed on the CSC under the symbol crop and they've actually bought the Italian rights to urban juice there are so many cannabis companies poised to grow as legal cannabis changes the way we heal the way we play and the way we interact it's a gold rush only this time the gold rush is a green rush but more importantly let's talk about how cannabis can improve your sex life cannabis can intensify feelings and connection with a partner and it can yield better orgasms some people smoked it as an aphrodisiac there are so many strains I need to experiment to determine what works for you experts recommend that adults experiment with smoking or vaping to find out your perfect strain one toke at a time it can be very strong cannabis infused lubricants may well change women's sex lives forever a company that I found in urban truth has filed a patent for a female sexual lubricant that includes ashwagandha oil which is an exotic Indian oil that relaxes combined it with THC and hamper oil and we theorize that that will increase orgasmic activity in women how can that be wrong people have been arguing for 50 years to legalize cannabis the public pressure in the last 15 years has been particularly strong the media has been a big supporter to legalize cannabis and there are still many media companies working hard to educate the world about it such as the Canadian cannabis media if you were one of those people who was opposed to legalization I encourage you to open your mind to it anyway and try to get on board with this you're gonna find that this natural plant is going to be responsible for an economic resurgence and social change when you come to realize that cannabis can make you richer healthier and smarter you may thank me consider educating yourself about how cannabis can heal you cannabis comes in mainly two strains sativa which generally stimulates an indica which often relaxes most strains are a genetic combination of both you can think of it kind of like white wine and red wine on steroids we each have an endocannabinoid system that is naturally set up to receive cannabis you need to find out which strains are right for you sort of like a wine tasting personally I love a good Sauvignon but I won't touch Chardonnay if you're living somewhere that has legalized cannabis like we will be here shortly if you're of legal age and if you find yourself on a Friday night going out for a glass of wine don't be afraid to visit your local dispensary these are the new wine stores check out the various cannabis strains inhaled aromas like you would a good wine consult with your bud tenders they're the somalis of the future for those of you that have already tried cannabis Bravo keep it up responsibly for the rest of you adults please consider giving it a try it's a new world good luck and have fun [Applause]", "cFwlIAzxTGc": "[Music] hi welcome back to Diamond delight animals my name is Liz and this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "OzRbCDRw4eY": "[Music] hi this is nutrition Sushma's as well I have a rich experience in the field of nutrition for 33 years including 25 years abroad and in UN and whu-oh as well right now I'm practicing in Bangalore at Swati nutrition our body naturally detoxifies but system could be little slow the most common way of detoxifying bodies by taking more fluids body detoxified still by throwing the waste out of the body like in the form of urine and sweating since THC is fat soluble so we have to avoid eating of fast food junk food and oily food in order to get it into the tissues and cells of the body foods rich in antioxidants would help antioxidants are like Omega vitamin A C and E and those supplementation also could help otherwise taking more colorful fruits and vegetables like a food bowl containing five fruits at least and eating more vegetable salads they help in detoxifying especially taking greens fruit and vegetable juices will work as a detoxifying drink like teenage and beetroot juice or avocado or green apple and any anything which you wish which is green in nature it will help you to detoxify faster another you are naturally detoxifying nutrient could be fiber to throw out the THC from a system through stools fiber rich foods could be legumes grains sprouts etc so eat them more and another flushing nutrient is niacin group of B vitamins and you have to eat nice and rich force like tuna or potato avocado etc foods reaching electrolytes like potassium magnesium vitamin C also could be helpful such as sytrus foods or lemon juice tomatoes being leafy vegetable juice and some other fruits also would be helpful because they are rich in electrolytes aloe vera juice or vinegar vinegar if sometimes added in the diet you know that also could be beneficial and cranberry juice oh yeah they they also are found to be beneficial detox can be fastened if you have enough fluids in your system water is the best beverage that naturally transports and eliminates all the waste from the body through urination and sweating some of the drinks other than water could be like coconut water or any fruit juices without adding extra sugar could be beneficial and make sure that you are drinking it eight glasses of water which is recommended or maybe some extra water to cleanse your system as soon as possible then exercise and sweating also plays a good role in detoxifying the body excessive sweating detoxify his body in a natural way so you have to get more sweating like you can be indulge in those exercises which which make you sweat a lot like walk I mean this walking or running jogging etcetera if you cannot do the exercise like you cannot run our job then taking Sun bath would be another alternative sauna which is indoors like if you don't have Sun then you can relax in sauna and you can sweat a lot so that is also natural way of detoxifying the body rest also has a very good effects on detoxifying the body naturally and make sure that you are getting enough rest for eight eight hours sleep at least sound sleep so for sound sleep you you can have either milk in the evening just before going to bed you know 15 minutes before going to bed because milk has a tryptophan the natural I mean amino acid which induces sleep or if you are not drinking milk or I mean then you are then you can take also chamomile tea just 10 minutes before going to bed so that will end you sleep so you can follow all these tips however prevention is better than cure so if you stay away from margiana would be the best best thing to practice [Music]", "N9tDxJge5x0": "showers.

THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION ENDS ON SATURDAY AT NOON. MEANWHILE -- AFTER A FEW CHANGES IN THE SENATE...", "xQExiOSY1J8": "What are kids these days smokin? Well it ain\u2019t your momma\u2019s weed. Hey guys, Julia here for DNews Not that I would know from experience, but\nit there\u2019s a rumor that weed strains these days, are a little different from what your\nparents might have smoked back in the day. And the blame is placed on THC. Tetrahydrocannabinol acts a lot like the cannabinoids\nyour body naturally produces. The cannabinoid receptors in your brain do\na lot of different things, they have a hand in pain reduction, pleasure, memory, sensations,\nand other stuff. But THC is also the thing that gives marijuana,\nwell... its high and euphoric feeling. Basically the more THC, the stronger the high. Potency has been monitored for about forty\nyears. But the rumor is lately that today\u2019s pot\nboasts more THC than in prior years. While some data might be skewed because of\nout of date testing procedures or sample size variations, there does seems to be a general\ntrend upward. As some pot users demand stronger, longer\nhighs, producers are happy to accommodate. One study presented at the 249th National\nMeeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society found that THC levels of 30% are pretty\ncommon in parts of Colorado where marijuana has been legal since 2012. But like 30 years ago THC levels were usually\nunder 10% according to one of the authors of the study. And some researchers, like Michael Kahn, the\npresident of Massachusetts Cannabis Research, think that \"the mega-potent strains may soon\nrepresent the norm\u201d. So, yeah pot is a little stronger today than\nit was when your mom was a teen. While high THC might seem like a great idea\nfor those looking to get high, some strains of pot are bred to be the opposite. Low THC but high in other compounds like Cannabidiol\n(CBD), one of dozens of other active compounds found in marijuana. Strains like this are newer and aren\u2019t great\nsellers, except in a few cases. Like one strain called Charlotte\u2019s Web,\nnamed after a little girl who uses its extract to cure her seizures. Today, there\u2019s a market developing for strains\nlow in THC but high in CBD, for medical purposes for other diseases like schizophrenia and\nalzheimer's. But THC has medicinal benefits too, like it\u2019s\nbeen shown to reduce tumor growth in patients. But it\u2019s difficult to deal with its potential\nhealing properties while also dealing with the high. So researchers are currently working on separating\nthe high inducing properties from the medicinal benefits. In one study published in the journal PLOS\nBiology, researchers found that the psychoactive component of THC runs through different neural\npathways than its other components. THC works on a lot of different receptors,\nlike cannabinoid receptors and serotonin receptors. The researchers found that by removing one\nof the serotonin receptors in mice, (5HT2AR), they were able to reduce some of the negative\nside effects of the compound like memory disfunction. But it didn\u2019t change some of the good effects\nlike pain relief. While the researchers caution against people\nself medicating, they hope that their research might lead to synthetic weed. All of the medicine but none of the high. On the topic of controlled substances there\u2019s\nalso been some research into the medical properties of LSD. In case you missed it, here\u2019s a video I\ndid. And we\u2019ll put the link in the description\nbelow, if you\u2019re on moble. So what do you think of medical marijuana?

that question let's take a closer look at the endocannabinoid system to see exactly what it does what marijuana does to it and what that does to you spread throughout the brain the endocannabinoid system is a biological system made up of chemical messengers called endocannabinoids cellular receptors that communicate with endocannabinoids and enzymes that break down endocannabinoids after they've delivered their messages as endocannabinoids communicate with receptors throughout your body they create balance and help regulate many body and brain functions such as helping with memory coping with stress pain and anxiety and keeping hunger body temperature motor coordination and alertness in balance now let's see what happens when marijuana is introduced into this balancing system made from a plant called cannabis marijuana can be smoked vaporized or ingested through food or drink marijuana contains a chemical called tetrahydrocannabinol also known as thc since thc's chemical structure is similar to naturally occurring endocannabinoids the body allows thc to attach to endocannabinoid receptors in the brain when thc enters the body it overwhelms the endocannabinoid system attaching to cannabinoid receptors and throwing the body and brain off balance preventing endocannabinoids in your brain from doing their jobs endocannabinoids work like a well-conducted and highly synchronized orchestra with each one playing at a particular time and place in harmony when thc is introduced the precise coordination is lost and thrown off the endocannabinoids can no longer do their special job this means your brain will have a harder time regulating all of those functions like memory coping with stress and anxiety and motor coordination plus when using marijuana some people may experience fear anxiety paranoia or memory loss while allowing medical and recreational use of marijuana for adults are becoming more common in some states though not in others but as a young person with a still developing brain marijuana can have a stronger more harmful effect on you than adults in fact research has shown that young people who chronically use marijuana especially highly potent marijuana increase their risk of cognitive and memory damage serious mental illnesses like depression and psychosis and addiction to alcohol or other drugs in adulthood learning the

selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "DP_LaoABgrg": "the 87th texas legislature kicked off this week here with us this morning is jax finkel director of texas normal that is the texas chapter of the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws thanks for coming on jax how are you thank you so much for having me it's great to be with you this morning definitely thanks for doing it so talk about this session where does texas stand with marijuana right now and what is normal hoping lawmakers will will change this session sure quick overview of where we stand in texas right now currently we have a robust temp program where people are growing hemp plants which have to have less than 0.3 percent thc we have a medical program in texas with a limited amount of conditions and also a restriction on how doctors can dose their patients and also we have basically possession of cannabis is still completely illegal and highly criminalized though there are some patchworks of deprioritization policies first chance programs so that's where we stand right now so you can see that we have a lot of work to do to improve our laws here in texas gotcha what are what are some of the main things that y'all are fighting for this time you know really what is very important important and a core goal for us is to make sure that patient access is improved we want to see people that have conditions like any type of cancer not just terminal cancer ptsd chronic pain included in the program and we also want to restore the ability for doctors to decide dosing and give them that medical freedom to converse on that with their patients additionally we want to remove the collateral consequences that come if you are caught in possession with the cannabis flower currently you can get 180 days in jail a 2 000 fine and then you lose your driver's license and have um you know a record for life that can affect your rental ability your grants through school and then also we want to make sure that we're having a really robust conversation about where do we go in the future with cannabis on a broader retail type of market so i think the main goal is to make sure patients have access and people aren't being arrested and then we also need to have those conversations moving forward speaking of the retail i know governor abbott has said before you know things like we will never become a colorado as long as i'm governor i mean are we are we a long way from seeing dispensaries and things in texas like in colorado you know i think that there is going to take some time to have that conversation and we're going to have to figure out what's right for texas you know we don't have to be colorado we need to do what's right for texas look at the other states around us look at arkansas oklahoma new mexico all of these different places that are instituting different types of programs medical and otherwise and we need to make sure that we are making wise decisions for us so i agree with him that we're not colorado and hopefully we can have a conversation about what is the right path for texas last question here we've got a little bit of time explain what's going on federally is there a chance that something could could completely usurp everything that happens in texas well movement at the federal level is happening as i'm sure you know schumer and harris both promised to make sure that this was a priority for them so if changes are happening at a federal level of course that will affect what happens in texas the safe banking act could be addressed in the next covid legislation and we could see the more act being discussed sometime this year perhaps in the fall so i am hopeful that on all fronts we can have a very fact-based discourse and move forward with some common sense legislation jax finkel with texas normal thank you so much always a pleasure", "Ij46cs0RuvM": "[Applause] [Music] bath bombs are an easy gift idea and adding CBD isn't hard to do so if you want to give the gift of relaxation here's what you'll need baking soda corn starch Epsom salt and citric acid these are your dry ingredients you'll also need essential oil coconut oil CBD infused oil bath bomb molds water and food coloring I mix the wet ingredients first starting with the coconut oil it's a solid at room temperature so I put it in the microwave for a few seconds and then I added it to a mason jar with the rest of the wet ingredients [Music] I used two types of essential oil here peppermint and eucalyptus [Music] one thing to keep in mind is that the color of the CBD oil will influence the final product so my first batch was very yellow I used less CBD oil and more food coloring in my second batch and I ended up with a nice light blue shade if you care about the color of the final product just make sure to use enough food coloring to counteract the yellow from the CBD oil it's time to mix the dry ingredients when citric acid and baking soda meet water they undergo a chemical reaction and that's what you're seeing when the bath bomb is fizzing up and making bubbles the cornstarch slows down the chemical reaction so you can actually control how long your bath bomb fizzes just by playing with the ratio between these dry ingredients I'll leave tips on how to do this below the video this step isn't hard but it does require patience slowly mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and when I say slowly I really do mean just a few drops at a time you don't want the dry ingredients to start to react if the mixture starts to get really fizzy you're going a little too fast when you're done the mixture should feel like damp sand now it's time to pack this mixture into the molds as quickly as possible press the mixture into the mold firmly you'll want to slightly overfill each one so that when you press them together there isn't a gap between the two halves [Music] these will be dry in a few hours but I recommend leaving them overnight removing the top half is easy sometimes the bottom half comes right off but if it doesn't just tap the metal a few times and try again this whole process involved about 15 minutes of actual work you do have to factor in drying time but this is a great option for inexpensive gifts that can easily be made in batches if you're trying to tackle several gifts at the same time if you choose to add CVD supposedly there are anti-inflammatory benefits but with any wellness trend you should do your own research to see if it's something you're into you can find more information about the instructions and the materials down

much effect but if you heat it you can change the game entirely through an important process called decarboxylation decarboxylation what is it how does it work and why is it so important find out on this episode of weed easy by the growth of no matter how you choose to use cannabis it's important to understand how decarboxylation works so that you can get the most out of your bud while cannabinoids like THC occur in the cannabis plant naturally the concentrations are very low that's why if you eat raw cannabis it doesn't do very much two of the most famous active compounds in cannabis are THC and CBD however before THC and CBD become active they start out as pH CA and CB da th CA and CB da are not active and therefore can't get you high to get the full effects of cannabis you must decarboxylate it first or use heat to activate the THC a and CBD a and convert them into THC and CBD what happens during decarboxylation decarboxylation is a chemical reaction that removes a carboxyl group when cannabis is heated this happens to th CA and CB da converting them to THC and CBD without decarboxylation th CA and CB da wouldn't be converted to THC and CBD and you wouldn't get high smoking and vaping both decarboxylate cannabis because they both use heat to activate the cannabinoids and decarboxylation is especially important when it comes to making your own edibles or cannabis infused treats to decarboxylate your bud for edibles there are two critical elements to the process temperature the first is the temperature used to heat your cannabis depending on the device you use the temperature required may differ when decarboxylate and cannabis for use in edibles most people use an oven crock-pot or toaster oven let's look at an oven as an example ideally you want to shoot for around 104 to 115 degrees celcius or 220 to 240 degrees Fahrenheit this will help convert the majority of the cannabinoids and preserve the terpenes keep in mind that every ovens temperature varies by as much as 10 degrees so invest in a good thermometer to properly monitor the temperature inside the oven time the second element in decarboxylation is how long you heat your cannabis for if you don't heat it long enough it won't decarboxylate but if you heat it too long you can lose a lot of the cannabinoids terpenes and other good stuff it's a delicate balance for decarboxylation in an oven it's recommended that you bake your cannabis for 30 to 40 minutes to maximize conversion typically maximum conversion is reached once you've hit 70% decarboxylation the THC conversion slows down at this point and instead converts to CBN a different cannabinoid that isn't psychoactive to grind or not to grind some people will tell you to grind your cannabis before Nika box leading and some will not we recommend not grinding your cannabis before decarboxylation instead break it into smaller pieces with your hands as this preserves the trichomes better and will make the most of your but in the end the important thing to remember with decarboxylation is to start low and go slow to make every cannabinoid count thanks for watching me DZ by the growth of subscribe to our channel for more

matters after a couple of months of legislative wrangling in trenton legalized recreational marijuana is now the law of the land in new jersey but it comes with some real problems especially for new jersey employers here is top employment attorney michael riccobono from the firm of ogletree deacons to explain thanks so much for your time sir i know that the state politicians businesses all of us are trying to navigate through the new recreational marijuana law let's talk specifically about businesses how how do they set parameters what what what rules and laws can they make within their own business even if they're contrary to the state law sure well it's at the the new marijuana law in new jersey it represents a radical change in new jersey employment law the good news for employers is that nothing in this new law prohibits them from still prohibiting employees from using marijuana on the work site or during work hours employers can still prohibit employees from possessing marijuana on the work site or during work hours and it also can employers can still prohibit employees from being under the influence at the work site or during work hours the change in the law actually provides someone provides employees with some employment protections most notably what the law does is it prohibits employers from terminating or taking any adverse employment action against an employee or an applicant solely because they fail a drug test for marijuana so no longer can the results of a drug test a failed drug test for marijuana serve as the sole basis for an employer to take an adverse employment action against an employee aren't the two things you just said in conflict that they do have they do you can prevent an employee or or have rules against an employee showing up high and at the same time if you test them and they are high you can't let them go it does present some conflict um the law really looks at um what is going on at the workplace right so it actually regulates off-duty or off-conduct um actions such as you know taking marijuana right so on the work site or during work hours employers can still prohibit the use possession and being under the influence of marijuana but simply a failed drug test for marijuana can no longer serve as the basis for um an adverse employment action there are other circumstances for example the employee violated policies or um did something did someone engage in some other conduct that is prohibited under the law the employer would need to point to that in addition to the failed drug test in order to take that adverse action against the employee in that situation so if someone is high at work or gets high at work on their lunch break and comes back but they're highly functional there's nothing you can do if they're under the influence during the work during work hours or at the work site the law says you can still take adverse action against them you can't let them go you can let them you can terminate their employees how are you going to prove that they were high by taking the drug test right and and that's one of the difficulties with the current state of marijuana testing is that there is no uh medically accepted acceptable test right now which shows is the isn't it is an individual currently under the influence of marijuana like we do with alcohol so what employers are going to need to do is they're going to need to rely on objective um evidence and and contemporaneous observations of the employee another thing about this new law is that it requires employers to use a what the law refers to as a workplace impairment recognition expert and these are folks that are supposed to be trained in determining and evaluating whether an individual is under the influence of marijuana so going forward anytime an employer wants to drug test for marijuana they're all they will also need to do this physical examination that is conducted by one of these so-called wire experts these workplace impairment recognition experts it seems like everyone i talked to about this law and i know they had trouble with it and they there was it was legislative wrestling till the end and even the governor wasn't happy with it when he signed it it seems like there's so many so much conflict especially for law enforcement and for employers that they need to go back to the drawing board and and fix some of this with legislation would you agree with that when it comes to businesses i i would particularly with respect to the employment protections uh and parts of the bill parts of the law that affect employees at the workplace the the good news i think for employers and employees alike is that the law does require the cannabis regulatory commission to promulgate rules and regulations that are going to be that are going to implement some of these employment related protections in the law and the the law says that those rules and regulations are supposed to be promulgated within the next 180 days or so so we're looking forward employers are looking forward to those rules and regulations which will hopefully provide some clarity on the the anti-discrimination aspects of the law as well as the drug testing aspects of the law and how those are supposed to work in practice and whether there's any type of safety sensitive exceptions to the law for employees that are whose job duties require them to for example operate a forklift or heavy machinery and and what kind of exceptions might an employer be able to rely upon for those employees that are either public facing or again involved in a safety sensitive position so we're hopeful within the next six months or so employers will get some some clarity on exactly how the law is to be applied in practice well when they tighten this up or they give you some clarity let's talk again thanks so much for your time sounds good larry thanks for having me attorney michael riccobono from ogletree deacons still to come on jersey matters most of us if not all of us have been for a cova test so what's the process like we'll take you on a tour [Music] next", "C97PWbX-nDc": "tell me about Colorado space it's a sci-fi you know a scary movie and Nic Cage is in it and he produced it and Richard Stanley the director he came out of retirement he's a very well-known horror horror or sci-fi it's horf its kind of horror sci-fi or and you play a character called Ezra yeah an old little typecasting there huh I'm an old hermit and they collect things and what will the film scare me yeah it's guaranteed to scare everybody what is it what do you mean by color out of space I don't really know other than what is the color of space well what it is a meteorite it's the it's the earth and it's it's alive with color and each color has a certain properties and it's really part of their job is to destroy the human race and it starts doing that with with me and who is Ezra Ezra is an old hermit that that I think he either found or he knows all about the space debris that comes from outer space and I understand it uses psyckadeli to create horrific imagery yes that's quite popular these do you enjoy watching yourself and movies yeah actually I do it means I'm getting a paycheck you know and that always feels good damn right moving on the television you recently competed on the masked singer yeah what was that like it was kind of uncomfortable what do you do well what they do they put you in a mask and a costume so that no one knows who you are and you come out and you sing a song and people try to guess who's the star or who the singer is and because I'd been on dance with the Stars I had a nice little little TV following and so they got me the I was in the first mass singer show and did they correctly get you thank God yeah they did why thank God because then I didn't have to live in that costume oh yeah cuz when you're in there no one can know who you are and so they put you in isolation I felt like Hannibal Lecter you know they will year-round but won't let anybody talk to you you can't talk to anybody did you try to change your voice no no no no I just tried to sing you know the best thing you say you're not an actor right no how do you been what what is Tommy who is Tommy Sean I'm a guy that can do a lot of things not perfect not good but enough to get by so I can play guitar but I'm not a guitar player I can act but I'm not an actor I can direct movies but I'm not a director and I'm a comedian but I'm not really yeah I guess I can say I'm a comedian I'll admit to that how did she cheat Sean get to be so big oh we hit the gold mine we found like I remember years ago reading about Charlie Chaplin and the way Charlie made it good because Charlie was like Cheech and Chong in a way where Charlie had a lot of different characters right but he figured out that the the that he played now appealed to everybody because everybody could look down on him and so when Cheech and I started thinking Cheech and Chong I mean the ones we play in the the characters in the movie they were just a couple of characters that we did on our record albums but when we'd shut the movies I realized these are the guys that everybody can look down on and so we used those characters and true enough everybody can look down on us but enjoy us what's change do one teach is healing teaches he had a knee operation so he's healing he's also one of the world famous art Chicano art collectors really yeah he's got a huge Chicano art collection in fact he's getting his own Museum out in Riverside are you old friends yo yeah ya know when you're in California you need your Mexican you say that you're known for Mon foremost is Cheech and Chong obviously right yeah pretty the most part yeah what made is so special teaching show what made what set them apart we told the truth about marijuana that's really what it was you know up until then marijuana was like an evil drug that was that if you smoked it all bad things were gonna happen or you hunger with bad people well what we did we showed the world that marijuana was not only a fun thing to do but it was healthy it was a healthy alternative to you know to alcohol for sure and and then we made light of real simple things you know we were just ending up and smoking were just a couple of musicians looking for it to get high that's all were you ahead of your time you obviously war with cannabis yeah I went to jail for bongs I was a little bit you went to jail yeah yeah I was put in jail by the Bush administration for you know three they had an operation pipe dreams right around the same time they invaded Iraq and I made a joke on on TV one time I think that set it off and said I said that the only weapons of mass destruction they found were my bongs so they they literally charged me was sending paraphernalia through the mail and even though I was innocent I had to take the rap because they threatened to go after my family my wife and my son you know she grew up where in Canada I grew up in Calgary Alberta oh that's the West that's West Canada yep what was that like that's rough boys yeah cowboys and especially now when when I was a kid we used to play cowboys and Indians and my brother and I we were always the Indians and then we did a DNA test recently I made percent native really yeah my brother and I are both percent how did you start in the business ah well like growing up in the country I learned to play a guitar when I was 8 years old and so I used to play with the fiddle player across the field and we used to play parties and so you know when you play a part you know when you play an instrument and you play for parties you don't just play a couple of songs you play all night right and so I played all night a few times growing up and who discovered you how did you get your break actually I ended up in an army van rhythm and blues band and Bobby Taylor and the Vancouver arbiter in the Vancouver's and it was Diana Ross and The Supremes they came to our club one time one night saw us and she phoned Berry Gordy and he could he flew in size of each each Cheech was up dodging the draft and he was selling he was delivering carpets for living really and and a mutual friend said that he was really funny so I invited down to a club that I had was the topless improvisational nightclub and it's actually the first pot club to because we that's all we smoked came up put Cheech and Chong together I did yeah in fact I came up with the name too really yeah because we were trying to figure out we did what we did we formed a band we were going to play music because I'd played was Bobby and I you know that was back in my past and so when we went to play our first gig Cheech and I started doing comedy first and we never got around to playing one note of music we just played that we just did the comedy was your first record a hit yeah big big big hit right out of the park and you made a few films with him right we made five five major motion pictures yeah do you like directing love it but I love directing Cheech and Chong movies I'm not good at anything else cannabis has we've completely legalized now in 11 states you've advocated for total legalization you think it's coming oh yeah absolutely to the on a federal basis it'll be in every state you know what they need to do more than anything is to make it so we can bank our money use the banks see right now everything is cash and the biggest seller in the marijuana industry are big Sates walk-in safes that you can put in your establishment because they don't allow banking yet in any of the legal states what's the difference between cannabis and hemp well hemp is the hemp plant it's a male it's a male plant it doesn't have the THC you don't get high you don't get high but you get CBD or a lot of bit out of the hemp plant you get a lot of good things out of the hemp plant it's a female plant like in real life is that's worth anything and that's the that's where the teach because you have your own brand called Chong's choice well it's Tommy Chong's no it's not just choice choices but it's mostly Tommy Chong and what do you sell we sell chocolate we sell breath mints we sell flour we sell individually wrapped Chalmers their joint big human's own had all the med men all the dispensaries you what you have prostate cancer and you said that cannabis helped you it did it really halfway well I believe that cannabis what it does it comes to mind and when the mind is calm then the you mune system kicks in and see you can't that's why stress is a bad for a lot of things and stress what it does stress it makes the body think of fear you know gives it fear and puts a body on alert whereas cannabis takes away the fear and puts a body on on like into neutral and so the everything that works in the body works really well like you that's why you get hungry and

like I want to be chill when I'm doing this guys being on camera I stress hi I am Michelle Raven I am the founder of mom jeans provisions I bake cookies with THC and CBD and today we're gonna be baking Nutella pretzel cookies laced with CBD this is our CBD product here which is coming from here in New York just to address this right off the bat CBD is not THC I'm gonna say it won't get you high but it will definitely affect your mood this recipe will make twenty cookies and I want about ten milligrams of CBD in each of my cookies and that's gonna give me kind of like a warm bath feeling when I eat a cookie like imagine you're walking on a cold winter day if you have like a big backpack of text books on your back and you're trudging you walk into your house and you take off that backpack and you sit down and it's warm that's what CVD does so that's what I want to achieve with these cookies today let's get started what we're gonna do first is we're gonna just start by making regular cookies so I have here about half a pound of butter going right in so just want to make sure it's super soft because that's gonna make a good cookie so we're just going to cream it and this is actually a good time to add our CBD because we wanted to bind to the fat molecules in the cookie to have the greatest amount of effect and also we want to disperse it evenly throughout the cookie dough we're gonna put 200 milligrams of CBD oil into the butter so here we go so we're gonna cream the CBD oil with the butter if you're confused about how to make good cookies at home this is also a great lesson in that because people don't cream their butter and their sugar for long enough and put enough air in their cookies and so when they bake them they just kind of stay as like rocks and we want those like spreadable like crinkly cookies there's no point of making like a CBD cookie if it's gonna suck so let's cream this so we put a hundred grams of white sugar and 320 grams of brown sugar and once again there's a half a pound of butter in here okay so the brown sugar and the butter and the CBD and the white trigger are all creamed together we're gonna add the vanilla and the eggs so now we have a teaspoon of baking powder a teaspoon of baking soda 390 grams of flour I'm just gonna put that all together and so right now because I'm adding the dry ingredients what we want to do is mix as minimally as possible so I'm gonna put it in and I'm just gonna stir until just combined okay so this is just about as mix as I want it I'm gonna add the Nutella and the chocolate chips yes and get those mixed in and then at the very end I'm gonna just add the pretzels and they're just gonna kind of crunch through the cookies so chocolate chips in so like a bag like what you would buy at the grocery store those bags that's a good amount I'm just gonna smear this on to the paddle so it marbles in and I want it to mix completely and so when you bite into it you get like Nutella bleeds gushes of Nutella it's a culinary term actually gosh is of Nutella okay so that's it for mixer and now I'm just gonna throw the pretzels in and what I love about a stand mixer is that they crunch them for you and it's such a satisfying noise should I put my mic down to it okay oh yeah crunch crunch crunch okay if you're interested in making these at home and you don't have any special tinctures of THC or CBD or anything you just you just make these recipes on your own and you just you just do your thing okay so this is my scoop I use this scoop with every batch of cookies every batch of cookies that I make bake at the same temperature they make the same amount of dough so I know that there will be 20 scoops taught so I brought my lucky scoop from home and here we go oh my god gorgeous already so the cookies will spread quite a bit so you don't want to put more than 6 on each tray for me when I bake with CBD and THC it takes about 53 to 56 minutes for it to activate in my system so if you are wondering oh I ate this edible and nothing's happening to me what should I do just wait because likely it's just taking a bit longer and you know people with different metabolisms the THC and the CBD will affect you differently okay so like I said there we have it twenty perfectly dosed cookies once you have them in the oven at 350 they bake for about 12 minutes but keep an eye on them alright so it's been about 13 minutes and I'm gonna grab those cookies out of the oven now oh yeah they're perf so these will be super lovely and crispy on the outside and then that Oh a gooey chocolaty on the inside and there's one more ingredient I have some meld on salt here which is that like flat flakey delicious crunchy salt and if the pretzels aren't salty enough this will definitely add another element of flavor and when you add salt to cookies it just makes them taste like so much sweeter and richer oh they're so good all right so let's check out the inside oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god what do you not want even done are you you crazy [Music] or you special you ever had right here Emma Levi made this like Ionis I can't believe I made this this is rude this is ridiculous the taste of these doggies are insane salty and it's like the bottom is like crispy and the top is crispy but the middle is like doughy and delicious in this chocolate chips would I say the gush factor was that the the technical term I used for the Nutella I just got a gush factor right there anyway it's closing thoughts cookies are great everyone loves a cookie but when they're laced with CBD it takes them just to that next level you got broken up with you got a D on your test your boss yelled at you grab a cookie she beat you for life for the recipe click the link in the description below [Music]", "3K6-ownuAEU": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] what's up everybody should have the cannabis live and we are here with another video today we are talking about TAC capsules I want to talk about one set of capsules here I tried first which is by a company called one origin and these capsules as I showed you in a previous video those that saw it are green these are ten milligrams each there's no CBD you get ten pills in a bottle now there are these 1:1 capsules they look like this you get seven in the bottle and you know each one is gonna have CBD and THC in it and it says right on here the serving size is fifteen point three nine milligrams so these are completely two separate companies one origin and Wellsprings fields which was originally known for making the first concentrates wife's concentrates in Ohio but now is making capsules as well they also make caramels I haven't tried those but definitely a good company comparisons well with the THC only capsules I did notice two onset within about 30 to 40 minutes of taking it and it did help me with my voice I was able to talk a lot even though I'm still dealing with the healing of my tumor being removed it did help me with talking I had some pain relief but it wasn't you know overwhelming pain relief experience even after taking two pills in one day in about eight hour period now as far as the Wellsprings one one product i started today will just take one and I'm still feeling the effects of it I took it at 11:08 ATM and that is now 1:00 p.m. and so I still have felt the effects of this product and I haven't needed to take any other medical marijuana products at this time so right now if I had him you know comparing them I would say that obviously the one-to-one is gonna be stronger in CBD since the other product had no CBD and to go over that again to see medium amount in this product is eighty nine point one one milligrams the total THC in this product is 107 milligrams and this product the total TAC reach pill was ten point five two milligrams so like I said for me I think it's important to add CBD into our medication routine so I'm gonna probably be more into these than I am to these although idea like the effect of these so like I say if you are already used to medicating with CBD an tac I would recommend this one if you like that but also I'm not gonna exclude you from trying this one if you just want to try pure THC so I'm kind of on the fence I think this one's a little bit better because he dose is stronger and you have the CBD with it but like I said you could always take two of these and that would be 20 milligrams of THC and that's pretty good amount to medicate with for first time if you if you've already been used to doing edibles and everything else pills work a little bit differently because you're swallowing it and then it goes down into your digestive tract and it solves down inside your body where it edible is you're needing them and chewing them first and some of that's get into your saliva and everything else so for me comparison wise compared to eating gummies I would say that I definitely got a more even stronger effect than I normally get when just taking and a de Bourgh got me or something like that so I recommend both products but I more strongly recommend this one if you want to add CBD if you're looking for CBD you're gonna want this one but you only get seven if you get this one you're getting no CBD and you're getting 10 of these price-wise this is $50 this is $40 I think this is a little might be a little bit more than 50 like 55 so it might have a tax so these were cheaper but the ones without TAC were cheaper if you wanted to take away so with that I'll go ahead and go [ __ ] boy anthing Mohawk campus live make sure your life subscribe you can also donate to my GoFundMe if they hit link in the description thank you for your support please [Music]", "alj-mqJrHS0": "well it's a big day in the state of new jersey the state legislator approved a bill setting up a legal cannabis marketplace and the development comes a little over a month after voters in the state came out for in favor of an amendment legalizing recreational marijuana use so here to tell us more about this is carly wolf state policies coordinator with the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws thank you so much for joining us and by the way this group has been advocating for marijuana decriminalization and legalization since 1970. carly with today's vote and the pending signing from new jersey governor phil murphy how long will it take for residents of the state to notice this change so actually the next step after the legislation is signed into law by the governor which he's for sure expected to sign he's been super supportive then on january 1st which is when the constitutional amendment officially takes effect so on january 1st marijuana will be legal to possess and use for all adults but of course we still have to see the all the rules and regulations that will be governing this new industry come to fruition and those rules and regulations will be established by the cannabis regulatory commission which is um the agency that that will will have members appointed to it which will uh governing which will be governing the the new industry um so so far two people have been appointed and i think that in the next few months we're going to see one more people being appointed to this commission and then hopefully by this summer we'll see some more of those rules and regulations um come out of that commission hopefully there'll be a period where they'll take public comment so you know residents of new jersey who who voted to see this policy change will will hopefully have the chance to weigh in there but as far as when uh adults will legally be be able to purchase marijuana that is all kind of still up in the air looking at other states if those states are any indication it could take anywhere from six months to four years i'm hoping new jersey will be on the earlier side of that especially since it looks like that the new jersey medical marijuana dispensaries will be able to in the first round start immediately dispensing recreational marijuana in addition to medical marijuana to all adults okay so because of that so sorry about that go ahead please continue no i was just gonna say that you know because these these establishments already have their their infrastructure in place and are operational um for that reason i hope it'll it'll be sooner rather than later okay so broadening things out a little bit today's story started with voters favoring this ballot measure back in november but what did we learn about the nation's stance on marijuana since the 2020 election yeah i think that in addition to making progress in new jersey and and some other states this election we've also made a lot of progress at the federal level the marijuana opportunity reinvestment and expungement act also known as the moore act which is the most comprehensive piece of legislation at the federal level did advance in the house of representatives um i believe that was just just last week it was approved by the house of representatives um sending it on to the senate for consideration um although it's not it's not looking very promising in the senate um in this next year ahead i think it's very very notable that you know the members of congress went on record and passed this piece of legislation so i think that really sets the stage for um the coming years and months for for federal reform to advance and of course public support is at an all-time high latest polling data shows almost 70 support across the nation and that's you know from people all over the political spectrum on that note in the very short time we have left when it comes to comparing federal and local laws or state laws rather what what's maybe the first problem that you see that might result in some conflicting laws between federal and state stances yeah so i think um that really stems from the scheduling of marijuana as a schedule one on the controlled substances act um which is the the most restricted uh category um it puts marijuana on par with other drugs such as cocaine and heroin um so i think that that's really where um that federal state extension stems from and if marijuana is ultimately descheduled it would ease many of those tensions okay and we actually reported earlier last month about efforts to

For a second I thought this was gonna be a very medical question and then it just took a turn. (dance music) This is one of my favorite segments I do, but before we start reading and responding to your comments, I want to ask you a couple of questions. I've seen a few comments\nof people requesting me to start selling merch. I wanna do that if\nthat's what you're into. I can come up with some\npretty funny mug slogans, t-shirt slogans, I can give you a shirt\nthat almost looks like the scrubs with my logo on it, donate some of the proceedings\nto Limitless Tomorrow or some of the other\nfoundations I work with. And the second thing\nthat I've seen is people asking if I have a PO box so they can send questions and letters. I've already had some\nletters sent to my hospital, I just posted on Instagram, it's a really cute drawing\nby an 11 year old girl that was just adorable. So if you want one of those\nor you want two of those, or you like none of those, leave it down below in the comments, and I hope you enjoy\nthis week's responding to comments video. Let's get started, pew woop! Whenever I eat apples or potato products, I sweat a little bit\nand my nipples get hard. Why is that? I love your channel. Officer moose, awesome username. Your nipples get hard from\neating apples or potato products? There's a condition known\nas oral allergy syndrome which is not exactly\nwhat you're describing but basically what it\nis is your mouth tingles and it feels like you're\nhaving a little bit of allergic reaction when you eat foods with certain triggering proteins. Again that can happen\nwith apples, bananas, but it has nothing to do with\nyour nipples getting hard. Officer moose, I don't know if\nyou're turned on by potatoes. As they say, whatever floats your boat, I'm not here to judge. Would you be willing to do\na video on the word quiet in the ER. I have heard there is a secret rule, never say for example quiet day so far. Chaos King, you're absolutely right. You never wanna say that\nit's been a quiet day, you never wanna say\nit's been a quiet call. For some reason, every time you say that it's been quiet, and you're grateful for it, you suddenly get a lot of admissions, emergency situations, rapid responses, code blues, and you start running around like a chicken with its head (mumbles). Now I'm not a superstitious guy, I've said the word quiet, and I've brushed people off who told me I shouldn't have said it, but I see why it exists. Mirthe Van der Heide. Hi I'm 13 years old and\nrecently I saw a video of how you can grow a few inches per week by doing stretches, is this possible? What you should focus on to grow the tallest possible is eating a healthy balanced diet, making sure you get enough protein, make sure you're eating\nyour veggies and fruits, I know that sounds like\nyour grandma talking, but it's true you need those minerals, you need that ability to grow. You need to get enough sleep, because when you sleep\nwell you actually get a lot of growth hormone release, and when I say a lot I\nmean the right amounts so you're not hurting the amount of growth hormone you're getting, and then on top of that you wanna make sure you're exercising. When you exercise it boosts your hormones, it boosts your growth hormone, it makes you process food differently, it makes your muscles grow, and all of those things will contribute to your physical appearance, including your height. Two girls were born to the same mother, on the same day, at the same time, in the same month and year, and yet they're not twins. How can this be? Okay give me a second Teresa. Two girls, born to the same mother, the eggs of a mother were\nartificially inseminated via in vitro fertilization, and they were born by a surrogate, so they were coming from the same mother, even though they were\nborn in different women, as different surrogates. That's my medical answer to that question. Is that the answer you think? Is it normal to talk, or in my case talk and sing in your sleep? This is pretty cool Meg\nI wonder if you're a good singer in your sleep. Actually talking in your\nsleep has a medical term, I'm gonna butcher how to pronounce it, somniloquy I think is the\nright way to pronounce it. It is a normal behavior, it's usually a short lived occurrence. I wouldn't worry about it\nunless causing a disruptance, a disturbance, to your sleep cycle. If you occasionally chatter in your sleep, it's not a big deal. Actually what you should do is record it, and play it back the next day. I've actually heard of some\npatients say some pretty R-rated or X-rated stuff in their dreams, so be careful you might\nbe spilling some secrets to your partner. Robert Mills, I know medical stuff, like stethoscope, tongue depresser, and suppository. What do you know about it? I hope everyone knows what\na tongue depresser is. People hate those, and I get it 'cause\nwhen people put anything into my mouth, when people put any kind of\nmedical device into my mouth, when people put a dental\nmold into my mouth it triggers my gag reflex and I have a huge panic attack I've said that before. Yes Robert you know a\nlot of medical words. Doc I'm a disabled vet. Thank you for your service, Thank you for your sacrifice. I've been gaining weight since I retired. What kind of cardio stuff doesn't require full use of the legs? Oh Marion this is such a good question. Immediately my head goes to swimming. Whenever I think of low\nimpact exercise that is really good for losing weight\nI think of swimming. I assume you can swim\nwithout the use of your legs. I think that there might be\nsome flotation aid devices that you can use to help you swim and allow your heart rate to go up. I know you mentioned cardio to lose weight and while high intensity\ninterval training is great and you can do that\nlike I said by swimming or playing some sports, do some weight training. I know weight training isn't\nalways related to weight loss but actually if you put on\nmuscle on your upper body 'cause you can use your arms, you can burn more calories\nthroughout the day which will lead to more\nsustained weight loss. So people that just do cardio all day long have trouble losing\nweight when they plateau. Michelle Squidy, hey Doc how's Roxy? Haven't seen her in a\nwhile hope she's good. Michelle Roxy's amazing\nI actually just had her stay at my place for the last three weeks because my dad went on vacation to Spain, super jealous 'cause I didn't get to go. Having Roxy there in my apartment is crazy because they're just on top of each other the whole time they love playing. I try to share some stuff on Instagram. If you're not following me\non Instagram you should be. It's doctor spelled out dot Mike. So definitely follow me\non there I put updates on me Roxy and Bear all the time. Is one sleeping position\nhealthier than others? Me the general rule that\nI give to my patients is you should sleep in whatever position you feel most comfortable. Now if you experience pain\nin this specific position, you should change. If you experience acid\nreflex or post nasal drip, there are ways to change\nyour sleeping position. So if you ever feel like you're\nnot getting restful sleep or you wake up feeling sore, that's a good conversation\nto have with your doctor. Mr. Jason Hammer, hey\nDoctor Mike can you tell us what you think about weed? Ah marijuana. Marijuana marijuana marijuana, hot topic in the press right now. It's getting legalized\nit seems like everywhere, in New Jersey where I\npractice you're able to prescribe it for a certain\nnumber of medical conditions. In New York they're\nthinking about legalizing it for recreational use. Is it as bad as something like alcohol? Probably not, but do we\nhave firm research on that? No not yet. Not talking about marijuana\nfor medical usages. I think marijuana for\nmedical usages should've been researched decades ago, and the fact that we haven't\nis truly disappointing to me. Now I'm talking about recreational use. Now here's the difference. When you drink alcohol, because it affects so\nmany parts of your body, gives you hangovers, makes you throw up, it functions itself as a deterrent, so it limits how much you can drink and how often you can drink. When you smoke marijuana\nor you eat an edible, you can really do that\nfor a long period of time, and you can do it multiple days in a row, and it doesn't have much\nof a deterrent other than probably I would say smell, because a lot of people are turned off by the smell of marijuana, or at least many people that I know are. So the fact that you\ndon't have this deterrent that alcohol has can\nreally make you consume a lot more marijuana than you can alcohol. Also a lot of people self\nmedicate with marijuana. They have some social anxieties and instead of facing their goals, instead of achieving and\nbecoming better people, that they can become\nhappier with themselves, they blunt that anxiety by\nsmoking or ingesting marijuana. So do I think marijuana is\nthis horrible evil thing that people have once said it once was and I thought it was when I was younger in fifth grade doing DARE and all those other drug programs? It probably isn't if it's destigmatized and legalized it probably\nwon't be the gateway drug that we once thought it would be. I think it's on its way to get legalized, but that doesn't mean that it's safe, it doesn't mean that I\nrecommend people do it, I do think it has serious\nmedical harms that do exist, that we don't yet even know about 'cause it hasn't been studied properly. My thoughts on marijuana, should probably be legalized. Before we start labeling something as evil or amazing we should get\nour research behind that. So that's why I'm never going to tell you marijuana is amazing or marijuana is awful because I just don't have the\nresearch to show otherwise. The big danger with marijuana\nis young people using it and it can change the\nchemistry of your brain and change the development of it so that's obviously a danger. But we can regulate that, we can control it. There are some pros, there's also some cons. It's about balancing that and getting your science in order before making a decision. I'm still looking at the science, I'm not an expert, I'm looking to improve, so if you have some articles\nyou want me to take a look at drop them down below in the comments and I'll gladly read them to improve my knowledge on the subject. Why do you wear two watches? Maria thank God you asked this question. These are not two watches. This is a watch, classical, I love Zenith watches\nI have a few of them. I believe a gentleman\nshould always wear a watch. This is a fitness tracker. It's a Fitbit. This is what I use to track my steps, my heart rate, I do some exercises on a Peloton bike, so I'm not wearing two watches, I wear a fitness tracker and a watch.

federal level and while we're at it i'm going to tell you about cannabinoids which determine the intensity and it determines the physical sensations you're going to feel in your body and i'm going to tell you about terpenes which determine the smell and stinkiness of the flower so when you go shopping for flour online you're going to be able to find the best stinkiest flower that just really smacks so without rambling too much i'm gonna get right into it my name's chris with cbd extract.co i've been in the cannabis industry for 10 years and hemp specifically for three years and what i can tell you from my experience is that the words hemp marijuana and cannabis all mean the same thing technically but thanks to our good old buddy donald trump he now made federal legal definitions for these terms for example marijuana is defined as any cannabis product that has more than 0.3 percent delta 9 thc now we're not talking about thca we're not talking about delta 8 thc and we're not talking about any other form of thc we're only talking about delta nine so if it's above that threshold it's marijuana so and that's really weird because on a federal level that's a controlled substance it's a schedule one controlled substance so it's up there with meth heroin crack cocaine whatever those drugs are i don't know specifically because i don't do those drugs but what i do know is that it's in the same category which is totally bogus and messed up but what's crazy is that hemp is defined as less than 0.3 delta 9 thc so what that means is that all the other cannabinoids like cbg cbn thca delta athc these are all compounds that have free reign to be bought sold and shipped over state borders on a federal level it's completely legal and usps will actually ship this no problem they will not confiscate your product as long as it has a lab test in the package now what this means for you is you can literally go on google right now you can go on google right now and type in hempflower or delta8thc or cbg and you can literally buy products that look like marijuana but are completely legal to be bought and shipped to your house that is literally crazy that's insane so and as a matter of fact if you want to get your hands on some indoor flour you can get an eighth totally for free at cbdxrack.co we actually give a free eighth of our greenhouse or indoor grown flower completely for free all you got to do is hit the link below so definitely check that out um it you got nothing to lose it's totally free we covered the pot all you got to do is cover the postage but anyways to figure out if the product is legal or not so it's actually safe to be shipped because keep in mind marijuana is illegal to be shipped over state borders you don't want to send marijuana over the border or buy it accidentally online and then you get caught and get in trouble so what you need to do is look at the lab test and so i'm going to pop this up on the screen right now but if you look at the lab test you'll see the triangle 9 thc as long as that percentage right there is less than 0.3 you're in the clear and it's considered hemp um if it's over obviously it's marijuana that's considered hot hot hemp as they call it and completely illegal unless you live in a recreational state so um and keep in mind like i said total thc doesn't matter on a federal level um the thca doesn't matter delta a thc cbg cbn none of that matters only the delta nine so keep that in mind i know i'm like a broken record at this point with the delta nine stuff but that's literally just how it works um so if you want to find the best quality this is the we need to look at because we're already looking at the lab test i might as well teach you how to get the best quality hemp flower there's a lot of people there's a lot of crappy dirty ditch wheat out there but basically if you look at the lab test you'll see the total cannabinoid percentage cannabinoid cannabinoid i don't know everyone says it different but basically the higher that percentage is the more you're going to feel so for example if you have a high cbd flower it's going to be relaxing if you have a high cbg flower it's going to be more stimulating because cbg is considered a non-psychoactive stimulant some people react to it differently they don't know too much about it but obviously each cannabinoid has a different effect cbn it's actually slightly psychoactive and it um makes you sleepy all right and then obviously if you have a high thca product when you smoke that thca it turns into delta 9 thc so obviously it gets you high same thing with delta 8 thc okay so basically you can buy these products online okay so if you want to get the products that really smack because a lot of people say oh hemp flour kind of sucks like it doesn't really make me feel like anything you need to get a higher percentage flower okay it's really that simple it works just like the medical industry with marijuana the higher the percentage the more you're going to feel and like i said you have different ratios of the cannabinoids the the percentages of them the next thing you want to look at in terms of the smell is going to be the terpenes now the terpenes are essentially the oils found in the bud that give it that pungent smell so if you're smelling pine you're smelling skunk you're smelling weird marijuana smells or whatever you know it just smells like weed in general that's a result of the terpenes and these terpenes actually indicate whether or not it's indica or sativa so for example uh limonene is considered a sativa uh terpene and mercine is considered a indica so if you look at the lab test you can see which terpenes are dominant that actually determines what effects are going to feel because these terpenes actually indicate um how you're gonna feel right they bind to your receptors in the same way that cannabinoids do so it's really crazy and one more thing to look out for when you're shopping for hemp flour online is don't just go off the pictures because you're gonna see these big dank beautiful buds you're gonna see like all these reviews and stuff but you might get it in the mail if you're going at it blindly and you'll be like man these buds are like dull smelling they don't really do anything they kind of smoke it i got a throat itch and a headache you don't want that so always look at the lab test right because the lab test is like your safeguard to make sure you're getting quality product you don't want to be wasting your money you don't want to smoke dirty ditchweed and also you want to see on the lab test if there's panel testing for pesticides because who knows maybe they're selling pesticide hemp flour you need to protect yourself so always look at the lab test and that's pretty much it so hemp flour yeah it actually can get you high if you buy a certain type of product just have in general you can get high if you buy a certain type of product but really guys it's just so simple if you want to feel good look at the lab test check the cannabinoids and the terpenes and you're going to get good product so that's pretty much it i hope you enjoyed this video and like i said if you want access to indoor and greenhouse grown flower hit the link below we're doing a free eighth promo uh there's nothing for you to lose all you gotta do is hit the link if you're from the us you qualify if you're from the uk or another country uh we do not do shipping internationally so sorry guys but that's it i'm chris

"mfXGpVi-YRs": "hi when I was invited here to give a talk on marijuana I wasn't sure exactly what that meant on the subject of or just on I hate to disappoint so I'm doing both my pleasure have you ever really looked at your hand I tell that joke because according to lore people high on marijuana are amazed by their limbs often Wells slow motion speed eating Doritos in their parents basement I hate this joke because it invokes a stereotype that is reductive at best and supports a system of diabolical lies at worst but I'm getting ahead of myself my name is David Schneider and I am a pothead by this I mean that when it comes time to enjoy an adult intoxicant I will forego beer wine and spirits in favor of marijuana which for me offers a world of nuanced delight and inspiration beyond the more crude effects of booze but I am NOT here to proselytize and for a long time I kept quiet about my own enjoyment of weed it was illegal for most of the time I was enjoying it and why make myself vulnerable as an out-and-proud law breaker if I didn't have to I also dreaded being saddled with the stoner stereotype of having my every move interpreted through the lens of pothead a label that calls up images of mr. Magoo levels of forgetfulness and passivity bordering on the comatose so what if I used weed not to escape but to engage with art and ideas and food and dogs and hilariously terrible movies I was but one man and I couldn't reconfigure society's image of the pothead all by myself I stayed in the closet and I'm familiar with the closet I grew up gay in the pre Elin bad old days when the only out gays were those who couldn't or didn't want to hide it drag queens and butch lesbians and gay bar raid victims whose faces wound up in newspapers and these Trailblazers might have been the whole of queer representation if Harvey Milk hadn't urged everyone to come out especially all the non remarkable queers who'd previously flown under the radar only then could an honest portrait of this subculture emerge it's the same with weed only instead of drag queens and Butch's weeds visibility parade is led by Cheech and Chong and Snoop Dogg and unlucky subjects of weed busts and I love drag queens and Snoop Dogg but leaving such exceptional outliers to do the heavy lifting of representation not only skews perception it allows damaging lies to flourish and the primary source of these lies is unfortunately the US government which has strenuously vilified weed and its users for over 80 years in 1930 the head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics declared and I quote marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes and makes [ __ ] think they're as good as white men this type of slander presented as science was codified in 1970 when the Controlled Substances Act scheduled marijuana as a Schedule one narcotic a designation reserved for extremely dangerous drugs with no accepted medical use it is hard to overstate the pernicious effects of this weeds Schedule one classification for one thing by scheduling weed as a dangerous drug with no medical benefit the government makes it extremely difficult to conduct research that would prove that marijuana is a not very dangerous drug with a wealth of medical benefits for example to study allegedly less dangerous schedule to drugs scientists just the schedule to drugs like cocaine or crystal meth allegedly less dangerous schedule 2 to study these drugs scientists just whip up some crystal meth and study it but to study schedule 1 marijuana researchers must be pre-approved by the FDA apply for government grown marijuana from the National Institute of drug abuse and be temporarily deputized by the DEA as only federal agents are allowed to handle schedule 1 narcotics add to this the fact that most funding for drug research comes from the pharmaceutical industry which views weed is a threat and has a vested interest in keeping it labeled as a dangerous drug with no medical benefits but as patients in two dozen Medical Marijuana states can tell you weed has a ton of medical benefits from quashing nausea to minimizing arthritis pain to controlling seizure disorders and in the face of all this cognitive dissonance with the government's lies chafing against the actual experience of humans speaking honestly about my own we'd use seemed like the least I could do so I started doing it I'm a writer who often writes about myself and being honest about we'd was a lot like being honest about gayness both called for greater specificity instead of saying I was on a date say I was out with a guy when writing about celebrating with friends mention the ball when I started this coming out stoner campaign weed was still illegal where I lived but I worked in an alternative news weekly that encouraged radical honesty and where I'd gotten high with the editor and publisher still fixing myself with the stoner label was itchy and I offset dread of stereotyping by stepping up my professional courtesy game I was aggressively punctual ostentatiously well-organized and as reasonably well motivated as every other person on earth and the world turned now it's 2015 and within a five-mile radius of where you sit here in Seattle there are a half dozen stores where anyone over 21 can purchase marijuana for recreational use there are also a couple dozen dispensaries where authorized patients can buy marijuana for medicinal use meanwhile 300 miles east selling the small amount of marijuana for any reason can earn the seller a life sentence an insane state of affairs summed up well by CNN's Mike Riggs it should be cruel and unusual to mete out life without parole sentences for a drug that's so mainstream that Colorado is using state collected pot taxes to build new schools yeah and sorry about the notecards I'm really bad at memorizing so we need to strive for integrity in our nation's pot laws and a good first step is moving beyond the marijuana monster myths peddled by the feds one such myth marijuana is a gateway drug no it's not the gateway drug theory holds that people that smoke weed are more likely to try harder drugs but the main thing pushing weed smokers towards harder drugs our black-market weed dealers selling harder drugs the prohibition creates the connection another myth people just want medical marijuana to get high shut up the most exciting developments in medical marijuana involves strains that are incapable of making anyone high opening a world of treatment for people who want their medicine without a side of stoned like kids with seizure disorders also it is fascinating how this people just want X to get high argument is never applied to prescription painkillers which killed ten thousand people a year prescription painkillers killed 10,000 people a year while no one in the history of the world has ever died from marijuana another myth marijuana will make you stupid and maybe insane this one's harder to dismiss and not because it is true but because it can be true for weeds most vulnerable potential users which are kids for those whose brains and bodies are still developing marijuana can create a lifetime of problems from diminished learning capacities to an enhanced chance of mental illness and humans under 21 should not smoke or otherwise ingest marijuana and actually maybe even 21 is too young if I were in charge people wouldn't be able to start smoking weed until halfway through grad school speaking of white privilege earlier I mentioned Seattle's many weed stores all of them raking in huge legal profits on the same streets where earlier weed entrepreneurs earned prison sentences and if recreational marijuana is ever going to be a truly guilt free pleasure we need to rectify our nation's pot laws and do right by those whose lives were ruined by draconian war on drugs sentencing for now if you are someone who appreciates marijuana either as medicine or diversion or both come out you don't need to cast yourself as a marijuana spokesmodel but stop treating your weed based pleasures as a source of shame to be kept secret and the rest of you stop lazily accepting the old stoner lore I understand that we live in an age of fewer and fewer acceptable stereotypes and we want to cherish those few we have left but the stupid stoner one is just boring seriously if I could get every weed smoking surgeon and lawyer and new New York Times bestselling author I know here with me on stage and if we had spent the past couple weeks rehearsing the Thriller dance we could blow your faces off thank you", "FYZ7iwJ8rzM": "welcome back to the talking hedge I'm Josh Kincaid and this is a cannabis business podcast it's official scientists can now make the cannabis psychoactive without the plant lab made cannabis is coming in a move that's expected to transform the cannabis and pharmaceutical industries scientists at the University of California at Berkeley announced on Wednesday that they had for the first time created a cannabis compound in a lab instead of by harvesting them at from a plant using an increasingly popular approach known as synthetic biology the research is genetically engineered yeast to churn out a key component cannabis that's a precursor of two of the best-known compounds of the plant THC and CBD using those precursors they made the compounds themselves no farmer field required while THC is part of the cannabis that causes a high CBD has an emerging reputation as a therapeutic and mmm active ingredient and the first federally approved cannabis based medication thanks to the health and wellness uses that CBD is tied to the so the market compound could reach us sixteen billion dollars as a result by 2025 up from maybe a billion or so now so this news is likely to have big implications for startups and pharmaceutical companies that want to make new cannabis based drugs from everything from epilepsy to pain and arthritis several companies are working on similar efforts Wall Street has noticed as well by saying that lab made cannabis is one on a growing list of factors helping to accelerate cannabis as an entry into the pharmaceutical and consumer wellness industries there could be a whole host of new products that could come from this lab made marijuana could have multiple advantages over traditionally grown marijuana like lower costs and a smaller environmental footprint genetically editing yeast to produce THC and CBD is cheaper than extracting the chemicals from cannabis plants with an approximate cost of $400 per kilogram the yeast can also be used to produce other cannabinoids that occur in cannabis but which haven't been studied to date as he only naturally exists in cannabis in such a small dose that is too expensive to study their effects it's also possible to add chemicals to the yeast to create new altered cannabinoids which could potentially be used and studied for further it turns out Frankenstein cannabis is not something that I'm excited about and with that we're gonna roll this one up I'm Josh Kincaid this is a talking hedge and I'm out", "V_OLCJGpjEc": "alright guys so what happens when your dog eats over a dozen pot cookies now I hesitated to make this video footage is like a year old and I'm gonna show you I just wanted to you know I decided you know I'm gonna make it you know it's by mistake you never want to give your dog marijuana or anything like that I'll kind of talk and give you guys kind of the story of when I went down and I'll have some footage of the day you know going in and out and then the end of the video I'll have some more footage so basically what had happened was I have an ex-girlfriend okay I absolutely loved her dog like I grew up with dogs my whole life but me and her dog just had like this special bond and I just fell in love with pit bulls ever since I was up people just got pit bulls just cuz their look and they look aggressive and all that stuff but pit bulls are the most affectionate dog absolutely love them so I get a phone call alright I haven't talked to my ex-girlfriend in like 2 or 3 months she calls me she's like hey she calls me cry and she's like oh my god like Avis had a seizure or a stroke or whatever I can't lift her up and put her in her car you have to come over blah so I hop in my Jeep I fly down there like I freakin robbed a bank I'm like super like oh my god like this sucks like I love you know her dog so I get there and you know sure enough she's laying in her dog bed can't really walk is like drooling a little bit and I'm just like damn it like this is it you know I had to put her down or whatever so I pick her up take her to the vet and the vet gets to asking her questions she's like she's like okay how old is your dog has your dog maybe eaten anything or whatever and she's like oh she gets in the trash sometimes but she's never like nothing's ever happened to her and then she's like has she maybe eaten any marijuana whatever and then Desiree kind of pauses and she's just like and then it dawns on her okay her brother was over a brother I'd cancer and you know eating edibles and stuff like that really helps like his appetite and he doesn't have cancer anymore which is awesome but basically they they made like 20 pot cookies and somehow you know it dawned on her that she left the bag and that's what must have happened to Ava she goes oh my god that you know that must've been it she must have had the pot cookie so basically we go from thinking her dog is dying and having a stroke or whatever - oh she just is super high right now on weed and needs to come down off his high so it was actually like a really scary day that turned out best case scenario because you can't really overdose on weed like it's not gonna kill you or anything like that so after all of this desert was actually going on a trip and she was like hey can you watch Ava over the next few days because I don't want to just leave her alone when she's working you know tripping so I was like yeah sure whatever you know awesome she goes to my house and I bring the kennel all along because Ava with some pit bulls no matter like even if you you you try to train him good some of them are just a little bit dog aggressive so Ava happens to be very dog aggressive you know won't hurt a fly as far as humans and stuff like that but does not like other dogs you know and I had my my English taffy shadow but you know I had a kennel you know I could just separate them into rooms or whatever but I thought you know what this might be a perfect opportunity to kind of see if they can become friends because Ava is dog aggressive - random dogs but if she like she has been together with other dogs before in the past and it's worked out but I was kind of scared you know being you know my little puppy I don't want it like Ava freaking biting her biting biting him so I was like okay Ava's were very high right now when you're high the last thing you're thinking about is kicking someone's ass so I was like maybe Ava's super chill and whatever and I can kind of introduce the dog so I was super nervous to introduce shadow and Ava but it worked out perfectly so Ava had no aggression she was just chilling kind of excited and all this stuff so they became actually best friends after this Ava stayed over at my house and they cuddled together they were freaking licking each other's faces and all that stuff so definitely be careful guys if you guys smoke marijuana or anything like that if you guys have edibles laying around the house you definitely don't want your dogs to get into it Ava was high for like two or three days she had trouble walking running just we're actually weird like normally she just licks your face but she was like kind of biting you softly I was just just not acting like yourself so I can't imagine like what it would do 12 pot cookies to a 60 pound dog or a 55 pound dog I can't imagine me taking two of those cookies I'd be tripping out of my mind but yeah guys that's what happened kind of hesitated I'm making this video just because it's kind of a weird topic and some people could take it the wrong way and I know you have to be careful you can't just leave stuff like that laying around but thank God it wasn't like some pharmaceutical medications or anything like that because that would kill your dog even like ibuprofen or whatever but the marijuana happened to be in cookies and dogs [ __ ] you know love cookies so April was high for three days and then after that she was just fine and shadow and Ava have been best friends ever since you know me and my ex went out together or anything like that but sometimes like if she goes on a trip I'll watch her dog if if I go on a trip she'll watch shadow so but yeah I hope you guys like the video give it a thumbs up share this video with your friends and yeah just be careful you don't want this to happen to your dog I know it's kind of like it might be a little bit of a funny thing at the end of the day because it did go from we thought Ava was dying to oh she's just tripping out so for us it was kind of like a really awesome thing that she wasn't having a stroke or anything like that but at the same time be careful you don't want that to happen to your dog it's just you know it puts them through torture for a few days so yeah I hope you guys liked it and I'll see you guys next time you walk inside one thing she too long wanna see her walk come here evil walk to me okay yeah this definitely isn't funny but it's kind of funny it's just so relieved that she didn't have a stroke or a seizure or anything like that so this is like best-case scenario yeah we can link relax now well not relax that's better she's taking extra extra extra my neck come on longest pee ever just come oh my god she's so stoned look at her hey left how are you peeing again this Danish cheesy so weird come on Yvette come on you're just running everywhere come on what are you doing David Oh with that noise that noise tripping out so I found the bag I think this was the cookie bag I mean it looks exactly like it so this was in the dirt and it's been raining so it looks all gross now but she ate the cookies dude a dozen pot cookies a pothead you poor thing baby okay [Music]", "Msb9DpTrTTI": "We are anarchist activist sisters. Our goal is to have weed nuns in every city and town across the planet. Hi. I\u2019m Jacki. This is the story of how I spent a week with weed nuns in the middle of California and I only accepted 30% of the joints that were offered to me. I\u2019m not an over-the-top weed enthusiast or anything but I love meeting badass people committed to living life on their own terms. That\u2019s why I\u2019m on my way to meet a woman known as Sister Kate. Sister Kate is the charismatic founder of Sisters of the Valley, a women-led business that crafts medicine out of cannabis. She started it in 2014 and by 2016 she was making $60,000 each month. The thing is, cannabis commerce is technically illegal in Merced County. Police cruise around and rip plants by the ton. We have to walk a very, very fine, clean line here. Pay every cent of taxes, no cash sales. And I know that if we would give them reason, they would shut us down. Sister Kate is the most fascinating human being I\u2019ve ever met in my entire life. She is such a kindhearted person but at the same time, kind of a gangster a little bit. She and her cannabis crusading activist sisters aren\u2019t \u201creal nuns\u201d and they don\u2019t claim to be. We are not at all patterned after Catholic nuns or the Catholic church or affiliated in any way with a man made or contemporary religion. We\u2019ve patterned ourselves after the Beguins. The Beguins came before the first Catholic nun. They worked together, they prayed together, they dressed alike to identify their enclave and they were hand farmers. Just take what you need out of your purse and lock it up. Doesn\u2019t exactly compliment your outfit. Sister Kate, Sister Cass, and Sister Freya are in Merced to pick up payment from their first wholesale client, a head shop downtown. So what am I gonna owe? \u2014 You\u2019re gonna end up owing $120.90 \n\u2014 $120.90. Okay. Even though Sisters of the Valley makes medicine out of cannabis, the cannabis they grow is non-psychoactive. So the weed that they\u2019re growing isn\u2019t going to get you high. It\u2019s not high-end THC but what it does have is CBD, that aspirin-like chemical compound that treats pain. And this should be everything that you asked for. Alright, we can go buy some white blouses. Desiree, what about this one? For making medicine? Oh yeah. The one\u2019s where we splash and throw away? Sister Kate was born Christine Mucin. Have a good day. Thank you, have a nice day. Originally from Wisconsin, she lived for eight years in Amsterdam while working as a business consultant. And needless to say, she doesn\u2019t really fit in here. It\u2019s not her scene. Well you have to understand I worked in London, Stockholm, and in Denmark and so I think it\u2019s about as ugly and as crude as you can imagine. It\u2019s unfinished to me. The whole place is unfinished. But not everybody feels this way about Merced, California. I was born and raised here on a dairy and I\u2019ve seen this town grow up. Like anywhere else, we\u2019ve got our problems but we\u2019re a town of good people. It\u2019s always been kind of run down, a boring place to be, and a very poverty stricken place to be. As a kid, I didn\u2019t know that there was anything else. If you\u2019ve never been to the big, bread basket middle of California before, just know that it is strikingly different than the state\u2019s northern and southern parts. This is not the California with the beaches and the... The tech stuff. This is a place built on agriculture where 25% of the population lives in poverty. Violent gang activity here revolves around prostitution and drugs way less chill than weed. Law enforcement is reportedly overwhelmed, underpaid, and facing high turnover. Education rates lag way behind state averages and there\u2019s just nothing for kids to do. That turns bored kids into criminals. Anybody who\u2019s smart, teaches their children, \u201cKeep your head down, don\u2019t talk to anybody here, go to school, and get out. This is not a nice place.\u201d Cannabis commerce is changing that. Legalizing cannabis commerce would mean economic opportunity and hope for generations living in poverty and incarceration here in the Central Valley. California legalized medicinal marijuana quite some time ago, but there are still tons of local restrictions that have made it impossible for a cannabis industry to really thrive here. Plus, there\u2019s still plenty of people in jail for minor weed related charges. On November 8, 2016, the people of California changed that. Sort of. Proposition 64 amends the state criminal code to allow adults 21 and over to possess a personal amount of marijuana and to grow up to six mature plants at home. But this bill leaves a lot out. Despite widespread availability and growing acceptability, California residents still have to fight to frame marijuana as a medicine and a cash crop. It\u2019s not like we all wake up one morning and go, \u201cMeh, nothing wrong with marijuana. Let\u2019s make it legal.\u201d An it happens, in my opinion, at a grassroots level. It doesn\u2019t happen in the halls of Congress, it doesn\u2019t happen in the halls of city government or county government. It happens on the street level. It\u2019s really more a war between an over-controlling, abusive pharmaceutical and medical environment that\u2019s got our whole government rigged into it. The FDA and so forth. So for us, it\u2019s an activist protest. It\u2019s, \u201cWe don\u2019t take pills and this is our day-to-day medicine.\u201d I\u2019m not a follower of the movement, per say, but I do believe in civil liberties. I think that they should be free to live whatever life they choose to live and that\u2019s why I feel so good about being out here. Anne, come on in and have a seat over next to Sister Freya. We\u2019ll start with a little prayer and I brought some sage over and I think I have a lighter. Mother goddess, put a blessing on these hands that work the medicine today. May these women keep connected with their ancient ancestors and with the medicine making work that they do together. Let them heal and carry the healing and the power of this plant-based medicine on their mission to the people. Amen. I brought all the women together to show them how to trim. You can see I\u2019m trying not to cut on the actual bud but around the bud. Get all these sticks and all the hairs and when we\u2019re done, this is what is considered dispensary quality. That\u2019s what we want because when we take it in there, if it needs more trimming the price drops. Most of these women have not been through a harvest and we\u2019ve got significant CBD crop drying in our shop that needs to come in. Women have taken the brunt of all poverty in all countries. Anywhere you see poverty, women are suffering more from it than men. This order is about making honorable jobs for women. Our holy trinity is spiritualism, servitude, and activism. The servitude is our medicine making and the activism is to change the laws so that they\u2019re more equitable for everyone. Sister Kate leads a revolving cast of workers that has grown steadily since 2014. This is Sister Anne. Um... Well I was in Los Angeles and I was just tired of the city and the crazy life there where you cannot really sleep because of helicopters and the sirens from the fire workers, the police. It\u2019s just no peaceful sound of the birds, like right now. When I came across Sister Kate on the internet and I liked the fact that she was working with medical marijuana. I was impressed by the commentaries of the customers saying they were healed by the medicines. I sent her a message. I came to visit and I like it. So I decided to move. It\u2019s fun. I like it. It\u2019s like a very intelligent plant that is totally connected with us. Who can heal us better than our creator? God and mother nature. She knows the recipe. Ow! Ow. Ow, ow, ow, why?! Ow, ow! We\u2019ll up the concentrate. We\u2019ll double the concentrate. So that went from four ounces to eight ounces. And these are the two strains that I think we should use for now, just for our first batch and then I\u2019ve got Sister Claire working on my calculator so I can start to mix in some of these higher ones. This is all pure bud so three ounces should be good. And then we\u2019re just going to up the concentrate, right? Yes. And we\u2019re doubling the concentrate. It\u2019s sort of an experimental batch to see what happens. Magic. Intuition magic. One of the sisters\u2019 most popular products is the salve. Sister Kate gave me a jar and it is, in fact, amazing. Here\u2019s how they make it: They melt a ton of coconut oil in crock pots, they wait. We\u2019ll let them do that\u2019s thing and be back in a second. All this weed. Remember this weed? Has been tried, cured, and placed in this refrigerator. Sister Freya grinds it, measures it out, then stirs it in the oil along with essential oils like lavender and calendula. Then they package it up, let it solidify, and sell it online. They\u2019ve got customers all over the world. Our customers are Republicans, Democrats, tall people, short people. Suffering is very democratic. Sister Anne and her seven year old son have been waiting weeks to move into their new apartment. The apartment manager is reluctant to rent to Sister Anne because she works with cannabis. I know it\u2019s difficult because you\u2019re a mom of teenagers and you don\u2019t want them to get into something that will destruct them for sports and what you want your kids to grow to. I absolutely understand how you feel and you don\u2019t have to worry because I have a son and I want the same for him. Thank you. Have a nice day. Bye bye. She\u2019s like, \u201cOh you work with the Sisters of the Valley?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t like people that smoke weed.\u201d You know? And she\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t like weed.\u201d Sister Kate had to get involved to secure Anne\u2019s housing. At this point, she\u2019s used to convincing people that her workers aren\u2019t up to anything fishy and she has plenty of documentation to prove it. I also wanted to let you know that the precedent has already been set in courts in California. The landlord cannot be responsible. You don\u2019t have to worry about it with Sister Anne because she doesn\u2019t smoke anyway. She just came here to work in the business. My point is that we wouldn\u2019t dream of putting you at risk and if you have a look at our website which is SistersOfTheValley.org, you can see that we ship our products all around the world and we would not be able to do that. We use the post office and we use regular banking systems and I will provide the report from the sheriff\u2019s department, as well as the permits that I do have, if that will satisfy you. Okay. Okay then she\u2019s going to be bringing those to you this afternoon. Thank you. Sister Anne\u2019s struggle is just one example of how weed is still vilified and misunderstood by many. And it just doesn\u2019t make any sense to me! Long before Jesus Christ was even a dude, people have been using cannabis to treat many, many ailments including addiction recovery, anxiety, chronic pain, seizures. I could go on. This should serve to prove that it is medicine and that\u2019s what Sister Kate is really out to convince people of. We\u2019re sort of asking the whole world, all the women, to participate in just growing the non-psychoactive cannabis and daring the law to shut us down. (singing) We all come from the goddess and to her we shall return like a drop of rain flowing to the ocean. (speaking) Mother Gaia, bless the people that work the land. Restore them now. Give them rest and peace as they\u2019ve all worked very, very hard to make this happen. To bring the crop in and to toil over the plants in a sacred manner and to follow the principles of the sisterhood. It\u2019s not easy being an outsider in a small town and it\u2019s certainly not easy to organize for social change and then turn that into legislation but it\u2019s worth it. Sister Kate is changing the way that people think about cannabis and I couldn\u2019t be more high. I mean, proud. Now we want to know what you think.

breastfeeding stigmatize mothers who choose to send their kid back to daycare at six months and go back to work are stigmatized moms will always be harshly judged more harshly judged than anybody else but as soon as I became a mom I hit it it was a secret even though I have a prescription and I use it for medicinal purposes Vickey below lows is a month the growing number of women who use marijuana while breastfeeding and while pregnant even as medical experts warn against doing just that in fact a recent national survey Fallot there's been a two-fold increase in women using cannabis during pregnancy many of them do so to find relief from things like morning sickness chronic pain and depression among other ailments [Music] Vicki had suffered from debilitating migraines foreigners at age 18 she found what she says was the best remedy in the form of a joint the first thing everybody told me as soon as I got pregnant is you're gonna stop consuming cannabis right you're not gonna use kind of this while pregnant right and she did it during her first trimester she also stopped taking migraine pills it's been three days I'm in bed with a migraine I can't go to work I'm throwing up I can't eat like my body's in a state of distress like that can't be good for my pregnancy that can't be good for the baby that can't be good for me Vicky's doctor prescribed a morphine drip to ease the migraines but for her that didn't seem like the best option I decided to consume cannabis and within 30 minutes I did feel better and I did have relief why did you feel more comfortable using marijuana instead of using the morphine your doctor prescribed because it's an opioid and it's a proven addictive substance but if I continuously took and put it into my body not only would I be addicted but my baby would be addicted by drinking my breast fill I'm back I knew in my heart of hearts that there was other women and mothers out there like me that we're using cannabis for medicinal purposes instead of pharmaceuticals because they didn't want to use pharmaceuticals and I knew they existed I just never knew how to find them recreational cannabis has been legal in Canada since October 2018 and it's been possible to get a prescription for medical cannabis for almost ten years but a shift in the law doesn't always mean a shift in attitude in Quebec doctors are reluctant to prescribe I think there's a lot of a lot of fear a lot of worry when it comes to kids anything involving kids in cannabis and whether it's pregnant women with a fetus hysteria around that cannabis use is still stigmatized Jordana's of its key looks marijuana every single day before she was a mom she used cannabis to get a handle on her anxiety and depression and when she found out she was expecting so pregnancy for me was a nightmare I jumped to being pregnant my entire adult life and when it finally happened I was bedridden with symphysis pubis dysfunction and that's all so it's when you were and your pelvis basically separates from a hormone called relaxin in your body and it happened too early on at 18 weeks I was throwing up until I was 22 weeks pregnant it's up to three times a day if I hadn't used cannabis I'm a prenatal depression and anxiety was so severe that I was not able to get off my couch even in the severe pain that I was dealing with physically it was really bad for me mentally and cannabis was the only release that I got from pain and from the anxiety that Jordanna was reluctant to use cannabis at first but changed her mind after coming across studies conducted in Jamaica back in the 90s that research found that babies born to mothers who consumed marijuana heavily during pregnancy didn't suffer any psychological or neurological setbacks after birth that was enough for Jordanna to take the plunge well I knew that it was working for me and I continued to advocate for myself with my doctors Jordanna was desperate for support and someone to talk to about her marijuana use that need led her to start a cyber support group for other moms in a similar situation that's how she met Annie clawed Bertrand another young mom who turned to cannabis during a difficult pregnancy the two teamed up to create Mother's marry mother's Mary is a not-for-profit organization that empowers and supports moms to live their most authentic lives using cannabis consciously through introspection and attempt right now we are an online peer support group and essentially everyone can utilize the group every day and you know be supported and empowered in that in that space they come to us with questions we accordi three new members today I feel like our Facebook group is growing at a rapid pace today with the exposure in our local community it's proving that like there's you think there's a stigma that comes with being a mom there's a ginormous stigma that's why we're moving our movement for us it's really important to not say terms like stoned or high now or baked like that's not that's not where what's going qualify though I'm Olivier listed faded and yes medicated you guys have a whole slew of synonyms yeah for marijuana and for the feeling of vampire on it yeah [Music] [Music] Annie has two kids and didn't touch marijuana during her first pregnancy but her symptoms both physical and emotional became unbearable with baby number two I vomit up to three or four times a day like being in meetings that were having fun run out and just being like I cannot wait to go home and just have it blend a little puffs like have dinner and try to keep it down you know it's really people I think people underestimate morning sickness like it's really debilitating postpartum depression just took me to the very deepest darkest depths of my life and I didn't know how I was gonna come out felt very suicidal and if it wasn't for cannabis thing I would be I would be divorced or I wouldn't be here we want to give women the pros and the cons and then you make your own decision based on what's right for you what's best for you like your own risk benefit ratio and analysis you know as well yes you advocate for themselves to go to their doctors and other doctors their family members their spouses whoever and are you showing the research article oh yeah oh yeah what do you say to the medical evidence that suggests we're not entirely sure if or how harmful this could be to kids mm-hmm I think that what we have to remember is that no mother is taking this lightly it's definitely not moms who don't need medication who are doing this recreationally that's not what we're talking about but what exactly does the medical evidence suggest we know that marijuana exposure during pregnancy affects the brain of the developing baby dr. katrina mark is an ob/gyn who has closely studied marijuana use during pregnancy the effects of marijuana on the developing fetus are much more long-term than immediate and so you may not be able to see them directly after birth but long-term the effects could range from no discernible difference to difficulties with learning learning disabilities attention disorders and even mental health disorders the response when I tell people that it can be harmful is often but it's not really proven right which I disagree with it is proven that it crosses the placenta and it has effects on the baby's brain and so although I can't show you a picture of exactly what your baby's going to look what like the way I can with something like fetal alcohol syndrome the changes with marijuana exposure are much more nuanced they're not seen five minutes or five days or even five months after birth typically they're not seen for five ten fifteen years and so they're much harder to study and much harder to characterize although pregnant women may experience relief from morning sickness after smoking a joint dr. mark doesn't want women to turn to marijuana as a first resort marijuana use during pregnancy has risks to both mom and baby and I would encourage any women who is using they're considering using it to talk to her doctor about the risks of use and about the potential safer alternatives in the same breath I think that we all need to distinct Nancy and outside of pregnancy because the stigma that surrounds marijuana use some pregnancy makes women feel uncomfortable disclosing their use and if they don't disclose their use to their doctors they can't make an informed decision because they're not receiving the information about the risks Viki never told her doctor that she smoked marijuana while pregnant as with any medication just like morphine or anything else they ask you if the risks outweigh the benefits and for me they did I don't think I would have made it through my pregnancy I don't think I would have been okay to make it through if I wasn't able to medicate when my migraines were that bad I would have ended up in the hospital and I would have ended up on a morphine drip and those have known and proven side effects they're known and proven but th is unknown and unproven that you were using marijuana while you were pregnant my parents my sisters my husband would we eat after Bach you need a diaper were you ever worried about people knowing only in the sense that the fear that maybe they would call child services on me that my child would get taken away from me was that a real concern were you afraid yeah it wasn't actually very afraid I was actually very afraid that I would have been seeing like a drug addict when I clearly wasn't how did you get over that fear I guess I didn't I really I guess I didn't I live without fear my whole pregnancy Oh mommy's here you're so sneaky Spears and sense of isolation went away when she discovered mothers marry online after her son was already born hey Vicki we're so excited today to officially be offering you at your role and we also are gifting you of course you're very excited she even ended up joining the team I put myself out there and um I feel like just so blessed that I was so well received and everybody was so kind to me and so supportive of me and I instantly found the community that you know I loved and here was a bunch of women that I never met I didn't know them personally but I loved them and that when they would write something in the group or comment something I worried about them and I cared about them and that was something I had never found before and as a mom for me it was just life-changing I don't know how else to describe it here we so emotional I know [Music] is it worth the risk um yeah it is worth the risk I know that it made me better I've seen my children from having them in my bellies to the age that they are now and they've hit every milestone they're developing beautiful ease [Music] I don't think cannabis is for everybody especially if you don't suffer from anxiety mental health or fibromyalgia or epilepsy or multiple sclerosis there's a bunch of the elements that cannabis does has been proven to help with so if you don't suffer from one of those things and I don't think you know you really need to consider it but I definitely think you need to consider it if you aren't being prescribed morphine or effects or or serafall and you're pregnant I think that it's a much better medical benefit for yourself and for your child I do stand by that and as opposed to poo as opposed to pills as opposed to pharmaceuticals with with proven by effects with proven site like birth defects in children kind of a saved my life so I don't think I would be here without it being a mom and suffering from severe postpartum depression the cannabis is really the only thing that kept me feeling like I had hope and if I haven't gotten my medical cannabis good morning I'm a new member from Quebec I felt very alone in my universe of a mother smoker they also feel better when he smoked when I'm under the effect of marijuana you

and some things I use if you're new to the channel this is what we do we grow we do rosin press reviews we do rather than squishing you can see all this on my page go check it out I have all these grows everything you see here go check it out give me a subscribe you know hit the little subscription button down below thank you so much if you want to support the channel watch the video all the way through give me a like and thumbs up I can't fit all the tips and tricks in the one video so that's how I'm gonna engage on whether or not I want to keep doing this one or not so if you really want to see some more of this give me some likes give me some comments down below thank you I'll get right into we're gonna go start out in veg and work our way through flour so a first tip I'm going to use is get some make host microbes definitely check them out I have a few videos highlighting them really really beneficial stuff for your root system and bigger roots bigger fruits right that's what I always like to say a lot of people you know so definitely do that badge and flour super crazy important have really good airflow and I mean just in general about temps you want to mimic outside like their plants that came from outside so mimic outside you want to have my go-to temps for my veg tank it is like 70 to 85 degrees 70 is my low 85 is my high you don't have to worry about it as much and badge because they like to be warm don't overwater how I gauge how I need the water is I'll pretty much like put my plants my soil water and I'll let him dry out to the point that they start to droop and that's when I start to get my idea of how light my buckets are and I hold my buckets up and if I remember that day you know and like oh my [ __ ] it's pretty light like that day then that's when I water so that's how I decide on how I'm gonna water training there's all sorts of different ways to do it low stress trainings my go-to method but you can do a bunch of different ways by five by five as you can see I don't need to know trellis Nets I still have a great canopy everything's pretty even everything's only been talked to one time and they're so uh just do training and I train my plants in a funny way I like had him every single day I go in there and I just pet him trying to be rough with them been immune to the ways that I want them direction I want them to start growing and it's really beneficial for a lot of reasons you can get more tops that way as you can see I have crazy tops all over my tent but I've only topped those plants one time and it's just because of training you can also decide how a higher canopy is with that and the reason I don't really use nets and stuff because I can get really nice canopy without it and I can still move my fence around when I go to defoliate and everything I don't have that big a problem so you know definitely important to train the plants the way you want them it helps you also see things that might be going on I started really small plant pots and I worked my way up and every time I change my pots like when I go to transplant I give a good flush every single time get all that old nutrients out start with a nice new base I run sixty forty sixty percent Coco forty percent like Fox Farm soil and that's just for you know my personal preference and then so every time you also transplant throw something that make us him they're super good stuff can't stress it enough do your research on it I keep my lights in bed anywhere between 12 and 14 inches away side run cobs and LEDs so if you're running HPS you know you want to be definitely a lot further away so that's my go-to for my light setup you want to see like what stuff I have in my real room go check out my channel and I highlight everything I'm running in my 5 by 5 on one of those videos so we'll go into flour times now super-important again good airflow definitely you need good airflow I can't stress it enough through your whole canopy top and bottom and then I also start dropping my temps back when I'm in flower I like to drop them back you know just like outside so like just not quite as cool as outside but I usually like to go back my preferred range is 65 to 75 that's another huge thing is a tip make sure that try as closer you as hard as you can to keep your temperature within 10 degrees like so you don't want your temperature to much more than 10 degrees off from your high and your low so I usually like to do 65 to 75 ID foliate week 1 week 3 so right when I throw them in there I'll give them week D fully at once and that's just take all your big families and all that stuff off it's good for different like reasons like light penetration and get more light down to those smaller bud sides it also helps with the air flow back again so I'll do that week 1 week 3 there pretty much most strains are done stretching by that time almost done stretching by the time so I'll go through and the more you do fully there's a big reason why you do it it's innocent instead of the plant using all the energy for that to keep those leaves alive and keep growing new leaves those ones it takes all that energy that you take all those leaves off and it just puts all of the butts all that extra energy that would have been used to grow those leaves is now all gonna go to blood production which is what we're all looking for anyways right so that's my tips on that I didn't defoliate this time as good as I really wanted to as you can see but it's still getting the job done my lights in this setup I like to you run 14 to 16 inches away from the top of my canopy in those terms nutrients you don't want to over water your or over water or over feed the plants either because if you're starting to get like you know follow your feed schedule if you want to know what I use go ahead and reach out let me know I will tell you everybody runs different stuff so so follow your feed schedule but if you're noticing when you burn tips and stuff late kind of take it back and not flush your plants like so that's a good tip there and you don't know everything is different so do that flush your plants lay back on your nutrients a little bit if you're noticing burn tips and stuff because you don't want to get it build up in there and stop production pretty much no go I don't like my relative humidity going and you we're past 55 when I'm in flower just you start buying more risks of bud rot and all that stuff so really nice another important thing is that is your air flow I run my fan at nighttime to a little heater and humidifier in my room so do that and then flushing super important at the end especially if you're in soil and another tip about like in terms of like seeing burn tips and stuff like that is when you're in the soil and stuff like that here's a really good pro tip that a lot of people don't know starting out is when you're in soil like what you're noticing now happened days ago like a week ago it's not like hydro where it's like super noticeable right away and you can fix it right away so it's also gonna take that week to fix it and see corrections so don't go crazy and cause another problem trying to fix one problem but that's a good tip there flushing I usually start like three weeks before I know I'm gonna take them down I'm checking my trichomes and it's gonna help you through flavors and everything like that and your spoke quality I wanted to get my video done to show my cure tips and stuff but that'll come next weekend so if you're looking for that that's when that's going to be coming out I had to do this whole video on my phone because my Wi-Fi is out at home right now so I can't upload that video so that's why I'm doing this one today instead but yeah I hope this really helps somebody and when I'm flushing you know I'm starting three weeks before I'm flushing down to like 200 ppm is 100 ppm is because also if you ever test or notice like after you flush you'll be getting that reading but if you wait a couple days and try test your run off again you'll notice that your ppm rose again because your soils coming coming back to life so I like take a real low three weeks before 100 ppm is as close as I possibly can to my tap water and then I just give nothing but water after that Mike and I went doing that flush I use pH water after that I don't use anything so I hope that really really helps everybody have a wonderful wonderful day any more questions you know go ahead and reach out to me if you knew please subscribe I hope you enjoyed the video go check out my page I have all sorts of things you can find me on Instagram as well I'm pretty active there so I hope you all have a wonderful day I hope this helps somebody if it did give me a thumbs up make sure to share I hope you just all have wonderful day thank you", "NWy9IN0cWao": "although we're only what six weeks into 2021 we've seen plenty of volatility uh including stock markets and in particular areas of the market this is the the cannabis u.s cannabis stock market index came into 2021 around uh 550 level and you can see uh just in the last few days uh traded as high as above 1650 so trebled in less than what six weeks or so so given the mania that we're seeing uh around some of these cannabis stocks in february are there still opportunities out there or actually uh has the price been pumped up and we're going to see it just dump further from here in this video we'll take a look at a couple of cannabis stocks the index that we're looking at here that you can trade with us uh and also an etf that tracks uh some of the companies some of the bigger companies in this sector but i thought just to set the scene first of all yeah we'll take a look at the cannabis index we've only got we've got data going back here back to about may of last year and you can see fairly flat for much of it uh came into 2021 um really strong breaking out through the these old highs from the last six months of last year then it really has had a rocket put under it in february we've seen um fairly massive inflows into cannabis stocks just in the first week of february compared to where it was in january we saw the price pushed as high as what 1661 the 10th of february and it's lost um what not far off 60 in a couple of days massively volatile market very difficult to trade but are there still opportunities out there so i'll talk now about some of these different companies and the etf and we'll come back and look at things in a bit more detail hello i'm david jones from capital.com and um i thought we'd do something different uh this time around i thought we would uh dip our toes into listed marijuana stocks and because we've seen a lot of volatility as you saw there uh from the index uh in recent weeks so let's take a look at this in a bit more detail see where the opportunities might be so we'll have a look at a couple of stocks and also an etf an exchange traded fund designed to um track the performance of the industry as a whole so as usual in this video i'll talk a bit about the markets we're going to look at then we'll jump back onto the platform look at things in more detail and see where the opportunities are if you're watching this and you haven't subscribed if you could click on subscribe it does help support the channel it means we can continue pushing out hopefully lots of interesting videos uh throughout the week right um let's get into things let's take a look at the first of these stocks let me just talk about the backdrop first of all so in the us the legalized marijuana industry in 2019 was worth around 13 billion dollars but it's forecast to reach a value of about 30 billion dollars by 2025. of course it used to be illegal but as of the end of 2020 um marijuana was legal in 35 states in the u.s for medical use and legal in 15 of those states for recreational use and one of the reasons why people expect the industry to grow further is the the change in government uh in the us with the democrats in power many people are expecting perhaps a more liberal approach even more liberal going forward and seeing further legalization across the u.s but it's a bit of an odd setup when it comes to the individual stocks for example canadian cannabis companies are allowed to list on u.s exchanges because it is legal uh in canada but because at a federal level so at a national level it's still illegal in the u.s u.s companies can't list usually on u.s exchanges so we see lots of u.s companies listing on canadian exchanges so there's quite a bit of back and forth going on here we've seen plenty of volatility uh over recent weeks again that the finger is being pointed at reddit and uh the sub forum uh wall street bets of course we had all that excitement with gamestop stocks uh gamestop stock uh back in in january and into february and uh at the moment uh it does appear that it's attracting a lot of interest amongst the community there and we've seen a sharp run up and as usual as we're getting used to now quite a sharp fall-off in some of these uh these legalized uh cannabis stocks and you can see this just from the figures according to vanda research in the first week of february uh retail investors put something like 400 million dollars uh into into cannabis stocks um which was more than double the amount invested throughout uh all of january so it did attract some hot retail money and we saw the price run up and since then we've seen some of these stocks come back down quite heavily but not to where they were before uh the main year really started anyway let's take a look at the first of these companies and see if there's an opportunity so the first of these is a name familiar uh perhaps to many people who look at the sector and it's tilray it's a global leader in cannabis research cultivation production and distribution we're not going to have to wait too long to find out how it's been doing recently its next results are due out on the 17th of february so the time recording that's tomorrow it's the fourth quarter results uh and also of course the results for the for the previous year as a whole so they will make an interesting read last time around we had a 2.3 million dollar loss it would be interesting to see how they've reduced that if they have have they turned it round into a profit plenty of volatility for the stock in recent weeks just last week it had increased more than threefold for february so again we've seen a massive move although the stock has dropped back by about fifty percent from that recent height so let's put some color on with this let's jump on the chart take a look at tilray in a bit more detail so here's tillery and if we if we go back to to march last year we saw tilray uh dropped to about two and a half dollars and i think looking at this sort of period it does put the volatility this year in perspective came into this year trading around eight dollars and then last week touched 66 uh dollars a share before crashing back down i think it's really hard to trade markets when they're moving like this because it's difficult to practice sensible risk management all of that sort of stuff but let's take a look on the hourly charts and see if there are still short-term opportunities let's flip it over to an hourly for 2021 so far i mean we do have a trend line in place that's been there uh for much of this year and it did did a good job right into february uh and then of course the market or the share price um really took off uh from then so i suppose if you were wanted to buy into the trend for this year we're edging back to those sort of levels now so i think one one potential idea on till rate um is to be a buyer is to perhaps watch it in the days ahead at the time we're recording it was still pretty weak at the end of last week ending up around what 29 you can see it fairly clearly there on the chart we do have this old support coming in it's not that old it's only from the 4th of february coming in just below 24. so i think for till right this 20 to 24 area is going to be an interesting one as we have seen perhaps some of the mania died down i'll be watching it over the next few days do we see some stability coming in in this 2024 area i think if we did get a bit of strength uh after some of the madder moves in february there's an argument to to be a buyer in line with this trend so um so whilst you may feel you've missed a lot of the excitement and that is true i think perhaps we'd have to wait some time for it to go back up to those those highs from earlier in february i still think looking at the trend this year there could still be an opportunity until right uh in the days ahead the next one we're going to look at is uh canopy growth they are the first or they were the first uh company first cannabis company in north america to be publicly listed back in 2014 and to sum up what they do i can't do any better than reuters who describe them as the world's largest pot producing company they've got a variety of different products whether it's supplying the plant itself or drinks edibles and vapes as well we've recently had results from this one they expect to be profitable they're not yet but they say the second half of 2022 is when the company will start turning a profit let's take a look at things in a bit more detail so here's our chart of canopy growth i've gone back a bit longer on this um back to the second half of 2018 we can see the shares peaked back then up around the 72 70 72 mark up there had another go once again in in april may 2019 and it's quite interesting that again that's where we've seen it run out of steam in the latest search but perhaps what we want to pick up on here is this recovery that started uh from october uh 2020. let's let's just zoom in on that so here's here's the move really or the trend i should say from october uh 2020. i put an rsi on here 10-day rsi um when we when we see i think mad moves like this like i say for some of the other markets we cover i think the rsi has as perhaps questionable use you know when the market was moving strongly higher uh late jan into feb the rsi was overbought so if you're following that you might have got out a little bit uh a little bit too early but but saying all that again i think as with tilray we've got a good trend here in canopy growth yeah that trend line is coming in uh around what's 37 36 37 a share we've got good support i think from back here uh jan lowe's uh jan the eighth lows around 37 at the time of recording it had closed the previous day uh or the end of last week at 51.20 uh still looks a bit weak so perhaps there is scope for a bit more of a sell-off but again i think like as with tilray we have had this burst of volatility if we see a bit more weakness from here we're returning back to a more short to medium term trend so again i think for me it's one i'd be interested in continuing to watch this week see if we see some stability come in and then think about being a buyer you know possible places for stops depending on when we see this weakness end the lows the jan 19 lows around 41 dollars after that like i say these lows around 37 january 8 and the trend line currently coming in around 37 as well so i think if we saw it perhaps under a bit more pressure to the low 40s um it looks interesting again but that trend from october is still up just a question of how far this correction is going to go from here but down in there sort of mid to low 40s it certainly looks interesting of course if you don't want to invest in individual companies exchange traded funds etfs have always been and continues to be a really popular way of gaining exposure to an area of the market the etfmg alternative harvest etf not the snappiest of names it's an etf that tracks the global cannabis industry top holdings at the end of 2020 by the etf include till rate and canopy growth and also gw pharma and aurora cannabis not surprisingly given the interest and uh the moves in these stocks this year it's having a great 2021. so far it's up about 70 for the year to date there's been plenty of volatility again on the top of that so um let's take a look at the etf and see if there's an opportunity here here's the etfmg alternative harvest etf and you can see how it has clearly you know carved out the fortunes the ups and downs of the cannabis industry over recent years traded as high as 45 in 2018 september 2018. uh then um a couple of years later september 2020 it was as low as as ten dollars again we have seen this recovery since then so let's zoom in on what's been going on since october november as with all these other stocks that we've looked at uh today we had this this burst of volatility this surge higher in february a bit of a reality perhaps coming back in since then but once again we've got a good trend uh in this etf for off the late october lows good support at the moment coming in on the trend line around 17 good support from late jan around 18 25. so once again if we did drift a bit lower perhaps closer towards 20 and we saw some strength come in i think there's another opportunity there so it's the same theme for all of these different markets this burst of volatility in late late january early february um returning more back to normality but it hasn't changed the overall recent trend over the last three months so i still think there are opportunities out there that's it for this update on some of the cannabis stocks uh and an etfs plenty of volatility in this area but for now from me david jones and capital.com we'll leave things there good luck with your trading for more trading videos just like this please subscribe to our channel", "bwbZTN4fMGM": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a wonderful day [Music] you", "QfcCSh7-Y44": "[Music]", "DoRyjd2zKwY": "what's good bass draw militia bass draw keys here i'm your friendly neighborhood negro and welcome to another episode of good eats in today's video guys we got a highly requested video for you today we're going to do our own homemade nerd ropes and you know that they're goodies for 20 style so without any further ado let's go ahead and get into it let's do [Music] way all right guys and real quickly here i do want to invite everybody please check out our membership program that we just started here on the channel it really

and get into this video here we go all right guys so let's go ahead and get into today's video today we're going to be doing our own homemade nerve ropes this video has been highly requested for quite some time so we're going to go ahead and make it happen today now there is an easy way to do it and there's a hard way to do it of course i'm going to show you the easy way to do it today if you guys want the like the harder way maybe we can do that at a later time but today i'm going to show you the easiest way to make your homemade nerd ropes so the first thing that we got to do is i'm going to show you what we need we're going to be using some is it haribo i don't know is it haribo hariba let's go haribo we're going to use haribo um gold bears this is what i was saying about the easy way and the hard way these are ways just to take these bears right here we're going to melt them down in the microwave that's the easiest way the hard way would be the harder way i was ashamed to be to go ahead and make our own gelatin just like you would do when we're making our gummy bears you can go and make your gelatin that way as well and do it but we're going to go ahead and just melt these down and do it the easy way and of course with nerd ropes you're going to need some nerds so i went to the store and i got some nerds so as you can see right here i have a baking sheet on the baking sheet i have some parchment paper what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take some aluminum foil and what we're gonna do is we're gonna actually make kind of like you can call it like a mold and that way we able to we'll be able to distribute our nerds and make our our nerd ropes the way that we want to make them all right but first what we got to do is we have to take some aluminum foil and we're actually going to make our mold you can say so that way we'll be able to distribute our nerds evenly let me show you what i mean you're going to take some aluminum foil we're going to make kind of like an accordion shape let me show you all right so you can see we have a piece of aluminum foil and we're going to do an accordion shape what i mean by that is you're going to hold it like this you're going to fold it like this and then we're going to [Music] hold it back like this we'll do that back and forth all right so you see we folded it back and forth now we just want to open it all right so that way you can you guys can see what i've done i've just made you can basically say like a w or m whatever that way we have places where we can actually put our nerds right we can put our nerds in here are you guys getting a good picture this way i don't think so let me raise up the camera and get a better angle for you guys but i don't think you're getting a good a good angle let me raise you guys up some there we go i think i made this a little bit too long i do believe i can fix that though there we go so i made him too long but i fixed that just by tearing off so now you can guys can see better what i'm talking about so what i'm proposing to do is [Music] now you see we have peaks and valleys in the valleys we're going to actually form our nerd ropes you see what i'm saying so what we're going to do is we're going to pour our nerve ropes in here right for the bottom layer and then what we're going to do is we're going to put these bears inside of this measuring cup and melt them down in the microwave at that point that's where we're going to medicate it now as far as how to medicate this you can use tincture you can use coconut oil it's up to you we're going to use some coconut oil today but if you got some tincture use that and as far as how much you want to use it's really based upon how strong do you want it i'm going to use two or three tablespoons of coconut oil for this but it's really up to you about how much do you want to medicate it if you're talking about how much thc you're putting in it that you know it just depends on how strong did you make your oil how strong did you make your tincture and then from that you can go ahead and you know put it in accordingly so let's go ahead and do the first part of this which is putting the nerds in here i'm gonna take a box open them i'm gonna start putting them in here i got seven boxes so hopefully that's enough [Music] if it's not oh no [Music] oh nerds all right [Music] and i said i'm going to try something on this last one what i want to do is i really want to take some spray and like spray it in here [Music] because as you can see i did these without any spray right here and so i'm wondering how how they're gonna be as far as sticking to the aluminum foil in the past when i've used things with aluminum foil and it's sticking it's been really hard to come off i'm just really trying to make sure they got an even coat so let me do that coconut oil cooking spray and i'm just going to [Music] and that's going to be our test to see if we should have sprayed it i just thought about it right now all right so look take some more of these nerds put them in here all right so we're pretty good on that i have four rows ready to do four ropes i bought a lot of nerds so i can now always do more batches so now what we got to do is we're going to take our bears right here we're going to put them in this measuring cup pyrex measuring cup put it in the microwave we're going to melt them down and then that's when we're going to take and our fused oil and medicate this up obviously if you don't want to medicate it just don't use the oil don't use any tincture if you want to make fantastic nerd ropes just like this that'll be just fine so yeah here we go all right so there's two cups in this bag we're going to use one cup right now like i said i'm doing this in batches so that way everything will work out the way we want it to so i'm going to take a cup of these gummy bears there's two cups in the bag we're going to take half of this and let's go ahead and put this in the microwave and melt this down and i'll show you what it looks like when it's finished this is two and a half minutes in the microwave and so you can see it's melted down now look at that so we're gonna do now that just melts it down we're going to take our coconut oil you can use tincture if you have tincture and like i said depends on how strong you want it i'm gonna do two tablespoons you know what i really you know what three tablespoons why not three tablespoons in there we're going to stir it up make sure you stir it up nice we're going to put this back in the microwave so we can warm this back up and keep it liquid once that happens and we take it out i'm going to put it in this squeeze bottle to make it easier to do the lines for the nerd ropes there's a lot of ways that you can do i've seen people pouring it cutting bags and that kind of stuff i think the easiest way to do is going to be with a one dollar squeeze bottle that you can get from the dollar store if you need a link for this i will put it in the description for you but yeah back in the microwave we go all right guys so we're out of the microwave now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take this and i'll pour it inside of here to make it easier [Music] so now we got this in here let's go ahead and do some lines that doesn't sound right let's put some lines in here so we can go ahead and medicate this go slow all right guys that's pretty hot so i'm going to use my magical butter glove in order to do it [Music] there we go very nice [Music] and this is going to be the easiest way for you to do it so you can control what you're doing what i like to do is just go down one time up one time and that'll be good enough [Music] it's like the easiest way to control what you're doing you can put exact strings in there perfect look at that look at that beautiful that's the way to do it without any of the waste and what's so great about it is in this squeeze bottle if it goes down in temperature all you got to do is warm it up a little bit and you can continue to do what you're doing all right guys so now that we got that done before this dries up let's go ahead and put some nerves back on the top of this [Music] all right guys so now you can see that we have everything covered there we go so now we have our [Music] gumby mixture in between the nerds and now all we got to do is just let them sit all right guys so what i'm going to do is i'm going to put these in the refrigerator for 30 minutes and then i'm going to take them out and take them off the take them out of the mold here and show you what they look like so yeah give me 30 minutes we're going to put them in the refrigerator and we'll be back in 30 minutes all right guys so it's been 30 minutes inside the refrigerator all right so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to attempt to peel these off see if they're set [Music] look at that it doesn't matter about if all the uh excess nerds fall on the tray that's why we put the parchment paper down look at that yeah i told you guys this is the easiest way to do it nero nero all right so these have been coming off pretty easy here doing it the way that i did it these are the ones by the way these are the ones that we didn't put the the spray down this one right here is the one that we did this right here is with no spray nerd rope nerd bro all right now this one is the one with the uh with the sprite and they came look the one with the spray came right off so i would say guys you might want to use this break because the one with the spray came right off look at that [Music] alright guys so

there's big news out of the senate thank you so much for joining me my name is tom howard and this is another very special episode of once again my name is tom howard thank you so much for joining us on canvas legalization news we have some big news out of the senate there's a whole bunch of senators that are tweeting regarding their uh desires to legalize cannabis in 2021 is isn't gonna happen i'm not sure but that's what we're gonna be talking about today so give us a thumbs up and a like subscribe whatever if you enjoy canvas legalization news tune in tomorrow we'll give an update on west virginia because somebody asked for that so let's go ahead and dive into it we posted it on our linkedin page if you haven't gone over to our linkedin page you should uh you can it's canvas legalization news on linkedin we only have 670 odd people that like it and then you can click over to the the story that we have on marijuana moment big shout out to marijuana moment came out yesterday and so there are all these leading champions in the senate that say that they are going to advance cannabis legalization for example ron wyden tweeted we can't address our country's racial inequality crisis without ending the outdated dangerous war on drugs and its disproportionate impact on black and brown americans and then he starts tweeting at people ooh exciting at senator schumer and at senator booker and i are going to introduce legislation to do just that that's fantastic so uh do you think that there's actually going to be some type of vote anytime soon on the moore act well probably not because the more active 2019 is no more the more act of 2021 has perhaps already been introduced into the senate or into the house and then they are going to vote on it i perceive this to be a political issue in the sense that the last time it was voted on in the house of representatives not only did it pass but it passed essentially against party lines approximately 95 percent of the democrats voted in favor and approximately 95 of the republicans voted uh opposed if you want more than that uh go dig into our videos and you'll be able to see when miggy and i were live watching and counting the votes uh of the moore act when it was voted on in the house of congress so now that the senate is going to get involved do you really think that it's going to move quickly no i don't but senator schumer then goes ahead and tweets out the war on drugs has been a war on people in particular people of color ending the federal marijuana prohibition is necessary to right the wrongs of this failed war i want you to know the ironic thing is that he is the senator from new york which has no legal weed uh and then senator booker new jersey finally got legal weed kind of not still they voted on it but i don't think they've passed the bill yet they're getting closer i really thought that i would spit out my gum before i was able to get live on here just a small just a small moment you know i have not gotten a chance to smoke weed at all today i have just been slammed with these uh 10-day notices they're really starting to shape up nicely we have the transporter ones basically if you got your social equity points you did get your transporter application license uh there might have been some errors in your illinois residency points and or uh the not the types of proof that you put to the state i was not thrilled that the state used to say tax records which presumably could have meant real estate tax records that indicated that you know you own the real estate in the particular area and that perhaps you also live there as it's listed as your address but no they said only income tax records and only pages one and two of illinois form 1040. and so i've just been going gangbusters uh what do we think is actually going to happen here is senator booker he fight he tweets out the failed war on drugs has been a war on people particularly the people of color sounds a lot like senator schumer's tweet and that he's looking forward to joining ron wyden and senator schumer to announce reforms that will ensure restorative justice and protect public health that is fantastic now what's the likelihood that it's actually going to happen right now not very good you want to know why because there's budgets and there's coronavirus relief that's getting negotiated right now in the senate oh i think they were also going to impeach that one guy that used to be president when they already impeached him but i think he has to go to trial really really quickly just a second i know i'm not supposed to do this on camera so i'm gonna give myself a small bumper uh why don't we check the stocks i guess they're still doing fine okay well suddenly i feel a lot more refreshed but uh the senate will actually be moving on this in some way shape or form the senate will probably move on it after the house in my opinion simply because that the senate goes a lot slower and then i think they're going to try to politicize this i think they're going to try to politicize this because it was effective in georgia and they're going to be using it for the 2020 election for example going into the 2020 election what if the house does what the house did before and that passes the more act or the whatever version of the moore act will be introduced by uh senator booker senator wyden and senator schumer well after that happens uh if it's passed in the house and go over to the senate now if if just one democrat doesn't vote it for it or if yeah imagine if one democrat votes against it and one republican votes for it still passes right we have um president vice president kamala harris that could cast the deciding vote probably not i don't think it's going to be that close mostly because it's not a plurality even or a majority of the states that have legal cannabis legal adult use cannabis it's fantastic your state should try it sometime but uh it's only like 15 states right now and so that's just not a majority of the population however if they use it and they try and it's stymied let's say by republicans and the republicans vote 97 against the moore act leading into an election year of 2022 i think the democrats are going to try to politicize it so that they don't lose additional seats and perhaps make up some ground that way um i just think that the 50 50 senate especially with the political capital that joe biden and his administration wants to use right now principally on the coronavirus reform means that uh criminal justice reform while coming and and that's exactly what the the cannabis legalization bill is going to be it's it's a criminal justice reform bill more than it's about legalizing weed uh and so will that happen sure uh when yeah but i'll tell you one thing when it does happen you know what it's going to be somewhere [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's right it's going to be 420 somewhere and then earl blumenhauer even got into it and he said very exciting that our champions in the senate senator schumer senator booker and ron wyden are prepared to move forward together on comprehensive cannabis legislation the more act a product of years have worked with advocates cannabis industry leaders and states is a great foundation and so the more acts is a great reform to reform the 117th congress it looks like maybe senator wyden i'm sorry senator wyden uh earl blumenhauer republican representative blumenhower has maybe already introduced the more act to the 117th congress it's already been january so that makes a pretty darn good a sense and now let's read the full joint statement as opposed to just the tweets if you're here for the tweets give us a thumbs up washington united states senator cory booker ron wyden a democrat of oregon and chuck schumer democrat of new york issued the following joint statement regarding comprehensive cannabis reform legislations in the 117th congress the war on drugs has been a war on people particularly people of color ending the federal marijuana prohibition is necessary to right the wrongs of this failed war and end the decades of harms inflicted by the communities of color across the country but that alone is not enough as states continue to legalize marijuana we must also enact measures that will lift people up who are unfairly targeted by the war on drugs we are committed to working together to put forward and advance comprehensive cannabis reform isn't it interesting that now they refer to it as cannabis but in the previous paragraph they were referred to it as marijuana cannabis reformed legislation that will not only turn the page on the sad chapter in american history but also undo the devastating consequences of these discriminatory policies the senate will make consideration of these reforms a priority in the early part of this year we will release a unified discussion draft on comprehensive reform to ensure restorative justice protect public health and implement responsible taxes and regulations getting input from stakeholder groups will be an important part of developing this critical legislation so there you go that's the full statement that the senate puts out and it appears that yes they are starting to tee this up as making it a very political issue and it's not just about the cannabis unfortunately it's not it's not really unfortunately it's the right thing to do to right these wrongs and to create a larger coalition but i just want to make sure that the patients have access to home growth so here it is what are they going to release in the early part of this year they're going to release a unified discussion draft that's why i don't think there's going to be an eminent vote on the more act because the the senate's not ready for a vote on the moore act they're ready for a unified discussion draft on what comprehensive reform to restore restorative justice promote public health and implement responsible taxes and regulations getting input from stakeholders groups will be an important part of developing this critical legislation did you notice they did not mention the word cannabis or marijuana at all in that now i thought it was also interesting that the official sten statement said both of those things but if you haven't read the more act and you should uh you know subscribe to the channel we'll probably read it one day on the on the news probably already have but one of the aspects of the moore act is it changes the federal term from marijuana essentially kills the term marijuana at the federal level because it's just it's just one line in the controlled substances acts you know in in schedule one so it would delete that and then it would create this new thing called cannabis and so maybe that's what they were doing in that because in one paragraph they refer to it as marijuana but then in the next paragraph they refer to it as cannabis and the more act calls it cannabis but it appears that that might still take months let me think let me just think a little bit about how many months that might take [Applause] [Music] yeah man that's it's a lot of months well okay so they aren't ready for a vote but they are ready for a unified discussion draft and then they want to get input from stakeholder groups and so essentially it appears that the senate after the house has already passed the moore act in the last house they have to pass it again in this one uh the senate now is trying to like gauge the room so they're going to do some talking points to get some input from the stakeholders so tune in in the future episodes in the spring when we go over this particular policy statement the unified discussion draft of it and then there'll probably be some calls to action on the channel about where you can go as a stakeholder to voice your support or opposition to this developing critical legislation and if you think that cannabis legalization is critical pardon me is critical legislation give us a thumbs up click subscribe and then also click the bell some people do oh and by the way we got 15 000 subscribers awesome so why don't you join us tomorrow for the news i have taken i've taken my break that was about 12 hours two minutes and um yeah wouldn't you when you just hate to have a lawyer that writes down minutes as hours sounds like something rudy giuliani would do 20 grand a day he was charging donald trump who didn't pay him hilarious uh the last administration was funny but now we have to do other real things like legalize weed and we're going to be talking all about that tomorrow who is our guest join us tomorrow to find out our guest", "xPHfRtfZnyI": "- Hello, my name is Volkar. I have been involved in\nthe cannabis industries since about 2007. There has always been\nabout smoking the stuff and getting high. However there's a whole\ndifferent side to cannabis and that's the medicinal side. I never really believed in it until when my mum started to take CBD oil. She has arthritis-like symptoms. Let's talk to mum herself. Please welcome my mum. Hey mum, thank you for being here with us. We wanted to ask you a few\nquestions about your CBD oil. - Hello, yes, we can do that. - Okay, why are you using it? - Because day in and day\nout I was in terrible pain and couldn't get relief from pain pills. The pain was always there. And of course, that burdened me a lot. - What kind of pain was it? - It's a pain in the joints. The whole body was stiff. My ability to move became worse and worse and I was getting desperate. - And in the past you used\npainkillers I believe? - Yes I used painkillers, one in the morning and one in the evening. And I've been using a\nrheumatism medication. - And then you started using\nCBD oil and what happened then? - I take one drop in the morning\nand it lasts the whole day, and I'm much more flexible. Everything is much easier,\nmuch more pleasant. And in the evening I take two drops, which makes the night\ncalm and I can sleep well. - Okay and we also wanna\nsay that you work in H Care and you work a lot with doctors and pharmaceutical medicines. You know a little bit\nabout this stuff, right? - Yes I think I know my way around. I just sat over everything\nand took the drops. I have now reported to the doctors that I'm taking these drops, and the reaction is zero. I have a feeling that the\ndoctors think that this is great, but they are not willing to prescribe it. So I got this privately. - And does it make you high? Or is it addictive? - No, not at all. This oil just makes my pain\ngo away, and nothing more. I have been taking this one\ndrop for weeks and months now, and I have not had to increase the dose. - Can you show us the\noil that you're using? - I think you can't go\nwrong with one drop anyway. - And were you able to\nstop using the painkillers? - Yes I have stopped\ntaking the painkillers and I'm using much less\nrheumatoid medication. - Okay, thank you very much and I'm gonna put this in our video and I hope this will help other people who have similar symptoms like you. - Yeah, maybe this can\nencourage other people to get in there and take CBD oil too. - Thank you very much. (foreign language) - Now there is a problem with CBD oil because at the moment\nthere is kind of a hype. There are thousands and thousands\nof products on the market, many of them are really bad. For example it happened to\nus that we bought CBD oil, the taste was horrible and\nthere was virtually no effect. The best way to buy CBD oil depends on the country you live in. In the USA, you now have service providers who test CBD products for effectiveness. This website here, they test products for\nCBD content and quality. The advantage is that you\ncan be sure that the value that is given on these bottles are true. I am going to show you two\nproducts that I recommend. This stuff is what I\nknow worked for my mom. So it is safe for arthritis problems. I would also try this stuff here. This is a full spectrum oil, that means it has not only CBD, but it also has these terpenes in there. So if you wanna imagine an\norchestra that plays music. If you wanna have a nice song, you will need many different instruments. I think this is the new way to go. In the future, all oils will\nbe full spectrum like this. There are different concentrations of oil and you wanna start with\na low concentration. You can see here, 125mg, 250, 500, 1000. There is such thing as tolerance, and if you start off\nwith just the highest, most concentrated oil, then you have no room to go upwards. You wanna start with a low dose first. So for example, the 250mg. If at some point you get tolerant to it, you can use it a bit more often and you can also use a higher concentrate. If you live in Europe, things\nare a little bit different. I have experience buying\nCBD oil over there, and I'm going to recommend you the product that we have\nbought and that we know works. It's called Candropharm100, from this website called cbdoilkaufen.de. The link is under this video. So there you go. If you haven't tried CBD oil yet, give it a go, because it may help with\npainful conditions you have. The link for products\nare under this video. Thanks for watching and\nI hope to see you soon.", "lT0k_xhqXkc": "next question is from ants dope life can smoking weed impact gains sure yeah let's do a fly fish yeah definitely can't you know um i i talked to a cannabinoid scientist recently had a great conversation with her and we went down a whole bunch of different paths with cannabinoids these are the the compounds that are found in marijuana plants and hemp plants there are some potential health benefits um that you can get from cannabinoids if they improve your health then they'll might help you with your gains but i i can't you know i'm trying to think of all the people i know that smoke weed how many of them have improved their health from smoking weed i can think of one person out of i don't know 30 40 people i know who smoke weed most people smoke weed like to get high and that kind of use is yeah it's going to take away from your gains cannabinoids high dose especially thc probably negatively affect your anabolic hormones they predictably lower testosterone levels or anabolic hormone levels i should say in animals they can do that in humans too especially at high doses it can definitely if it's used chronically um it can definitely reduce motivation which that's not a drive goes down yeah that's not a great thing for for working out um they can balance out inflammation if used at low doses but just you know two or three hits from a joint is way higher than low doses and at that point you may be in influencing uh inflammation in a negative way in terms of gains so i i don't think it's it's not something i'd say go do this to improve i've heard long distance runners though like they do well uh with under the influence yeah yeah just during the yeah yeah because you ever died have you ever done a long run no i haven't i've done it i love mobility yeah uh yeah under the influence no it's hot because it you trail off dude you trail off in your thoughts and i mean it's like when you know when you hit that like when you're running right it takes about 10 15 minutes or so yeah then you hit that runner's high and then if on top of that if you got a cannabis high on on top of that like you just kind of drift off into your own thoughts you know what they very therapeutic and you know what they they attribute the runner's height to um natural cannabinoids that your body releases yeah so it makes sense right anandamide i think that was called 2ag if i'm not mistaken and here's something you can do okay if you want to utilize cannabinoids for potential benefits use uh hemp oils full spectrum stay away from too much thc too much thc's got some negative effects on the brain use things like cbd and some of the other cannabinoids that are non-psychoactive what those things tend to do is they tend to increase your body's own production of its natural cannabinoids this is not a bad thing so if you're going to if you're going to notice any benefits from using cannabinoids then you go in that direction not buying the weed at the dispensary that's you know 20 thc or smoking a joint with your buddy that's probably going to be detrimental so that's why you know for me nowadays i stick to things like ned which is the full hemp oil extract you know full spectrum and that i don't notice the negatives if i were to have like weed from the dispensary you know i i get that you can have fun with it a lot of stuff but it's negatives is what i know yeah you have to be real careful i mean this is a conversation i have with my younger brother a lot right like i i was lucky that i didn't really even find cannabis i mean i had a bad experience with cannabis twice in my early 20s and it wasn't even until i was like 30 that i really like smoke weed and like the way i look at right now so i like weed the same way like a desperate housewife likes wine and i look at it the same way they're like you got to watch that you got to be careful of of that like if am i smoking uh every single night am i is it gonna turn into a cougar you might do am i dependent on this am i having the whole bottle type of deal like and because there's so much positive messaging around right now with marijuana and the health benefits of cbd and yada yada yada at the end of the day it could turn into a an addiction and an issue like anything else so if it's getting in the way of you learning more and growing and spending time on your business or working better at your craft or being a good husband or being a good father or being a good son if it's if it's starting to bleed into those things and you have to be you only you know that you have to be self aware of that to make that decision and most certainly can bleed into getting into way of your gains if you know getting high ends up happening and you don't go to the gym because of that like that's it's an obvious issue but if there's ways that you can find it to complement your life and have balance i think there's nothing wrong with it just like i don't think there's anything wrong with someone having the occasional glass of wine to enjoy that with their dinner but very easily you can turn into somebody who has two or three glasses of wine every single night and then at that point when you start asking yourself okay is this more of an addiction and something that i rely on more than something's actually helping me or complementing or enhancing who i am yeah and when they do studies on on cannabis and performance it clearly reduces power output and explosive uh performance so for lifting weights probably not a good idea the best idea i've done it before lifting weights terrible it's not a great idea yeah it just doesn't for me it definitely doesn't improve performance um but maybe for long actually more interested in it though maybe maybe for long lower intensity kind of long duration stamina based movements maybe the pain killing effects the fact that you're in this other state of mind might help with that kind of stuff but for lifting weights and for explosive power uh definitely not a good idea it doesn't make me stronger for sure i can't lift as heavy you know but i might be in the gym longer and i might you know focus more on squeezing and pumping the muscle or i might just lose my my focus and start looking at articles yeah or whatever walks by yeah", "-oXHvVukf6c": "just this week florida legalized edible medical marijuana and it's a game changer for the multi-million dollar industry but tonight abc 7 is getting you more our rachel anderson looked into if this could be the new cash crop florida so desperately needs right now medical marijuana doctors expect little gummies like this to spark huge demand for the industry but in order for the state of florida to benefit something else needs to be legalized i'm expecting a lot of people to call me up and say hey doc can i have edibles the medical marijuana industry is celebrating this week i think people have been asking for it for a long time they've been waiting for it for a long time edible marijuana officially legalized in the state of florida advocates say it's a big move in the medical cannabis industry it's going to increase sales because now you've opened an entire avenue as of this week nearly 400 thousand people in florida have their medical marijuana card but the state itself won't profit much marijuana is considered a medicine and therefore it's not taxed senator jeff brandis says the kovit 19 pandemic put the state of florida in a four to five billion dollar deficit he says weed could help pull us out but it won't be medicinal gummies that do it the only way to really provide for revenue with cannabis is to allow adult use adult recreational use is something brandes has been fighting for but it could be years away i don't think you're going to see recreational in the short term until then the state will have to turn to other options and recovering from the blow it took from kovid 19. well i think it's going to be a multi-year we're in in process myers rachel anderson abc 7. in terms of recreational marijuana being legalized brandes hopes to see that on the 2022

can't even believe that you can't grow this like doesn't do anything to your consciousness zero it doesn't affect you at all because it's related to pot it's illegal the National hemp museum is in versailles kentucky isn't really where I graduated high school do because it's Woodford County Kentucky was at one point the largest him producing Counting the entire nation whoa it just I don't know something about the limestone is total conditions the humidity sunlight now shot in him it was really really well Wow the first legal 508 or acre hemp farm in Kentucky unveiled so now it's legal in October oh wow so now they can grow it excellent beautiful I don't live there anymore so I'm out of touch but hey that's great news that's fantastic news that's amazing well we're just talking about something that I was gonna bring up oh [ __ ] I can't remember something about something about new mr. Nelson something new stuff that had to do with with legalization marijuana in Kentucky we were just talking yeah yeah it's just it's just pretty crazy that you'd have a hemp museum and have it be illegal for so long with no argument there's like there's no science it doesn't pollute anything it doesn't do anything the environment the nation makes amazingly built on it yeah everything was made out of that [ __ ] do you ever see the first Henry Ford Model T where he made the fenders out of hemp and he's hitting it with a hammer not know though dude you had to watch this we'll play this for you it's the craziest [ __ ] ever Henry Ford's very first car that he made he made the fenders out of hemp and you're watching him hit this [ __ ] fender with a hammer and a hammer is just bouncing off the fender check this out and this is crazy I mean I don't know when was this what did it say Jamie was the time it said their 1941 1941 so in 1941 before it was illegal so it was made and it was made illegal right around the time where alcohol prohibition had ended and they needed something to go after so then they started using the same guys to go after weed and this was pre that look at this he's hitting this [ __ ] thing with a the back of an axe it's just bouncing off it was also a great way to discriminate against Mexican immigrants it was and black people to the whole name marijuana came from a Mexican slang for a wild tobacco didn't have anything to do with marijuana they just created this thing like when they made it illegal the the people that were they didn't even understand they're making hemp illegal they had all that explain it to everybody then they were they had like tax stamps that you had to but about DuPont understood that all the Institute's to the [ __ ] out of it so did William Randolph Hearst that guy was the craziest the guy whose Citizen Kane was based on rules that guy was the craziest so here is this guy's hitting this hemp fender with a [ __ ] hammer Henry Rollins testing it Henry Rollins goddamn it look you barely smudged the thing I mean they're so superior to metal and it's easy it's a renewable resource like we're we've [ __ ] this up so bad it's so obvious it's one of the biggest example said why are you drone on about pot all the time it's because these things like that are one of the biggest examples of just how egregious making it illegal is it is a it's one of the most amazing plants we've ever discovered you can make your house out of it you can [ __ ] eat at you can get high with it you can make your clothes with it it has all the amino acids you could use for heating oil you could what to treat cancer patients treat cancer patients with this here first I mean somebody put it here come on come on come on right it helps reduce tumor size it's crazy helps a host of different diseases I know a lot of people that have like serious inflammation problems they smoke some weed and they're alright just lightens everything up and it's illegal and you can grow it you grow your own you can grow a [ __ ] ton of it in your backyard anybody could do you have a sprinkler okay you got some good dirt alright you got some weed that weeds just good to go that's a [ __ ] hardy ass plant yeah my grandmother she just had some some health stuff and it's like you know how do I you know she's pretty old-school like well knowing there's this thing out there that that isn't anything that these doctors are gonna offer it's just gonna make her feel awful yeah and and you know ever have to go through all of that somebody just give you comfort and it ease nausea or make you want to eat food or those kind of things like why wouldn't you want someone you love and care about to have that but then at the same time you know you want to be the person trying to feed pot to your grandmother yeah it's a hard sell it's a hard sell yeah it's just stunning how well propaganda from 1933 carried all the way the [ __ ] to 2018 it's stunning is it I mean but it's almost a hundred years yeah with what we like the amount of information that you can get on a subject now like say if you're the bet the medical benefits of cannabis just google that and you'll just start reading all the [ __ ] like if it seems to me that enough people would go wait what are we doing like why is it illegal nobody's died from it like no one more people die of aspirin every year because zero die from pot so it's really the number zero it doesn't mean that people are going to get high and walking at traffic some some are gonna but I think part of that is because we're not too teaching people how to get high properly someone gets high for them but it's time you let a poner how many of those people that are getting hit by cars are actually looking at their phones it could be a lot they were high and looking at the phones you don't see that here like you're doing in Nashville I drove around and that's like if I can't hate that and you look every time was driving on a town everybody's texting everybody's looking down you can always spot on the interstate yeah we've been home but you don't see that in California guys you guys have like really heavy loss saw today yeah so today some lady had drifted completely in my lane and I looked over at her and I saw the back of her head like I was I was on the driver side I was on that side looking over at her and all I saw was the back of it she literally wasn't looking at my car and she was just looking her phone and working her thumb and occasionally like looking up at the screen or looking up at the wind chills like whoa you crazy lady you think just cuz you're going 40 miles an hour that's okay cuz you're on a side street like you're not even looking where you're going you driving a car what if you hit a kid Jesus Christ [ __ ] what if you slam into some old lady you know what if you rear-end a bike you're not even looking you didn't notice the bike was there boom you run over some guy's leg what in the [ __ ] lady or dude maybe I was misgendering I don't know I don't know what her statuses you gotta be real careful today Sturgill amazed it like that Nashville is ever like super I don't know bro I don't leave the house I really don't have any idea I just I think that's a good move yeah you know I like my kids I mean I'm somewhat aware of everything going on it's surprising that none of that's really hit the music business mmm as hard as it is but there's just yeah I try to just do my thing yeah there's a weird weird world were living in today I would like I would like us to figure this out better I would like us to do just a little bit better job being nice to each other getting our [ __ ] together you [Applause]", "qG-Ac48CyVU": "what's up friends welcome back today i will be showing you how to make infused pixie sticks the powder inside of these can also be used to dip your suckers into to eat by itself and if you add a lot of citric acid you can get it so sour that it's even more sour than warheads which is kind of how i like mine in this video i'm also going to be showing you guys how to infuse the sugar but if you already have infused sugar or don't need to know how to make it you can skip to six minutes in this video to get right to making the pixie sticks [Music] to make the infused sugar you're going to need half a cup of tincture and one and one quarter cup of granulated sugar start by pouring your sugar into a large dish and then pour your tincture on top and stir it all together i felt like mine was too liquidy so i added another quarter cup of sugar and then stirred that some more after i added the sugar the consistency was much better you could definitely still see the grains instead of it being mostly liquid like it was before um if you guys aren't sure about how much sugar to use if you find it's too liquidy just keep adding a few spoonfuls of sugar until you get a consistency closer to something like this then we need to evaporate all the alcohol off of this sugar so we're going to preheat our oven to the lowest temperature that it can go for me that's 170 degrees and we're going to place it into the oven leaving the oven door open and i'm also having a fan just to help with air circulation because you are having alcohol in the oven you have to be very very very careful to make sure to never close the oven door and to always have good airflow then i'm going to set the timer for about 10 minutes and every 10 or 15 minutes i'm going to come back and stir the mixture this is what mine is looking like after the first 10 minutes so i'm just going to stir it and try to kind of scrape down the sides and i'm gonna have to do this quite a few times like i said every 10 to 15 minutes just come and stir it so because i am making pixie sticks um i want to flavor my sugar so i want two different flavors so i'm just going to get another baking dish and pour part of this mixture into it and then i'm going to add a flavoring oil to each dish now we want to do this earlier in the process so we can help with the evaporation of the liquid but it doesn't really matter if you put it in the first 15 minutes the second 15 minutes or anything like that just try and put it while there's still liquid in there so that it can evaporate with the rest of the liquid then we'll just put it right back into the oven for another 10-15 minutes again we're going to have to repeat the process of in the oven for 10-15 minutes take it at a stir put it back in the oven for 10-15 minutes take it out to stir until it has returned to its original grainy sand consistency so at this point the sugar has been in the oven for about 45 minutes i think and is still a little bit too liquidy so again we're going to stir it and then put it back in the oven for a bit and continue to do this until we get a nice consistency so after about an hour and a half it was pretty much all good i did leave it sitting out um for a couple hours just to dry off any extra moisture and then here is what it looked like you can see it definitely made some clumps so we are going to break those up and each of these dishes are different flavors for me but um one is bubble gum and one is watermelon so i don't really mind if i'm using the same utensils because the flavors kind of go together but yeah so i'm just going to scrape all the sugar off the bottom of the dish and then we are going to put it in a blender to um make it nice and refined so i'm just pouring some of this sugar into my blender and we're going to try and grind it down into a finer texture unfortunately i don't know if it's because i put too much sugar that might be the problem um i it wouldn't really grind like the the blender wouldn't really get it to um like mix i don't know it just it wasn't working very well for me so i decided to use a food processor instead but i have a feeling if i did smaller amounts in the blender it probably would have worked a little bit better so using the food presser helped a ton it was coming out very very nicely you can see the texture is beautiful and i just continued to do this for all of my sugar until it was all ground down nicely i do want to mention that humidity plays a very important part in being able to make this sugar properly i luckily have air conditioning in my apartment so i set it really high so we could dry out the space as much as possible if it's too humid your sugar will clump so just try to avoid that if you can otherwise maybe just use extra sugar where i live in canada is not very humid at all so it's not something that i've really had to worry about but for those of you who do maybe you can leave some advice in the comments to help others out as well so at this point the sugar is pretty much done if you're going to use it for other purposes just store it in a airtight container um but for us we're going to be making pixie sticks so let's move on to what we need to make that our first and most important ingredient is the sugar that we just made we're also going to need some icing sugar some citric acid some kool-aid packets or some flavoring oils and some food coloring so this is 24 hours after i made the sugar and even though i did grind it down to a fine texture you can see it clumped up once again probably due to the moisture in the air i'm not sure um so we're just going to reprocess them i separated them into three bowls because i'm gonna do three separate colors and then we're going to start with the first one and place it into a food processor so i'm just pouring it in there and i'm going to grind it down first just to see how it's going to look and then we can add our other ingredients so it looks beautiful you can see it is so fine and not clumpy at all and then we're going to add our citric acid if you want to be sour just start out with um a teaspoon or so and blend it together see how it tastes and then add more as desired you can make it as sour as you like i'm also going to be adding some food coloring to mine i'm adding blue this is gel food coloring and i do have some issues using this as you will see as the video goes on at this point you can also add some kool-aid packages for your flavoring if desired i've already flavored mine with flavoring oils when i made the sugar but kool-aid packages work very well also and they have citric acid in them so if you don't have citric acid at home it'll help to get that sourness so you can see here my food coloring is not mixing at all it's just kind of clumping so i'm not sure why it's happening just yet but i have a suspicion that it's to do with lack of moisture so i'm just going to continue on with how i'd make these regularly and just see if maybe it binds so i'm just adding some icing sugar and this helps with the texture it kind of gives it like that baby bottle pop fine sugary texture that's really nice you don't need to use icing sugar um but it does help with the taste the texture and it also helps for people who live in more humid climates at this point the food coloring has still not properly mixed in so i decided it's due to the lack of moisture so i added my gel food coloring to a couple drops of water to create essentially liquid food coloring just a regular kind of kind you'd buy at a grocery store which i'm assuming most people that's what they would be using anyway so you probably shouldn't have this issue gel food coloring is just what i usually have on hand um but yeah adding a couple drops of water to the gel food coloring definitely really helped because clearly it looks very beautiful um and it mixed very nicely so i'm very happy with that now i'm just scraping the bottom to make sure everything is properly incorporated as well as adding some more citric acid so that it's extra sour and then i'm going to mix it a final time and then once that's done i'm going to pour it back into its bowl and set it aside until we have our other colors now i'm starting on my next one so same process adding the sugar adding some citric acid if you want to add your kool-aid packets you can do so now and then adding the food coloring for myself i am adding some water with my food coloring before i add it so like i said i'd let this sugar sit over 24 hours after i made it before i added um the food coloring and this whole process here today um but after i made my initial batch of sugar i did make some pink and i used my regular gel pink food coloring and i had absolutely no issues getting it to bind which is why i think it was because of the lack of water because the sugar still had a little bit of moisture in it yesterday but 24 hours from then which is now it was dried out more so that little bit of water added with the food coloring helps to restore that moisture now it looks like some of the food coloring got stuck on the bottom with the sugar so i'm just scraping it around to get everything mixed and then adding some powdered sugar the measurement is not really um well i didn't measure it i just kind of put spoonfuls into my taste but if you are looking for a measurement i would say use about half the amount of regular sugar for the powdered sugar so if you used one cup of regular sugar maybe use half a cup or less of powdered sugar but again it can be to taste or you don't even need to use powdered sugar if you don't want to [Music] now i'm just adding in a little bit of yellow food coloring just because i want to be a little bit more neon looking and then mixing it together you can see i have to scrape the bottom a little bit there um but yeah i think that the color turned out a little bit too green i kind of wanted to be more of a lighter green but that's okay anyway it still looks cool i was hoping i'd be able to lighten it by adding in some more sugar to dilute the color but it didn't really help that much and then that's done you can add in more citric acid or more sugar you can just adjust it to according to how you like it so then i'm just pouring that into its bowl and then i also have the blue one that i just made and then a pink one that i made yesterday and now it is time for the fun part which is filling up our pixie stix [Music] now we're going to prepare our pixie stick straws and we're going to seal the bottom of them using this bag sealer thing that i just bought i'm also going to show you guys later how to close them without one of these um i did just get this egg sealer thing but it works really well like look how great that straw looks um i think it was like 10 or 15 on amazon i'll post the link um but i am new to it like i literally just got it so you guys can probably see i will struggle a little bit but after the first few straws i got a hang of it better and then they were very easy to quickly seal now we're going to fill up the straws with their sour sugar powder dust whatever you call it um and i'm using this squeeze bottle to get it in there so i bought a tip that is slightly bigger than the size of my straw and i just put the straw in and hold it inside of that tip and then just shake it up and down and it comes out really nicely um the easiest way to do this would to just be buy bigger straws and then you can just use like a paper funnel to get it into the straw but if you already have these tools at home this works like the best it just it's not really worth it to go and buy it if you can just do bigger straws in a paper funnel then i just filled up all my straws using a variety of colors it was kind of annoying because i had to switch the tip every single time i did it if i want to change colors yeah just fill them up to however you like they can be all one color all different colors um and mine are flavored sour watermelon and bubble gum but they actually taste really good just with the sugar and citric acid like they don't even need flavoring okay now that all of my straws are done i'm just going to take my little sealer and close the tips of all of them now i'm going to show you guys how to seal the straws without a bake sealer so you're going to take an oven mitt or a folded dish cloth and then put a piece of tin foil on it put your hand inside of it sorry i didn't get this in the camera that well um put your hand inside of it and sort of shape it into like a little mitt like that with the dish cloth underneath to protect your hand now you're going to place the straw in your tin foil mitt hand and use a lighter to quickly light the other end then once it's lit you're going to quickly switch it over to the other side and squish it down holding it to seal it and then take it out see that looks pretty good so you definitely don't need to go and buy the sealer for this you could just use a lighter and some tinfoil and it seals very nicely the blue powder reminded me so much of baby bottle pops and it really like had that taste too i don't know i think it just because i used more powdered sugar in that one but i thought it would be really good dipped in or to dip suckers in there so i took these little bags and filled them up with some of each of the powders and then put a sucker in there these are just regular suckers because it's what i had on hand but if you really wanted to up them you could use a infused sucker and you can clearly see i'm thinking very hard about what color would go best i chose the dark one i hope that was the best color combination um i really like the way that the the red contrasts with the pink powder but yeah i think they all look adorable the green one's a little bit too green for me but i also really like all the colors mixed together so i did a mix of all the colors and then i'm just putting them into this little container because you don't need obviously those little bags to enjoy this you could also just put it into whatever you want and dip your sucker in there and i absolutely love how pretty all those colors look together once everything is done try to store it in a dry area so maybe keep them in a sealed bag or container to keep any excess moisture and they should last for quite a while i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did and please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe thank you guys so much for watching have a wonderful day

incorporate edibles into your life well me personally I don't really agree with edibles because they have a button that's the own button but they don't have an off button he comes to me right you know and I don't like not being in control so I'd rather not but for those who do who don't you know prefer to smoke it's the best high quality CPD you know it's stopping the line you know I'm saying this is to do it fluid it's the do it fluid all right now whatever time I did we probably that's something that like like you know there was one guy on my staff and he'll go nameless producer Dan Ferguson and he just a love you know his pot in his edibles and I remember what she was like looking I was looking at the stuff he had he had like a baby pacifier made out of a pod you would like long long long long you know I mean there [Applause] I caught him ah I caught him a mustache before what's that I caught that guy in mustache yeah that listen they have all kinds of stuff now they have creams there's bath salts last week we had a sex expert on the show and I'm not kidding she had a spray that had what THC in it and you're you're a woman is supposed to spray it in her nether regions Oh to increase pleasure and she said it's becoming a big thing have you tried the sprays out at all not know sexual medically marijuana tricks or none of that I've I try but I've heard and I've heard they're very well so would you be interested that you think you would try that I might I might I might yeah I'm not saying that you're not gonna tell me I might you know what let's try it on Larry King okay yeah happy to do we wait we wait till Larry King's at naught at the urinal Larry you", "TCnvp8zq3I4": "when pot became legal in Canada investors couldn't sign checks any faster to make sure they had a foot in the door stores and producers popped up and people right across the country we're excited about this industry and what it might mean for new jobs the truth is some of the Canadian cannabis companies have been struggling so we're here at weed me a cannabis cultivators just 30 minutes outside of Toronto to find out why the difficulty is that it's hard for people to get the product at the moment that's Terry Kellogg ah he's the founder of weed me a company that grows cannabis and makes its products available to legal companies across Canada and one of the markets he's moving into is Ontario the access to the to the consumer is really limited in Ontario there needs to be more brick-and-mortar stores so people can go in see the product touch and feel the product smell it and then buy it in Ontario there are 24 legal cannabis stores this is nothing compared to how many liquor stores the provincial government runs here more than 600 stores the reason why there's such a big difference here is the only way you can sell marijuana in Ontario is by winning a licence through a lottery fewer stores and a huge market like Ontario mean many people are getting their weed elsewhere the black market when people have been interacting with a seller in the black market for many years they will have confidence that that seller is going to give them the sort of product they want about three Canadians bought cannabis from the illegal market earlier in 2019 for every two who bought only from the legal market not surprising when you see how much people pay for it legal cannabis is about $10 per gram but in the black market pot is half that price at about $5 per gram the real issues for people especially people that have been using pot for a while is what's the motivation for them to switch first of all they can't find it and second of all they have to pay a lot more for it but why the price hike there's many levels of government that are involved in in every step of the way so we're quite significantly taxed if if we were selling direct to the consumer without so many hands in our pocket so to speak that we would be extreme we competitive with the black market well recreational marijuana was a huge hit with investors in 2018 shares are now down by 25% to big producers hexo Corp and can trust recently cut hundreds of jobs those layoffs represent about 4% of the cannabis producer workforce in Canada but it's not just companies that are suffering the New Brunswick government decided to get out of the cannabis game saying it's time for the private sector to handle it isn't that indicative of some of our the initial hurdles of the industry starting super big is difficult to do and there's no real previous model to follow in this industry except for the black market which in some ways the legal market is trying to emulate we're not reinventing the wheel here we're trying to legalize the wheel the black market produces some great products but what they don't have is the confirmation that what the consumers consuming is safe for consumption in the black market there are no regulations as to how these plants are treated prior to consumption and finishing for us we provide a safe product for the consumer it's time to show show the public that as a producer you're able to actually produce product and you're able to do so in a way that makes business sense but the cannabis industry in Canada is still very much in its early days so maybe what's happening right now are just a few growing pains [Music] you [Music]", "7bM2Zh6Owt8": "what's up y'all southern damper here and this is gonna be my official review on chronic elixir but y'all know me first things first I got to put some smoke in there get the mood right

"but what what dr. heart is talking about is in the first chapter of the book which I guess you haven't read and I really should have a copy for you it's stupid of me I got a copy of my bag but so this is fascinating to me the the British you know they colonized India and they set up what they called lunatic asylum was really psychiatric hospital sort of very primitive psychiatric hospitals and they were really initially for soldiers in the Indian Army and they were run by British doctors and what these doctors really as early as like the late 1850s 1860s noticed was that a lot of the people who showed up in these hospitals were showing up with canopy what they called ganja actually in Indians called ganja or bong which is a very weak preparation of basically or Indian hemp just sort of low-grade cannabis and so and so they started counting and they rose the twenty to thirty percent of the people who were coming to asylums or heavy cannabis users and that was way more than alcohol is more than opium and this really fascinating doctor named George Francis William EWTN's wrote a book in 1908 and he looked at the evidence and and it is amazing to hear how he describes schizophrenia how he describes cannabis how he describes the cases of violence around cannabis it's like it's like any psychiatrist today certainly any forensic psychiatrist like my wife would would like everything in the book would ring completely true and it was so fascinating to me to stumble on this and realize this is something people were talking about for more than a hundred years mmm so could we agree that there are some people where cannabis is not a good idea absolutely right we could agree that that's a all right would think we all great we're also agree that some people can't eat peanuts absolutely yeah yeah right yeah you know why peanuts kill you that's yeah it's more dangerous Oh so these second six hundred a year yeah people die from peanuts so yeah I think more people die from canvas as a result of homicide in the zoo okay well there's no correlation there's no study but I know somebody's got to do the work but why you saying that then because I've looked at enough data to tell me you think marijuana is causing homicides oh yeah this is what the book is about but anyhow so what does it causes paranoia and psychosis in people and paranoid psychosis are huge risk for homicide and schizophrenia studies that refute that it was notable there are no studies that refute that paranoid psychosis are huge risk for homicide schizophrenia is a 20x20 Times Joe well Jamie I sent you a document yesterday I mean there's there's multiple studies that they show that you know marijuana laws are not associated with a new drug yeah so the use of the drug which could possibly trigger psychosis psychosis and schizophrenia which are correlated with murders are we're not correlated they're triggers that's a grab salute fact yeah triggers because of the paranoia and delusions and you think that someone's out to get you and they're not absolutely I mean the the out of the numbers okay so the numbers are if you're if you have a diagnosis of schizophrenia you are 20 times as likely to commit homicide as somebody who's healthy now it's actually worse than that for cannabis okay and here's why what so the National Alliance for mental illness and the mental illness advocate advocacy groups hate talking about this why they hate talking about it obviously because it stigmatizes people with mental illness so what they say and this is true is if you have a diagnosis but you're taking your antipsychotics even though the side effects might be unpleasant you're in treatment you're you're you're not using recreational drugs your risk for violence isn't that high it's not that much higher than a healthy person okay and you know fortunately healthy people don't commit murder that often the problem is if you if you think about the math for half a second if there's this one group of people who don't have a very high risk for murder or serious violence who because they're not using because they're on antipsychotics it means that the excess risk in the people who are using and who's untrue whose psychosis is untreated it must be spectacularly high and the numbers bear that out so so there's a really good study from last year 2018 a small group of patients in in Switzerland Isis what's wrong Linda's a safe country is a low base crime rate but 50% of the people who are using cannabis and had psychosis over a three-year period committed violence in that group of people that's mostly 20-something man well you know there's a study here and I just sent it to you Jamie and it's it's titled risk factors for violence and psychosis a systemic review and meta-analysis of 110 studies so you know that's it's quite a few studies okay so you know let me just just read part of it out to you so violence was strongly associate with the history of polysubstance abuse strong associate with diagnostic oriented substance use disorder and recent substance misuse and moderately associate with a history of alcohol misuse a history of substance misuse recent alcohol misuse recent drug misuse and a history of drug misuse it was unclear if there was an association between violence and history of cannabis masseuse so again this is a hundred and ten studies they very carefully looked at all of the different risk factors as to what could trigger violence just let me finish Alex and what they said again it was unclear if there was an association between violence and a history of cannabis misuse alright so that's a hundred and ten studies so cannabis use in there is gonna get locked in with poly substance use like because a lot of people who use are gonna be using other drugs Holle substance means multiple sub zactly so odd everything else was found to have significantly sophistical announced and I have not not just mine a study that doctor heard a song that I'd like to look at it without looking at it I can't push back as hard as I would like what I can tell you is that I have many studies in the book that show that cannabis use is associated with violence in people with psychosis okay and more broadly it's associated with violence in the general population in large studies in studies of high-school students and bullying in studies of people who were vacationing in Ibiza in in in studies of young men in China and the UK there are big studies out there that show cannabis use is associated with violence Ibiza grilled over there for that they get manager just said it yes some dignitary or royal person how Lisp right isn't that how it all starts right yeah yeah I believe so noted yeah the way the people in Spain prints words was directly affected by this one person apparently but um so this these this correlation between people that have schizophrenia and using cannabis how do you is schizophrenia a diagnosis it's purely based on behavior basically yes yeah it's a clinic there's no blood tests do a brain scan it's basically how you behave and and what you tell the doctor about how you rise rise or it's very subjective because you're you're asking someone basically a series of questions I mean it's no different than you know depression really I mean you just just asking someone a series of questions and then you know based upon that which is very subjective then you're gonna make you know a clinical decision whereas when it's like a blood test like if someone you know passes a you know a certain amount of hemoglobin a1c and depending on which chart you're looking at then you're going to call that person pre-diabetic or diabetic but you know our fortune we just don't have those objective measurements and again that's why you know Alex was saying earlier that that you know the they couldn't really figure out you know how many people in the United States had had schizophrenia and I understand that but at the same time too I mean it's okay to to adjust you know the way that you diagnose someone over the course of the years and you learn things because you know you could easily say that almost everyone has some type of mental illness and I mean people should understand that you know there's seven different basic human emotions you know I've talked to sports there's the anger is contempt there's disgust there's fear sadness surprise and happiness that's seven so you know depending on which way surprise goes I mean six out of those seven are negative right because we're wired to basically detect threats so you know we're making you know the all these diagnosis I think we have to be careful because you know some people are calling themselves depressed and some people call themselves anxious when really you know they're just not dealing with basic human emotions that they need to understand and need to deal with like people are getting angry about being angry or like depressed about being depressed like if you feel one of these emotions just kind of sit with it and just kind of reflect on it and I think you know that's a much much better way to kind of kind of T to T's things out but you want to come back to to my original point I think that you know more people are understanding that you know we don't just need to give out a pill for everything and that you know everyone shouldn't just be labeled as having a mental health diagnosis because if things just keep you know going the way they are you know what it's by 2040 it's gonna be like 50% of people are gonna have like a mental health disorder so I people just need to understand that life is hard you got to deal with these emotions sometimes it's not that big of a deal and that's why and that's awesome for some folks and that's why I'm such a big fan of Jordan Peterson because you know he's he's kind of tough on people and he said but let me stop there because Jordan Peterson was on SSRIs for years yeah yeah for a long long time I mean it like for a long long time as was his family and that's what's crazy about him is what got him off as a carnivore diet is an elimination diet where he only eats meat with salt and drinks water and the healthier that he's ever been in his life and that is a another massively controversial subject yes let me push back a little bit because I think people you know as controversial as the book has been about about cannabis and psychosis this violence issue is even more controversial and obviously for a fair number of people it doesn't really doesn't sync with the stereotype doesn't say it doesn't say with how they've experienced cannabis use right so I think I think alcohols are really interesting [Music] comparison um I'm a Canadian from Newfoundland oh I'm sorry youthful age understand marijuana loose and land decisis a Newfoundland trade myself to say that way your tongue I'm wrong lane look what you just pulled up marijuana use increases violent behavior 50-year study finds casual link between cannabis and subsequent violent behavior new research published online in advance of print of the journals like psychological medicine concludes that continued use of cannabis causes violent behavior as a direct result of changes in brain function that are caused by smoking weed over many years researchers have long debated a possible link between the use of marijuana and violent crime in contrast to alcohol meth and many other illegal drugs the metal bang effects of cannabis seemed unsuited to promoting violent behavior however ample ample previous research has linked marijuana used to increased violent behavior the sticky problem in such studies are that many confounding factors co-founding factors involved in interpreting this correlation so okay it is very difficult to determine whether or not any statistical correlation between marijuana use and violent behavior are causally linked or instead the two associated or instead the two are associated through some other factors such as socioeconomic status personality traits or many other variables that are related to the propensity to use marijuana so I think that's a fairly good summary as well of the issues to add the study came from 411 boys who were born in 1953 in London 97% of which were Caucasian and all of them are raised in two-parent households so so you know so those people are relatively stable if they're to family to parents to have parents be tissue that's also know it's possible but so so so I think the alcohol comparison is again a good one because anybody who's ever been in a at 9:00 p.m. and gone back at 2:00 a.m. knows that alcohol dis inhibits people right it causes fights right it it makes people loud it makes a lot of [ __ ] it does alcohol and sex you're a terrible idea right it certainly causes some sexual violence okay but at the same time everybody knows that you can have a drink you know you can have a beer at that backyard barbecue you can classify that's right it doesn't mean that you're gonna get in a fight and it actually might enhance your conversation social lubricant all that good stuff all that good stuff and you might even know people I mean I do know people who I would say have a problem with drinking okay but it's mostly they're sitting at home drinking scotch watching baseball until they fall asleep that night now that's obviously not a healthy way to use alcohol but it doesn't make them violent but we know on a population basis that alcohol causes violence it causes drunk driving it causes problems and it's said that in the study that that I quoted earlier but it's it's said that alcohol again they they didn't or sorry cannabis they weren't sure right so okay so this is again I would like to read the paper that you're quoting from because I have so much other research but here's here's what I'm saying about cannabis okay cannabis for a lot of people yeah they can just smoke it and as people you know many people have tweeted at me the only thing I attacked was a bowl of nachos hmm like and so and so that's true for some people but that could be eaten with the alcohol as well that's exactly logical variable and there's so many studies that say that that the cannabis laws have actually decreased crime so so even though for many people cannabis isn't gonna cause violence that doesn't mean it can't cause violence in some people especially or at least could be affair or at least could be a factor especially with the kind of violence that I am talking about and then I write about in the book which is again so alcohol it maybe makes a argument into a brawl it makes a brawl into something where somebody picks up a stick it makes that into something where somebody pulls out a knife it escalates right cannabis is different cannabis causes paranoia and psychosis and it certainly causes those things temporarily even if it doesn't cause them permanently so a distortion in reality that could lead to you doing some things terrible and it's usually to somebody you're not actually fighting with it's a family member that the worst cases that I've and I've really seen a lot of these cases are basically innocent family members who are just in the way when somebody loses touch with a reality and literally thinks like this my 85 year old grandmother is going to kill me so I better stab her to death first that happens it happens a lot and if you look at the amount of violence that people with psychosis commit on a population level basis it looks like people with schizophrenia commit about six to ten percent of all the murders in this country and it looks like people is sort of broader to more broadly defined psychosis again bipolar with psychosis other psychotic conditions temporary psychosis they might be responsible for as much as twenty percent of the violent crime in the United States that's a lot of violent crime and what I'm saying is that it is quite clear that drug use mediates that violent crime in other words if you're not using you can keep your impulses in check but when you do use you become dangerous so when we're talking about biological variability if we factor in schizophrenia you know essentially what you're saying is that there are people that have schizophrenia that don't commit violence but that they're much more likely to commit violence if you add some sort of psych medication whether it's marijuana whether it's something else that perturbs reality for them and particularly psychotics bring down these yes so recreational drugs the worst the worst cases of all are cannabis and a stimulant because to these they both like cocaine or meth exactly yeah so when you get that you get paranoia from two sources mm-hmm and you get the only good thing about cannabis from this point of view is that kind of knocks people down a little bit but meth brings them right back so is it fair to say that what we don't know is that we don't know whether or not these people like this young man with this terrible story from Connecticut yes we don't know whether or not he would have become a schizophrenic and and exhibited those symptoms without the marijuana we really don't know we do know he did with it that's that's correct and and what I would also say is that for somebody like that and this is quite clear on a population level basis with people with schizophrenia is you've got to discourage them from using we really have to be described because it brings out the worst Brian and and you know somebody said this a friend of mine of old friend mine from the New York Times said so every time there's a hurricane people some people on the right say well you can't prove that global warming caused that one hurricane that would have happened anyway and he and they're right you can't prove it and you can't prove that any one case of psychosis was caused by marijuana but when you look at the big studies at the population level data the association is really clear and everything points the same way and the synthetic cannabinoids k2 and spice those can clearly produce psychosis in people and people with psychosis tend to slip back into it if they use at some point you got to start to say to yourself why does everything go the same way yeah I also have a personal friend and I'd really didn't think about this guy but there's another personal friend that I know that is a martial arts instructor that had a psychotic break he became schizophrenic and he's a regular marijuana user and the people around him associated that with that and in fact people that are regular cannabis users were trying to get him to stop using marijuana if you're close to being on the edge and you use a little bit of cannabis for sure let me tell you something this guy was not on the edge when I knew him yeah when I knew him he was very rational very rational but something happened somewhere along the line was he would did he become a pretty heavy smoker over time I do not know because we don't live in the same area anymore but he got really heavily really heavily medicated and did some really crazy [ __ ] and wanted being hospitalized and this was not the case before I mean whatever it was that triggered him I mean it when I was around him when he was younger I would have said he's a total normal guy and I would have never saw that coming he was a heavy marijuana user heavy heavy but I don't know how he's doing now I hope he's okay but we're you know we have mutual friends yeah and he became a schizophrenic and and you know you will see you know cases like that but you know when you do a lot of the larger data on cannabis and violence I mean it's just it's just not there like there's lots of data that suggests that you know medical marijuana laws for example can actually have a decrease in overall they could I mean I think that's a study that says there's no comfort to the people who lose their children because of these psychotic breaks that's right and those studies are really bad so the place that you can criticize is bad though because they're because state-level data is not great the place the book has been criticized or andr there was a rand review though in 2013 and I mean that that's again that stays by statement that marijuana use does not induce violent crime and the links between marijuana use and property crime are Thayne right there I think we all agree that marijuana use by itself with people that aren't schizophrenic probably doesn't induce violent crime but with people that are schizophrenic or people where it triggers schizophrenia it could potentially induce violent crime my friend did not get violent although he did do a violent thing it wasn't to a person yeah I think I think we have to be really careful because there's no just like with diet just like with the food and you know like allergies all these different variabilities when it comes to human beings I think we have to be really really careful about lumping all people together when it comes to how they get affected by various compounds yeah so so the state levels thing if you want help so the place the book has been criticized in my mind sort of the most fairly is it points out that in the four states that legalized first which is Alaska Washington Oregon Colorado if you look at 2013 and then you compare that to 2017 mmm-hmm murders and AGG assaults violent crime are up substantially in those states and substantially more than in the u.s. can I stop you there but is there a possibility there's a correlation between organized crime because one of the things about selling marijuana is the people that have always been selling marijuana have been criminals when you make things legal in a state the people that were selling an illegal flock to that state and that's true so that there's there's a direct correlation between people being robbed that there was also a significant problem with credit cards and banks where everyone was having to do all the transactions with cash there was a lot of violence as was associated with marijuana in regards to that and also massive increase in population so so and that's the reason why Trump is actually not really against cannabis in some ways is because he feels that if we have medical marijuana laws that especially the states that are that the better border states that the crimes going to drop drops a lot tremendously and it has dropped they they did a study last year and it dropped over successes all around drop seven percent in Arizona and then again you know Benjamin Hansen who's who's in the wrong data silver so he said that the murder rate did not demonstrate that marijuana legalization increases fonts and then it may have actually demonstrated that legalization slightly decrease fonts and he thinks that the reason that there was an increase in the murder rate particularly in Washington is because there was a large income gap they say that Washington has the tenth largest income gap in the United States but that's how did that change the ex-cons to the murderer good question Durham I'm so I haven't you know I didn't get to speak with Benjamin about this it sounds like confirmation box well he I mean if that that is one thing that has been shown to you know increase mental illness like we talked about and can definitely increase violence is when you have an income gap right that happens but how's the income gap shifted that directly correlates to the legalization of marijuana because during the scene because during the same period the income gap particularly in Washington and increased okay so he feels that you know the corresponding number right so he feels that that it's it's likely more to that and I mean he'd I mean I understand but I mean you have to respect this guy I mean I don't I respect them because I know what he did with this data and and so Joe this this is maddening to me okay okay okay violent crime in those four states increased more rapidly than in the u.s. period between 2013 and 2017 Jamie just conjecture Assad no credible data exists it supports a significant association between the increased violent crime and legalization furthermore studies suggest that so far violent crime decreases in states with legalized medical marijuana until new research credibly suggests otherwise the claim that a demonstratable link between the two exists will remain classified as false okay so that's just not true okay I know it's knope's okay and I know we trust Snopes how do we trust them that okay I was gonna say that too but they're they give all of their their source okay so again these do you are you on of those where are these sources and what's wrong with it here let me just go back to okay what I'm saying yeah please do 2013 Oregon Washington Colorado Alaska mm-hmm there are 450 murders in those four states there are 30,000 AGG assaults period okay 2017 Oregon Washington Colorado Alaska there are 620 murders in those four states that's an almost 40% increase there are 38,000 AGG assaults that's a 25% increase if you adjust for population you still get big increases in Denver 2018 almost 70 murders there were about 35 in 2013 Seattle 27 2018 there were 34 35 murders there were I think 19 in 2013 these increases are real okay they now know now okay can we say that marijuana legalization caused those increases we cannot yet there are other possibilities and your what are those well one positive all population did increase it's also possible that these states quote-unquote imported violent crime in other words that you've got a population of transients coming in in part because marijuana was legal and those people are likely to commit violent crime and on top of that organized crime people that are selling absolutely there may have been some people who are exporting to Nebraska to Minnesota to other states there's crime associated with that but what I am saying is that unequivocally unequivocally the people who said legalization is going to decrease violent crime and people did say that and Cory Booker in 2017 said it he said that it actually had decreased violent crime in states that legalized and he didn't say it randomly he said it when he was injured using legislation to legalize marijuana on the federal level those people are wrong and they need to stop saying it I know and by the way that Oregon economist used he used the wrong data set for his charts okay he used I used the real numbers okay the FBI homicide numbers he used numbers that include justifiable homicide no police that's not right because the FBI reported that the murder rate went up 1% from 2015 to 2016 as compared the nationwide which went up 7.9% and then it dropped by 11.6 percent between 2016 and 22nd do not know what you're talking about okay those are FBI numbers I'm reading not know what you're talking about the numbers are clear okay I use I'm reading them right now 2016 release of FBI uniform crime reports from Oregon okay yes Oregon you're not reading the reports from the United States you're picking one state for Jamie sure the entire country from that time period too so yes I picked those four states where marijuana was legalized as a sort of cherry-picking you know it's not it's picking every state where they're illegal country arrays no that's what I'm trying to show yes something wrong we'll pull back so we can see the holster so first of all that's a that's violent crime for murders and a crime great be in there Oh violent crime and that assaults aren't they no so so the four categories of violent crime are murder AGG assault robbery and rape rape is sort of gone sideways the last few years robberies actually have gone down it's murders and AGG assaults that our interpersonal violent crime okay just to go back to this Oregon economist because this Madden's me he used a dataset that is not the standard data set to report murder what is the difference he used the data set that includes justifiable homicides meaning I'm in my house you come in I shoot you and kill you the police don't charge me with anything right and police homicide because let's not let an interrupt let me finish the those two categories of crime are not likely to be impacted by cannabis use cops aren't smoking when they're on Patrol is hope and if you are using you're very unlikely to have your murder viewed as justifiable homicide the fair comparison is the base murder rate in the US and that's the number that I used and I am Telling You I mean I know these numbers I sleep you know I wake up with these numbers cannabis the for cannabis legal states on a per capita basis crime murders rose 31 percent on a per capita basis in those four states over the 2013 2017 period maybe I'm sorry I said 31 maybe it's 29% so maybe I say I woke up with anyway the for the u.s. its 18% 29% versus 18% that's the gap and I am NOT saying that I know that cannabis legalization caused that gap what I am saying is people need to stop claiming that cannabis legalization reduces violent crime it in it has increased in those two I asked you in those states was it Universal the increase was it almost identical yes Alaska was the most then I think merged why not more in Colerain Washington and and what's also interesting Joe if you're if you really want to go into the numbers is the gap actually widened year by year so that's sort of what you would expect if this is the result of a psychomimetic effect in other words a psychosis causing effect because cannabis doesn't cause psychosis right away people break down but if it's causing heavy use and some of those people are sliding into you know paranoia and psychosis you'd sort of expect the gap to increase over time and that's what's happened okay so you know I'm gonna go back again to the Netherlands okay because they've had you know cannabis legalized forever and they have one fifth of the homicide rate that the United States does right but they also have a lower cannabis use that's true but still you know one one line cake box result one one fifth I mean it's still it's pretty drastic overall and and again you know Alex you know you know I appreciate some we're talking about the correlation between cannabis use one of the things that we have to accept in America is when you're in a place like the Netherlands it has a long and accepted history of use people are accustomed to it so I think things kind of even out I think one of the things that we're dealing with with the United States is people that have just they don't they don't have a long history of experience and it becomes legal and then they use it and maybe some of them like we're talking about don't have a tolerance for it have too much and like I was talking about with my friend who's like this really continent the the one who had an edible and became suicidal and this [ __ ] up for weeks that is very confident very articulate very intelligent he's not a not a weirdo not a not transient extremely extremely successful you know I think there are there are variables that we need to take into consideration there's certain human beings that exhibit a pattern of behavior that's directly correlated to cannabis use that I don't experience so if I could say from my own personal biases that that's [ __ ] that's nothing it doesn't do anything I've been smoking for years doesn't do [ __ ] well you probably don't have one of those three genes that we were talking about and you probably also too you know don't overuse or you have some type of you know legitimacy as to why you are you are using it and you know one III want to keep going with this but you know at the end of the show I think that we should make some type of like recommendations for people just because I hate when you know you have this big you know three-hour podcast and then at the end of it it's just like hey guys just be safe you know some type of like recommendations like I love the podcast with with with with crecer and Joel Wright but at the at the end of it was just sort of like hey guys the American diet I think most people realize that one person was going on data and the other person was you know yeah yeah I mean I'm sure I find it so fascinating that now when you think back through your you know through your life you've thought of somebody who was affected that I have several people I'll bet Oh if you think about it you'll think of more people maybe but those are the big ones and like I said my friend who is a martial arts instructor it was a pretty significant issue with a lot of our friends we were trying to figure out what was wrong with him beforehand he was sending me these videos that didn't make any sense and I was like what in the [ __ ] is this like I'll explain to you more off air because so I don't have to out this guy but a lot of people that were close to him were really seriously concerned now it is it something that would have happened anyway I don't know how is he since 20s late 20s 20 you know that's right around the age a little a little bit late ish like because like I said a lot of the studies even when you look at the ones on adolescents like for sure it's it's below like they have done studies like below 18 is worse yes and say below 25 below 15 is worse than 18 like the younger you go the worse and he seems to be fine now that's good that's good it's using that I don't know after I know and it's you know I'm not an expert on this subject but it's because of this of something called pruning that we go through so everyone goes through this and basically if your adolescence you're gonna drop off some some weak neural connections to kind of pick up some stronger ones you know it's the best way to kind of explain it I'm gonna use cannabis you can potentially accelerate that process and then because you accelerate that process you don't get those good neural connections and then you know people unfortunately you know develop things like like psychosis and and schizophrenia so you know that's kind of where they were the issue lies so you know one thing that I am you know very happy that we're talking about and I know Alex will be too is that you know we want to discuss the benefits in this podcast make sure that people understand that you know I believe that marijuana is medicine it's an excellent medicine but the other thing though too is we do want to mitigate the risks because there are real risks out there so you know I do appreciate you know us talking about adolescents and making sure that they do stay away from cannabis yeah and I mean especially that's like I've read these you know these cases files sometimes you know the kids started using when he was 11 and you know it's like that kid never had a chance right and obviously oftentimes these are kids coming from disadvantaged backgrounds anyway but you know they were using by 11 and it's 16 they put a you know put a gun to somebody's head and pull the trigger I mean the pre-adolescent and early teen use we got to do everything we can to stop the problem is yeah like if you if you smoke pot in junior high like say 7 8 9 like you're probably gonna smoke pot and highs yeah like that's the I mean that's what I saw we went out when I was growing up and you know even when I was home for Christmas for a few days like yeah a couple of my friends even talked about you know some people that we knew you know smoked ton of pot in high school and like now like they're they're they're crazier they're not really doing too too much you know so but there's you do have to be careful with that I think we've learned a lot of ignorance we're dealing with a lot of ignorance in a current when it comes to biological variability right we we don't really understand how a lot of these different things affect people including like just diet and what what what causes depression like how much how much of what we constitute or what we just decide is depression is inflammation poor gut health there's a lot of variables a lot of them marijuana is absolutely one of those variables and again I don't have an issue with it I liked it I loved the stuff but it does it doesn't [ __ ] with me right but I'm also honest and so I see these people were it's pretty obvious to me that something's going on and that marijuana is not a good idea for them and I just think you know like I said in the past I might put myself have been guilty of using this this sort of blanket description of it as being a positive influence and then it's a good thing for people I don't think it's a good thing for everybody no it's definitely not a good thing for everybody and it's definitely not a good thing for the people who have that those genetics that I discussed earlier and you know also to like you know if you you need to have some type of like self awareness like the people who you know don't do well with cannabis you know you you shouldn't have to you to have your friends tell you that you came in like you're not going to work you shoulda got yourself like but that's hard for people yeah it's one of the most difficult things for people to do is itself of self-assess yeah you know to be objective you know and and it's a I've obviously I've heard from a lot of people who used heavily and seen other people who've used heavily in last month and I think it's very interesting why people continue to use when they're getting paranoid and and you know the the most cogent argument and again I'm I'm not it you know you've smoked a handful of times in college and Afrikaans I usually don't think I'd be comfortable using high THC cannabis now knowing what I know but anyway so the people the most got some right I'm gonna get hot-boxed I'll give you the shitty law on the ban the most cogent argument I thought was so interesting this guy's well you know my friends I talk to them they say I'm I'm paranoid now but I'm gonna smoke through it I'm gonna smoke so much that I'm almost comfortable being paranoid and I think that's a dangerous thing to do to your mind because you're you're sort of counting on being able to step back from that and stop using yeah that's a that's a silly way of looking at", "2jGqTiVuyHg": "on may 31 2019 illinois voted to legalize cannabis for adult use the state became the 11th state to allow the use of recreational marijuana but the first state to do it legislatively hello i'm tom an attorney at the law firm collateral base but you can find me by googling cannabis lawyer and going to my blog cannabisindustrywarrior.com an online resource for all things legal cannabis like today we're going to talk all about illinois's new legal cannabis law the law is called the cannabis regulation and tax act the crta in illinois or the curta in new york's pronunciation the crta states the general assembly finds and declares that the use of cannabis should be legal for persons 21 years of age or older what a great declaration let's dig into it who is allowed to sell marijuana in the beginning only licensed dispensaries will be allowed to sell medical marijuana when the bill become law in january of 2020. more licenses 75 dispensary licenses will be granted in the middle of 2020 and in 2021 another 110 dispensaries are earmarked to be granted however it will still be up to the municipality and county governments to say what businesses can operate in their jurisdictions and where speaking of where where can you smoke cannabis in illinois according to the new law cannabis smoking will be allowed at home and within the marijuana's seller's premises if they have an on-premises certification which may end up being like a liquor license and we have yet to see that fare out springfield illinois was going to be the first public consumption lounge in illinois but then kobit happened and since then well lots of things have changed however smoking marijuana will still always be prohibited in the following areas for example public areas such as streets and parks in motor vehicles whether personal or otherwise near police officers or close to school bus drivers while they are still on duty within a school setting however exemptions may be made for medical marijuana close to anyone who is under the age of 21 stay away from people under 21 when consuming your cannabis legally while smoking marijuana in the confines of your own homes allowed property owners have the right to prohibit it on their premises so check your lease colleges and universities will also be allowed to prohibit weed smoking within their institutions too bad how much cannabis can someone possess according to the crta residents of illinois may be allowed to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis flour five grams of cannabis concentrates and 500 milligrams of cannabis infused products which would be like five can chocolate bars which each bar containing 100 milligrams as that is the maximum amount of milligrams and edible may have and then it would have to be comprised with 10 or more smaller parts cannabis infused products include edibles but also tinctures and topicals taxation for illinois cannabis a sales tax will be applied for all marijuana products for instance products whose thc is less than 35 will have a sales tax of 10 edibles and candy infused products will be taxed at 20 products with a thc concentration over 35 percent basically just concentrate will have a sales tax of approximately 25 aside from these sales tax a 7 gross tax will be imposed on the marijuana sold by growers to dispensary it's called a cannabis cultivation privilege tax and it's highly likely at the end of the day the cost of all these taxes will be passed on to the consumer which is a very important calculus in suppressing the black market in any state the higher the taxes the higher the price of legal cannabis the more likely somebody might divert from the legitimate channels and go to black market channels and where will the marijuana for sale come from in illinois well currently there's 20 marijuana cultivation licenses in illinois and at the beginning of january 2020 these are the only facilities that will be allowed to grow marijuana for that year however this fall there will be 40 craft growers that will be allowed to operate up to 5 000 square feet of flowering space that they might be able to grow that to 14 000 square feet don't forget to click the likes and subscribes and you'll see one of our most popular videos about craft grows speaking of craft grows in 2021 60 more craft grow licenses are up for grabs in illinois can you grow marijuana in illinois marijuana cultivation will be legal for those like me and maybe you who have medical marijuana cards patients will be permitted to grow five cannabis plants at any given time however there are certain restrictions for complying with your home grow first it has to be in your residence for example if you own the residence then it's okay if you don't own the residence and you lease you must kind of check with your landlord and get their approval finally you are not allowed to have five plants per patient but only per household so if you and your significant other both have your medical marijuana cards you're only allowed five plants and it must be grown in an enclosed locked place that you keep free from children under 21 and that is not visible from the street sometimes we get questions can i grow my medical cannabis home grow in a greenhouse perhaps if that greenhouse is not visible from the public streets and it counts as an enclosed locked space the statute under article 10 for personal use actually goes into great amounts of detail as to what people may grow cannabis for personal use hint medical patients at their primary residence plus you also need to be a resident of the state of illinois to be able to grow weed at home according to the law though this is only residing in the state of illinois for 30 days therefore if you're a medical patient from out of state and you decide to move to illinois so that you can get your medical card and grow your own medicine by the time you get your medical card after about 30 days you can start growing your own medicine where do you get marijuana seeds well again i've done a video on this and i tried to be as compliant with youtube's regulations for example you and everybody at home that you show this to should always comply with their state's laws and respect the marijuana plant and advocate for legislative action at the federal level to end schedule 1 substance classification of marijuana it should also be retitled cannabis so check out that video up there on how to find legal cannabis seeds online the only people that are allowed to sell marijuana seeds in illinois are going to be the dispensaries it's still illegal for people to sell marijuana seeds many people confuse this many people think they can give them away or their souvenirs be careful always follow your laws speaking of that let's get back to cannabis use and possession by people under 21. according to the new law possession of cannabis by anybody under 21 is still a criminal offense just like underage drinking punishment for such offenses will depend on the circumstances at hand and may include revocation of a driver's license if the person is driving vehicle at the time they committed the offense a fine of not less than 500 if a parent or guardian allows anyone in their possession to use cannabis jail if there are other crimes that have been committed while under the influence of marijuana while you are required to produce identifications to verify your age when buying marijuana products your personal information will be protected for privacy purposes the sellers will not be required to record your personal information if they do they will need to first get your consent now that this bill has become a law those who want to take marijuana for recreational or medical purposes will have a much easier time getting the cannabis products they want or need they will also get a value for their money because all business transactions will be done in accordance with the law stay compliant license holders however those below the ages of 21 must watch out and not use cannabis because it is still illegal for them and may land them into trouble with law enforcement officers and none of our subscribers want that that is a brief summation of the illinois weed laws thank you so much for tuning in to another episode of cannabis legalization news and i will see you wednesdays at 2 p.m and then also on sundays please do tune in for our cannabis congregation where we talk with activists about the movement if you have any questions hit me up at cannabisindustrylawyer.com until next time", "BzE0YPXhj3Y": "so if you click this video it's probably because you want to learn how to make some edibles and you want to make some really easy to do recipes at home edibles which is a good thing because that's what we're gonna do in this video I'm going to teach you the five most easiest things to make at home with edibles and cannabis my name is Judy Shekar and you're watching puff puff toast let's start off with number one cannabutter one of the most common things to make with cannabis it's super easy to make all you need to do is melt some butter and as you're melting the butter you add a gram of ground cannabis into that butter and you keep melting it melting and melting it until it's nicely infused with the cannabis and voila you have cannabutter super easy super simple and a lot of people use it the second thing that you can make at home is cannabis tea using the can of butter which is interesting because I actually wouldn't expect putting butter in teeth but a lot of people do and apparently this tastes really good so all you do is brew your favorite tea and a teaspoon of that can of butter into your tea and it's this blend of something really delicious warm and nice the third thing that we're going to talk about on how to do our Keith's cookies so Keith is basically the extra powder that comes off of the cannabis bud or when you ground cannabis any leftover powder that happens all of that can actually be used to make keep cookies and and they're really easy to make all you do is you get that left over ground Keith add in some cookie dough bake it and boom you've got Keith's cookie super easy super simple very very delicious apparently number four is I want to tell you how to make pot brownies okay so super easy again but one thing that you want to make sure that you want to have is a brownie mix that uses foil because what you're gonna do is you're gonna heat the oil up and as you're heating oil you're gonna add the ground cannabis to it and then you're gonna mix that oil into a brownie mix and then you basically bake it and you have pot brownies the last thing that I want to teach you how to make is called a firecracker very very very easy all you need are graham crackers peanut butter and cannabis powder so ground cannabis call you to as you spread some peanut butter on the ground cracker add some of the ground cannabis on top of it slap on another peanut butter spread ground cracker on top to make a sandwich cover it in foil put it in the oven for 30 minutes and then you've got this amazing sort of peanut butter brownie cracker sandwich with cannabis so those are the top five really easy ways to make cannabis edibles at home however I'm sure there's more out there and if there is let us know in the comments below let us know what do you make it home with cannabis that's all for me my name is Trudy Shekar and you're watching puff-puff post", "vLm9VAXFl6I": "and so I'd still take my life in it a fruit roll-up what's up guys welcome back today I have yet another gummy video for you guys and I'm very excited about this one because I think it's going to make a lot of people's lives a lot easier and it is going to be delicious today we're going to be doing a little experiment making gummies out of two ingredients store-bought gummy bears tincture or coconut oil so I just bought some gummies from bulk barn any gummies are fine and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to melt these down and I'm gonna add to some of them tincture and to some of them coconut oil and we're gonna see how they're going to turn out I think the ones with tincture will turn out amazing the coconut oil ones I'm not so sure about so let's try it out and see how it goes PS these are like the best gummies ever they're the Albanese brand you can buy them at a lot of places and they're so good they have like the best flavors the green ones and the white ones are my favorite so I'm actually not going to use them for this recipe so I'm probably gonna eat them while I'm melting them first step is to sort your gummies you don't have to smoke them if you don't want to but I want all my colors to be separate all right let's do this so I separated my gummies into yellow and orange purple and then my favorite ones just to eat while I'm doing this and we're gonna melt them and then add in our ginger and coconut oil and see how it goes I have no idea how long it's going to take us to microwave them so I'm going to start with like 15 second intervals and just check on them and then we'll find out how long it takes to melt them without over putting them I don't know so start with these great ones here there's a total of 13 gummy bears in here and they're just regular sized right there I mean they're a little bit bigger than like kuriboh gummy bears um but they're pretty standard so I was going bears and you guys can even see that okay so I'm gonna check on them in about 15 seconds and see how warmed up and melted they are so that's 20 seconds and they're starting to melt but they still need a little bit more so I put it in there for another 10 seconds okay so this is a total of 30 seconds pretty much melted and good to go I'm gonna add my tincture into here for this amount of gummies I'm going to do 1/2 a teaspoon of tincture so it's just room temperature you don't want to have it like really cold or frozen because it will affect the heat from the gummy so we'll just put that half a teaspoon in so there it is and let's see how well this stirrer is in if it doesn't stir it hopefully you guys can see that can you oh you guys can't even see that there we go so hopefully that stirs in well and if it doesn't we are going to add some lesson and lecithin into this to help combine it but I think that there's enough things and the gummy bears to start with that we shouldn't have any issues getting this to emulsify or combine or whatever you want to call it so that looks pretty good and then we're just gonna put these into a mold the same way you would with homemade gummies and let them sit and we will move on to our next batch so this is quite a bit thicker then they're coming mixtures so it seems like it's kind of hard for the little syringe to pull it up so that's one a little bit of an issue here so let's see yeah see we can't really soak it up so our options would be to microwave it more so it gets more liquidy or to add more liquid but I do not want to add more liquid so I am going to put it in the microwave for another 10 seconds okay so that was another ten seconds for a total of 30 are sorry a total of 40 seconds and I think they should be good enough to be able to put into our molds so I have about half in the mold then it's being a little bit trickier to put in that I thought it was going to be I'm having some trouble like getting the the dropper to like suction it up and that's because it is really thick so again I'm going to put it into the microwave for another 10 seconds and warm it up some more now if you had a lot more going there zero melting I'm like I did it this won't be as much of an issue because the heat will contain itself because there's a larger amount because there's such a small amount that's getting cooled off quicker and thickening faster and also like my dropper is like has a limited stuff to suck up so that won't be if you're doing a larger amount but it's not hurting anything by putting it in the microwave for just like 10-15 second intervals you just have to make sure you work kind of fast so let's throw that back in okay so looks a little different now I guess it just melted a lot more it's a lot more liquidy and put these interim moles okay so I put the purple ones into a molds now let's try some more but with the coconut oil let's do the yellow ones one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so we'll do thirteen of them just like we did last time and then we're gonna microwave this I'm going to start it with 40 seconds okay here's our 40 seconds melted they're nice and liquidy still might be a bit of an issue with the syringe dropper thing but if you have like one of those bottles you can dispense them with that'll be like way easier but let's add in the coconut oil so I hope you know what nut oil is what I expect to be the most difficult but I think that there's already less lecithin in the gummy bears so the oil should be able to emulsify pretty good but we'll find out so let's have it half a teaspoon of coconut oil okay we got our half teaspoon let's mix that in so so far it's actually mixing in really well that's all something I do for gummy bears with tincture instead of coconut oil because they I think they taste better but I know that most people you should just have coconut oil on hand the texture is a little bit different with the coconut oil I'm going to put that back in the microwave for another like 15 seconds alright so I did another 10 seconds I thought 15 might be too much all right now let's put these in their molds it looks like it's a lot harder using these so I'm gonna use one of my squeeze bottles which will be a lot you hear well I guess I should say hopefully it will be a lot easier you can see that like the coconut oil's making it like that doesn't like stick to the sides of the bottle that much I'm actually very surprised how well the cup oil mixed in oh my god that's so hot oh god it burns okay so don't touch hot melted candy because it is really hot and it hurts okay and this is cooled off a bit now that I've changed the bottle so hopefully it comes out okay if not I'll put it until I got a hot bowl of water or something look at all that gelatin or gummies sitting on the top there and I gotta get him down I'm just gonna leave this to sit upwards to get this to come down guys it's just it's it's too sticky this didn't really work that well either I'm gonna take the metal cap off and I'm gonna put it in the microwave just like this hopefully that works okay I did it ten seconds in the microwave it still doesn't look like it's gonna come out like this No okay this is not working either see another way that we can get this into the mold I mean like it's still gonna taste delicious I'm probably gonna have to eat a lot of this like just peel out of the bowl and stuff okay my plan was to cut a hole and squish this through but I don't think that's gonna happen well let's let's try see oh it's working okay I mean it's a little hardened now Oh No okay this is not working very well okay so the melting of the gummy bears and adding coconut oil didn't work very well I don't know why it seems like it almost got like harder like I now I'm just wondering if I like I microwaved it too many times like I don't know it just it won't come out really it's too thick to come out of anything so I'm gonna make another batch with the tincture just to test that out um again and see it's like it's definitely going to work or if it's user error and I mean it still I'd still take my get it a fruit roll-up it still tastes good if you wanted to you just melt them and then I mean this is really good little easy to get through oh look but you could just melt it and put it onto like parchment paper or silicone and peel it off after and just cut it into strips it's like the same thing it just won't be in the molds the actual gummy product mixed really well - coconut oil it tastes amazing of course you just they just happen to make sure it's pretty making the mold so still work very good I'll be snacking on this later okay let's do some more with the orange gummies and let's put some more tincture and then this time 1112 where do we do 13 or 12 I remember 30 I think and you don't have to do 13 so it's just the number I'm doing I don't know just - just what it is I'm doing and yeah you can just use whatever amount you want obviously you're really good okay let's microwave this you've got 30 seconds we're gonna do double the tincture so one teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon see this looks like it might have been too much tincture too much liquid and they might not set but you could always add more gelatin but I have a feeling these will set they'll just be a lot softer but if you want them to be able to firmer you could just add a sprinkle of gelatin a little more liquidy consistency as will definitely be easier to put into our moulds hopefully this one works a bit better I think it will we just got to act fast I mean using a dropper I probably would've been fine I don't know why decided to use this because it's such a small amount coming out already there we go oh yeah that's perfect oh and also just FYI if you buy these bottles which are really great for gummy making when you're making larger amounts not like this much died by making the tape it comes with like this I don't know if you can see that it's really really small and the gummy mixture is usually too thick to come out so I just put a different tip that's a little bit wider on there to make sure it can get through this was really difficult to use with such a small amount that I had so use a dropper if you have one this is usually my go-to option to squeeze things into molds but because there is such little amount when I squeeze it it's not really doing anything whereas if there was like this much gummy make sure when I squeeze it the pressure would push it out but because I made such a small amount obviously it's gonna be a little bit trickier I will just eat this out of the bottle later I'm just going to put the gummies that I need into the fridge probably for like 20 minutes alright guys I'm back but it hasn't been 20 minutes it's been two days so I took the gummies Oh after 20 minutes and they were not nearly hard enough I couldn't even really get them out of their molds so I put them in the freezer for a little bit like about half an hour and once they were hard enough I popped them all out of their molds and just left them on some parchment paper but they still were a little bit too squishy and too like corn syrupy so I left them out for a day and they were still a little bit too squishy Tomo for another day which is where we are now so it's been two days and they are perfect so if you guys make these just leave them out on a piece of parchment paper for a couple days depending on how humid it is wherever you live it might be a little bit different like it's not very humid where I live at all um so they dry up pretty quick but if you live somewhere very humid they might take a lot longer to dry or they might even not work for you in the first place so I'll show you what they look like so both the purple and the orange ones turned out very well you can see they're sticky obviously because they are sticking to my fingers so they are a little bit stickier than like a regular gummy but they're they don't really stick together in the bag because I've let them dry out for a few days so the purple ones had half a teaspoon of tincture in them and the orange ones had double that amount so they had one teaspoon of tincture and I thought they were gonna have a lot of issues but they're totally fine yeah they turned out very well and they taste just like the gummies did before I remoulded them last thing just to clarify um my gummies with the coconut oil didn't turn out only the ones with the tincture worked for me I don't know why the coconut oil ones didn't work if you guys know why please let me know because I'm very curious so yeah guys these turned out fantastic I'm super impressed with the results I definitely am gonna use this method many times in the future um going forward what I would do is for every 10 dummies I would do half a teaspoon of tincture so you can just multiply that by however many you want to make in total but based on what I've seen with these with half a teaspoon and the regular teaspoon they both turned out so you couldn't probably get away with using a little bit more but if you're looking for a starting point I would go with ten nine bears and half a teaspoon all right please let me know if you guys try this out I hope you enjoyed the video and let me know if there's any videos you would like to see I hope you guys enjoyed this video please

take more risks and spend more time with our friends and less with our family these behaviors have developed through evolution to make sure we push ourselves so that we learn to become independent from our parents by putting ourselves in new and challenging situations different parts of our brain learn to work together forming brain circuits that can communicate with each other rapidly to help us respond in different ways ensuring that our brain is wide in the right way during the teenage years with strong and healthy brain circuits is critical to our future and how we get the most out of life 3 the most important circuits that are developing during this period are those involved in learning and memory motivation and mood learning in memory circuits control our ability to receive store and recall information our motivation circuit is supported by an inbuilt reward system that helps us to decide if something is important and whether we should do something to get it our mood is shaped by emotional circuits that interpret how we experience and react to different situations and interactions making sure these particular circuits wire in the right way during our teenage years is the brain zone occupational health and safety team the endocannabinoid system the endocannabinoid system is a complex and delicate brain system which helps to fine-tune communication within these circuits ensuring the wiring is assembled correctly damaged cells are repaired and the right connections are strengthened for the future when looking into the effect of cannabis on the brain scientists found that we naturally produce a brain chemical called an and amide that is similar to cannabis concentrations of an and amide are delicately calibrated for it to accomplish its critical role within the endocannabinoid system this is why if we add cannabis into the brain it causes the endocannabinoid system to become flooded with cannabis chemicals it's a bit like dumping a bucket of salt on your chips instead of a pinch or like stadium speakers being plugged into your iPod constantly disrupting the endocannabinoid system with cannabis impacts how your brain develops and in particular how the mood motivation and learning and memory circuits get wired short-term memory loss is a common characteristic of long-term heavy cannabis use because when you use cannabis less information gets saved as memories this is why it's harder to learn and remember new information which can lead to significant drops in school grades cannabis can reduce your ability to focus attention to organize yourself and make decisions not just when you're using cannabis but for weeks afterwards cannabis use can also lead to loss of motivation heavy users can feel detached and disinterested in things they used to like such as sports hobbies and catching up with friends it can also lead to low self confidence that turn affects your mood making it more difficult to manage everyday stresses worries and frustrations which can result in prolonged low mood anxiety and depression while these effects are commonly experienced by people who use cannabis regularly new research suggests that these effects are worse and more permanent for people who start using cannabis while their brain is still developing this is because the endocannabinoid system plays a central role in the development of your neural circuitry during the teenage years the developing brain has a pretty good blueprint to work off but our experiences and interactions with the outside world also help to shape these neural circuits that we will rely on as adults your teenage years are an adventure that sets you up for life enjoy the ride and look up your brain it's the only one you've got", "IPP0OFjnEbI": "in today's video i want to talk to you guys about a popular drug combo that often goes south and it goes south fast a lot of people who smoke cannabis in their everyday lives think that if they're trying a new substance like say lsd for the first time that if they take a few tokes of weed during their come up it's going to help relax them and ease them into the experience unfortunately more often than not the opposite happens and instead the weed catapults them into a terrifying nightmare of a trip i personally have experience having a nightmare of a trip from smoking weed during the come-up and this is going to be quite the terror tale actually seems most of my terror tales of bad acid trips involve mixing substances you think i would have learned my lesson but um nope apparently i'm very hard-headed and not in the sense that it means i can take a lot of substances hard-headed in the sense that i'm just a [ __ ] numb skull as always this is a story from my past so don't do anything that you hear me talk about in this video i don't promote the use of illegal or legal substances but if you are going to take a drug like let's say lsd make sure that you always test your tabs before consuming it there are a lot of imposter substances going around that dealers disguise as acid but they're actually harmful drugs i recently put out a video called testing lsd so if you want more information on how to test your tabs to make sure they're safe then follow the link and check out that video there so this story takes place about a year and a half ago and i was on a camping trip with my girlfriend i was the only one who was going to be tripping i had a very important life decision to make and of course i thought i would consult with my personal gods which at the time were the acid gods and i thought it would give me some new insight into my problem and will help me just see things from a new perspective and come to a new conclusion i only intended to consume about 100 micrograms of lsd but what i didn't take into consideration was that i rolled for myself a joint that was probably three to four times larger than my average joint and i should tell you guys that i have a very low tolerance to weed it really doesn't take much to get me high i didn't realize that combining that much cannabis with what i thought was a low dose of lsd was going to create an exceedingly intense experience i didn't realize that the two drugs were going to potentiate each other i remember being in the tent with my girlfriend and i remember as the acid was starting to come on i was having very intense closed eye hallucinations and i don't even want to call them like closed-eyed visuals like they were full delirious hallucinations i was in my mind experiencing an alternate reality than what was actually going on in my mind me and my girlfriend were having this full-blown conv and during this conversation she was a [ __ ] i i couldn't separate what i was imagining from what was really happening and i started to imagine her being just this terrible person and i was just getting really hurt by her when in reality i think all that was going on was she was just trying to get me to calm down because i was freaking out because i was having some kind of a weird delirious ego death type experience i remember starting to just completely lose touch with reality and lose touch with who she was i completely forgot that she was my girlfriend i completely forgot everything about her i didn't know what her name was i had no memories of her all that i knew was i was trapped alone in this tent with this person she was in a bad mood and she wasn't happy that i was waking her up so she was being very hostile towards me and her hostility translated during my trip into her being like a bad guy like i was in some kind of a really negative like life-threatening situation and i had to under any circumstance get away from her so i remember going to uh the zipper and to go outside and she's trying to stop me she's grabbing my arm and she's like adam what are you doing stay in the tent with me like don't go outside and i were looking at her and being like no no i just need to pee i need to pee but meanwhile in my head i'm thinking hey adam you don't know who this person is she's obviously kidnapped you you need to lie to her and tell her that you're going to pee but really what you're going to do is run and the more she was trying to stop me from getting out of the tent the more scared i was getting because she knew that i was really freaking out so she just didn't want me to leave because i guess she anticipated that my behavior was going to be exceedingly erratic and i remember just grabbing the zipper and looking at her and just being like listen if you don't let me go i'm going to run i will run i'm running that's it i'm running now we were at a campground a provincial park campground and they don't really have like any lights like when you leave your tent if you don't have a flashlight it's pitch black and the visuals were coming on pretty intense i remember i was just completely blind it was like someone blindfolded me and i was just running uh in pitch black darkness i'm running through the woods now i remember all of a sudden like my vision starts to kick in a little bit but all i can really do is i've got enough vision to dodge the trees like i'm not even running through the campground i fully just ran into the forest i kept getting these weird visualizations of what i perceived to be rapists in the woods it was like i'd look and i'd see a tree and then there would be like a figure would like dart out look at look at me and then dart back behind the tree and it was happening a lot like the woods was filled with these evil rapists i i don't know why they were rapists but that that is where my mind was going at the time i thought that like i was on some kind of a crazy prison planet and everywhere around me was a rapist like none of this makes sense i was so delirious as i'm running through the woods i'm starting to remember that hey i'm not alone there's someone out here with me and i'm starting to get some flashbacks and some images of my girlfriend and i remember that my girlfriend was out here but at this point i couldn't remember that i had left her i convinced myself that i needed to find her but at the same time i remembered running into a car and i think because i remember just like smacking into a car i started to convince myself that um i had a car accident and the next thing i know i'm back in the nightmare trip if you guys have seen my video i have a video out called nightmare trip and during this trip i talk about feeling as though i was dead and i was looking for my body it was like deja vu i was pulled right back into that trip and i thought that i was again some kind of a spirit or something and i had to find my body and i was getting these flashback images of a car accident that i had when i was younger when i was about 18 i drove right into a tree and it's actually a miracle that i'm alive but i was having these flashbacks to that event as if i actually did die when i hit that tree and i was convincing myself that my whole life since hitting that tree has just been a dream and nothing's been real this drug was showing me that i need to figure out a way to get out of this reoccurring dream and just accept that i died like 10 years ago it was quite terrifying because when you're in that state and you're so suggestible even to your own crazy notions you you can convince yourself of some pretty wild things i was ready to accept that i died 10 years ago and my entire life was just a complete fallacy up to that point luckily i saw people in the distance i saw a fire and behind them was a car and as i'm running through the woods i remember thinking that's it that's it that's my car and i thought i was running towards my car accident and i thought that as soon as i joined with my dead body that was clearly going to be slumped over the steering wheel and full of blood that once i joined with that body and saw with my own spirit eyes that i had actually died 10 years ago then you know i'll ascend into the light and i'll go on to whatever the next dimension is keep in mind that i'm running towards another person's campground like these are people i don't know all that i remember is popping out of the woods and you know like i scared the [ __ ] out of them they were like holding their hearts it was these two guys drinking beers and they're just like oh my god and i'm like hey it was like i just snapped right out of my trance of believing that i was finding my dead body slumped over a steering wheel and now i'm back in to find my girlfriend mode and i'm back in the trance earlier where i thought that she was cheating on me i'm thinking oh my god here's the guys these are the two guys that my girlfriend is sleeping with or she's sleeping with one of them one of these guys is hiding her and i have to figure out which one is hiding her think of what this looks like from their perspective all of a sudden this lunatic looking guy just leaps out of the woods and enters their campground like that's not something you see every day when you go camping with your buddy i proceed to just like stop and i'm catching my breath and they're like oh my god we thought you were a deer or something and i was like oh no sorry i was just i was lost in the woods i have no idea where i am right now and they're just like looking at me like you okay buddy like is everything all right here like can we help you with something and i just blurted out i'm tripping hard right now i'm just like i'm really tripping out i think i took too much psychedelics and then they just kind of laughed and like oh oh okay okay that makes sense then the next thing that comes into my mouth is have you seen jasmine i'm looking at them with these eyes like i know you're hiding her from me i targeted this one guy in particular there was a bigger one and a shorter one i was targeting the shorter guy and he's like jasmine no i don't know who you're talking about i was like oh okay well i've lost my girlfriend and i can't find her so i was just running through the woods looking for her and they're just like oh is she on like psychedelics too i didn't tell them exactly what i was on i think they said are you on mushrooms and i just said yes just to make it simple so they're like oh is she on mushrooms too and i'm like no no she's sober i just i can't find her and i don't know where she went she disappeared and like oh oh that sucks and i was like yeah do you think you guys could uh help me find her and they're like yeah i guess so and i was like well maybe you could just help me walk back to my campground because i have no idea where i am in this campsite i don't have a frat flashlight and yeah i don't know where anything is i had left my phone back in the tent so i pretty much i had nothing on me they're being really nice they're being super chill and super down and one of the guys cracks open a beer and he hands it to me and he's like here dude you look like you need a beer just you know just try to calm down it's okay we're gonna help you out we'll help you find your girlfriend and i was just like oh okay thank you i was thanking them like a lot i was like thank you guys like i really appreciate this i know you don't know who i am just like thanks i remember asking them does it look like i'm really tripping out and they're like no you don't really look like you're tripping that hard so they grab a couple beers and they're like we're gonna take a beer with us for the road they were obviously drinking all night they were probably pretty drunk or buzzed i can't remember and of course we run into park security now one of the rules of this park is you are not allowed to do acid no that's not it you're you're not allowed to walk around the campground with open alcohol you're gonna have open alcohol at your campsite but you can't walk around with it so i remember this female like park ranger comes over to us and she's like you guys know like you're not allowed to walk around with alcohol right and meanwhile i hadn't actually drank the beer they handed me i was just holding it it was full to the top and as we were walking they had they took two beers each with them when they um had finished their drinks i offered to hold their empty bottles for them so here i am with two empty bottles and one full drink and they've just got one bottle so the park ranger is like laser eye targeting me and i'm just like oh no i didn't know you couldn't and i was like i actually haven't drank anything and she's like uh why do you have so many empty bottles and i was like oh i was holding it for them like oh i'm such a rat i'm writing them out now they're like she looked so confused but i was thinking in my head i was still very delirious at this point i was thinking oh thank goodness she's here for some reason because she was a figure of authority i thought she came to help me and i was convincing myself that these two guys who were being very nice and helping me like they didn't have to go to the way to help me i scared the [ __ ] out of them i was thinking that they were the kidnappers now and they were the bad guys and then she she took all our bottles away i remember being so thankful when she took our bottles away because i was thinking for some reason that the beer bottles were their weapons and when she took their beer bottles away i was like oh their weapons are gone they can't really hurt me anymore and then she charges us she wrote each of us a ticket for one hundred 100 for walking around with open alcohol they were furious the two guys were like they were they were ratting me out they're like this guy came to our tent he said that he was having a bad trip he said that he was really tripping out hard and we're just trying to help him find his girlfriend and now you're giving us a ticket and she turns to me she's like is this true i'm like yeah yeah i'm holding their alcohol this is all theirs none of this alcohol is mine and so they're thinking that i'm like trying to throw them under the bus but i'm just so out of it i don't understand like that we're in some kind of trouble because i think that she's here to help me thankfully my girlfriend shows up apparently she was looking for me she was out with the flashlight and she's like oh my goodness there you are i didn't even get a chance to say thank you to them they were furious i mean they each got fined a hundred dollars for helping a stranger who was tripping out if by the rare chance i don't remember your names you guys are watching this video uh thank you for helping me i really did appreciate it i would love to cover your hundred dollar fines for you i don't know just send me an email so my girlfriend grabs me and we head back to the campsite and for some reason as soon as i saw her i completely sobered up it was like my trip completely ended and i was back and i went straight to sleep mixing these two substances should only be reserved for those who are extremely experienced with the effects of weed because what things like lsd do is their mood enhancers they enhance how you currently feel and cannabis has the potential for a lot of people to put them in sometimes paranoid states so say now you're smoking weed on the come up and you get a very slight amount of paranoia paranoia that you'd normally just be able to ignore but because you're on the lsd as well which enhances how you feel it can just make that paranoia get infinitely multiplied to the point where you just start freaking the [ __ ] out anyway that concludes my story i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you haven't already be sure to subscribe to my channel for weekly psychedelic related content if you did enjoy this video be sure to leave a like and i have to say a massive thank you to all of my supporters who are pledging to me on patreon you guys are all

so", "sQPCOT2_lAQ": "I blog on Berber very welcome back to other installment of edutainment the place you are laughing being entertained but most importantly where you're learning something that you apply it to your own personal life and make it better how am i doing today I'm doing more sing less and keeping that same energy no cap so had a young lady a woman message me about her drug test situation so she's in the process of getting into the military and she was talking about how detoxing business isn't necessarily the issue but if you're actually smoking weed while she trying to detox to see for my body and pass the drug test so when it comes to the quitting leave so that you can actually detox and not have not no longer have heat in your system it's a couple components right you know how to detox ideally you've seen some of my past videos intermittent fasting at least 16 eighth fasting to eating our window income laughs of water Gandhi ideally working outs but not 24 hours on to your actual drug test and also incorporating more movements throughout your day the goal each day I would say based on my research based on my videos are watched get about 10,000 steps in each day this will help you not be so sedative right so that you work a knob of three to four times out of the week but each day you are still getting about 10,000 steps which for further help your lymphatic system transfer toxins out of your body and help you to get the necessary nutrients to various various areas of your body because you have the lymphatic system and we also have the circulatory system right you know if the thing about pumping your hearts you don't think about blood going from your veins to other everybody but the lymphatic system actually needs you to be active to move in order to get the various nutrients and toxins out of your body in a coherent time period so that's that part but as far as quitting really concerned right she was saying how because she can't quote-unquote smoke weed or she doesn't want to smoke weed it makes your brain actually you want to smoke anymore but you have to wait okay don't eat it I'll be right back okay don't touch it wait for me to come back don't eat it okay yeah I thought I'd told you to wait but is it good why did you even it don't know but was it good what I mentioned this in the past but I just wanted to make sure that more people are aware do focus on what you don't wants focused on the outcome that you actually want okay anytime the thought to smoke arises or pops up into your head at cravings what is your is your thought process pop pop your thought process that should be what do I want out of this why Mike why am i quitting me right the more pregnant is to you the more personal it is to you the more likely you are to follow through and not do that for get me into your craving for example it's important for you to take a take inventory of when you usually smoke will you usually I'm awake and Baker were usually smoking to fall asleep or were you smoking throughout the day right once you know the time means that you that you tend to smoke the next process should be what can I do that time now instead of waking and baking for the first three minutes everyday or as soon as you wake up you go for a walk 30 minutes don't just focus on the outcome that you don't want but creates new habits and focus on the outcome that you do want right the craving hits you okay I'd rather go for a walk I'd rather save money I'd rather save money second build an emergency fund so I can buy a house so I can have my own apartment I've ever seen money so that I can quit my job and be okay for a couple months while I look for a better job I'd rather be healthy and go work out I'd rather be healthy how have the desire to go for a walk stuff like that that's what you want to be focusing your mind on not on you want to focus your mind on the outcome that you want but we're also creating new habits creating a new no association between a certain time period of the day and an activity so in the evening if you usually smoking what can you do now because not your time we hands now the hour two hours 30 minutes that you would have been smoking what are you doing through time now right are you reading a book are you creating content for your own YouTube channel might make some money so carrying your own bag are you spending that time with your kids 30 minutes of playing with your kids or playing video games it doesn't have to be this is ugly talking but just playing video games instead right but essentially you're creating new habits or creating a new activity for yourself that coincides with the time that you used to smoke weed right so focus on the outcome that she wants and create new activities for yourself that can further change your normal association to marijuana right so this is something to think about when you are trying to detox to also new pass the drug test we know about the detox methods but I mean that's all gonna be very useful if you are relapsing throughout your whole seven-day 14 days leading up down to your drug test and like I said time and time again if you want to know whether or not you are actually addicted to marijuana or you're smoking too much you go for a week one week tolerance breaking you can go for a full week and not experience withdrawal symptoms like insomnia my sweats cravings stuff like that sure I guess you would never really addicted but if you go through the seven days either you can't make it the seven days or you experience withdrawal symptoms throughout those seven days you were smoking it a bit too much and let's even go further you can go thirty days without smoking marijuana you will be able to have a greater perspective on whether or not marijuana is the thing that was holding you back in life or holding you back from making more money holding you back from being healthier or holding you back from having the amount of money in your bank account that she would like right 30 days without weed will give you that perspective as to know what are the things that what other things are holding me back as opposed to me being the person that blames things on weed right I'm not saying it is bad I've never said this but bad I never say what is the issue but it can be one of the issues that you no longer need it in your life if you can't handle smoking it eating it responsibly no Sam wah-wah thanks feature will I be here to find some good lighting it is as you can see is evening dark wouldn't be able to see me in regular conditions um BIA so what I want to say was there is also important that you have consequences for when you when where if you do relapse what is the consequence a lot of us just human psychology we tend to avoid pain more than we seek pleasure if you compare two situations right someone says a meeting tomorrow and I'll give you a thousand dollars does that or if you don't mean it tomorrow I'll kill your mom I'm sure I thought it still sounds like a lot but the urgency to kill your mom or to have some type of pain is greater so for example I need time IV laps tell yourself I'm gonna get my friend $20 anytime I smoke weed I don't give him $30 whatever it is or anytime I smoke weed I will wash all the dishes in the house for that night so for that week I mean is when you alright thinking about your decision to smoke again you're weighing the pleasure of that high and the pain of doing a chore for a week or I don't know giving your friend $30 every time you smoke right so now you have a choice and a consequence as opposed to just a choice with no consequence and when you think about it for a lot of people even living life through your weed magnifying glass for a couple years now right every single day even smoking with the other day the smoking I have been able to really see life from from the perspective of an on/off a little bit so [Music] the opportunities that you missed out on the inability to stick to your commitments cuz we just like and you can get that high moment just like and like a mini organism this isn't one of the reasons why people get addicted to pornography right you get high you you are the pukes you think you are the person having sex with all of these this woman like one guy gangbang two girls on one guy one guy in two girls same thing or whatever it is right and you feel like you are that guy so you have no desire or need to go on approach girls in person or going to talk to cause a person and likewise marijuana when you do too much makes you feel like you've already reached a pinnacle of life you're really making amount of money that you want you already have a body that you want you're you have business that you want and like what is the point what is the use quote unquote right oh do anymore or putting down the blunt and Ashley isn't doing more work so nothing quick pro tip is to definitely try and push your first if you don't have a detox test or you don't not trying detox for a drug test my goal my op my recommendation is to actually push your first smoke session quote-unquote later once a day right if you are smoking multiple times a day try and reduce it to once or twice and then you gradually take it away right so be busy be as busy as you possibly can in the morning afternoon and then have a smoke session the evening this not only will help you save more money but it will gradually break that Noll Association that you create to marijuana nonsense so big ups all the mandem all the Gotham boys girls bro the trying to detox for a drug test either for government job military whatever it is big ugly is excess passing much love god bless peace enjoy almost number does it feed you don't water it and too much everything good thing it's good for nothing how are you doing today hopefully you're doing more thing less and keeping that same energy no cat sup the scripts I'm

and they talk about um smoking weed and if it's gonna hurt uh bodybuilding outcomes so here they talk about their stance on it and i'll kind of interject after and give my opinion let's see thoughts on bodybuilders that smoke weed have you ever had have you ever and are you against weed and what's your opinion on it i smoke weed every day do you really before bed only at night yeah i didn't know that yeah i did that for a little while just to cut like i had some back pain i didn't want to take a bunch of advil yeah i actually started eating gummy bears just to kind of kill the pain and pass out yeah no i just like i'll do like usually before my like fifth or sixth meal and have my meal and i eat it in two milliseconds and i relax on the couch for a bit and have my last nail go to bed yeah i couldn't do it could you do it regularly like just sitting around no i can't do it during the day yeah 0 if i have like i couldn't leave the house high there's no way yeah okay we're the same then that way i think it's only i know usually when melissa's already gone to bed and i'm like the only person a week and i'm just like chilling and eating my food like watching you know netflix or whatever like i'd like to be in solitude for that usually yeah and she makes fun of me when i'm high too so yes it's better yeah i can't handle that yeah um okay so we're not against weed and we don't think it's harmful to bodybuilding at all so that's cool yeah tons of guys do it so they basically talk about how ian uses it every single night and he thinks there is no um deleterious outcomes on bodybuilding results whatsoever and he knows lots of guys who do it and you know how negligible is it you know for i just kind of want to lay out the science as far as giving you a more clear idea because i think there may be a deleterious impact to your bodybuilding results and i'll explain why so typically when you use it like acutely intermittently once in a while you're going to experience benefit from a reduced sleep latency standpoint so that means you're going to fall asleep easier quicker like when you actually lie down put your head on the pillow are you going to get to sleep that's your sleep latency it has seemingly no impact positive or negative on sleep duration with intermittent use however it has a very potent negative effect on rem sleep duration which is the dream sleep stage so if you know rapid eye movement if you know anything about the sleep stages you know i guess the most common ones that are known are just non-ram just straight up nor normal sleep then you have rem and then you have deep and basically rem is a critical component of sleep that is necessary for learning memory consolidation um mood regulation very notably and not being very deprived of rem sleep can lead to a lot of irritability uh mood swings depression and if some research even implies that it may lead help encourage the development of alzheimer's disease so when it comes to bodybuilding outcomes and something i should note too is when you use chronically thc every single day what happens is your body ends up building up a tolerance to it where you're gonna eventually need to use more and more to achieve the same decreased sleep latency and if you stop using it what happens is you have a brutal rebound of insomnia like sleep deprivation where you then are forced to go back to using it just to achieve a normal level of sleep latency that you would have otherwise not had that you would have you would have otherwise had if you were just healthy and not you know using the thc every day to begin with i'm not saying you're unhealthy if you use it by the way i'm just saying that you get to a point where you depend on it so much and you may need to build up your dose too then eventually if you try and get off of it if you're using it every single day you're going to have a probably have a pretty horrific rebound where you sleep like [ __ ] and then it's going to make you have to go back to use the thc in order to achieve like a reasonable sleep latency and get a normal sleep duration again all but while still having that impaired rem sleep so it's like from all aspects unless you're using it very very intermittently here and there it's not good in my opinion for bodybuilding outcomes how how drastic of an impact is this gonna have you know when you actually dig into the literature on rem sleep and how important it is you'll see pretty quick that depriving yourself of that sleep stage is likely not going to be you know negligible in terms of health outcomes as far as how it impacts bodybuilding outcomes if you're getting a sufficient amount of sleep duration and deep sleep with a relative lack of rem sleep it's like you know it plays a lot into your mindset though if you have rem sleep deprivation you start to notice it in your mood how you react to things very blatantly it has a very notable effect on how you react to emotionally to a lot of things in your life and as well as just like basic being able to be intelligent and like retain [ __ ] information in your head there's a lot of things that come from rem sleep that can't just be glossed over it's like oh it's this negligible portion of sleep that doesn't really matter for bodybuilding i think it does matter for bodybuilding and i think that smoking weed every night is going to have a negative effect on your bodybuilding progress so if you're going to incorporate it i would do it sporadically like here and there you know as a recreational thing maybe if you just like want to or you if you think it's gonna benefit you though and you think you're getting better sleep outcomes because of it it's either that you've built up a tolerance to it and you need it or or i should say dependence on it or you're just like misconstruing the decrease in sleep latency as a benefit when in reality if you put on an aura ring it would be interesting to see what was your rem sleep prior to using it and then what's your rem sleep duration when you're smoking weed every single night that would be interesting to see if it's actually impacting you in a negative way or not and i would recommend doing that if you're somebody who plans on using every single night because that is going to be the only way you're going to determine if it's actually having a negative impact on you is if you actually check your sleep metrics yourself so um you know how accurate is an aura ring or a whoop or whatever those things are for checking your metrics i use an aura ring personally you know it's up for interpretation but i think it's at least worth checking and if you're going to be doing this on a regular basis so definitely something to keep note of and in general even if the aura doesn't indicate a significant difference like personally i would just recommend being more you know intermittent with your use rather than using it on a full-time basis every single night i think it is the data in the literature does suggest that it's going to have a negative outcome on your sleep quality in the long run so just keep that in mind thank you guys for watching please like subscribe

might end up updating you guys one last time once I wake up if you enjoy this video drop a like drop a comment down below subscribe to your boy you guys aren't subscribed I'll see you guys soon", "vjpBZ_OCNRs": "[Music] what I like about this product so much is that it's just super easy to use it is really gonna be user friendly for everybody I think even if you've never had any experience with medical marijuana or or with any kind of vaporizer or anything of that nature I was not familiar with concentrates or vaping concentrates when I decided to go with the true leave true stick I wasn't familiar with it so I had a lot of questions and the reason I'm making this is really just so that I can kinda help out some people that might have some of the same questions that I had and couldn't really find the answers to and I'm also just going to kind of give you an overview of what I think about the product overall and just kind of my experience with it and what I think I actually have managed to I've collected all three now of the different strains that you can currently get for the true stick battery there's one Endicott one sativa and one hybrid I have the indica the sativa and the hybrid and I've got to try them out a lot all three of them and I think they're all awesome gonna be a personal preference which one you like the most for me I'm in love with the newest one which is the Durban poison that's their sativa and it is awesome another thing that I was really confused about when I or what I wasn't sure about when I was gonna start vaping with the treu stick with what is it going to taste like is that going to be like I just didn't know what the vapor but actually just like honestly I feel like you just get the nice kind of all the nuances of the strain when you vape it it tastes like a canvas strain and you can definitely tell the difference between each string I love not only the effects that the German poison has and the fact that it's a great daytime weight but it also tastes often it kind of almost have like a zesty kind I was really surprised the first time that I don't think and I wasn't expecting it to taste as good as it does on Nestle for one yeah also it was like I wasn't really ready and I took a big I took a long drag you can take a long drive I said if you want you and I don't recommend that the first couple of hits are missing and just be careful cuz like that's my only thing is it's pretty strong so it definitely does its job and you can definitely feel the vapor so yeah it's an effective product it's great for a number of reasons and I'll play you guys right so there's a few different things about this that I love for me it's the fact that it is such a user-friendly product pretty much easy for everyone to understand and to use and there's really no question about how it works and I'll kind of walk you through it just for fun the Internet has all of the information of course truly has it all on their website ok so anyway so ok basically I was caught off guard with how strong of a hit I took I wasn't expecting it to make me cough at all I was like oh you know I don't know about you guys but I was afraid that I would have to have a tolerance to I think what I'll do it is in this video just kind of talk about the product itself the battery the whole system I think in this video I'll just kind of talk about the battery the system how it works and maybe in a separate video I'll go over the different strains and like I said I have all three right now and I love them all but they're all good for different things and I can kind of talk in detail about each one what if won't taste like etc basically what's so user-friendly about this is that it's just like two pieces you buy two sitting you buy two things you buy your battery and that's gonna be obviously this it's your true stick technically that's what this is called your battery's gonna come in a little simple black box it's also going to come with a charger that goes just like this right into the bottom boom ready to go and then you take your other end which is USB and you just plug it into wherever you want to plug your USB things a cube whatever port I don't care so you charge what you'll notice about it is it's like it's very lightweight don't let the size the weight of this thing fully it can hold a charge forever it's amazing I've gone like two three days not charging it and just I dream about you guys but for me I don't always charge all of my electronics every single day sometimes I forget but it's not a problem with this so that's beautiful the price of the battery is only thirty dollars okay so that's I just like that there's only one button you don't have to like you know change the heat level or whatever let's be honest does anyone not use the highest one anyway when you have options anyway let's talk about the tripod true pods are it look like this when they're out of their packaging it's just a little pod and now this is the newest one that I have right now I bought this yesterday but you'll see it inside that there are some air bubbles okay and that is because this is a very thick product this is not a liquid and you can ask at the store at truly about you know more about the actual true true clear product that's inside of the true pod the true clear in there is actually from what I understand what I was told anyway is that true clear inside of these true pods is the same as the kind that I felt as their oral or edible syringe true which that product is very very thick there's what should have said to make that more clear but I might for comparison eventually it'll get down to let your any other product there's a lot of it so they what kind of funky after you start using it's something you might notice about this if it has the little green band around it on each of the three pods comes with a little rubber cap on it and they also come with a band it's actually helpful for identifying which one is which strains that's cool cuz you cannot if you're if you're organized enough to not lose all the caps like I have you can keep the you know yellow cap on the hybrid the green one is a TV it also comes with one on this and to the great one just to cover that and the magnetic and of the okay yeah so that's pretty cool so yeah it's a really easy system I mean you just use your troop until it runs out you can try any of the three different strains depending on what you like my favorite is Durbin poison for sure it's a great day time weed it's a great date time vaporizing straining or I've tried some edibles or there haven't I haven't driving a turban poison edible products yet but I have tried some other sativa products that I can also talk about in a future video if you'd like so yeah basically the batter is 30 bucks the tank I'm sorry you're not taking one true pod is 94 bucks the thing is it's gonna it's going to vary how much like how many of these you go through and how fast and I'm still waiting to see how long it takes me to get through one of them use them pretty heavily so we'll see I have two of the different poisons only because the store in my city ran out of what I had really gone there for but I knew I was gonna eventually needed urban poison again and this one is like on its last limb so I mean it's still definitely else them in there it's just I figured it might as well have a new one for when I'm ready since they didn't have the true clear which is what I was trying to buy um I have gone through once and one syringe of the true clear oral solution and it's awesome and I can tell you as more about that in my video thing you not doing one devoted just to sublingual slash or old products and review make those telling my opinions on them because I have tried two different ones now from two different dispensaries not just truly but another one too so yeah hopefully on that as well in another video um if you guys are liking this video I'm telling you please just comment or like it or thumbs up it or anything just to let me know that you want to see more because then call me corn if you don't know I'm not gonna make any more videos it's not helping anyone I don't want to waste my time or yours so anyways yeah anyway I am really glad that I tried this product I was a little nervous at first and I was planning initially on getting me dry herb vaporizer but I'm really glad that I went with this instead I just had a little good experience with this and I would not wouldn't trade it for for a different type of vaporizer I'm really happy with it and I ordered to continue to use it um so yeah yeah and yeah so if you guys liked this video just let me know and don't forget to Like and subscribe it's an awesome product overall I don't have enough good things to say about it and I really can't think of anything bad to say the only thing is that it is a little bit harsh I would almost like if I could turn down the power or something just a bit and that's not something you would ever normally hear me say hey like I like I like it all the way turnt up okay like I want I'm trying to feel that like feel limit medication so anyways um but yeah so I'll show you I'm just kidding this was my one nut so yeah this is all you do is you literally just inhale and press your button at the same time what I like to do is I start by um I inhale a little bit index on so and so there's my vapor and then think you saw at the ended up this lit up when your batteries charging it will be red until it's fully charged time that when this light will turn white um my god you guys have any questions or anything let me know and let me know if you want to see a video about oral syringes tell me if you want to see a video about some of the oral delivery medical cannabis products that we have in Florida or if you'd like another more in-depth review of all the different strains that are available in the true stick right now in indica is dos Tito's hybrid is trademark and sativa is Durban poison yeah if you want to hear all about those in great detail and which one you should try or what I think about them whatever let me know thanks for watching guys and I hope you had an awesome night or day or whatever whatever time of day", "SWOwtIkGLRU": "[Music] welcome to my complete guide on how to make edibles at home I have made edibles like tons and tons of times and I usually never D carve I weed before making the can of butter and I like making very strong potent edibles and they always come out really well so if you're trying to save some time you can totally skip that step if you want to other than that you do not have to use butter you can use any type of oil you want and before I start the tutorial I'm going to do a step by step guide with all of the math right now on how to specifically dose your edibles that guide that I'm gonna go through is going to help you in deciding what ratios and quantities to use so what you're gonna need for this whole process is going to be your weed you're gonna need one to two sticks of butter you're gonna need some water a nonstick preferably nonstick saucepan a metal meat thermometer or you could use like a laser thermometer you're also gonna need some cheesecloth it's usually in the aisle buy like all of the cooking utensils like the spatulas and stuff like that it's usually in that area and then besides that you'll just need some type of cooking sheet or baking dish or jar to solidify the butter and oh and you'll need like a grinder or something to grind up the wheat obviously but with that being said let's make some edibles so the first step when we dose our edibles is we want to find the THC percentage of our weed now I made this little chart right here for you guys in case you know maybe you didn't get your weed from the dispensary if you catch my drift if you do get your weed from the dispensary the label is going to tell you the percentage but in case you don't know so we that you just get off the street that's like hey it's pretty good it gets me high but you know it's not like super frosty top shelf [ __ ] that is gonna be typically five to ten percent THC potency higher end weed something a little bit nicer that's gonna be like eleven to fifteen percent so I would say like the ten to fifteen percentage range is probably pretty average and then if you get your weed at the dispensary it's usually gonna be fifteen percent up to even thirty percent now the national average percentage THC percentage is ten percent now that we have figured out the percentage of THC in our weed we have to do some math this is optional this part right here which I'm going to explain to you guys there is actually a THC a to THC conversion so like I was saying earlier let's say your weed has 10% THC a we're gonna multiply that by 10 to get the milligrams per grams ratio so if your weed is 10% we multiply that by 10 that is 100 milligrams of THC per gram 100 milligrams of THC M equals eighty seven point seven milligrams of THC per gram that is all very confusing and you know eighty nine point seven is close enough to 100 so for simplicity reasons I just use 101 THC to THC ratio so 100 to 100 that way you don't have to you worry about this whole conversion here we're just gonna use a one-to-one ratio in which case you can ignore this conversion so now that you have your percentage of your weed for simplicity let's just say that your weed is 10% THC or 100 milligrams of THC per gram as I was explaining before that's the national average so I made this little chart for you guys that you can also screenshot so in this chart we have this side here is going to be our available amount of weed the total milligrams per batch this is how many milligrams of THC are in each brownie or cookie each individual serving if you have 1/8 of weed which is three and a half grams that's gonna be 350 milligrams per batch if we divide that by 12 that is 29 milligrams per brownie or per cookie so obviously like I said before for a batch of 24 servings you're going to divide the total milligrams per serving by - since we're doubling it honestly if you're gonna be using a full 1/2 ounce or a full ounce of weed I would say go ahead and make a batch of 24 I mean that's entirely up to you but if you put half to a full ounce of weed into half a cup of butter it's going to taste very like earthy and weeding again this is up to you use this table for reference and you can tweak the numbers as needed so yeah guys that is how you dose edibles if you have questions just leave them in a comment and I will be happy to answer those for you and then I'm putting these full pages out here so you can screenshot them and here I have the entire step-by-step guide to actually making the butter but if you want to go ahead and screenshot this for simplicity purposes please go ahead so first grab a cookie sheet line it with some parchment paper for this batch I am not using flour like nugs I'm using our shape jar so every time we've been rolling joints or blunts and there's leftover shape we put it in this jar along with the stems so I'm going to actually wait and see how much we've accumulated and I'm gonna use that and I know it looks like super stemming and everything home but there's like a shit-ton of Keith at the bottom if you could see that in the previous clip so I'm just gonna go ahead and weigh all of the shake and stems and see what we've got over time and as far as my dosing goes I'm just gonna say that the shake is about 10% put that in the oven to the carb at 200 degrees for about 30 minutes and every like 10 minutes or so you're gonna want to take that out to kind of stir it so the surface area is even so coarsely grinding the D carved weed is going to help the butter taste cleaner but you can use a coffee grinder I just don't really recommend it and then I'm turning my stove on low and we're putting in a full cup or two sticks of butter in there along with one cup of water so you want equal butter to water ratio and what the water does is helps it to regulate its temperature regulating the temp is key with making cannabutter so once the butter is kind of melted in the water as you can see you can go ahead and add in your ground-up flour and just mix it in there and then once the mixture has started to kind of simmer like this we're gonna go ahead and take our thermometer and take the temperature so the key here is we want the time sure to always be within 160 and 200 we do not want it to be over 200 so after I let this cook for 3 hours you can do 2 to 4 hours that's what it's gonna look like go ahead and grab a dish and some cheesecloth so I'm just taking the cheesecloth and we're going to you'll have to cut it because it comes in huge pieces to fit over a bowl that's what I'm using you can also use a jar or something like that and we're gonna go ahead and pour all of that mixture into the cheesecloth [Music] so once you have that all in there you're just gonna go ahead and wring out all the butter don't squeeze too hard because the cheesecloth can rip and then you'll have to start over that's happened to me before but yeah once you wring it out all the way you'll see what it looks like when it's dry [Music] yup Phelps like literal [ __ ] so we're gonna now transfer the butter to some type of cooking dish if you don't have a glass dish like this you can use a cookie sheet I've done that before and then we're going to saran wrap this and put it in the fridge for 1 to 2 hours to solidify and then once we take it out of the fridge it's going to look like this and go ahead and take off the saran wrap and we're going to scratch the surface to see if any water has separated under the butter so if you added a lot of water throughout to regulate the temperature you'll have to crack the surface and drain the water out from the butter but since mine was good I'm good about regulating the temperature all the water evaporated from my butter while I was cooking it so now we are good to go we're making brownies so melt that butter back down put in a cup of white sugar we're gonna do 4 eggs and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract [Music] so next I'm just sifting in the dry ingredients it really makes a difference it's 1 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and then a cup of all-purpose flour go ahead and sift that add 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and a half a teaspoon of baking powder not baking soda and then go ahead and mix that up [Music] I'm putting this back into the same pan because it already has all that butter residue on it so it's like pre-greased then we're going to stick this in the oven at 350 degrees if I remember correctly for 25 minutes but don't quote me on that and this is the finished product you guys all done and ready to be eaten and I did testis and they were fired but thanks for watching", "tz6QveHJ4y4": "to smoke or to vape that is the question at least according to the state of New York hey guys Tara here for dnews and we've reached a turning point in our country where marijuana use is starting to become the norm whether it's medicinal or recreational andrew Cuomo the governor of New York State is expected to sign a bill soon that will legalize the drug but there are rumors that only certain methods of intake will be legalized specifically anything that does not involve the actual flower so edibles THC pills and vaporizing would all be okay now we've been hearing a lot of news lately about e-cigarettes and how those are supposedly better for your health than smoking actual cigarettes but how do we there stack up and are they better or worse for you than smoking say a joint let's go back to basics for a second now a raw cannabis plant contains over a hundred different cannabinoids which are chemical compounds that bind it to the cannabinoid receptors in your brain cells one of those cannabinoids is THC which is what's responsible for the psychotropic effects of smoking weight then there are others like CBD which gives you a body high but without all the mental fogginess now depending on where it's grown a cannabis plant will naturally contain anywhere from four to 65% THC and products with a high THC content like hash don't actually need heat in order to be activated you could still experience their effects just by ingesting them it's just that heating makes them even more potent now when you smoke a joint you're using an open flame which is very high heat and that combustion process activates the THC so when you inhale it the alveoli lining your lungs will deliver it straight into your bloodstream that's why you feel the effects of marijuana almost immediately after smoking vaporizers on the other hand use a process called conduction heating where either the raw plant or an extract of the plant has direct contact with a heat source but without an open flame so it uses a lower temperature and it heats it up just enough to be able to vaporize the THC that way you still feel the effects of it but without all the health problems that come along with smoking now much like a cigarette paper rising marijuana is still a relatively new thing so it's hard to say exactly what the long term effect but unlike ecigs you really don't have any outside chemicals to contend with so it's still widely agreed to be better for you than smoking burning marijuana produces carcinogens it can cause you to inhale soot and it can exacerbate problems like asthma shortness of breath and coughing basically it irritates the hell out of your lungs and there have been many studies showing that switching to cannabis vaporizers from smoking is effective for relieving those symptoms a 2007 study found that marijuana users inhaled fewer toxic compounds and less carbon monoxide when vaping compared with smoking it also tastes and smells better and from a medical standpoint it just kind of makes sense there's no medicine out there that you have to smoke in order to use so if the option to vaporize cannabis exists why wouldn't we use it well like anything there are a few caches for one paper izing can be way more potent than smoking and it's harder to actually determine how much THC you're getting many people say the effects of vaporizing lasts longer but also produce a more even high it also depends on your specific method if you're using dabs which are a super concentrated form of hash oil it can be really easy to overindulge dab users have also been shown to develop more tolerance to marijuana and have a greater risk of withdrawal which can lead to things like irritability and sleep problems even so it's hard to deny the relative benefits of vaping over smoking as long as people are responsible about how much they're dosing then this law may very well set a precedent for future marijuana laws what do you guys think would you support legalization even if it bans smoking outright or is this a step in the wrong direction let us know in the comments below as always thank you guys for watching", "WNPoTAKhcys": "what's up guys how you doing today it's time here again and today we have a special guest with us i'm here with mr hoyte who is one of the first black men in africa to own a cannabis company so we're currently on his farm right now where he creates medicinal cannabis and he's going to be telling us how he was able to start this company as a black man and also build his community where it currently is so what's up how are you doing today i'm fantastic man thanks for coming i'm a huge fan of yours firstly thanks a lot thanks for having me fantastic just give us like a breakdown of how you started out did you find your ass i would yeah yeah sure sure are you i'm 29. you're 29. yeah i started my first job at 19 in government i just reached out to the ministry at the time the minister was trevor manuel i respect that that man a lot because he gave him my first shot he was appointed as a minister in the presidency for planning and i felt the need to work for him so i kept sending messages and bombarding him for a couple of months until they called me in for an interview and i got the role one of the things that i'm really proud of is that at that time we were the team that worked on the national development plan and vision for 2013. so my life was pretty pretty good until around 2013 unexpectedly my mom was diagnosed with liver cancer just out of the blue this is someone who is extremely health conscious i mean but mom wouldn't want us to have fried fish because it had to be grown right and like those kinds of things she was very really very wow you know she was extremely healthy health conscious so it was a shock to us and she battled that for 18 months we're thankful to the team of the oncology departments that she was with who just gave her the best care but when she passed on one of the things that i realized in 2014 is that people don't actually have quality reliable supplement for their treatment and cannabis is a very very good supplement to to the treatment regime so for instance i'll give an example okay my mom loved food okay she loved cooking good healthy food but she lost the taste but as a side effect of the chemicals yeah and that's just one side effect so when you use something like thc for instance thc cbg and cbd combined in a plant they help to stimulate your appetite and that's where the the passion came from in 2014 i you know i went all in started traveling and different parts of the world to learn about what's happening in the industry globally the g20 summit in germany a couple years ago i was selected to attend that but i couldn't attend the conference and i went privately a couple of weeks later to go see what's happening in the cannabis industry in germany which was mostly medicinal i'm trying to find out what's happening in other parts of the world where there is a cannabis regimen from lesotho canada and the like um and that's how south korea started so you traveling to those places wasn't it easier to just stay there and just establish your community why did you come back all the way to south africa to come back and establish something where you're from because it's old i'm a firm believer that africa doesn't have a wealth problem africa has a management problem it's up to us to build our futures or it's up to us to build the kind of space for for our children my children are to be south african right they may they may have citizenship elsewhere as well but they are south african right be nigerian a british citizen right but you are still nightmares that's true south korea is is a company that is established in south africa but is now global and we've got a joint venture with south grove in jamaica we've got south grove in the uk we're expanding in other areas and we've got teams that are working with us but we are still authentically south african and purely african you you've seen some of our colors and those are african bags i'll say the color i'll put it up you know so that's that's who we are we're an african company but we have global ambitions and it's about establishing african presence everywhere and so that's the um register the company officially in november of 2017. and my wife came up with her name um wow it was more like she was like shout out to her shout out to yeah we're just lying better a couple years ago and she was like you're on that south ground and then that's how it just came you know when it comes to this kind of topic cannabis it's sensitive type of topic you know because not everybody accepts cannabis so how are you able to start actually in africa where it's not legalizing most countries so how were you able to break through and build a company around something that's not like you're selling tomatoes you're selling a product that it's highly controlled exactly so fortunately in 2017 what most people don't know is that south africa has always had a medicinal cannabis regimen right since 1963 if i'm not mistaken so it was scheduled and all that and you needed to have permission from the department of health to to have cannabis products and from the 60s right to 2017 only 13 people were granted that approval to 10 people yep since the 60s to actually have cannabis for medicinal purposes 2017 the regulation from the regulator came through the guidelines and i just went all in you know i left my job you know i just our savings our lives right i mortgaged everything that i had owned pretty much just i really believed you have to you have to back yourself because no one will thank you and i'm really thankful that i had a i've not even had i have an extremely supportive wife we invested and then once we invested in it we started it was quite expensive just from regulatory red tape point of view just you need good manufacturing practice you know all these standard operating procedures and guidelines and and and all that stuff costs money and you know that's where we invested i'll say that it's also important that we also need to be honest as entrepreneurs right you don't wake up in the morning and say okay i did it because my mother actually see that a lot of it was also part of the inheritance that we'd received from my mom from ramsay's estate right that was where you got the start-up got started because often when people thought i was like yeah i started like okay but how did you show here people always have this little aspire to pass by a story like oh i have started and i i don't want to one billion tell us how you did it so it's important that we need to be honest i came first from a certain level of privilege i'm not the typical south african black young man story because south african young black men and young black women are currently going through a lot yes the significant number of us are unemployed and the like so it's not like a you know go out and be an entrepreneur and then we need to tell it the way the way it is so that we all have an understanding of what the problems are so you can fix those problems too at this moment we're currently on your farm this is a nine hectare farm what's meant to happen here this is the next phase which is just outdoor cultivation right and down here what we are looking at at any given time is about nine thousand plants nine thousand nine thousand plants which will yield anywhere between three to four tons of dried cannabis product dry flour three to four tons yeah and that's a lot of wheat yeah it's a lot of wheat but it's not enough though i mean that's the crazy thing is that it's not enough how lucrative is this business it's a hard business to get into because there's so much red tape right and there's so much regulatory compliance that you have to go through across the entire process i mean i'll give you an example our first harvest which we're expecting in the first half of next year by june of next year of our indoor harvested product is 15 million rand of product and we're running a consecutive harvest cycle so we're looking at about 50 million annualized over three to six harvest cycles and with a maximum of just over a hundred hundred million million yeah wow so from fifteen to a hundred million is what you're looking at but you don't remember cannabis is sold on a gram basis um and then on a wholesale you're selling it at um in kilos and in towns selling to pharmaceutical companies in europe and the like um you sell in tons and in kilos so you guys export it out of south africa so yeah so the market the markets are export but we're also now working on our finished products um i infuse drinks and all those kinds of things oh that's so it's not just about growing cannabis right it's a brand business business yeah it's about building a brand so that's interesting you guys have two sections you have the power you export and you have the power you make finished products that's really interesting most companies always just extract the raw materials then they send it out there even in nigeria that's what we do with that we extract yeah as well if we send it out and they'll buy it back here as well for like times 10 of the money we call it digging and delivering we don't want to be a dig and deliver economy um the value in cannabis is in the finished product i mean per liter of of cannabis oil is anywhere between five to 15 thousand dollars wow i think i need to go and start my own my own calories i'm learning so much i'm learning so much from this interview trust me think about it too like one of the things that we don't think about right is that why would big pharma big tobacco and big alcohol get involved in the cannabis business cannabis is the greatest substitute for all those substances i.e sure look at canada the largest cannabis company now on the planet is canopy growth right and their largest investor is one of the largest alcohol companies on the planet they invested five billion dollars into canopy growth because the data suggests that people who consume alcohol and when they're exposed to cannabis cannabis acts as a natural substitute and they tend to shift their consumption patterns so our competitors are defensive businesses in the sense that they're trying to defend their position and trying to defend their long-term growth canopy growth is not my competition yeah my competition is red hmm the company that sold seven billion cans last year seven billion cans that's who i'm going up against instead of having like an energy an energy drink right you have a you have our tonic okay our sparkling tonic that's zero carbs um zero sugar and with no taurine when you talk about cannabis i think what all people just see is just all the joints smoking weed that's all i see right but i also feel from your products i've seen i've seen that it's possible to create lots of products from cannabis when you when people think of cannabis they think of it in the way that you've described it it's true it's bigger and cannabis has always been used we're talking about a seven two thousand year old traders it was a us government that pretty much globally banned cannabis cannabis wasn't a bad substance until 1921 from not mistaken globally we need to unlearn the things that we were taught i mean nigeria has a very strong cannabis culture it's brewed as well in drinks in south africa there are over 180 of us right and out of that a small number is actually black african-american and more specific in our case youth we are black youth we have a vision for ourselves and we know what we're doing i mean our entire team is is relatively young and with the exception of our board right and i'm the youngest person on the board talking about talking about the board how many people do you have employed in this business in the whole company we've got about 15 people and everyone in the company is a shareholder take us through your production facilities here the whole process we've built an indoor cultivation facility secure clean environment it's that cost of compliance that i was telling you about we've done all of that so you start the nursery the mother room the vegetation and vegetative state the the flowering room the drying and so everything is broken down into different in two different differences in different spaces and yeah the plant itself needs goes through various stages of growth and you need to control each one of those environments to get the maximum output massive grow lights um four to eight hundred watts lights each um it's very hot yeah it's it's very strong lighting um because you want to mimic the outdoor environment as well right but you also want to control the environment so you want to give the plant as much exposure to light and and nutrients and energy and just various inputs but you also want to control the the process and how the product grows and ultimately how the product comes out because i need to be able to validate that the product that you consume tomorrow is the same product that you consumed yesterday yesterday oh just like the way mcdonald's is not definitely you have to have the same quality same quality standard so there's so much that actually goes into this it's not like you just throw seeds somewhere and it just grows then anyone could do thank you about some of the it you faced in starting this business like i said you know there had to be some seed somewhere and a little bit disingenuous for me to say to people just start a cannabis business yeah and then see that guy lied to us so i never want to be that dude because it's such a high barrier to entry industry cost is one of the major barriers right we've invested millions that's the challenge and then you have to sink this money in without an expectation of revenue but my biggest mistake was initially hiring people who weren't skilled okay but i had them because i had a personal relationship with them and they were in positions or situations where i um thought maybe we could build this thing together but you realize that you need to have people with the right mindset true you need to have people who are hungry it's about building a culture and because culture i mean ben horowitz the famous vc says the culture is the stuff that happens when you're not there how much would you say this business is what currently so anywhere between the last pre-manned evaluation of about 150 and that was earlier yeah 150 million rand wow um that was variational in october last year our team is working extremely hard and super dedicated to building a brand that is consistent reliable and is a premium brand for people to be able to enjoy the cannabis products that's what we're here for i'm not sure to sell at north american of i know i'm so africa we were using african cultivars right um congo land race durban poison ray bart from in the eastern cape right in pondo classic um swazil malawi goal um there's no nigerian on your menu there's actually a working one is getting the seas from nigeria certain situations but i definitely want because it's about telling every one of our at the back of every one of our products is telling a story about where the cultiva comes from and what's in the culture and why it does what it does and the people who grew this culture over millennia because it's important it's important for us to tell our stories stories it's very important yeah it's very important for us to tell our stories because if we don't tell our stories it will be told for us most definitely and when it stood for us it can be told anyway but at the same time it's also about whether or not the the thing that you're building is actually scalable i get what i mean details and individuals is not scalable creatures and individuals are scalable yeah but now media is scalable true south korea is scalable true that's very true so what's your advice to a lot of young people out there adversity young people to thought just start starting is the first bit and then secondly never underestimating the importance of the relationships that you build with people who will back you later on in life right one of the things i got from watching she said is start small start with whatever you have and you can always scale it up just start just thanks a lot for sharing your story with us i'm sure a lot of people out there have learnt a lot about if they want to build a business in africa so i'm going to link your companies page in the description below i'm sure you need probably customers and public partners you want to grow you grow together man yeah so i'm going to link his page below his website phone number and all of that and you can always reach out to the company southgrown and that's a lot for you guys today if you like this video please hit the like

bill that could allow more texans to get a medical cannabis prescription is this the one medical therapy that legislators feel that they should be telling doctors how to practice medicine if his bill passes patients with any condition their doctor deems necessary could get a prescription do you think that governor abbott is going to sign any of these no i hope so but why now pew research center released a new study monday indicating 68 percent of americans are ready to legalize marijuana many states already there but for menendez this is personal his wife had two back surgeries she's had fentanyl patches she's been on the horrible narcotics and and narcotics can kill people and they stop your system and cannabis is helpful and so it's helped her texas could also see an economic boom

wednesday friday after lunch hey guys uh welcome to scully's daily mixology show i'm your old pal rusty today i'm going to talk to you as i promised a little bit about infusions okay if we were going to infuse pineapple it's first of all it's nice to have the original bottle any infusion that you're going to do the higher the amount of the alcohol the quicker the infusion if you're infusing things you want to use a pure spirit or a top shelf meaning that you're going to pay pay for it okay you're not going to use um the cheap stuff to try to make infusions after you've made your infusions they're going to wind up in the fridge because you're going to be using stuff like pineapple and strawberry and stuff like that so let's start with pineapple vodka okay we're just going to pick a vessel you want to use fresh fruit when you're doing this third full fill the bottle with vodka okay third full of strawberries fill a bottle full of vodka every day give it a shake for one week then put it in the fridge for a week every day take it out give it a shake strawberry same thing strawberries third fill it cut it up small pieces third fill the glass fill it with tequila or vodka depending on rum light rum if you like but you have to use a top shelf okay same thing every day give it a little shake let it sit at room temperature for a week infusions like pineapple and strawberry you cannot let go for more than three weeks otherwise you're pulling out all the sour flavors the bad flavors the bitter flavors now if you were making something like a coconut infused rum you would fill this with the third floor with shaved coconut and you're gonna have to leave it sit on the counter for at least three weeks and then taste it before you before you actually decide if it's any good and let it go for another week if that's what it needs then of course we always strain it and it always goes into the fridge infusions except for this one which i promised i'd tell you how to make this vessel i choose to use when i'm infusing marijuana please know your audience before you decide to attempt this okay don't i use this vessel particularly because it has a wide brim and i want to reuse the bottle so don't stuff anything in it that isn't going to come out easy break it off now uh because i know my audience i'm going to use about uh i've got about three quarters of an ounce of little popcorn buds in here i've never tried it with uh off cuts and leaves and stuff like that you may be able to do it but this one takes this one takes a little bit now we're going to fill it with a top shelf vodka okay because that's what the uh my wife likes it so um we're going to fill this now you're going to notice that this stuff is all going to float not only that you're going to leave it at room temperature and it's going to float for a month after about a month and i'll have to get another bottle of this but you will see after about a month all of this stuff is going to sink if i had more this vodka with me um all this stuff is going to float for a month then it's all going to sink then every day for two weeks you're going to give it a shake turn it right upside down put it back down so that the stuff's not sitting in a mass at the bottom it's not helping you out and once i get this filled up it should be ready for christmas time and uh this will be very strong as i said i've got there's a 40 ounce bottle with three quarters of an ounce or more of have days of marijuana please know your audience you might want to cut this in half i wouldn't suggest you make it much stronger it does work now you can make this possibly with a distillate and not get any flavor out of it but i think you might have to heat the alcohol and i don't want to tell you how to do that however christmas time and this will be enjoyed and if you're making it at home i hope you're watching and uh have a great time peace out", "oqTOlrF-lgQ": "what's up guys welcome back today I have a very exciting video we're going to be making infused flamin hot cheetos now only RV is going to be absolutely amazing they are also the easiest recipe you're ever going to come across on this channel and it only requires two ingredients what you're gonna need some flaming hot cheetos tincture or infused butter or oil the first step is to spread out the cheetos on a baking tray if you're using tincture like I am you'll pour it into a little spray bottle I like this bottle because it does a really nice fine mist if you're using oil or butter you'll need to make sure it's warm enough to be liquidy and use one of these oil mister bottles like this I'll post a link for each of these items in the description box below now all you have to do is spray your Cheetos with the tincture or the oil if you're using the tincture you can just leave them out to air dry and they should be good after a half an hour to make them even stronger I'm gonna flip them all over and spray them again you can repeat this process and spray them as much as you like to get the desired strength just make sure not to use too much so they don't get too soggy if you're using oil or butter you'll need to put them into the oven for five minutes at 200 degrees I left my note to dry for about a half an hour and they're ready to put into bags now they've dried out they're ready to eat today obviously tastes amazing thank you guys so much for watching I hope you guys try this out if you enjoyed this video please give us a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe have a wonderful day [Music]", "GDgj4zVNub0": "so we are going to be doing a uh cbd versus thc delta 9 versus thc delta 8 blind test we're gonna have my friends try out these drugs and see if they can tell the difference between them uh this is purely for entertainment uh so let's get right into it by the way if you don't know who i am i'm chris with cbd extract and if you haven't tried our hemp flour before do me a favor and hit the link down below and you can grab an eighth of our hemp flour completely for free it doesn't cost you anything all you got to do is click the link down below to claim the offer let's get right into it we're not going to tell you what's what okay oh we're going to we're going to tell you at the end but for now let me ask a couple questions okay uh how long have you been smoking like a year and a half year and a half okay about six years six years quite a while yeah that's quite a while how experienced would you say you are with weed but i am not good at knowing types quite a lot of experience so i'm a big dabber so like um i get a lot of different profiles like i tried to switch up my strains and stuff and switch up like in because of a hybrid so okay i like to get a lot of different like experiences so i'm pretty well versed and he's from the uk by the way wheat is not legal there at all so he has [ __ ] weed [ __ ] weed in [ __ ] england they don't even have cbd weed there if they do they have to label it as tea because they they don't even allow cbd weed there so this is the first cartridge uh you're going to have to guess if it's delta 8 delta 9 or cbd and also you know just feel what you think about it tastes like ginger um it's interesting like it tastes like a flounder tastes like actual planters i could do your own i feel nothing it just tastes very like not strong but you can tell the flavor no but that just tastes like the ground it tastes like the ground yeah what cannabinoid would you say this is um it tastes a little bit different from like most cards i almost want to guess that's delta nine i really don't know i don't know cbd i'll i'll say this is cbd for now but i might change my mind so okay i don't know i get like a certain like throw hit off of the actual thc and i felt like slightly different but i almost can kind of notice some effects i could just be liking a placebo so this is the next card [ __ ] tastes a lot more like what i would expect a cart to taste like oh there we go right off the bat i noticed it's super clear i'm just looking at it it looks pretty concentrated and i can i feel like i can almost kind of feel it off of that suit and by the way on these parts we're doing a curveball because not only are some some of them delta 8 or delta 9 or cbd we're also some of them are botanical terpenes and some are going to be cannabis derived terpenes so we're going to talk not super vibrant flavor like if there's any terps in this i would guess it's you know minimal what do you think about the taste this is um this is delta eight would you say it's an indica or sativa i'm never gonna tell you that all right yeah whatever i get in the currency but it's just for like the flavor differential not really the effects i never noticed anything different [ __ ] does it hit strong though like i smoked delta 8 before but this is kind of different this is like that tastes very strong in the back of my throat i can feel that [ __ ] just yeah it's definitely there um this is delta a that's delta a i think the last one might have been delta nine because starting to fill that a little bit i'm gonna guess delta h [ __ ] i don't like that one like nothing like i can't taste anything really just tastes like is there a throat hit to it nope no throwhead okay it's fruity yeah i don't know and it hits good like very smooth it just tastes like him like i'm chewing grass taste reminds me a lot of like actual distillate like um delta nine still i like this one it seems to look a little bit like it unless it's just like terps although it does look really thick i don't know it's good though i like that one so would you say cbd delta 8 or delta 9 on this one um i'm pretty stuck in between delta no no no this is delta a not cbd i don't know that was delta nine which one the one that i just did was delta nine the first one cbd because this is way weaker than the last one right i'm not tripping like this has to be delta a i don't know you tell me man i think there might be like some cd in there too you think there might be cbd yeah yeah i think like the last one is more like pure delta eight if i had to guess and then like this one there's like some other additives i don't know it could be completely wrong but i don't know how you know the difference between [Music] [Music] okay hmm is that one clogged too they're all i feel like all cars wow that one hits more it's in the bathroom oh that one is like peaceful this is like taking him right before getting to bed i don't know whether it's thc cbd abc this is like not the strongest thing it's not the strongest like the second weakest in terms of like first impressions right but this is like i could smoke this like a lot you know like i could wake up a lot of bed and take a hit you know i have to prepare myself for this i don't need a big breakfast [Music] this is very casual this is delta r that's delta all right uh yeah or delta yeah delta nine here okay i always get it mixed up then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah interesting i don't know i don't know what this is but it's not dealt to mine not about the man no okay so final verdict finally uh which one would you say was the strongest out of all strong ones one two three or four probably two two three two two no i lied three was this one yeah three okay interesting and so and out of the one two three four which one is cbd which one is delta eight which one's delta nine [Music] cbd was the one with the little white cartridge uh delta nine was the second one and the first one was whatever okay cool am i right nope you're completely wrong so out of the four which one do you think had like the best flavor to the worst flavor um i would say the first one had like the most diverse flavor like i could just like pick up like those things going on in it and i think that one would be the seemingly one the very first one i had um and then the second one there wasn't a whole lot of flavor but uh it seemed like there was a high concentration of thc in it whether it's delta eight or delta card and then uh the third one you gave me it was a lot like the first one but it just had like a little bit more flavor okay cool and then what about the and then the fourth one we just talked about that yeah yeah yeah that obviously tastes like almost any card up there interesting all right well hey that's you were actually spot on that everything was right oh okay then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah and then this the third the middle one was dr eight and then the last one was the first one yeah okay we got that right i did she got everything right yeah oh my god yes so there you have it hope you enjoyed the video if you

guys welcome back thank you so much for your support I just popped that 10,000 market oh my god think you could not have done any of that without your support guys I really really appreciate it it just means the world to me you like me you really really like me sorry just being an ass having some fun alright so today what I'm gonna do now that I showed you how to do canna candy sugar & Canas syrup we can now make our gummies without using butter and the Gerber is an emulsifier however if you want to make them super super strong absolutely go ahead and stuff the butter back in there but this gives you far more control over how strong or weak that you would like to make them now you guys are always asking me how much milligrams etc something is and I don't generally tend to answer that very often because it is all dependent upon what you make how you make it once you're starting THC is etc so what I've done is in the description there I've included a link for the calculator that I use it's a free signup it's a little course you're more than welcome to have a look take a look at it listen to her she's really interesting and lots of information but the calculator you can use for free and that's what I use so then you can go ahead and you can make your calculations and figure out how strong etc that you want to make your candies and with this it gives you a lots of versatility so you can go all can of sugar and syrup or half-and-half which is what I'm gonna do in the recipe so I will stop babbling on now and I'm gonna get into the ingredients of course and of course what we need and then we'll put all that stuff together and make some awesome gummies there we go alright guys all right so for our new gelatin for our new gummy version here you're gonna use one box of your paper flavored jello I three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water for blooming your gelatin or what I use are these kool-aid waters so they're just flavored water so I now use these in place of water they're great because they add more flavour to it or you can kind of combine some flavors which is really cool to do so I use those things are nice they're lighter and sugar and said just adding more flavor now another thing you can do for adding flavor is juice crystals now I get these at the bulk bar and you can only get them during the summer time but I get these in all different flavors and I've got two tablespoons of those again enhancing the flavor that way if you don't want to use or have these flavors artificial flavors you can go use those which work great the other thing you're going to need is a quarter cup of your can of syrup and a quarter cup of water for our jello and then for our candy side our candy version so it's going to be like the other one where we do the cook you're going to need a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar or again you can use a full can of sorry a full cup of your can of sugar same thing with your syrup I'm using a quarter cup of canned syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup again you can go and use as much or as little of either of those as you like I like to do the half-and-half mainly for taste and not to kill people so that's my kind of my you I don't want anybody rendered completely useless and then we are going to need 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and then as well if you want to add additional colors or flavors you can add those optionally as well and as I said if you want to add your butter as well it really makes them super duper you can do that you're just going to follow exactly the same thing except the previous steps from the previous version with regards to adding the butter and the Goregaon to emulsify it now something else I wanted to say and the same thing now in this version I'm not using the clear gel however you can use the clear gel exactly the same way as you do in the previous recipe of the regular and sour gummy recipe that's a good one to follow it's the most up-to-date and gives you both those versions that you can use and that's all we need for our ingredients and now we'll get into our equipment and then we will get the best part go and we'll get all this stuff put together alright so the equipment that you're going to need just like the other recipes a double boiler I just do a makeshift I get a bowl that will make sure that your water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you will need a smaller saucepan for our candy syrup two spatulas you will need your candy thermometer and you will need a larger pot that your bought is that your saucepan small saucepan will fit into ice water water with ice in it but a little tongue-tied today and obviously your candy molds now a lot of you ask me how many candy is gum you will get out of a batch now it's all depending obviously on the size molds that you use if you use about this large size I got these from Michaels you will get about sixty if you use of this size gummy which is kind of a little bit larger than those big ones you're going to get it probably about 75 to 100 and if you use the little teeny tiny ones then you're going to get about 150 to 200 of them so that's approximately what that recipe will break down to you for you and now d'leh before we get started there is something very important that I found out from my other recipe when I started this is and I don't do this in the other recipes but when we're working with the can of sugar and the can of syrups it is a must that we oil down the sides and the insides of our pot for the candy syrup reason being when it heats up and starts boiling the oil THC oil starts to separate and it sticks to the smiths of the metal of the pot you might have noticed that if you did that with a can of syrup which is why I redid the video for that specific reason so we're going to do things a little bit differently than we do for the regular candy recipe but I'll show you all those details once we get into it but the very first thing and don't really don't want to forget is we're going to lightly grease our saucepan and hold on just couldn't dribble a little bit of oil into it and then make sure to work it all the way around make sure to get it right into the corners because anywhere that this oil is not where there's no oil your THC will sit the only thing that dissolves THC oil is oil because it is oil soluble by doing this we're going to be able to scrape anything that sticks to the sides off much much easier then seeing all your products that they're going oh what happened so you said you want to lightly grease that you don't want to have any excess oil so make sure to do that up as well as your spatulas you want to lightly oil your spatulas for the same reason when we scrape it off the sides if these are not oiled it sticks to it and it doesn't come off so you want to make sure anything that is going to be touching the THC the syrup you want to make sure that you all and that's it I'm gonna get into putting our ingredients together and get this started oh one other thing I wanted to cover is with your moles I don't spray my moles beforehand but I have found sometimes that they do stick but so what I do is I care them so I will spray them or oil them down lightly let it sit for 20 minutes in the mold and then wash them out so it still leaves that oily feel but it's not gonna leave your Piquet knees all greasy and makes it far easier for them to come as well as you only have to cure them once every few once every five or six batches or so so it lasts a long time by doing it that way all right so now I promise we'll get into the ingredients in our candy all righty so the very first thing that we are going to do is we are going to microwave our quarter cup of liquid for about 50 seconds till it's boiling and we're going to bloom our unflavored gelatin all right so you're going to evenly sprinkle your gelatin over the top of your liquid whether you use water or the kool-aid water and then you are going to stir it in now a lot of punches I explained in about whether that your gummies did not are not that they're too sticky but they're not gelatin enough that can depend a lot of power on your gelatin I just bought a batch of gelatin because I buy a bulb that didn't it wasn't blooming at the strength of it or something was not working well I did two batches and I had almost double the gelatin so a lot of it is dependent upon your gelatin now one test that I do is when I put in the three tablespoons and mix it in it should start very quickly to get the texture of apple sausage and clicking up pretty quickly now this is not so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in another half a tablespoon of gelatin yes I've just sprinkled on another half a tablespoon and I'm gonna stir that in and now I'm getting that texture of applesauce can you kind of see what I mean that's how you know you're probably are at the great strength for your gelatin starting off if your gelatin is not right from the beginning if it's mushy I'll show you when we go to put this in but that's the texture it should be once you once we've got it mixed in now we're gonna set that aside for five minutes or so to let that bloom now meanwhile we will add our box of jell-o I'm giving the blueberries well berry blue and we are going to add in our boiling water and stir that around and get it dissolving see was it and then just keep scraping because the jello will cause the sides of the bowl are cool it's good to just kind of stick to it so just keep scraping the sides down as you go and turn your heat on to low so again we only want to melt our gelatin over a hot water bath we don't want it hot at boiling at all that's what breaks our gelatin a lot of the time is you don't even think that you've got it too hot but really past hot water probably by 150 degrees it is that's about all you need so that's that's a big mistake that a lot of people make myself included so I'm just going to continue to stir that gently until the gelatin is dissolved and then we will add in our corn syrup and our other stuff and once your gelatin and that has started to melt the sugar takes longer because the sugar melts at a higher at a bit of a higher heat so it just takes a little bit longer but once your gelatin and that is melted you can add in your corn syrup and your flavor crystals if you're wanting to add so you saw your canister your quarter cup of Kanna syrup and then your flavored juice crystals if you want to add those in as additional flavoring and again just stir that until it all starts gets incorporated and now for you guys asking for those clear gummies how do I get my gummies clear this well you can now you could have perfectly clear gummies so I'm gonna kick it continue to stir this and just gently mix it together until everything is melted and combined I'd you notice I got my nails done so for all of you those wishing that I get them done they're done and to those of you commented there you go I know I looked at the videos and thought make and those are ratty looking hands so I do apologize hopefully it'll be better from now on in the future I hope you like these a little bit better do you got a look at them for quite a long time so why not make them a little bit more attractive and also just remember to continually scrape down the sides of your bowl so that the gelatin is not sticking to the sides and just to show you this is just how hot your water should be there shouldn't be any boiling just a little bit of steam coming off of that that's as how that's as hard as you want to get it otherwise any hotter than that it's gonna break your gelatin alright so now that everything's pretty much dissolved I'm going to add in our gelatin now here's another thing if your gelatin is after 5 minutes or so blooming is mushy when you touch it then your gelatin is not strong enough so whether it's old and it's weakened or there are different gelatin with different strengths if it is nice and firm to the touch and no mushy you're good to go so I just split this up into pieces slap her in and you're just gonna let that you're just gonna gently again stir that until it completely melts and again if you start to see any kind of foaming may take it off your heat immediately it's getting too hot so I'm just gonna let them set them going to continue to stir that until my gelatin is fully melted well once your gelatin is melted and everything looks good and it is nice and translucent just set it off to the side and now we're going to start our candy syrup alright for our candy syrup in goes our half a cup of white sugar our half a cup of Candace Canon sugar our Candace syrup quarter cup a can of syrup like I said before you're more than welcome to play around with your different measurements on that as long as it equals 1/2 a cup either way it doesn't matter and our quarter cup of light corn syrup our half a cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to gently stir that till ever - your syrup till your sugar and water and everything's just combined and then once you're combined here turn your heat on to medium Cline to start and then we're going to drop it down to medium once it begins to boil and you're just going to continue stirring this make sure to get all around the edges because the sugar likes to sit there and so we're going to continue to stir this until it starts to boil now all of my and all the other candy recipes I say as soon as we start boiling we're gonna stop stirring and use our brush not in this recipe and I'll show you once it starts boiling as I said the oils yeah I got a little syrup on the burner there so the oils start to separate out with the heat and until it gets all to the same kind of temperature it will they will stick to the side so we're going to have to continually work the sides of the pot but you're going to want to be very very gentle because we don't want to spit dirt into the syrup so as I said I'll show that all to you once it gets there now you'll start to notice as as it's starting to heat up if you scrape the sides of your pot see all that that's your oil and that's what we want to make sure it gets back into our syrup so I usually have to use the two you want as I said you have to grease both spatulas here and work it off get it back into the syrup and we're gonna have to do this continuously through the whole cooking process so at anytime that you see any darkness starting to form on the side make sure to scrape it down and as your syrup gets hotter you can just put your spatula in it'll just melt it off and also make sure when you are scraping the sides of your pot hold on to the handle firmly I've done it before I wasn't paying attention and whoops and the last thing you want is molten lava being poured anywhere other keeping it in the pot so when your syrup begins to bubble starts boiling you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and remember this is normally where I say we stop stirring not this time so we're not actually going to stir it what we're gonna do is just to continually scrape around the sides of the pot but don't go deep into the syrup we just want to stay around the bubble area and you just want to keep pulling this in so this is the alcohol of the excess alcohol and stuff burning off and any impurities that are in it so see how it's gathering up on the sides that's what we want to make sure get them back into our syrup whatever is supposed to cook off will cook off whatever is good will stay in so again just gently don't go into the stirs syrup just gently keep going around the sides and you'll do behind the candy thermometer towards the end and we are going to cook our syrup - if you want a soft candy you're gonna cook it to 260 if you want a firm candy you can go as high as 280 280 is soft crack I'm gonna go to just before that I'm going to take this to 275 but you see what I mean about the oils how they just continue they'll keep going to the sides of the pot as it heats up and gets up to temperature it will it will the oils will get incorporated and once your syrup is boiling in that you want to just turn your heat down to medium just medium a little above medium I said then don't forget to get behind in behind the thermometer because it will hide in behind there I love the smell of this syrup cooking it's oh it smells so awesome oh and just as a tip for safety always have a fan either an overhead fan I've got one going or the if you've got an overhead on your stove regardless when you're ever working with tinctures even though you've working them in a dehydrated yeah most of it's cooked off some of them may not be and you just want on the safety side always have a fan going and leave don't be sparking anything up in the in the general area so you've had your gelatin sitting over on the side and you have a look and you've noticed that there's all this white inky foam stuff and you're sure positive that you didn't do it high on high heat the heat didn't get too hot that'll happen so nice if the gelatin is old and it's starting to break down so if you do see that in order to compensate for that bloom another tablespoon of unflavored gelatin and we're going to add it into the candy mixture at the end that's gonna help us compensate for the gelatin that's broken in our mixture here so that will help it so anytime that your candies come out super sticky and you can't get them out of the mold the reason is is because the gelatin is not gelling properly so there's a really handy tip there for you guys now in order to get that out because I don't want that in to go my syrup I'm gonna run this through a strainer before we put it into our syrup so now I might actually my syrup while I was babbling away there is getting close to temperature I've got my ice water ready to go and as soon as it hits temperature I'm gonna drop the bottom into the pot and once the temperature starts coming down and the cooking process is stopped I'm gonna set it to the side until the temperature comes down to 240 before we add our gelatin in just watch your thermometer till until the temperature starts coming down and your bubbles start stop bubbling and then just set it to the side and said until your temperature comes down to 240 all right so now my syrup is cooled and then it's say because I don't want that white foamy stuff into my syrup I'm going to use a strainer to pour it through that way it'll catch all the chunks of jell-o gelatin and being bad and I'm going to mix that in now I also what I did was I bloomed another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid and we're going to add that in a little bit in a little bit so right now you're going to stir your jello and your candy syrup until it is all combined and if you find that your syrup is a little too sticky and it's solidified you can put your heat on to minimum you just want to heat the bottom to get the syrup off the bottom now you can make sure that you do so that you scrape the sides and if you said if you find that it's too hard coming off turn your heat on and it'll eventually start to melt so you just want to want to keep doing that until everything is completely melted in all the same temperature all right so now that everything is all melted together and nicely mixed now this is a test that I do to determine whether my syrup is did a job correctly if I pull it up and you see how it just goes in a nice smooth syrup it doesn't really seem to start gelling or anything it stays in a fine line so that's kind of telling me that this is gonna turn out way too sticky it's gonna come out what's it like you can't get it out of the mold it's more candy than the gelatin that's what I said about my gelatin breaking there that I knew that was gonna happen so I've added it I'm gonna add in the additional gelatin that I bloomed and I'm just gonna stir that until it's completely dissolved so now if you want your syrup just translucent that nice clear there you go you've got it you can go ahead and put it into your bottles your squirt bottles or use the little eye droppers for dispensing into your molds but however I never like to keep things plain so I'm gonna do half-and-half or I've got translucent and solid and also just to give you a look to see how to go about doing that all right so now when after adding the additional gelatin in now when I do my test you'll see it's thicker and it'll start to split up and almost solidify in midair so that's how you know it's likely going to set correctly I still had to not do things correctly that's occasionally but that is a very good indication that you're safe and good to go so if you wanted translucent go ahead and put it into your bottles at this point or use your eye dropper dispensers or whatever it is that you get it into your moles however I of course need to always get fancy so I'm gonna split this into two colors so I've got half of it translucent and half of it of the solid blue whoops all right so I'm just gonna eyeball this here if you want to be exact you can pour it into a measuring cup and split it exactly however I've been doing this from this pot for quite a while so I'm pretty good at it sometimes so because I mix the blue with the green because obviously the green from our can of syrup and our sugar so it's turned out a little bit greenish and I actually want this to be blue so I'm going to add in a little bit of blue color and then on 1/2 I'm going to add in white so this one I'm mixing in a few drops of blue you can use any kind of food coloring the gel base oil-based water base for this for this particular candy recipe does not matter so we're just gonna get that stirred in oh that's a pretty color you see it on the white that's nice that's a nice kind of teal color then in my other half I'm gonna pour in some of the blue the same kind of teal but this is gonna give me the solid background as the white now if you guys have white on hand make sure that you shake it really really well if it's hot it sitting for a while it does separate and you will find that if you pour it in you're gonna get a little tiny white it doesn't go well you get little white lumps or something like that it just doesn't blend really nicely so make sure to shake it really really well you can almost hear it come back together it's like you can almost hear the water at the top and then all kind of comes together and sounds a little bit thicker so I'm gonna pour a little bit of that in isn't that pretty so again you're just gonna thoroughly mix that in until it is one complete uniform color and once I've got that i'll get it into my bottles and we'll get this into the mold there's a little trick i learned the other day find it by Occident that's on most things happen so I'm if you want to have a half and half candy where you've got the clear on the bottom and the solid on the top what you can do to easily make that happen is use your hand blender on this we whip a bunch of air into it and once you put them together the air is all I'm automatically gonna bring the solid color up to the top or if you want to do that with the if you want it the other way around then air Rach you're clear but you're gonna have to wait a while for the bubbles to come out because that's gonna make it not so clear so I recommend just putting the solid on the back you can do that it's just a quick way of doing it otherwise you have to pour one layer let it set a little bit and then pour your second layer well aren't I just a cesspool of useless information today I'm just gonna pour this into my squirt bottle this should make a full almost a full bottle or a little bit more see bang almost right on now if you guys have to haven't seen these before these are the best squirt bottles ever they just make putting it into the mould so much easier especially if you want to blend colors absolutely highly recommend these I've got there's a link for them in the description there for you to make it easy if you'd like to order them and I'm just gonna do my clear and we'll get this going all right so I said I always do two colors I always like doing that so I did combination I'll either just whoosh or if you want to happen half you can do it that way you can go this way freestyle whatever you like and that's it get them all into your mold and you're gonna put them in the fridge for a minimum of two to four hours sometimes they've got to go overnight now if you let them go overnight and they're still sticking you can't get them out of the mold put them into the freezer for a few hours let them freeze up take one mold out of it I'd add out at a time and pop them out as quickly as possible if they still if there's still stop the first you'll come out if it starts to stick throw it back in the freezer work on another mold put them into a double boiler melt them down on low heat and add another tablespoon of gelatin melt it and recast them and that will fix that problem for you and that's it enough I'll come back low will pop these out so you can have a look at them and I'll show you how to sugarcoat them not that sugarcoating is that difficult but you can coat them with the can of sugar and just show you an easy way of doing it and that'll be it will say goodbye candies upset and you can do this in a bowl or I found that doing them in a large plastic bag worked a lot easier so in this I put a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar and I put a quarter part about a quarter cup of the flavored drink crystals that I used in my recipe again the drink crystals are totally optional for you just adds that little bit extra flavor and then I added about a half a teaspoon of citric acid because I wanted these to be a little bit more on this our side if you just want to have just a little bit of a tick bite but not really sour at all I add a quarter teaspoon so I'll do those two my sweet ones and then to the sour I use a 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid I don't recommend using much more than that one it's not going to the sour flavor isn't that great and it can also melt your candies because citric acid acid is water soluble so simple enough you can actually see it oh and I also have sorry a wire a wire rack with parts line o parchment paper line line on top of it for them to dry so I just pop them out these guys are popping out nicely and I get and what I do is I do one mold at a time so I leave the rest of them in the fridge because otherwise they start to warm up and they can makes it difficult sometimes for them to come out of the mall so I just think about one at a time and once I get them on the bag I go a little bit there and I just fish them out and shake off the excess sugar and we just lay them out to dry here just like all our other candies this is just a slightly smaller mold that I use same thing now see sometimes you'll do that and you'll see you think oh no they're not gonna come out they're stuck just pull the edges away and then they just they'll just come right out now if you do that and it doesn't come out that's when you would put them into the freezer so again you see that just around the edges to pull it away and they're good to go and that's about it I'm just gonna go through and sugarcoat the rest of these guys and then I'll be back to say goodbye well guys that's my little demo there on your cannon Candace Eric and sugar gummy bears I hope you enjoyed the demo as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to ask and thank you guys so much again for your support and let's get to the 50,000 whoo all right so you have an awesome rest of your day and thanks again for watching [Music]", "nBlBahN72YY": "[Music] hey out here in Cali visiting checking out some of the dispensaries and stuff out here I picked up this mystery baking company new canvas infused green apple strips there's a hundred milligrams in the whole bag and each piece is about ten milligrams so here you go right here nice little strip ten milligrams in here so since there's only 10 milligrams per piece and only 100 milligrams in the bag I kind of got to eat like the whole bag to get an effect which since I have a high tolerance this product is not the best for me it tastes delicious it's an awesome taste I love eating them but it just as imprudent enough if you're new to cannabis and cannabis edibles then this might be a nice one for you because it tastes good it's only ten milligrams for anyone that's accustomed to taking in cannabis not the best option go with something a little stronger not saying this company's bad just this product is not the best for someone that has a high tolerance so that's my review on the cannabis infused gummy strips by mystery baking company 100 milligrams and whole bag ten milligrams apiece not a huge fan tastes delicious though they taste they taste awesome they're so good I love eating them they just don't really give me the effect that I want", "hQ-2ooQuUkU": "[Music] hi and welcome to canada basics today we're going to learn how to make bubble hash [Music] bubble hash is one of the oldest and purest methods of making concentrated cannabis and uses only ice and water as a solvent it's easy to do but requires time patience and some elbow grease so let's get started here's what you need to make bubble hash when it comes to making bubble hash you are going to need some bubble bags and these are usually vinyl bags that are designed to fit inside of one gallon or five gallon buckets and they have a silk or micron screen bottoms and those that vary in different sizes 25 to 220 microns and you're going to need three to five different sizes of those you can find links to those kinds of bags on amazon in the description you're also going to need a wooden dowel to agitate the cannabis you're going to need some ice about 10 15 pounds of ice you're also going to need some cannabis you can use any grain of cannabis that you want for here we're going to use about three or four ounces of outdoor grown cannabis if you're using outdoor grown cannabis or any kind of cannabis you're going to go ahead and manicure it down to its buds so go ahead and pull off the major portion of the leaves until you get down to the pods unless you're actually using shake and trim which you can also make bubble hash out of shake and trim but we're using the buds and we're going to go ahead and manicure that down the next thing you're going to do is to layer your bags inside of the bucket we're using a five gallon bucket you may use a one gallon bucket also depending on the bags that you have but the thing that you want to do is you want to layer your screens inside of the bucket starting with the smaller screen first so in this case we've put our 25 micron screen in then we put our 73 micron screen in now we're putting our 160 micron screen in and then lastly we'll be putting our 220 micron screen back in and micron screens and that a micron is the measurement of microns with 220 microns means that 220 microns will fit through each hole in that screen and then so the smaller the number the smaller the size of the holes so and now that we've added our screens and layered them up and now we've added our cannabis into our 220 micron screen we've added about three or four ounces of cannabis and then now we're adding in ice now the ice is being used in this case to lower the temperature so that it freezes the trichomes and so that the stems of the trichomes are brittle and the trichome heads break off into the water so you want to use as much ice as possible so we're putting as much ice in we're covering up our cannabis and we're coming about six inches from the bottom of our pocket and now we're also going to add water and you want to add water so that it covers up into barely covers the cannabis which is in the the bottom of our top bag so you can tilt the screens or tilt the bucket to find out if see if you estimate if you have enough cannabis enough water to cover your cannabis but that's the idea is that you want to have enough water to cover your cannabis as well as up into the eyes and what we're doing is we're freezing the the trichomes so that the stems become brittle and the trichomes heads fall off and the idea is that to break and agitate the cannabis so now we're agitating turning and using our wooden dowels to actually literally just agitate and mix the cannabis being sure not to poke holes into our micron screens we're going to keep agitating as much as possible you can do this for several minutes 15-20 minutes or so and then after you do that you're going to let it settle and we've uh what we've done is we've broken frozen those trichrome heads and we've letting them uh fall into the water and then they've fallen through those micron screens and this larger micron screen we're now taking that out it's been several minutes after it's been agitated and it's been sitting for about 45 minutes and now we're taking out the the top screen the 220 micron and setting it aside and now we're going to pull up our first green which will have trapped some of the uh larger pieces of cannabis and our thc and trichomes and also some plant material so this first layer of screens that we're pulling out is going to be our least pure it's going to have our most plant material it's our biggest micron screen and most of the thc has actually fallen through this screen so but you can see there we've pulled out a little bit of bubble hash there and it's a darker color hash and then now we're pulling out our second screen and in order to uh save the cannabis that was left on the screen that we didn't wash off we're inverting it carefully and then dipping it back into the next green down into the water that's in that screen and that is to wash the trichomes off into that next screen so now we're removing the second screen out i believe this would be our uh 73 micron screen and we're we're letting the water fall out of that we're not going to squeeze it we're gonna let it fall out and then you can see now that the trichomes that are left there a little lighter color than the first set and there's also more of them and there's a lot less plant material here as you can see compared to the previous hash that came out it's a lot lighter color but again we're rinsing the remaining hashtag we didn't scrape off into the next batch or into the last screen so we make sure our screen is nice and clean and then we've come to our last screen and this is our 25 micron screen and we'll see this is the finest screen and this is going to make sure that pretty much anything left on here that's any thc is going to get trapped in this screen here and as we scrape that up you can see it's pretty easy to collect the cannabis or the thc that's collected there or the hash and it's a nice uh lighter a little more blonde color than the previous two a little bit more pure and you can see that's why those screens are used so that you can get different grades of hash and the next step now a lot of people would use a micro on screen here we didn't have a micron screen we're just using some cheese cloth or a muslin cotton muslin bag here and we're squeezing out the water it's just being pressed out gently with some palm pressure there to press out the water and what's going to be remaining is bubble hash and what we've got here is three different grades of bubble hash depending on the three different screens that we used and and in the end we're actually going to combine all of our hash altogether so i'm just showing you the different screens there for demonstration purposes but if you're only going to use one grade of hash in the end uh there's really no need to have multiple screens you might just use one or two screens in that case but for demonstration purposes we're using multiple screens to show how you'd get different grades of hash and now that we've uh we've gone one run of our canvas you can do this two or three different times or even up to five or more times with each batch of cannabis so this is the second run with the same batch of cannabis just with another run of the water and ice this one actually sat overnight this second run we got a pretty good yield off of it even better than the first and then we even decided to go ahead and run a third run off of the same batch of cannabis and so even after collecting two pretty good batches of bubble hash with it we went ahead and decided to go the third one and even after the third running we're still getting some more hash out of it you can see after the third time the cannabis is getting it looks like a lot like seaweed it's very foamy it get agitates a lot easier and it also gets foams up a lot easier as the last two or three batches were gone but once they pressed out the the phone goes away and you can see that there are three different batches of bubble hash there at different stages of drying out and you can see that the uh the newer batch is much muddier looking uh the batch in the center there is the first batch we did is dried out from overnight this episode of cannabis is brought to you by the roughhouse studios smoke shop selling raw rolling papers accessories vaporizers much more a great process save 10 off

subscribers [Music] having checked through all the great comments you've been leaving us and to mark our momentous rise to 10 000 subscribers we have created a definitive list of your top 10 favorite cannabis strains we do just have one question to ask though how can you tell how good a cannabis plant will be just from looking at a few of its seeds after all you only look at the seeds don't you that's what you bought them for so we did some research as to why you may have found the seeds of each strain so enticing and decided that it must have been on their potential potential that is if you accidentally happen to drop one of the seeds into a pot of nutrient rich and moist soil that is located in a warm place under a light bulb and that was also located in a well ventilated place so where shall we begin at number 10 on the list you voted for train wreck though starting out with a train wreck may not seem such a smart move especially if you enjoy travel this one's popular because of the powerful high and few negative side effects it seems to have a reputation for generating creativity and many comment that it has helped migraines general pain and arthritis gelato comes in at number nine with a word of caution for the uninitiated as this has a powerful hit physical relaxation seems to be the overarching theme while the ability to still function normally is a definite upside sitting at number eight on the list star dog is a winner with those of you who are looking for a good thc level at around 20 percent you guys seem to feel that this is a good choice for those of you suffering from fatigue stress or anxiety at number seven future one seems to hit the mark with those of you who are looking for something that leaves you feeling seriously relaxed apparently also helping to reduce feelings of depression a few of you mentioned the word chocolate and not just because of an attack of the munchies on to number six we have amnesia haze so how did it get its name maybe because it's high in thc and low in cpd levels the citrusy notes seem to go down well with you as does the boost of energy that gets delivered northern lights seems to be another popular choice with you and enters the list at number five perhaps because of its potential to reduce stress and counteract sleeplessness the slightly lower thc level makes this one more sophorific and more likely to create a feeling of blissfulness we're beginning to detect a theme here as this is another great strain that apparently induces a great feeling of being relaxed and happy rumor has it that this plant will also flower after just 45 days which is pretty quick in our opinion so maybe a good variety for those of you who are impatient girl scout cookies makes it comfortably onto the list at number four thanks to its ability to help users deal with pain while providing a full bodied hit of relaxation and mind-bending euphoria at number three we have gorilla glue also known as gg4 which has won many awards across the globe and has clearly been a big hit with you as well this is one of those highly potent strains that helps to deliver a thumping dose of euphoria and relaxation which will leave you feeling glued to whatever you are sitting or lying on bruce banner is near the top of our list at number two and works quickly with a heavy hit and then settles down into a euphoric and creative buzz it also seems to be popular with daytime users before we move on to the coveted top spot voted for by you it would only be right to mention a few honorable entries sour diesel didn't quite make it on the list but deserves a mention through its ability to make users feel uplifted euphoric and generally happy while still feeling full of energy your comments also indicated potential for helping with stress and depression we also couldn't completely leave out ghost train haze primarily because of the reports of its inducing a strong sense of creativity and ability to still concentrate heavily some of you also mentioned about its possible help with pain and depression but those prone to anxiety should give this one a pass so back to it and the clear winner is wait for it wedding cake an unforgettable journey into the land of delight begins with a single taste of this indica dominant super potent fiend of a strain its family line oozes sweet and sour earthy scents with unmistakable vanilla aromas and old skunky undertones it would seem that this one delivers the strongest high followed by a deep and overwhelming sense of relaxation now isn't that what many of us are looking for apart from loose change down the back of the sofa and there you have it and we do hope you've enjoyed this video and while these are the top 10 strains of cannabis based on what you've had

sketchy thc e-liquid going about so today i thought i'd make a video about why you should sort of stay clear of thc e-liquid now quickly before we get into this video quick message from our sponsor of the day the goods yo the goods have been such an amazing sponsor of the channel so it's always good to have them back on here and yo they have some of the most amazing cbd vapes that you could ever imagine and they've got a bunch of new flavors recently i'm super super hyped to try this draw on honor because everyone's been telling me that's dank and i haven't tried it yet i'm waiting for it to arrive so hopefully in the next video it should have arrived so i can give you guys my thoughts on it but for the time being if you want to check out the goods the link for them will be in the pinned comment down below so i get messages all the time saying something along the lines of hey drew do you know about these fake thc carts going about hey drew do you know about these thc carts with spice in them so i thought i'd make a whole video just going through my thoughts on sort of these comments and explain to you guys what i think and how you can avoid stuff and just stuff to keep in mind in the future really so if you don't know about this this has been a thing for a very long time all the way back since like 2014. these vapes started popping up which were basically like spice vapes they'd be sold online on the internet as something called sea liquid and basically it's just like synthetics in a vape and then basically selling it as a legal high it's basically legal high but as a vape so these have been around for a long time and they're really not something that you ever want to come in contact with because if you do end up coming into contact with it you do end up smoking some of it it will not be a nice experience these chemicals that they put inside those vapes are insanely strong and they're not safe and like some of them aren't even like cannabinoids a lot of people like to think oh you know synthetics are just like cannabinoids so it should be fine no no no we've gone way past the cannabinoid point of synthetics like a lot of these vapes will not even have like synthetic cannabinoids in them they'll just be synthetic drugs in general that you are vaping so that's been a thing for a long time but in the last two years it's kind of propped up that a lot of new users a lot of people who don't really know anything about vapes or you know people just trying to prey on new people in the cannabis scene we'll try and sell them this spice liquid and say that it's thc now i get messaged a lot about this and to be honest most of the time when i get messaged about this unfortunately it's usually really young people like people who don't really know much better people who aren't in like the actual cannabis scene and people who just think like hey i want to get a thc e-liquid you know it seems like a reasonable thought but to the untrained person who doesn't know about all this stuff you could be sold one of these things and then it could end up [ __ ] your life up but the thing is as well i kind of hate when people call these fake thc carts because they're not it'd be like the same thing as if somebody has some ketamine at a party and then they come up to you and they say hey man you want to do this line of coke and then you do it you've not done fake coke you've done ketamine right like somebody has been an [ __ ] and has spiked you essentially and i guess i'd probably think differently if people were like making a brand and like you know there was like this brand of thc e-liquid which was actually spice you know but i'm pretty sure that's not a thing i'm pretty sure most of the time it's just people buy this spice liquid branded as spiced liquid then they're trying to sell that to people and trying to lie to them and say that it's thc which i wouldn't quite see that as saying oh it's fake thc liquid as much as i would say it's someone just trying to drug you but okay listen to me here that is not the only reason why you shouldn't buy thce liquids so even before the whole spice thing came about i've been trying to tell people that thce liquids just aren't worth it like they're really not so when you think about it in this way it might make you change your perspective on it but think about it for a second right if you have a thc e-liquid it has to be mixed with something it has to be mixed with like pg or vg essentially when you're mixing it stuff you're making it weaker and i'm not gonna lie like every real thc e-liquid that i've ever tried has been insanely weak but you kind of have to hit it the same amount of times as you'd hit a joint to be able to get the same feeling from it and when you're doing that with a vape it's not the most comfortable thing in the world especially when most people who are vaping are trying to like you know just have one or two hits while they're outside or walking around like it just doesn't feel quite right to like sit there with a thc e-liquid and chong it just as much as you do on a joint it just really doesn't feel right and then you've got to keep in mind that shout out carts are a thing right and to be honest shack hops can be just as like iffy to buy especially if you're buying like a branded one i guess that's kind of the difference with the thc e-liquids in the carts because the thc eliquids are pretty much always going to be unbranded but the carts are always going to be branded now obviously carts are dangerous for a different reason like obviously there was the whole vitamin e acetate stuff that happened with you know a bunch of carts having that in it and it you know messing people's lungs up so that's a whole nother story so i mean personally i try and stay away from branded shatter cartridges and also you know the e-liquids in general but if consuming in that way is exactly what you're looking for and you're from the uk honestly the safest way to do it is to buy an empty cartridge that allows you to just put straight up shatter in it so you can get these types of cartridges from loads of places i've even made a video called making my own wax cart so you should definitely check that out if you're interested but essentially you can buy your wax from a certified saucer you know the wax is on point good because honestly it's an extremely rare thing to have like contaminated waxes it's more of like a i guess you could have the issue of having like bad wax with butane in it still but if you're buying rosin it's relatively the safest way you could ever do stuff so imagine you've got yourself your rosin you've got yourself a cartridge all you've got to do is heat up your rosin to the point where it goes a bit liquidy pour that into the cart put the lid on it and away you go you've got a safe cartridge that you know is 100 real and you know it's going to get you stoned as well because one hit on it is going to make you feel like you've just done a dab so for those reasons that's what i would say to stay away from thc e-liquid especially in the uk especially right now i definitely definitely wouldn't be going near it and that's not even just on the safety standpoint it's also just on the standpoint of you know if you're a smoker and you have a high tolerance thce liquids ain't going to do [ __ ] for you oh and yeah there's a reason why cbd e-liquids work so well in comparison to like a thc e-liquid when you normally intake cbd you use a tiny amount of it so the ratios of when you've mixed the cbd with the pg and the vg it comes out to still being really strong in comparison but if you had thc at that same level of the cbd it ain't doing anything i mean i mean it will do stuff but it's just not going to be what you're expecting it to be so people just before i go i want to know what your thoughts are on thc eliquids in the comments down below have you ever had any issues with like the spice liquids or anyone trying to sell you something dodgy or just in general you haven't really liked them or maybe you like them maybe you really love thc liquids i would love to know in the comments down below so save one for that people i'll see you guys very soon i'll be live streaming later on tonight at 9 00 pm so like you're always on the phone i sell a toxic what you do the

stomach condition I still have to this day a camera came along and I was super bubbly and I was part on the usual prescribed medications but I was 16 world so medications didn't necessarily have a great agreement with my body back then as my body was still developing my family doctor that had been my family doctor since I was a child at that point recognized the issues that I was going through and identified that there was another substance that could possibly help he would be unable to prescribe that substance but he would suggest that I would maybe explore alternative avenues a substance that he mentioned to me was cannabis and that was 18 years ago that set me on this path that I'm on today currently I did lose my wear for a few years along that path but by 2012 2013 I was back on the path of medical use cannabis making my life better cannabis making people around me life better and when my dad passed away in 2013 I was left with inheritance money and a lot of know-how of cannabis own and how to help people basically and that was what my incentive was I never got into this to make money or go into this to basically help people and seeing the end of care life that my dad had seen the end of care life that my granddad and other people that had around me and I just wanted to make a difference if I could make a tiny little bit of difference to someone's last two weeks on earth that was all that it meant to me that we world was far greater to be able to help people I had two children that came along one in 2012 one in 2014 there was literally times where I had

understand how we operate are we able to operate the thing that this was given to me how this was easy if they understood the amount of time and effort and money its took to get to this point the

manifested in a field that was free a lot like what we see now wasn't going on back when I was doing this there was no real social media pages that were advertising cannabis there was definitely no Instagram following or was no Facebook following the page itself had very I think I had 54 followers for about six months that was and one of them was Cleveland police so literally it was a Facebook group and it was every Sunday a talk and talk a flat lane and 30 people turned up and from that there he people it spread to three hundred people over six months and then the first festival happened and then a bit more of meetings died down for winter in 2014 2015 spring back up again I would dog events getting my attention by the end of 2015 we were ready to open all the first books tomorrow

people enjoy music and relax over here we have a movie room normally a Saturday tends to be this is the busiest room people enjoy movies like relax and unwind the room next to us here which we've got a lot of people in but we can't film call me that's the spot where people watch boxing football all that sort of thing these gentlemen enjoy just playing computer games this is the computer room just to chill out and relax and then we call on Miss web and we come along too this is normally the music area that we would have here so we have people's army that would be playing instruments our practice and jamming for gigs upcoming gigs or whatever in here also a vaporizer and bum area this is the water closet some of the depression sands and the warning signs that we had issued upon well maybe should show soon the fact that we also have healthy men healthy women it's all about mental well-being not just physical well-being time reduction and meeting with partners and working with patents and then we head down to the main room and this is the main area this is where patients and members of come along they'll speak to the bud tender which today is salmon salmon we'll talk them through what what looking for if the recreational user then they won't be looking from which I advise if there are medical user anything else not like skin creams bombs all yours doesn't have to be just kind of as flower product salmon can help and advise them of all of that we have some merchandise over here which are cups t-shirts bath bombs or CBD body butter bombs you name it pretty much what you see in all the other CBD shops and other things we offer every alternative from edibles to vaporization anything to stop people actually haven't allowed kind of Joan but as people enjoy counter pressing spliffs core so naturally with it like a cook goes with a cup of tea that's just the way the world is and in terms of how we operate their day this is how we'd sign up this is our membership form so once you've signed up we would ask a member basically to come in give us the details accept the rules Sandro's the man pull off on the way basically the good because as long as we're seeing the two farms about everything is good we go with them well smokin our combustion of any kind at this point except vaporization and then if salmon would pass me the keys I will take it how this doll never get to opened ever this is literally a stuffed doll but we will take you down to this would be I brought you in from the sidebar which is the back of the building so taking us out here we'll bring this out under the high street which literally is come out here if you look down that where and if you look up this way you see at the bottom end of Stockton High Street Stockton High Street is the widest High Street in the UK apparently and we're at the end of it here currently and this is our bulletin cannabis is medical or recreational no matter who you are we're creational users are still medical users the same guy that goes and drinks a paint a couple of paints after work in a pub he's a recreational user of alcohol but he's not even medical use of alcohol he's not recreational because he's obviously using it to relax and unwind same as people who can't depressants okay any anxiety medications do the same thing people who use cannabis are using cannabis and functioning members of society every single member on our books of functioning members of society to pay the taxes and the contribute contribute for some of the people that I saw I'm watching this right now they are paying for you yet you want to look down your nose and say these people aren't contributing our members are Barclays bank managers adult social workers Adult School teachers and/or like and secondly school any assessment or health nurses normal nurses we haven't got any doctors that are know of on the currently but you name it we've got pretty much someone on our books you'd be supposed to have got ex-police that use this facility we actually appeal to people that you would never know small kind of us the people that you've seen tonight coming in and out of here and even here we never know a small campus about the vote side that's where we stand in a people for these people we provide safe cannabis consumption rooms for adults to consume cannabis in a safe social setting they can also purchase cannabis that has grown via the members and then we just agree with very the club back to the members at a price and the price is cheaper than the black-market cheaper than the street there's a lot more variation and shows available for the members which is one of the incentives from the SIOP we charge 25 pounds for the air for people a sign up renews the premises and then the three-pound concession free basically MP fee charged the woman in Deer egg I'm going to the club basically I never set this up we've wanted to make money as to because the sounds working with Ronald Hogg in their early days it was literally provide safe consumption rooms for the audience to consume cannabis what we found without was after trial in that method the original model that we were operating under allowed for a lot of criminal elements to basically enter into that market a lot of our members at that time suffered with autism epilepsy and develop a debilitating illnesses that were literally end-of-life care basically and the last thing that they needed was to be sat in a club with a bunch of people that would not normally associate with them in normal social settings and it was quite unnerving for them and I took this on board explain this to Durham Police and Ronald Hogg no matter what you've were you sitting on the fence if you need safe controlled access to cannabis we would like to provide that so the key was to remove that criminal element we basically set up a plan in order to supply the cannabis internally via the club itself and we just a Buick to the members it was easier said than done and like anything in practice obviously there's a lot of things that need tweaking and changing so we re looked at the model again reworked the model we've come to the point now where now where we have a set limit on the amount of cannabis that can be purchased to certain limit on the amount of edibles and the hash that can be purchased and the club makes the same amount on every transaction that it makes no matter whether you've purchased the calendar we purchased the cameras for a member between normally between 100 pound 160 pound an ounce is what we will pay the club makes its same 60 pound regardless of what appeared first and foremost people from the outside will look as a cannabis social club but were much more than a kind of a social club where the harm reduction center and that's every aspect not just coming to support everything all these people that were out there telling me I was doing a good thing went one stand on the front man with me all the people that were telling me I was doing a terrible thing and saying I was going to get locked up I believed him they thought that I was mad I genuinely thought I was getting locked up or genuinely believed that I was going to get locked up but I believed in my heart more than anything that these things should be available there should be in every estate in every town in every country Columbus affects everybody's life and I think that the sooner people start to realize that I think it's amazing when we look at the world now we'll just in the last six years since I started out cannabis was a taboo word literally people runnin out I couldn't get businesses to talk to me I couldn't get businesses to support me I spent far terms buying products in to give away in competitions now literally I can pour on a business or email a business in 70 seconds grab my ear to me we get three guns before stuff dropped off and delivered to us to give away people want to be part of this and associated with this it's not hard to open a club so that's one of the first things I want to put out there to people when the buildin invites some people around you've got yourself a club staying open stay odd part it wasn't given for me I was told countless times I was going to be read in the shut down it's down to the individual that keeps that wall up and no one keeps it with him this club Excel and everything that it's done in the Northeast another knock-on effect on the cannabis culture the criminal cannabis tree was in the area and that stands up for itself and if you look up the police arrest if you look up the police money like the spend anonymous this is the way if I would the save money to get your pretty sparse as backup a woman being a pillar of the community and being feeling safe in the community is to save money or not police and cannabis that's what Durham Police did what pointing reporting something for a slap on the wrist a diversion so the Check Point initiative was something that Ronald hugged well in which has now been used in Northwest checkpoint initiative diverts you from the criminal justice system to a health care system that's what we're focused on is the health care system here you don't realize you judge people because there's a stigma attached that stigma has done more harm than I have seen anything there's people on radio people on the news that are doing more harm then cannabis has ever done and they're [ __ ] millionaire sorry for swearing in a million years it's ludicrous that people are still buying this rhetoric the government has spent eight years telling people this planet is dangerous and bad now listen because it's profitable and there's money to be made from other countries making billions of pounds we've got Coronation Street EastEnders I'm Adele all the major things like Jeremy kale that we worked on all these things is to desensitize the masses it's part of the propaganda put for people it all of a sudden think well I was told this drug was does this this would create like leading me on how to drugs are quick and this all the other issues in my life and then all of a sudden to say I don't watch any of the sobs but we'd say Sandra who's been packed buying 20 pound of cannabis to treat epilepsy or a treat some bad back chronic disease or something and that's how people who start so our oldest members now 84 year old 2018 the first November medical cannabis come in the supply on people get an access to it and on the I get an access to wait why is it so expensive now we can undercut criminal gangs then undercut the black market well your Big Pharma so expensive so these places like here the government might not necessarily want a big family might not necessarily want because they bridge the gap for people that need access to cannabis a cheap affordable place and that's the key this conversation needs to be had on a halt I think medical cannabis needs to maybe loosen up some of its some of its restraints and the pace is definitely needs to come down but also I think it's really important that people are aware that the choices that they make when the Whorton for the crown commission in the local area can have a knock-on effect so I was very fortunate that in the beginning of my journey and Mayor story that a gentleman whose mom passed away the late Ronald hog Police Crime Commission of the Durham he had a very similar thought process not just to cannabis but to every drug every sort that was out there he approached me and asked me to meet with him into him took him up on that opportunity and our counter didn't as a very first friend when he passed away he went above and beyond what what I would have ever expected and there was definitely no was on them divided this was a man that put yourself on the line why was in office to give people like me people like you a choice and a voice to be able to consume cannabis however you choose [Music]",

so i'm literally on my knees right now but it's all good it's all good i didn't give a [ __ ] class right now i got such an amazing strain right here to make you shake your pants all right so got another new strain not from ct pharma little cg farm include you like what the [ __ ] you talking about credit anyways we'll get to that so care leaf has been dropping off some strains as you can see a lot of the producers actually been dropping off some [ __ ] down the healing corner truly don bristol connecting with dispensary best dispensary the whole entire universe hands down i've been to a couple another planet they weren't that good um and boy are we going off to space today um very fitting so today we got a strength from cureleaf here leaf came out with strain they want a little two gram things which sounds good it's called the aquamarine let's see aquamarine and you'd be like what is the aquamarine well the aquamarine which is clocking at 26 thc well it was what get that again dr marine is the kiwi candy kiwi candy that's the main tie across the apple fritter my pad across the upper kiwi candy sounds awesome it's only 20 bucks for the two grams these shits these two grams cost me 100. i made some moon rocks and two grams of [ __ ] moon rocks from here that's right so we took the kiwi candy we [ __ ] coated that in some [ __ ] aj sour diesel [ __ ] oil soaked in the aj sour diesel and then we rolled that and the aj saudi easels from their plant so we're kind of cross screening a little three-way trifecta here we got the carolee flower the kiwi candy soaked in the aj sour diesel thera plant greniva oil coated in the ct pharma tetradine seattle sour cush keef these shits could be the bomb look what the [ __ ] you been hundred dollars or two can go no i made these i made these rocks so technically you can't really get these exact same ones but you can produce them just like i did if you want to kind of match me um and if you think about it moon racks are expensive but even if you go like if you were able to actually access these things from a dispenser you're going to spend about 50 bucks a gram anyway these ones are going to be good i know because i made them so that's why i'm excited about that all right so let's check this [ __ ] the [ __ ] out and uh blast off time all right so again i haven't tried these yet i made them i put them in the fridge that i'm soaking set and here we go oh my god all right so the smell is ridiculous you can smell a ton of that oil smell that aj saudis oh that's actually freaking out and then you get this it's just like just strong like it's it's not it's not fruity it's sourish smell and they smell a lot of that kush melt in the tetrahedron you honestly don't get much of that the kiwi candy smell because i think it's just covered up in all the stuff so i'm gonna check these [ __ ] out wow yeah yeah okay so yeah okay [ __ ] yeah all right did i really just touch that [ __ ] on my [ __ ] jacket actually then probably knocked the moon rock off and i don't even know about it one two three i honestly don't know who the [ __ ] knows they probably got a moon rack somewhere on the floor here right in my pocket in my pocket all right anyways look at these [ __ ] shine like yeah what okay yeah son all right so we got some moon rocks here we got some [ __ ] moon rocks these [ __ ] these [ __ ] are just shining like diamonds so again i i made move rocks like this look at the crew i made these extra oily get my straws i've made moon rocks a couple times look at the oils nice nice i've made moon rocks a couple times and uh look at that really [ __ ] wow look at that big clump oil right there it's probably anyway my occasion piece and obviously no that's going to happen so we got right here i'm going to do one little moon rock obviously but these shits like you said these shits right here i made these before i mean you crack these [ __ ] open they're stinky like like look at that like you're saying they're sticky they're oily they're super keefed up in like like you see all the black stuff that's all the oil the pumpkins are almost through the keef okay i even got a little bit of [ __ ] some butter spots mashed up in there look at that [ __ ] so these shits are guaranteed to medicate you out the [ __ ] ass um i mean they're expensive as [ __ ] i mean but they're just awesome i mean look at these things look at the whole perspective like those are if you got that for a hundred bucks at a dispensary you probably wouldn't actually be that upset about it realistically i wouldn't i'm like [ __ ] yeah let's just look at the bomb and they are the bomb um i mean so you should cut in half like figure one two three four five six seven so you take those three and those strings split that big boy in half for 50 bucks a piece would you buy that yes i would i mean i wouldn't second i'm gonna shoot [ __ ] fire all right so very excited about these [ __ ] very excited um like i said and they're nice i mean they're they're good they're solid they're chunky i soak them what i use what i do is i take my bud i squirt obviously comes in syringes i squirt the oils on through and through like a little bit here and here i mean i took what i took was the two grams it's technically like any i took two grams of like product to two grams i took a milliliter off the oil and then uh i took a gram and a keef so if you're two grams of flour gram to keep probably about a half gram equivalent of oil um and then like if they just sprinkle it on and then i put it into the heat container i just kind of press the buds and i roll it with my dabber press it but the trick is and then you got to take it out and then i take the extra oil having here because i don't use it all up once and i stick it on again and then i dip them again so you double dip the [ __ ] and that's where you really get the stickage i press hard with my fingers like pressing them into the key so it just kind of like flake off if you want to get that real moon rex texture that's basically what i do all right guys i'm going to grab this little guy right here this piece right here is going to be my med piece and break that up in two balls and uh i'm excited as [ __ ] moon rocks yeah care leaf airplane and ct farmer in a sense the one i really didn't get here was agm you know i was thinking actually about grabbing like a little bit of their shad or something sprinkling in the mix but like then you're going past the point of where it's actually you know costing more than you would if you had to get it commercially so i'm fine with matching the price point for scientific purposes i don't exactly want to go past point to make it just like over you don't want to overdo anything i guess is what i'm saying all right all right let's pack these [ __ ] up these shit's gonna be nice these shits are gonna be nice now some people handle their moon rocks with like gloves or chopsticks or tweezers all a good idea to be honest with you like it's not really because [ __ ] when you break it up it's gonna stick right to your fingers and you're kind of pissed like you like [ __ ] dance on my fingers like you know but just let me know so when you see people breaking them [ __ ] up like that like why did there's actually a good reason like i'm gonna do is shoot my fingers i'll probably lose a little bit of product on my fingers but it is what it is also with the moon rocks i don't completely break up the buds like into little pieces i kind of just break them into like sections if you will wow all right i should show you what the inside my god that shit's is all right so look hey hold on sorry guys all right so i broke this [ __ ] open look that's what the inside looks like as [ __ ] so you wonder what it looks like there you go nice right these are real deals no mess around here all right let me put this [ __ ] down because one shit's all stuck to my finger right now okay sitting there holding on to the thing sorry all guys all right so nice because that breaks in like sections if you will okay oh there's smaller bowls but crazy balls all right there's a little one here's bowl too a little air space in between the balls don't don't pack on tight because it's just going to get gooey you don't want to clag up your bowl definitely pissed if you [ __ ] up all that my word let's do this [ __ ] so word so wow now i taste that flour but a lot like kiwi candy is nice there's so many flavored spices going on my mouth right now i'm getting so edited good job greg well holy [ __ ] them shits are good all right so again i mean i'm not even sure how much of a medicinal product this is because it's really taken from zero to like not even a hundred from like zero to like a thousand it's like way off the scale so you can't even see any of the charts like that's how it hits you i'm [ __ ] wicked medicare most of this is like a sativa i just [ __ ] fantastic right now i want to laugh i want to giggle and it's still just creeping up and i can feel all this weed just building up my system i mean i can't even tell you what the stream would be good for unless you want to just get [ __ ] you know like listen i need to get medicated hard right i can feel it on my face right now like i'm looking at myself from the camera my face feels like it's going like

bowl number one nice wow holy [ __ ] i apologize she's making sweat [Music] [Music] i will make it so uh i can't [ __ ] breathe all right i don't even want people to smoke these things these are too strong if you don't smoke weed don't ever smoke moon rocks they'll kill you hey i'm out gee c2 reviews peace oh my god", "7FWbbaelBuE": "today we're going to take a look at a couple of reports from benzinga on some legal issues there's a cbd chain that can sue visa the credit card uh processor for terrorizing its business and then we're also going to take a look at how a pet cbd supplier can proceed with claims in a 100 million dollar lawsuit since we've got katrina glogowski angel investor and attorney to kind of go through that with us we're going to kind of see how the industry is normalizing with lawsuits welcome back to the talking hedge i'm josh kinkade capital markets analyst and host of your cannabis business podcast katrina thanks for being back with us right let's take a look at um a couple of these articles the pet cbd supplier can proceed with claims in a 100 million dollar suit but before we get to that i want to look at visa because we all hate getting charged per uh per transaction or at least the small businesses that that have to pay that due so there's a cbd chain that is able to sue for terrorizing its business so this could open up a whole new slew of suits with a brand new case law so originally published on weed week and appearing on benzinga looks like a missouri-based cbd chain expressed relief this week after a federal judge ruled that they could continue pursuing unjust enrichment and defamation claims against visa which has been accused of terrorizing their business among other claims they say the credit card giant arbitrarily placed them on a transaction block list this is a big issue for cbd companies josh and it has to do with the mucky muck of uh federal regulation connected to banks and this is one of the effects yeah not many businesses can be can sell you know 66 000 worth of product and not get paid for it and that's exactly what happens so the suit alleges that visa withheld 66 000 in payment and then fined them 25 000 and cut off transactions involving the business after wrongfully determining that it was involved in illegal activities so i guess the defendants had filed several motions and claims that were dismissed uh that the cbd chain allowing the cbd chain to go after the unjust enrichment and defamation yeah i mean that happens in in everyday industry like construction for example you might have a subcontractor who has a change request order and then you put in a new 25 000 beam and then the the main contractor says no we didn't authorize that and so some small business isn't getting paid i mean that happens a lot but it's through the inefficiencies and lack of communication really whereas this is about law right even though we have the the farm bill that passed we still don't have banking and so there's all of these independent businesses like visa making rash decisions to withhold funds and not pay things because they don't understand so i don't know is that normalizing are we moving forward well this article does state that the lawsuit was filed two years ago so that would have been in 2018 uh and uh i have not read the actual pleadings in this case uh but uh in in early 2020 um the the government did try to address this by saying that hemp uh was was not regular was not against the law hemp is fine uh but of course cbd continues to be out there josh the fda just will not issue rulings on cbd and as a result it creates a gray area you and i talk all the time about the fact that you can buy cbd from walgreens or bartels or whole foods or any other little corner kwik-e-mart that you go to uh and use your credit card uh obviously you can use your credit card at walgreens for example so if you can use your credit card at walgreens to buy cbd what is the issue when you go to an e-commerce site to buy the exact same product and i do think that uh discrimination may be appropriate uh here for on the part of visa again i haven't read the pleadings but it's just a reality you can buy cbd everywhere yeah so i guess since this lawsuit was filed before that farm bill passed and you know subsequent issues with federal you know banking availability i'm not sure if they're going to drop this or how that's going to work out but i guess they're just trying to figure how the impact on cbd and hemp companies are going to work with financial institutions kind of um yeah it's interesting how long this takes to play out and all of the changes that happen so fast this continues to be a problem if you have uh if you sell cbd products online this is an issue today yeah it shouldn't be but it still is um and so looking at this other case for cbd supplier proceeding with the 10 million dollar suit i think this one happened here locally if i'm not mistaken but yeah seattle-based cbd manufacturer can move forward to claims of anticipatory repudiation of a violation of connecticut trade law so in which the judge dismissed the claim for declaratory relief am i saying that right do i i don't even know what i'm talking about here territory relief yeah it looks like uh there's a um an exclusive maker of a cbd pen and not like a vape pen i thought it was a vape and i'm like how are you gonna get dogs to inhale a vaporizer but it's it's actually a syringe so it's not a pen that i'm thinking of like actually i think i got one in my pocket here so it's not like you know these these vape pens it's more like a syringe so they put in an order for 75 000 um and i guess that was 10 million dollars worth but they only earned 1.1 million through the deal well short of the 6 million per year that they were supposed to get in 2019 and 2020 and 21 that was stipulated by the contract so um obviously they want that uh the lawsuit to be dismissed trying to get that move forward um josh this is the normalization argument uh that you were making uh breach a contract is reach a contract you're good you have committed to buy one million of these pens or whatever the exact numbers are and if you do not buy one million of those pens after promising to do so you would better comply with the terms of the contract uh to get out of it and if you don't you're on the hook for one million pens simple contract law this is the industry normalizing uh it and they say that there were some quality control issues and uh led to customer complaints but the issue before the the court in this particular pet case is going to be did they comply with the terms of the contract to cancel and or repudiate the goods and if they didn't they're on the hook yeah i remember us talking about a verbal agreement down in california and i think it was i don't know if it was um it was some rapper and i don't know if it was burner or uh green thumb dr green thumb um but regardless like if you have contracts and then they don't fulfill those contracts that's one thing but at least it's better than the issues we've seen in the past where was like some verbal agreement you know and you have you don't have any contract whatsoever so for whatever reason they either found that you know this particular sku wasn't selling and they got out of it you know but this yeah this is fairly normal if you don't fulfill your obligation you're gonna get sued and so here we are kind of normalizing a 10 million dollar lawsuit yeah all right i guess we'll kind of see what happens with this it's a ongoing litigation so i'm just going to come back to the talking hedge and find out i want to thank my guest katrina gulgowski angel investor and attorney thanks for being back on the podcast thanks josh with that we're going to roll this one up i'm josh kinke this is the talking hedge don't forget to like share and subscribe or don't hand them out don't forget to

completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver

what they say for the percentage pokemagic.ca yeah it's 20.86 yeah they got some weird like packaging error it says 20 it says 208.6 was she with 20.86 i wonder if that's a special i get a special container this one let's go to it's got erroneous packaging on there i wonder if i could do something about that hmm so i'm reading a review sorry i'm getting distracted by the reviews but this puff the magic site good it's got some nice detailed reviews so according to puff the magic would they reckon would they buy us training again no they say while ice cream cake is but in diva delivered an enjoyable experience the strain effects do not stand out for us they suggest something similar with good supplies monkey glue and they changed the score score was 8.13 now it's 7.96 so let's say lower the score that's interesting but you know what i don't know i just had i just had a little sesh and it feels nice it's a nice chill relaxed indica dominant buzz i want that misprint on the packaging is unusual to me i've never seen that it's like strange i almost kind of want to look that up now to see what happens like it's totally wrong the thc is 5.1 milligrams or total thc two point twenty two hundred eight point six like it's so off but they've completely scripted packaging i don't wanna go i'm gonna check out i'm gonna go down in into this actual website to see what they say that's a whole other thing i'm done with this session for today it's a nice little chill relaxed buzz it's first blaze of the day at five so i'm gonna go enjoy this and read up on why the packaging is completely wrong on this", "RQppj42jV7M": "what is up it's your boy chronic i don't know how much of this you guys are going to be able to see in my face i'm going to try to angle it just right um it's your boy chronic we're back with another how-to so this time we are doing dry ice hash so as you can see i have dry ice in here um i've got my trim this is just just all the excess trim that was uh from hera so this is jack herrera trim we're going to be using one of the this is the 220 micron bag i have a set of bubble bags that i use and basically what i do is i go ahead and make sure all of this is in here and it doesn't slide out i make sure that i've got it all in this container sitting on this dry ice make sure it's uh really getting cold and then from here i go ahead and i give this a nice tie and now there are easier setups this is just my setup this is what works for me um you know this is just how i do it it's easiest for me you guys will see here in a second now another important thing i'm going to bring you guys over here hopefully you guys see this is this collection tray you definitely want a collection tray of some sort that's like a stainless steel or medical grade stainless steel or something uh you can collect with and uh the last thing you'll need is hey would you be able to grab me one of my business cards can you have a second okay last thing you'll need is a card to collect with i use a business card uh they're clean it's easy so let's uh start the process so basically i'm gonna scoot over towards you guys bring you guys a little bit closer and angle this down hopefully that stays there basically you just uh flip this over as you can see i mean all of that already and you wow and you basically just shake it up you just give it some tumbles thank you sweetheart business card keep it close to the tray uh basically guys you're gonna do this dry ice hash sifting for about 30 to 45 seconds maybe a minute until the color starts to change once the color starts to change that's when you're going to go ahead and collect you know do your first collection move it off and then do your second collection um basically as uh wow there's so much here as there as a it collects and breaks down with this dry ice more plant matter is going to come out so it's going to be more uncured so i usually do about 30 seconds um to 45 seconds minute tops for my first run because this is all trim and i know a lot of this is actually pretty quality i'm gonna go ahead and just do a minute so we're going to keep shaking just for a little bit longer i'm going to do my first collection and show you guys what we got so i generally also go based on the color tone so i am not only watching uh or counting in my head just like you know how i i am at i'm watching the color of the hash that's actually coming out so we're gonna go ahead and stop so i generally set this off to the side just like that take our collection card and we start collecting and we just have mounds and mounds and bounds of hash so this is uh the way to collect dry dry ice hatch guys so you're gonna watch me a few more times basically uh do this and i'm gonna do the rest with uh the rest of hera and i'll come back after i uh you know you guys will see the time lapse and everything of that but this is basically the general concept um 30 to 45 second intervals one minute max you really want to watch your color color is everything your nice golden tones are where you want to be sitting for your first run your your mid golden tones with a little green is where you want to be sitting your second run more green towards your third and fourth runs fairly green on your fifth and sixth run uh the seventh run i usually just don't even do i put the the material uh to use by doing edibles or putting it in my magic butter machine so that's how i make use of the last little bit of material that has trichomes on it so there's that so that is what we just collected um we're going to go ahead and do a second run don't do that guys do not do that barely got any out so we're going to scoot this over generally i don't like mixing these so i do actually press these separately these are my different press runs they all taste different they all have different quality for sure i press at about 190 degrees to 200 degrees for about 100 seconds and uh right now i'm using 90 micron i usually do 35 micron for hash but i have to use what i have to use uh so yeah that's what i'm using you guys will see that in the next video this one's just going to be uh the dry ice hash extraction so we're going to go for round two and it's looking mighty golden and nice still so that's a good sign lots and lots and lots and lots of heat so guys another key thing um you want to freeze your product before you actually use it this trim has been sitting in the freezer since i actually trimmed her um it was dried and cured everything was dried in here not cured sorry everything was dry so it was all dry product proper humidity um i didn't trap any moisture any unwanted anything unwanted but i definitely uh i definitely froze on my product the next bit of run we're going to be using is actually sitting in the freezer now i always suggest freezing it um you know the colder the bud the easier the trichomes are going to fall off you don't want to make it too too cold um you know you don't want to keep in the freezer for prolonged periods of time you can damage the trichomes you know a lot of people think crypto freezing is actually like really good to store your butt there's actually studies that show it it reduces the potency over time so you know there's generally if i'm gonna process um right away you know within that first three to five days i will go ahead and put my stuff straight to the freezer from um you know trimming however if i'm not going to process i go ahead and cure my bud or cure whatever i want to cure and um once it's you know cured i'm ready the day before i'll throw it in the freezer you know that way it has 24 hours to sit so we're gonna go ahead and stop this is gonna be our second collection i'm gonna kind of scoot it away from this edge here so i can set this down man just loads and loads and loads of thc guys just insane set that down right there you know what i actually have a tool for this let me grab it i don't even know why i'm not using it alrighty so now that i got my actual scraper that uh is designated for this because i'm a dingus i forgot i had it um oh my god look how easy that is the card was i was struggling with the card all right guys so there's our second run looking nice and uh pretty still gold still fairly golden brown golden still fairly tan like a sandy color with a little bit of green that's what i want so we're gonna go for our third one here in a second and i'll show you guys what it looks like and then i'm gonna get to doing uh more more dry sift hash here's the third one we're gonna same thing 30 to 45 seconds maybe a minute max looks like at this point it actually is coming to a halt on how much is in there so yep this will be the last run that i do for the trim and i'm going to trim with the used rest all righty she's getting pretty green so it's a good sign that more material is coming out than actual trichomes so we're going to go ahead and call that the last run for the trim and i'll go get actual hair bugs next which you guys will see some time lapse footage of so what the hell little fuzzies came falling down alrighty so then from here i take this out there's going to be dry ice in here and i'm going to want to as quick as possible get this stuff out guys don't touch dry ice with your bare hands it's bad it can hurt you but uh basically i take all the dry ice out because it's not done it's definitely still good all right guys we're back all right so i got my little collections and i need a sharpie alrighty so here's what i do here's third run of anything so all my third ones are going to go into this one this is how i stay organized keep myself clean and not contaminate my product it's important guys if you're going to do your own stuff at home damn it shut some of these lids don't shut whatever that's good enough um okay we're gonna be pressing today i don't give a [ __ ] about these lids so there's three there's two [Music] uh all right then let's take our product so we take the excess stuff that we did we're going to be using for the edibles go ahead and dump it all perfect so here it was seeded out so i'm just going through here and picking out any uh last seeds i see and we'll find they're healthy because you know here s ones are always awesome alrighty let me show you the last little bit of this before i go uh ocd picking through here with seeds which i'll be doing before i uh probably sift it before i put it in the stuff that's amazing so i'll show you how to prep this if when it's not already prepped and then that'll be the video guys so uh with product you definitely want to take it all off the stem so make sure that you take all the stems out um break your product up that works as well as just like you know chunking it off it is going to get broken up but i prefer to not have stem in my uh dry sift just makes it easier that again guys over top shake shake shake and you know what's up i want to say thanks for tuning in uh be sure to

roughout studios now welcome to cannabase ecstatic oak shatter tabs and wax today we're going to look at several ways to smoke shatter wax and rosin along with the pros and cons of dab rigs and nails dab pins vaporizers emails and nectar collectors you can find all these products and more at the wizard puff com online head shop and you can save money with the code roughhouse I'd like to thank wizard puffs for sponsoring this video perhaps the og of ways to do dabs is the trusty dab or oil rig fitted with the titanium nail or quartz banger and is truly one of the most effective ways to do a dab you'll get a huge hit instantly and usually get the most out of your wax - as it's fully vaporized in seconds dab rigs might be one of the most effective ways of doing dabs but there are drawbacks such as needing a torch and gas to heat the nails and also a recovery time to reheat it now for the next tab also when you introduce open flame and exposed high heat into the process you also sacrifice safety to some degree dad pens on the other hand are probably one of the safest ways to do dabs these types of pens usually use quartz ceramic or metal coils to heat the wax enclosed inside of a sealed glass or metal cap these types of pens can be effective and give big hits but usually will take several puffs to smoke the same amount of wax as doing a single dab off of a nail another common drawbacks to wax pans is that the unvailed wax builds up and they require constant cleaning to keep functioning properly some vaporizers that are made for dry herb can also be used to vaporize wax to these devices usually provide a cup or pod that inserts into the dry herb heating chamber to vaporize the wax these types of devices can be very convenient but the cons are that they often do a mediocre job of vaporizing wax as they lack the heat that's required and the small pods can be cumbersome and leaky so it can be hard to keep the heating chamber clean for dry herb nectar collectors or vacuum systems could be considered the Dark Horse of DAB methods these types of devices use a heated tip on the end of a handheld device that you dip directly into the wax there are both electric collectors as well as those requiring external heat sources such as a torch one big advantage of the collector type rig is that you can get huge hits when you're dipping the tip directly into the wax but they can have a bit of a learning curve and a little bit awkward to use perhaps the biggest favourite among divers is the email emails are very similar to the standard titanium nail on an oil rig with one key difference the emails have an electronic control center to set a precise temperature and a heating element that will keep the nail continuously heated and ready for a dab the pros of emails are that it's ready for a DAB any time that it's on and you can set to precise temperatures and you also you can do back-to-back dabs without having to reheat the nail they may also arguably be safer than using open flames and are clearly more convenient than needing a secondary heating torch cons are that they usually require a power source to operate so it may not be as portable as the other methods and it's also very convenient to use so you might find yourself smoking through your wax very quickly and passing out on the couch very early whichever method you choose dabbing wax or rosin so long as it's free of impurities is actually healthier than smoking cannabis flowers by not smoking or vaporizing the plant materials you are clearly putting less unnecessary chemicals into your body and by taking concentrated doses you're required to smoke less frequently not to mention that the time it takes to do it to have is far quicker than the time it takes to smoke a joint bulb or especially a blunt but if you're an everyday diver like myself a nice email setup likely be the way to go but if you only occasionally dabber prefer to vaporize then a three-in-one vape pen that does wax too might be satisfactory or any or an inexpensive wax pen might be even better or perfect for the beginner just looking to dabble in wax shatters and rosin concentrates again I'd like to thank the guys at wizard puff for sponsoring this video you can save money on a lots of the products that you saw in this video with a code roughhouse and wizard puff comm I hope you enjoyed this

have found it melted and made into one of the most finest hashes now be one of the first to witness the philosopher stoned hey you welcome to my push review a juvenile spells this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now instead of show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with the philosopher stone hash review so check it out i'm going to start this time by lighting it in the pipe and telling about it and then lighten the joint so let's light a bowl up and i'll describe the flavor it actually has like a very beautiful berry like tasted flavor to it and the smell is very very tasty very very smelling light too it actually kind of smells like blueberry or raspberry a little bit which is surprising and it smells very fruity this is my first time actually smoking it so i'm surprised that it actually has that really fruity taste to it too it's really surprising it tastes very good so let's light the joint up and take take a better look into i'm gonna put it right here so yeah i'm really surprised that it actually has that nice berry taste to it too so if you take a look at it it's like a dark brown and it looks like it's really hard but it's actually well it is hard but it's squishy like you can put your thumbnail right into it it's nice and squishy and i'm really surprised how much of a berry taste that it does have wow tastes very nice so if this your first time tuning in go check it out i've already done ak-47 and moroccan molex i just dropped but i just finished doing the white angel review so that's going to come up a little bit before this so go over and check that out and i'm going to be doing death bubba and i still got dragon hash and moroccan blonde to do so let's rate the account of a gram that's one gram of it besides the little nug i took off for the pipe and the bit i put in this joint so it came in a nice account i still got enough for like another couple joints there so i'll give it a i'll give it like a nine for a count because that's a nice big chunk for the price i think it was 15 or 20 bucks or something like that all this lately has been from her reven i ordered it all for more herb heaven so go over and check their website they got some pretty good stuff there's no sponsors or nothing like that i just went over and checked it out myself and decided to do some so this hash tastes very good you can taste the hash in it like the nice crystal taste but you can also taste like a lot of berries very delicious i've never tasted a hash like this it's very good i definitely recommend it especially if you like fruity taste and berries taste and stuff it has a very strong berry taste to it it's crazy and i'm starting to feel really good off of it it busts up pretty good you just i just broke it up tiny little pieces and rolled up and it's burning really nicely especially for hash and a joint but for the taste i'll give it a 10 man that tastes very good that tastes very delicious i like the taste of it i'll give it overall rating of 10 because it's very good ash it's very delicious it's a very nice treat so i'll give the philosopher's stone hash a rating of 10. it's very delicious and it's good smoking it in the pipe and it's good in a joint so whatever you prefer man it's definitely going to taste good i tell you right now it's going to taste really good i love the taste of it but i don't want to drag this on for too long i hope you guys enjoyed it and i guess if you guys want to see which one you guys want to see next moroccan blonde or dragon let me know in the comment section i'll give you a quick look at both that's moroccan blonde and that's dragon so let me know in the comment section which one you want to see next and i'm coming at you with my next how-to toke i'm going to be smoking out of a watermelon so keep your eyes out for that that's gonna be coming up in the next couple days also so thank you all for stopping by and spending time at juvenile styles i appreciate it big time y'all good night now it's time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go now that we're all getting stoned but i got lots more videos so you can stay for show so bust up some more push to roll and watch another show now i'm blasting out", "JMFUaIXkCSQ": "what's up hey you welcome to my quick review a juveniles does this is what I do smoke push past and shadow to go and check them up I try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news Alastair the show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile stars coming at you with a cannabis tribute show today we got an exotic strain and it is called two in common so check it out I got an ounce of it it's a for a time so let's open it up dump it over take a good look at it and smoke a joint of it that I wrote and nice padding that light up so let's take a close look at it so when I got it it came nice and like vacuum-sealed up it really nice I also got a nice shadow buyer to try out at the end [Music] so this is an ounce of it trying to hold it so you can see it it looks very nice it has like really nice bright orange hair yeah hold a nice but up close it looks very nice and it is a sativa and it said its average between 28 and 30 you remember like as a strong smoke let's light it up and we'll continue to take a closer look when you get it this is from heaven but when you get it it comes vacuum seal like I said very like nice and very squished together but you've washed it up and it busts still very nice it kind of tastes like really really crystallized like kind of like a smooth frosting and it don't have just like a strong push flavor like most good weed it actually has like times an original taste and probably why sorry [Music] oh yeah that's a definitely a different type of taster was it really expected it but I know it's probably good it tastes pretty good I paid to 24 nouns of this which ain't too bad I'll say tonight came a nice good account I'll give it a 9/10 so this is the bar I will be sampling at the end of the video here so you can stay for the opie tried this kind managed [ __ ] awesome I do really enjoy it I've been wanting some really good different kinds of smoke but a few ounces of smoke at the same stuff mixing it up a little bit as you know cuz I'm doing reviews on you just let your note I'm gonna be doing diletto and platinum cookies next and I just did chocolate stone which pretty much finishes a trio of the skunk like I got chocolates gum yellow skunk a twice gun so go check those oh really explain [Music] so I was expecting to get a new chair for the videos and stuff for my birthday I was gonna bring it on but it's just gonna be a little late so I hope you guys like that when it comes to the nice-looking one so hope you guys like I got new equipment coming for my cameras got new cameras and then mics and all that stuff coming so all my videos will be a lot better quality soon so I hope that you stay for those if you like this give it a sub cuz those will be coming soon [Music] yeah that's pretty my job and my plants are doing good they go with very nicely feminized seeds to do with some other kinds of strains to grow in the minute throwing the monster you guys can see how they do too so I really hope that you're all doing good now that the weather's didn't wanna hope y'all get no doing some [ __ ] stand distant for people but still getting out and having a good time I'll give an overall rating I think of like nine five to ten comments during it's a very good straight it's original type of taste ITC Clinton I'm starting to feel pretty good I feel pretty lifted you know I feel like I'm pretty nice and uplift that I enjoy it I feel nice so I definitely recommend it and just case you're wondering I like to say every once in a while these are the papers I use those you can go see me bio so the biodegradable stuff if you smoke a lot of joint so every that really cheaply we should try them out that's what I use to smoke my joint most of the time so Casey wondered so I did do a review of another type of chocolate bar another THC one it had 250 milligrams too but was only like half the size of this one this one so this one so this one has a nice little pattern on it I guess what to say it just says what it is it's 250 milligrams ten point four milligram extra two per piece so it's 250 milligrams all together and to ten point four two milligrams each week so what I'll do is open it up and I'll try a few and I'll let you know in the comment section later on so here I'll have to put this down [Music] so let's break up a little there's a really nice milk chocolate [Music] so it does have a really nice milk chocolate taste to it I don't really taste too much - you see anybody does taste nice actually the aftertaste I do people he tastes the THC it does taste very nice so this is a shatter bar and you can search at euphoria extractions to find it it tastes very good I do taste the toffee a little bit it does taste very nice I do like the milk chocolate very very good taste so yeah I'll finish this last bit [Music] [Music] it does have a very very nice flavor not too sweet which is very nice and healthy a little bit of toffee tasting so I'm gonna end it there I guess now it's done English so I'll be back but I have to go now that we're all good in stone but I got lots more videos so you can stay for show so bust up some more fish to roll and watch another show now I'm glass you know",

addictive and that's what I hear all the time when I propose to a patient that cannabis therapy might be helpful hi I'm doctor Dan Stein board-certified neurologist and medical cannabis expert and that particular concern is a very common one patients want to know that the medicine they're taking is not going to cause more problems addiction to certain chemicals is certainly a problem in our society opioid use for example alcoholism even gambling addictive behaviors and addictive physiological responses to drugs caused major problems cannabis can cause some addiction in some people but it's very very rare usually it's in younger people teenagers that use a lot of THC the endocannabinoid system our brains biochemical machinery that binds THC is a very carefully balanced system and when too much THC is taken in the form of cannabis or marijuana the receptors on our nerve cells become less populated there's a down regulation and so with a lot of THC use it does take more and more THC to produce the same effect we call that tolerance in some individuals who are using a lot of THC perhaps dabbing that's the process of inhaling a concentrate in a large dose those individuals sometimes down regulate their receptors to the point where they need to use more and more every day and then as a result they become preoccupied with finding that medication finding the product buying it and using it when an individual is preoccupied with acquiring the substance and using it to the detriment of their health and their social situation that is called addiction I want to be clear addiction is the problem that people develop when they are no longer able to function in a social environment and they're preoccupied with obtaining a sir a substance even though they may know it's detrimental to their health so that does happen with cannabis use but it's rare and it's usually in heavy users at a younger age so the majority of patients that we see are cannabis naive they haven't been using and I certainly recommend to them that they not use too much because they can develop problems and it may not even work so here at the cannabis clinic when asked about addiction I can say confidently that no patients are not going to become addicted we're going to guide them in a way that uses cannabis properly to provide symptom relief without dependence on the medication I do

different varieties of cannabis plants cbd oil is extracted from leaves flowers and stems of the cannabis sativa plant while hemp oil is made from the leaves flowers and stems of the hemp plant both oils are associated with cannabis but what's the real difference between them cbd is short for cannabidiol which happens to be an active ingredient in cannabis plants while some cbd oils do have low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol thc it is not enough to experience the euphoric feeling associated with other thc infused products on the market cbd is sold over the counter as a remedy for pain relief and neurological disorders some studies claim that it helps improve moods and can even lower blood pressure and improve blood circulation cbd oil interacts with the body's endocannabinoid system cannabidiol works with the body's own endocannabinoid system which is a complex cell signaling system experts don't completely understand how cbd interacts with this system but they seem to think that it helps to treat certain ailments as well as regulate sleep mood memory nausea and appetite hemp oil might contain low levels of cbd but not enough to have the same benefits as cbd oil however there are many brands of cbd hemp oil on the market it is worth noting that hemp oil and hemp seed oil are sometimes advertised as the same thing but they have differences hemp seed oil differs from hemp oil in that it is manufactured from the seeds of the hemp plant because of that process hemp seed oil does not contain much cbd or thc as a result hemp oil is used in beauty products for its

hottest new products on the market and a lot of people say it makes them feel great without any of the negative side effects well i have some right here and we're about to put this stuff to the test and see what it can really do what's up and welcome back to the strain show if this is your first time here this is the channel where you can learn new fun facts about weed every week so don't forget to subscribe so you can put some nuggets of knowledge into your strain brain my name is matt i'm a medical cannabis patient a cannabis industry employee i love to learn about weed and today we're learning all about delta eight thc first we're gonna cover what delta eight thc actually is then i'm gonna show you all the cool stuff that the studies and research have shown that delta 8 can do then i'm going to try some super fat dabs of this delta 8 thc full spectrum distillate and see if it can get a true smoker like myself high or if this is all just hype let's go delta 8 thc is a cannabinoid produced in small amounts by cannabis plants just like cbd and it's very similar to the more common delta 9 thc that we all know and love since delta 8 occurs naturally in very small amounts in most plants selective breeding combined with extraction and isolation are typically used to make delta 8 products and extracts delta 8 is sold in various different products and it's usually marketed to have all of the same high of weed without any of the negative side effects now when we think of thc we normally think of delta 9 thc that's the one we all love that cannabis plants grow in large amounts the main form of thc delta 9 is so common that we usually don't even specify it as being delta 9. we usually just say thc but that's not the only kind of thc there are actually a few like when you eat edibles metabolites in your liver convert the delta 9 thc into something called 11-hydroxy thc 11-hydroxy thc is much more potent than delta-9 and this along with a few other reasons is why edibles can make you feel so much higher and so much different but 11-hydroxy thc doesn't even exist naturally in cannabis plants it's only formed in your stomach after you eat thc but delta 8 thc is different delta 8 does occur naturally in a cannabis plant and on a molecular level it's very similar to normal thc many people claim that delta 8 gives them a more clear-headed high while others say it makes them feel more energized or motivated rather than couch-locked they like the fact that they can still get all the medicinal benefits without getting too high or feeling anxious and we are learning more about these effects and more about delta 8 thc with every new study that is published and we have already learned some really interesting things we know that delta 8 binds to the same cb1 receptors in the brain as delta 9 and studies have shown that it shares a lot of the same medicinal benefits of regular thc as well as some from cbd with a high that might actually be more enjoyable for some people there have been studies published on delta 8 thc in 1994 2008 and 2014 but a study published through medjin sums it up best when they described delta 8 thc as an analog of tetrahydrocannabinol with antiometic anxiolytic appetite stimulating analgesic and neuroprotective properties and if you're not a damn scientist that means that these researchers found that delta 8 had the properties of anti-nausea anti-anxiety pain relief it could protect your brain cells and it could stimulate your appetite these researchers also found that delta 8 thc exhibits a lower psychotropic potency than delta 9 meaning that it won't get you as high as you would normally get from the same amount of thc these scientists just keep showing us that we still have a whole lot to learn about this crazy plant and all of the things this one plant can do for us but i want to see if this delta 8 will do anything to someone who is an everyday smoker like me with a high tolerance now for this little test we have this delta 8 thc full spectrum distillate this stuff pretty much looks like regular distillate it looks really good sort of like honey i don't smell much of a smell off of it yet and if i get close to it there's still not much of a smell at all i really can't smell anything so for this test i wanted to see what this delta 8 would do to someone who smokes weed every day and who already has somewhat of a tolerance but i did want to make sure that what i was feeling from this delta 8 was just from this delta 8 so i've gone a full 24 hours without using any cannabis products what we're going to do is hit two fat abs out of the turp slurper we're going to give it 10 minutes and then see how we feel right now i'm not high at all and so it will be very noticeable if i get stoned from this but i don't know i'm dabbing regular thc all the time so we'll see let's scoop one of these out and see what it looks like where's my dab tool okay wow it's hard to get a dab out of here this stuff is very thick and very stiff it's like super cold honey okay we got a fat dab put our pearl on got my close-up cam here we go delta eight thc [Music] so [Music] oh it's crazy huge dab no taste like no flavor at all just smoke or vapor whatever it is when you dab but no taste it's crazy all right we're gonna dunk this and clean the banger and hit one more fat dab and we'll see how we feel wow it's so stringy look how long it is that looks like a fat dab all right dab number two here we go [Music] so [Music] it's crazy like there's no taste to this stuff at all but besides that everything else seems like a regular dab but it's just crazy how there's no flavor especially since it says full spectrum but that sort of makes sense because a lot of time distillates don't have a lot of flavor but let's give this 10 minutes and see if we get stoned so it's been about 10 minutes since our two delta 8 thc dabs and after 24 hours of not smoking anything i can definitely tell that i'm stoned i'm like pretty good in stoned actually i think if i would hit two huge dabs like that of delta nine that a i would have coughed for ever and b that i would be a good deal more high than i am right now but nevertheless i am stoned off these two dabs and the only other real differences i can tell is that the oil itself is really really sticky and really thick almost like if you took honey and put it in the refrigerator and also there was no taste and not just like a light taste or almost no flavor it was like no taste at all it was sort of crazy and since this stuff does get you high and a lot of people say that it does it without the side effects from regular thc this stuff could be really popular because you can buy this all over the united states but recreational weed is still illegal in a bunch of places but did you know that they're now actually growing cannabinoids in petri dishes in a lab in an attempt to completely replace weed plants

marijuana, with other states slowly but surely following suit. But long before prohibition, Long before the united states, even, Cannabis had been established as an integral part of human civilization. From it\u2019s depiction in the cave paintings of Japan To it\u2019s usage in burial ceremonies in ancient China, It seems as though our relationship with weed Likely goes back to the advent of our species And if our endocannibinoid system is any indication, Perhaps even before it. But while there is limited information about marijuana\u2019s role in early mammalian development, There is a wealth of evidence across virtually all cultures throughout history Of it\u2019s importance in textiles Medicine And spirituality. This is the forgotten past Of one of the most versatile plants Ever discovered This is cannabis\nA lost history The first written reference material we have when it comes to cannabis is in the form of the Chinese materia medica, alleged to be written by Shen Nung in 2800 B.C.E, The earliest surviving copy of this book dates back to around 50 B.C.E. Shen Nung is a legendary figure in Chinese culture, part of a group of three kings called \u2018celestial emperors\u2019. Half emperor half deity, He is said to have ruled over China long before written history, inventing irrigation, agriculture, the axe, the hoe, the plow, acupuncture, and traditional Chinese medicine in the process. He is often depicted draped in a garment of leaves, and  often chewing on their stems to experiment with their effect on the human body. Shen Nung was, essentially, the first pharmacologist. In compiling The Classic of Herbal Medicine, shen nung discovered the medicinal properties of cannabis, saying it was good for gout, rheumatism, malaria, and absentmindedness, as well as about 100 other things. Prior to this, the plant which the Chinese called \u201cma\u201d had been used for many centuries for its fiber in producing cloth, paper, rope, and even in the production of pottery. As the Chinese continued to explore cannabis\u2019 benefit, they found it effective in the treatment of other ailments, like vomiting and infections. It is generally believed to have been used in moxibustion practice in acupuncture, being replaced in modern times with mugwort. Around 200 A.D.   A physician named Hua Tuo became the first person to use anesthesia in surgery, nearly 1600 years before its discovery in the west. And while Hua Tuo\u2019s formula for anesthesia has not survived into modern times, it\u2019s name Ma Fei San, translates approximately to Cannabis boiling powder\u201d and is widely accepted to have had cannabis as a component, with other candidates such as jimson weed and opium proposed to be either in addition to or instead of marijuana. Cannabis was one of the 50 fundamental herbs in the Traditional Chinese medicine toolkit. In modern times, with the questionable legality of its use, reference to \u2018ma\u2019 in recent translations of the Chinese medical textbooks only make reference to non-psychoactive hemp seeds. But in antiquity, the Chinese were not shy about singing cannabis\u2019 praise. Confucius compiled the Book of Odes, and the Cannon of Rites, detailing poetry, song, and the religious ritualistic practices of the Chinese shamanism of his contemporaries and ancestors. Ma is mentioned numerous times throughout each of these collections. But perhaps more interesting  is it\u2019s frequent association with the burial ceremony during this time period. Cannabis has been found, both burned and unburned, seed, bud, and everything in between, with Burned seeds having been found in kurgan burial mounds in Siberia and china, dating back to 3,000 B.C, and nearly two pounds of  bud being discovered in the grave of what is believed to be a royal shaman in China\u2019s Xin Jiang region. But through a network of trade routes, weed quickly found its way across the ancient world, intersecting with numerous cultures in the process. Coming up, we\u2019ll explore weed\u2019s spread throughout the east, and its importance in the foundation of indian culture. As marijuana\u2019s popularity as a dietary staple, a medicine and the very plant from which clothes are made grew, China came to be known as the land of hemp and mulberry. Mulberries are high in protein, iron, vitamins and minerals, just like cannabis so it is no wonder that the two were both revered in this similar way. But while the earliest recorded history of cannabis comes from China, it is known to have been widely distributed in the fertile soil along the rivers of the ancient world. Along the banks of these great rivers, like the yellow river in china, the tigris and Euphrates in Mesopotamia,the Indus in India, and perhaps even the nile in Egypt, civilization  began to sprout up as well. And while it is unclear how, exactly, this knowledge of cannabis\u2019 medicinal and psychoactive properties spread, some evidence points to nomadic tribes emerging from the steppes of central Asia, such as the Yamnaya, who also may have been responsible for the kurgan burial mounds found throughout the region. Historians believe that these tribal groups of the caucasus region helped to advance trade across Asia and Europe well before the silk road, spreading the wheel, horse domestication, and many other technologies of the times Some subset of these tribes, who called themselves the Aryans, migrated from the north into what is now India, eventually merging with people who had already inhabited the region, developing the prototypical indo-aryan language and culture in the process. From this culture, Indian and Iranian cultures, among others, would ultimately be born. This protoculture was also responsible for the invention of one of the earliest written languages, Sanskrit. Some of the earliest Sanskrit texts, The Vedas, meaning knowledge, are still in existence today. These texts are the basis of our knowledge of ancient indian history, as well as spirituality, being important religious texts for both Zoroastrian and Hindu faiths. Cannabis, or bhang, as it is called in India, is mentioned as one of five sacred plants in the fourth veda The Hindu god Shiva is sometimes referred to as lord of the bhang. There are several legends associating Shiva with Cannabis, from him making it of his own flesh to help purify the amrita, or elixir of life, to it being churned up from a sea of milk, along with the sacred cow and the moon by Shiva himself. One such legend states that Shiva, in the midst of an argument with his family, escaped to the mountains. As he continued to climb, he became tired from his journey, and the suns hot rays. He fell asleep beneath a plant. When he awoke he became aware of the fragrant smell of the plant and decided to taste its leaves. Rejuvenated, Shiva made this Ganja his favorite food, bringing it back to humanity, along with the art of yoga, a sort of instruction manual for the practice of using this sacred herb correctly. As a result, devotees of Shiva still consume bhang, ganja, and charas, 3 traditional preparations of cannabis, to this day. It is most commonly consumed in a drink known as Bhang Lassi, which is similar to the mango lassi popularized in the west, with bhang taking place of mango. This drink is especially used on holidays such as Holi, and Shivrati, the festival of Shiva. Even in regions where it is illegal, an exception is made during these celebrations. The Sadhus, yogic holymen and devotees of Shiva, smoke it in the forms of ganja and charas on a daily basis, saying it brings them closer to shiva. But as we will see, Hinduism isn\u2019t the only indoaryan religious tradition to incorporate cannabis into its culture. Coming up, we\u2019ll explore marijuana\u2019s place in Buddhism, Sikhism, and the Zoroastrian faith The Vedic religious tradition, the proto-religion of the indo-aryan people, served as the origin for both Hinduism and Zoroastrianism, with Hinduism developing in the Indian Subcontinent, and the Zoroastrian faith flourishing in Iran. The Persian prophet, Zoroaster, is believed to be the first to make mention of cannabis as a sacrament. In The Zend-Avesta, a collection of important religious texts in Zoroastrianism, hemp appears first in a list of over 10,000 medicinal plants. It was considered the chief religious sacrament of the priest class, and was generally unavailable to common people. This priestly class would consume Bhang, sometimes referred to as bhanga or mang, mixed with wine after which it is said that their bodies rested while their minds went on a spiritual journey. In fact, many of our modern conceptual imagery of heaven and hell come from Zoroastrian priest Ardak Wiraf, who was known to go on journeys to these realms through the use of bhang. Zoroaster\u2019s wife, dissatisfied by this secondary shamanic experience, prayed to the supreme being that he \u201cgive her his good narcotic, Bhanga.\u201d Back in India, a new religion was developing based on the teachings of a sage named Siddhartha Gautama. According to legend, Gautama, the Buddha, subsided on a diet of cannibas (primarily in the form of hemp seeds) for six years before his revelations and his ascent to Buddhahood. As he sat beneath the Bodhi tree for 40 days and 40 nights, he consumed only a single hemp seed per day. And while most sects of Buddhism have largely forgotten or ignored bhang\u2019s important place in the life of th Budha, a spiritual movement called tantra sprung up in the 6th century weaving Hindu and Buddhist beliefs into a new esoteric philosophy in which bhang played a preeminent role. In the mahanirvana tantra, bhang is said to assist in the great liberation. A prayer is contained in this sacred religious text that is supposed to accompany consumption of bhang. When translated, it reads, \u201cmay this cannabis be a blessing to my heart.\u201d The mahanirvana also states that, \u201cBhang is consumed in order to liberate oneself, and that those who do, in dominating their mental faculties and following the yoga, or law of shiva, are to be likened to immortals on earth. By the middle ages, bhang became so popular, in fact, that it was often consumed before battle, much in the way that alcohol was in the west. They believed that consumption of bhang would make ones enemies feel possessed by spirits. A later religious tradition, Sikhism, which finds its roots in tantra, forbids all drugs and alcohol\u2026 with bhang being the exception. They call it suknee dhan, meaning giver of peace. And when the sikh\u2019s founder was presented with bhang by the mughul king babur, he was so delighted as to offer his blessing for babur have his kingdom for seven generations. This Sudknee Dhan was especially popular with a group of sikh warriors known as the nihang who consume it to this day. And while colonialism has largely wiped out psychotropic plants the world over, the Sikhs received special permissions from the british imperialists to continue using sudknee dhan. In the late 1800s, when opium and other drugs of concern were made illegal in british colonies, a commission was set up who created a report on the importance of cannabis in Indian culture, it concluded that suppressing the use of bhang would be unjustifiable, due to its ancient religious usage among hindus and the view that it was harmless when used in moderation. When we return, we\u2019ll explore the spread of cannabis into the ancient western world. The Aryan tribes that settled in Iran went on to form the Persian empire, whose rule reached from the borders of India all the way to the land of Egypt by 500 BCE. But some suggest the Egyptians had knowledge of cannabis nearly 1500 years before that. The oldest complete medical text, the eber\u2019s papyrus, as well as other writings of the time contain reference to a plant, shum shum tu, which was created by the sun god rah and used in ceremonies honoring the dead. It is believed by many to be none other than marijuana. Shum Shum Tu, used medicinally, was often combined with honey and used in topical medical preparations for inflammation. Whether this interpretation of Shum Shum Tu identity is correct or not, There is other evidence indicative of ancient Egyptian knowledge of cannabis. For example, the goddess seshat is almost universally depicted with a 7 pointed symbol often resembling the 7 pointed marijuana leaf above her head. Similarly, hemp fibers have been discovered in the tomb of ahkenhaten, with Hemp pollen found inside of the mummy of Rameses II, who died nearly 700 years before  the Persian conquest of Egypt. Both of these samples have undergone chemical analyses and confirmed to be weed. There are also numerous hierogylphs showing what appear to be smoking pipes or ceremonial incense burners. And while these have been attributed by some to represent ceremonial use of the blue lotus flower, which itself is psychoactive, most researchers agree that blue lotus was steeped in wine as opposed to being smoked. But while evidence of ancient Egyptian knowledge of marijuana\u2019s psychoactive properties is mostly circumstantial, there is an unmistakable written record by their Greek counterparts. In fact, the word \u201ccannabis\u201d comes from an ancient Greek translation of a Scythian word. It is generally believed that hemp, hanep in Old English, comes from the same Scythian source. But the Grecian relationship with cannabis is not purely etymological. The Greek historian Herodotus was the first person to make any mention of cannabis in western literature. He wrote extensively on the Scythian people, a nomadic tribe he had encountered in his many travels. According to Herodotus, the Scythians used cannabis in the manufacture of their clothes. They also used it in religious ceremony accompanying a funeral. They anoint and wash their heads, and for their bodies, set up three poles leaning together to a point and cover these over with wool mats, then in the space so enclosed to the best of their ability, they make a pit in the center beneath the poles and the mats and throw red-hot stones into it. . . . the Scythians then take this (kannabis) and crawling into the tents, throw it on the red-hot stones, where it smoulders and sends forth such fumes that no Greek vapor-bath could surpass it. The Scythians howl in their joy caused by the vapors And while mainstream historians tend to reject the idea that these practices found their way into greek culture, there appears to be  evidence to the contrary. For instance, the Scythians, notorious for their warlike nature, made up a large part of the Greek police force. It is highly unlikely, then, that their unique cultural traditions would not be continued during their tenure in Greece. What\u2019s more, Herodotus makes reference of another Nomadic tribe whose use of cannabis was not so sacramental. He said, \"They have parties and sit around a fire, they throw some of it into the flames. As it burns, it smokes like incense, and the smell of it makes them drunk, just as wine does. As more fruit is thrown on, they get more and more intoxicated until finally they jump up and start dancing and singing.\" Outside of these direct written references, it should also be taken into account that the ancient Greeks had continuing conflict with the Aryan tribes that went on to form the Persian empire. It is very likely that through the Persian invasion, cannabis came to be known in Greece. But regardless of how they first encountered it, ancient Greek physicians used cannabis medicinally to treat a variety of conditions, such as edema and even tumors. It seems impossible, then, that it\u2019s psychoactive properties would go unnoticed by the philosophically minded among the ancient Greeks. While there is little about this in academia, it is more likely because of the taboo nature of entheogenic research and less so because Grecian use of cannabis did not exist. Another possible reason for the limited information on the topic is that the psychospiritual rituals of ancient Greek philosophers were heavily guarded secrets. While generally shrouded in mystery, there are some indications of cannabis\u2019 psychoactive use in ancient Greece. For one, we have ancient greek writings of an incense known as \u2018scythian fire\u2019 being used in the cult of Asclepius, the God of medicine. Additionally, the thracians, another nomadic tribe living amongst the greeks, had within them a group known to the Greeks as Kapnobatai, or \u201cSmoke Walkers\u201d These \u201cSmoke Walkers\u201d were dancers and shaman, who used the smoke of hemp to bring about a trancelike state. These Persian, Thracian, and Scythian practices hardly went unnoticed by the greeks. In fact, the ancient Greek word, Cannabeizen, meaning \u2018to burn cannabis\u2019 is believed to have taken place in the form of incense burners burning cannabis along with frankincense resin, which is also known to be psychoactive, as well as other fragrant resins such as myrrh and balsam. It is not inconceivable,then, that such an incense may have played a role in some of the numerous divination rituals practiced in ancient Greece by the likes of Socrates and Pythagoras. What is known for sure, though, is that cannabis found its way to Rome via their conquest of Greece and appropriation of Greek Philosophy, science and art including Dioscorides\u2019 Materia Medica, a classic that influenced western medicine well into the middle ages But perhaps some of the most controversial references to cannabis in antiquity come from the Judeochristian bible. In the first half of the 20th century, the Polish anthropologist, Dr. Sula Benet, discovered a glaring error in modern translations of the bible. She noted that the bible\u2019s many mentions of \u2018sweet calamus\u2019 only went as far back as the Septuagint, an early Greek translation of the Hebrew bible. The problem with this is that calamus has virtually none of the properties it is purported to in the bible. Benet demonstrated that the original Hebrew script used the term \u201cKaneh Bosm\u201d which she believed was, without any doubt, cannabis. In fact, Dr. Benet believed that \u201cKaneh Bosm\u201d may even predate the Scythian term Kannabis. This \u201ckaneh bosm\u201d was referenced multiple times in the old testament. Take, for instance, Exodus chapter 30, in which God instructs Moses to make a holy anointing oil. \u201cAnd the LORD spoke to Moses, saying: Take for yourself choice spices: Five Hundred shekels (6kg) of pure myrrh, half as much of fragrant cinnamon (3kg) two hundred and fifty shekels of kaneh bosm (3kg) and five hundred shekels of cassia (6kg) and mix these with olive oil (5 quarts)\u201d This holy anointing oil was used to make the temple, the altar, and quote \u201cBurned offerings\u201d most holy, and the bible says that anything that touches these, too, would become holy. This anointing oil, in the old testament and Judaism, was used to baptize the likes of kings and priests, ultimately leading to the Hebrew term \u201cMessiah\u201d meaning \u201cThe anointed one, which begs the question, \u201cDid jesus himself use cannabis?\u201d It is well documented in the old testament that a sacred incense, burned offerings, and a holy anointing oil containing kaneh bosm, were an established part of the rituals of ancient Israelites. These ceremonies were conducted in a tabernacle, a temple similar to that of their Scythian counterparts, who have been shown through ancient historical sources to have traded with and occasionally fought against the ancient Jewish people. It is not surprising, then, that the old testament describes kaneh bosm as being an exotic herb from a far away land. But the new testament makes basically no direct references to kaneh bosm itself. So did Jesus know of, or use cannabis? It seems that the answer may very well be yes. Christ is a Greek term meaning, \u201cThe anointed one\u201d as opposed to being Jesus\u2019 last name, as some believe. In fact, last names generally did not originate until the middle ages. These terms, \u201cChrist\u201d and \u201cmessiah\u201d are indicative of the fact that Jesus was anointed in the holy anointing oil. The very same oil used by Moses and Aaron to initiate the priestly class into their faith centuries earlier. As is well documented in the bible, Jesus was scholarly when it came to his Jewish faith from an early age, teaching the Rabbis in the temple at the age of 13. It is highly likely, then, that he was aware of the formula of the anointing oil In fact, while the new testament doesn\u2019t mention kaneh bosm directly, anointing seems to be a key part of Jesus\u2019 ministry. Jesus anointed the 12 disciples, and then sent them out to anoint others in the holy oil. As put in Mark 6:13 \u201cthey were casting out many demons and were anointing with oil many who were sick, and healing them\u201d There are many references throughout the bible to Jesus anointing and healing those throughout the region. References to casting out demons may, in fact, be referring to epilepsy, which cannabis oil is known to treat. Similarly, Jesus heals leprosy, which has been commonly treated with cannabis in many ancient cultures. He is also said to have healed a blind man. In modern times, we know cannabis to successfully treat glaucoma. But outside of his many healing miracles, Jesus anointed people, namely, to introduce the holy spirit into them. As Stated in The First Epistle of Saint John, \u201cI am writing to you in this way about those who would deceive you, but the Oil you received from him remains within you, and you really need no teaching from anyone; \nsimply remain in him, for his Oil Teaches you about everything  and is true and is no lie-- remain in him as his Oil has taught you to do.\u201d This anointing of common people, and, further, gentiles, or \u2018non-jews\u2019 is in direct violation of Hebrew law, as God dictated to Moses in Exodus: \u201cAnyone who makes a blend like it or anoints someone other than a priest will be cut off from the community.\u201d Is it possible, then, that this could have played a role in the Hebrew elders\u2019 contention towards Jesus, or their decision to condemn him to death? Whether you believe in the historicity of Jesus or not, it is clear that this holy anointing oil was extremely special to the early Christians. While the Gospels found in the bible appear to confirm Jesus\u2019 anointing oil, they are just a small fraction of the Christian Gospels of antiquity. Before the canon of Jesus\u2019 life was solidified by  The Roman Emperor Constantine in the 3rd century, a number of early Christian sects, collectively known as The Gnostics, meaning knowledge, all had their own interpretations of Christianity. In one such work, The Gospel of Phillip, the author says The anointing is superior to baptism. For from the anointing we were called \u2018anointed ones\u2019 (Christians), not because of the baptism. And Christ, too, was [so] named because of the anointing, for the Father anointed the son, and the son anointed the apostles, and the apostles anointed us. [Therefore] he who has been anointed has the All. He has the resurrection, the light. . . the Holy Spirit. . . [If] one receives this unction, this person is no longer a Christian but a Christ.\u201d Similarly, the Gospel of Truth says that Jesus came specifically\u2026 \u201cso that he might anoint them with the ointment. The ointment is the mercy of the Father\u2026 those whom he has anointed are the ones who have become perfect.\u201d And in The Gospel of Thomas, thought by many to be the earliest Christian text, the anointing oil is praised more specifically as a plant derivative. Holy oil, given us for sanctification\u2026 you are the unfolder of the hidden parts... You are the one who shows the hidden treasures. You are the plant of kindness. Let your power come by this [unction]. But when the Romans, the former persecutors of the Christians, who had fed them to lions, decided to make Christianity the official state religion, and decided exactly which version of Christianity would be practiced, all of these early gnostic practices became punishable by death; being conveyed in a symbolic manner before, ultimately, falling by the wayside. Interestingly enough, it is almost as if Jesus saw this coming. As he is quoted as saying in Mark 4:11-12, \u201cTo you has been given the secret of the Kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables: so that they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand. \u201d It\u2019s worth noting that Judaism and Christianity aren\u2019t the only monotheistic religions where cannabis played a role. In the 7th century, the Persian Empire, once home to Zoroastrians and Scythians alike, was in decline. A new religion arose, rejecting the pagan tribal religions of the Arabs. This new faith, Islam, had its roots in the Abrahamic, or judeochristian, religious traditions. Islam's founder, the prophet Muhammad, was very direct in forbidding intoxicants; but seems to refer specifically to alcohol. Could it be that he, too, used cannabis? Both the hadith and the Qur\u2019an describe a night journey in which Muhammad flew on the back of a winged horse, ultimately visiting heaven to speak with Allah. Some sects of Islam believe this story to refer to an out of body experience, potentially one influenced by an entheogen. And with this region of the world having a long standing tradition, even then, of using cannabis, and particularly hash, it is very possible that, should this journey have required an entheogen to take place, it was most likely cannabis. But while there isn\u2019t much in the way of evidence for Muhammad\u2019s cannabis use, we know for sure the longstanding tradition of cannabis consumption in the middle east did not die with the foundation of Islam. Although some take the prophet\u2019s proclamation that intoxicants are haram, or forbidden, to extend to cannabis as well as alcohol, it is known to have been used as medicinally by some Arab physicians, the world leaders in medicine in the middle ages. That said, its use was not solely medicinal for the Muslims of this time. The Sufis, a mystical sect of Islam, used cannabis to bring themselves to higher states of consciousness and better appreciate the nature of Allah, and the natural beauty of his creation. As the Sufi poet Fuzuli once said, \u201chashish is the perfect being, sought after by mankind with great eagerness. It may not be the perfect being for everybody, but it most certainly is for the seeker of mystical experience.\u201d But Fuzuli certainly wasn\u2019t the only one singing cannabis\u2019 praise. In fact, many Sufis ate a hash preparation known as ma\u2019joun As an act of worship, believing it to allow the spirit to\u2026 \u201cascend to the highest points in a heavenly ascension of disembodied understanding.\u201d But even though the Qur\u2019an doesn\u2019t refer to the prophet as using cannabis, it does mention a figure known as The Green Prophet, or Al Khadir. Al Khadir is borrowed from earlier Arabic religious traditions. Originally, The Green prophet seemed to symbolize fertility and vegetation, with flowers and plants magically blooming from the ground on which he walked. By medieval times, he came to represent the type of esoteric knowledge that breaks you free from the trance of everyday existence through shock, much like the change in perception one may feel under the influence of entheogens. As a result of his association with schocking realization, he has come to be somewhat of a patron saint of artists working with unbound enthusiasm. But much of cannabis\u2019 use throughout the early centuries of Islam is unrelated to The Qur\u2019an or Hadith. As discussed earlier, hashish was commonly used by the Sufis, and likely came into existence via the earlier charas, popular in India and the Persian empire. But cannabis wasn\u2019t the only substance used by The Sufis to better understand the nature of Allah. They are thought of as having been instrumental in the development of coffeehouses as we now know them. Legend has it that a wandering Sufi once revealed how he had prepared this new and unique drink to a Sunni woman. He prepared the beverage using a hash filled hookah. This preparation could be responsible for the long standing tradition of hookah lounges serving coffee, and even coffeehouses serving cannabis, which they did in the middle east for several centuries, and continue to do in parts of Europe, most notably Amsterdam. But the Sufis weren\u2019t the only branch of Islam to partake in cannabis use. Marco Polo once wrote of a mysterious Old Man of the Mountain who lead a secretive band of Shia warriors in battle against the Sunnis. These warriors, the Nizari of Syria, would use hash to make them more focused on their targets and more in tune with the consequences of every movement, and they were often tasked with taking out high level targets, shrouded in the cover of night. These Nizari came to be referred to as hashishins, for their use of hashish. This word, through time, evolved into the word assassin, which generally refers to hired killers who use similar tactics today. Perhaps because of its association with assassins, there were many attempts to suppress the use of cannabis in the middle east, beginning in about the 14th century in Egypt, where it had grown extremely popular, especially for its ability to enhance music. Cannabis use became a crime whose punishment was to have one\u2019s teeth pulled out. But cannabis users, so attached to their hashish did not stop its use, ultimately, these attempts at suppression failed, only being realized many centuries later by western interference. When we return, How did cannabis use fair in pre-enlightenment Europe, where any aberrations to mainstream Christianity were viciously punished? Knowledge of Cannabis\u2019 medicinal properties spread throughout Europe by way of the Roman Empire. It found its way into the hands of the Germanic tribes that had come to inhabit western Europe, where its seeds had served as a food source for ancient Germans. In the middle ages, These peoples, who had earlier been converted to Christianity at the hands of the Romans, have become infamous in history for their use of torture. But the idea of cannabis as \u2018bad\u2019 is a relatively recent construct, and so its use did not seem to be punished in medieval European society. In fact, its psychoactive properties are largely underreported by the Europeans of this time, who seemed to more prominently use psychoactive mushrooms, alcohol, and datura species for inebriation. While it continued to be used as a medicine, much of European society during this time cultivated it for use of its fibers. Up until the late renaissance period, cannabis continued to be thought of as little more than a source for fiber in western europe, but the discovery of America heralded the dawn of a new era in intercontinental trade, and along with it a changing cultural paradigm. Soon, smoking, which had been virtually Unheard of in Western Europe until that point, became vogue across the continent due to a steady influx of American tobacco. Meanwhile, the queen of England instructed every landowner with more than 60 acres to begin growing hemp for industrial use, with Henry the VIII fostering its use by the navy. In time, Spanish and English explorers independently introduced cannabis to the Americas, with the pilgrims bringing the utilitarian crop with them on the mayflower. In fact, the first law regarding cannabis in the new world, actually required farmers to grow it. A far cry from the draconian laws instituted just a few short centuries later. Back in Europe, Dutch explorer Jan Hogan Van Linschoten wrote of his tales to the near east, where he had encountered hashish, a preparation of cannabis leaves, that, like Ancient Greek philosopher Galen had once described, 'filled the head' And while cannabis use did not take off in Europe immediately thereafter, an awareness of this powerful plant began to grow, especially among the creative communities. Among it's users during this time period was famed playwright, William Shakespeare. While unknown until recently, Shakespeare is now believed to have smoked weed, as indicated by the numerous smoking pipes containing cannabis resin discovered on the grounds of his former property. Pipes that date back to the time in which Shakespeare lived. As we have discussed, Shakespeare wasn't the first writer to utilize this sacred herb. And he certainly wasn't the last. It is well documented in History textbooks that the founding fathers of America were wealthy farmers. What they farmed, however, is almost never discussed. These men, and many of their countrymen alike, were actually hemp farmers, as hemp was used in the manufacture of rope, clothes, and other goods. Growing Cannabis was so much a part of American culture that weed was even depicted on the back of the $10 bill in the early 1900s, which was also printed on hemp paper. In fact, Thomas Jefferson once said \u201cHemp is of first necessity to the wealth and protection of the country\u201d But rest assured, in those early days of the U.S. cannabis was used for a lot more than simply making textiles. George Washington is known to have used it medicinally for tooth aches, and said \u201cMake the most of the Indian Hemp seed, and sow it everywhere.\u201d James Madison, the father of the constitution, once claimed that hemp gave him the insight to form a new and democratic nation and James Monroe, who took up the habit of smoking cannabis during his tenure as ambassador to the French, smoked it until his death. But the American founders weren\u2019t the only world leaders of this time period who used cannabis. In the 1830s, an Irish physician named William Brooke O\u2019Shaughnessy saw marijuana being used medicinally while on a trip to India. Astonished at its efficacy, O\u2019shaughnessy brought the plant back with him to England, introducing this \u2018indian hemp\u2019 to physicians there for use in the treatment of everything from arthritis to epilepsy. Soon, Queen Victoria of England began using medical marijuana for her menstrual cramps, under instruction from her physician. Independent of O\u2019shaughnessy\u2019s reintroduction of medical cannabis, Napoleon\u2019s army brought hash back with them from their excursions in Egypt, and appear to be the true beginnings of widespread hashish consumption in the early modern period in Europe. By the mid 1800s, a group of French Luminaries started the Club De Hashischins, a Parisian club dedicated to the consumption of hash and other drugs. One of the most esteemed writers of this circle Charles Baudelaire wrote \u201cThe Poem of Hashish\u201d and \u201cArtificial Paradises\u201d lauding the use of Hashish and opium, insisting that they, theoretically, could aid mankind in reaching an \u201cideal\u201d world. In America, Fitz Hugh Ludlow wrote, \u201c The Hashish Eater\u2019 about his numerous experiences in eating cannabis. This book became wildly popular, with President Lincoln\u2019s secretary of state John Hay fondly remembering \u201ceating hasheesh and dreaming dreams\u201d during his youth at brown university. When we return, marijuana\u2019s shift in public perception from medicine to menace. As reports of marijuana\u2019s efficacy began to be published, it quickly became mainstream medicine across Europe and the United States, primarily in the form of extracts, which were used for an ever increasing array of conditions. But by the early 1900s, the American Medical Association was established, creating an orthodoxy in medical treatment that some argue demonized herbal healers. This uniformity allowed for heavy licensing fees for physicians, which many traditional practitioners were incapable of paying. The AMA, a private company, soon had a monopoly on the medical industry. Cannabis was banned in California, Massachusetts and a handful of other states shortly thereafter, while many physicians and pharmacists under the new regulations embraced the potential of this wonder drug. During the prohibition era, in which alcohol and other drugs were banned nationwide, a number of other states followed suite in penalizing cannabis use. Interestingly, in states that didn\u2019t ban the herb, cannabis serves as somewhat of a replacement for booze, with shops called \u2018tea pads\u2019 opening up that offered cannabis based tea, a legal intoxicant that served as a loophole in a country unaccustomed to its new, inebriant free lifestyle. From there, its popularity only increased, becoming widely used among American jazz musicians, and Ex-Pat writers of what is reffered to as \u201cThe Lost Generation\u201d in Paris, one of whom was Gertrude stein. Her lover, Alice B Toklas, is often credited with having invented the pot brownie during this time period. Meanwhile, In America, advancements to a machine called the decorticator allowed hemp fibers to be stripped from the plant at a far more efficient rate, leading to popular mechanics calling cannabis the new billion dollar crop. Hemp had already been superior in that it takes significantly less time to grow than trees. But now, with production simplified by the decorticator, it was really no contest whatsover. This did not sit well with publisher and industrialist, William Randolph Hearst who, aside from owning much of the media of that time, also owned the paper factories on which his newspapers were printed. Soon, he began publishing propaganda pieces insisting that Mexican immigrants who smoked cannabis violently raped women. As society had grown familiar with cannabis and its many benefits, Hearst chose to use the term \u201cmarijuana\u201d which had, up until this point, only been used to describe a wild Mexican variety of tobacco completely unrelated to cannabis. Soon, the dangers of this new supposed threat had alarmed American society. A small church group produced a morality tale entitled \u201cTell Your Children\u201d about this new drug that supposedly made its users turn violent. At this time, a new motion picture code had recently been instituted by the US government which prevented movies from featuring gratuitous violence or sex. An opportunistic film producer, Dwain Esper, purchased \u201cTell your children\u201d, recutting the film to include such taboo behavior so he could distribute it on the exploitation film circuit that sprung up in response to these new film regulations. He renamed it, \u201cReefer Madness.\u201d For Esper, like Hearst, it was all about the money. But the American people truly did begin to fear this dangerous drug marijuana, largely due to the steadily growing stream of propaganda. Hearst quickly used his resources to begin lobbying politicians, including Harry Anslinger, head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, a precursor to today\u2019s DEA. Up until that point, the FBN was in charge of preventing opiates like heroin from being smuggled into the country. But Anslinger soon made marijuana a priority, drafting the Marihuana tax act of 1937 to greatly diminish the strength of the hemp industry that was beginning to effect both Anslinger\u2019s paper and Du Ponte\u2019s nylon sales. Even the American Medical Association believed that the act went too far. They claimed that the bill, which had quickly been drafted in secret, did not allow adequate time to prepare a legal opposition. Also, with the term \u201cmarijuana\u201d used instead of cannabis, the AMA\u2019s legal defense, Dr. William Creighton Woodward argued that \u201cMarijuana is not the correct term\u2026 Yet the burden of this bill is placed heavily on the doctors and pharmacists of this country\u201d In spite of this, the new law was passed hastily, facing little opposition. The first string of arrests were made the following day. Part of the new law indicated that tax stamps were supposed to be given to those interested in growing cannabis, but virtually none were issued, and farmers feared that by seeking the government\u2019s approval on the matter, they would be incriminating themselves. One of the main opponents of the law was the mayor of new York city, Fiorello La Guardia, for whom la guardia airport is named. In 1938 he appointed a commission to investigate the new bill, later creating \u2018the la guardia committee\u2019 to oppose Anslinger\u2019s draconian campaign against cannabis. The committee was unsuccessful, and in 1942, cannabis was officially removed from medical textbooks. That same year, the US dept. of agriculture and even the army themselves urged farmers to grow hemp, releasing a propaganda film of their own, Hemp for Victory, talking about the importance of the crop. Soon, with World War II in full swing, tax stamps were issued to allow the plant to be grown. But this change of heart was short lived, and cannabis arrests continued, increasing during this period, as did the drug\u2019s popularity. Finally, in 1969, after being arrested for possession, Harvard professor and psychedelic pioneer Timothy Leary challenged the Marihuana tax act in court. In \u201cLeary vs. the United States\u201d it was determined by a federal judge that the marihuana tax act was unconstitutional and the law was overruled. In response, congress passed the controlled substances act of 1970 to ensure that cannabis remained illegal, as it was used heavily by the anti-war hippie counter culture, and black Americans fighting for civil rights. The DEA was born. President Nixon hired a team of scientists to prove the dangers of the substance to help justify his decision. When just the opposite was found, and the commission he had appointed called for the decriminalization of marijuana, he threw the study in the trash. Cannabis has been illegal at the federal level ever since. Over the years, numerous states have seen the error of their ways and decriminalized it, with some legalizing it for medical and even recreational purposes. Now, nearly \u00be of the US population supports legalization, but there has been a heavy pushback by the federal government, with lobbyists from the private prison industry and the prison guards union, among others, objecting to any legalization efforts. Thousands remain in prison, largely due to the propaganda and anti-drug sentiment of years past. It is worth noting the racial disparity in these drug arrests, with the majority of non-violent drug offenders being minorities. That\u2019s why it\u2019s now more important than ever for us, as a society, to look at humanity\u2019s long standing history of cannabis consumption, as a dietary staple, a sacrament, a medicine, and even its use as a textile, and to realize the error of our ways. Cannabis users are not the violent rapists they were made out to be in the 1930s, any more than they are the lazy slacker stereotype perpetuated by the media today. While there are certainly people smoking weed in their mom\u2019s basement, other users are doctors, lawyers, religious leaders and, yes, even politicians, along with virtually all other segments of the American public, with cannabis being one of the most widely consumed drugs. Modern studies have concluded that it is hundreds of times safer than alcohol. It\u2019s even safer than Tylenol. The failed laws of yesteryear, the narrow, 2 dimensional stereotypes, the anti-science and anti-intellectual arguments for prohibition need to be revisited, questioned, and challenged.

your eyes out for the next video", "JsL--trSNb4": "[Applause] thank you thank you for the invite so most organizations have figured out the way to pack a room is to use the words marijuana or cannabis so this talk has nothing to do with that I'm here to sell you some cars so thank you for coming and we'll talk about the Kia Sorento No so let's talk a little bit about about the role of cannabinoids so the title it was marijuana and we're trying to move away from the use of marijuana which was actually coined by the American government many years ago when doing their sort of initiation of this Prohibition period this extensive period of prohibition that we've had and so really the active ingredients in cannabis are cannabinoids so we're going to talk a little bit about cannabinoids and I'm gonna trying to explain to you the the role of this plant in in medicine as a medicine it is a medicinal tool and I'll touch a little bit upon the recreational aspects of things as well as we go along because I think that comes to mind with with the new rules that are coming up and changing in the near future so let's see if I can it works so we'll start out by asking the question what is pain because that's what we're talking about we're talking about the role of cannabinoids in pain management so pain is a physical suffering or discomfort caused by illness or injury it can be physical in nature it can be mental and often it's a combination of the two and usually it initiates with you know some offending aspect either a broken bone a pinched nerve something like that that message is then transmitted up to the brain through the peripheral nervous system first through the spinal cord afterwards up to the brain it's processed in the brain that's kind of the mental aspect of things so it's processed up in the brain and then there are subsequent messages that go back down to the painful area to try and limit the amount of pain and to activate inflammatory responses and healing process and other things that take place so that's kind of the the basics of what how pain works and really we can kind of divide pain up a little bit more so that we're all kind of start at the same foundation of what we're talking about so pain can be divided up into an acute pain process which some comes on really quickly lasts for usually a relatively short period of time it can be chronic it can be lasting forever it can come on slowly often it's indolent might be sort of a two or three out of ten or it could be higher but it's chronic it lasts for long periods of time and then we have components of the breakthrough pain and breakthrough pain basically are where you might have a chronic level with exacerbation it's a periods of really acute drops in between the chronic and that's sort of breakthrough pain the pain can be as a cause of either a muscle or a bone or something more Hardware origin from joints and muscles or it can be more visceral the GI tract for example attend and and visceral pain tends to be more squeezing and uncomfortable in that fashion and then it can be neuropathic as well and that's kind of what we're gonna talk a little bit more about today which is the neuropathic pain then your Pathak pain really is a result of usually excuse me some form of damage or pressure to nerves often will have some sharp or shooting type pain burning type discomfort it's often associated with inflammation and that's important to keep in mind the inflammation often makes the pain worse in this scenario alright it often tends to be chronic it and then it has subsequent sequelae of the pain being present such as fatigue or weakness and it tends to be one that's more it's harder to treat you know the the advils and the tylenols of the world don't tend to cut it for this kind of pain often what is the effect of pain so I don't think I've to tell everybody anyone this because I think you all have at one point another had some level of pain or discomfort you understand that it can be it can be quite frustrating it can cause anxiety and anger fear depression it can lead to poor concentration and memory that can have sleep deprivation and fatigue so pain is not just the just a symptom of pain but it has a huge rundown effect a sequela again from that so what are the painful episodes in myeloma it's often as so first of all pain is the most common symptom in myeloma affecting up to 80% of patients at some point in another the sensation which causes discomfort or distress and it's often a signal that the body is dealing with an injury or illness the brain gathers this information as I showed you the pictorial the earlier on it gathers this information it processes it and then it sends out signals and usually traditionally we think pain was caused because of a means of the body trying to protect itself right so it's a warning system to the body to not you know exert anymore I said you know pressure or downside to that area that's that's hurting so it's meant to be a protecting mechanism in there the common symptoms and complications of myeloma pain have a significant impact of course on the quality of life as we have discussed briefly and so controlling this pain controls can have a lot of impact on a lot of other aspects of your life including the sleep the anger the depression etc that goes with it all right so the pain that we get most often in myeloma is often associated with bony related pain it can be due to thinning out of the bone or osteopenia and it can be resulting from lytic lesions that are caused that may cause dull achy pain on an ongoing basis this is of course prominent in my little bit off and also president many other cancers I deal a lot with prostate cancer in my business and I see a lot of prostate cancer metastatic disease to the bone and bony related pain as a result of that so and it can be quite and very debilitating for for our patients you can end up with bony fractures and can these can be compression fractures in the spinal cord for example or they can be outright fractures of long bones femurs and and the arms and things like that so when you get to bony destruction you end up getting various different to quality of that itself so you can get high levels of calcium spilling into the blood and the calcium itself can go through and start to cause grief in the gastrointestinal tract so you can get abdominal pain vomiting nausea etc as a result of the hypercalcemia that takes place you can get peripheral neuropathies because of some of the drugs that we use to treat the cancers and then there are of course paraneoplastic syndromes or or there's proteins that are released from myeloma and in other conditions as well other cancers as well that can get deposited on nerves and irritate the nerves themselves and that's a kind of a neuropathic pain that that involves from that so traditionally when we treat pain inside say myeloma you might be treating the primary cause which is the cancer itself and then you might be also using painkillers and there are various different pain medications that we as physicians have in our material to utilize for for patients and these include things such as an anti-inflammatories that can involve things like Tylenol they can be things such as antidepressants such as a me trip to lean and and there could be neuro blue called neuro modulating agents such as gabapentin and carbamazepine and sometimes you use steroids to try and help with the pain as well and of course opioids are often used as well tylenol 3 with codeine or fentanyl which sort of has a nasty kind of tone to it in the recent because of what's been happening out there so these are great if they work but they don't often work and the problem also is that we can get Anne Shiell side-effects from treating with traditional pain medications so narcotics for example can result in constipation and I've seen patients who have had such severe constipation and abdominal pain that it can be very debilitating there housebound and they have a real difficult time managing it simply because of the constipation of course there is the the narcotics have effect on your on your central nervous system and they can make you you know dopey and difficult to drive and it's tired and sleepy so there are a lot of side effects some of the medications we use and and narcotics aren't the only ones right so the neuromodulators can do similar things and and even they try cyclic antidepressants can do the same sort of thing so they all have side effects that we have to monitor for as well and if you can find a balance between the positive effect of the medication versus the the downside the negative effect or the side effect then of course you have you have a winner right you have a pain medication that's working for you without a lot of side effects but often as I said that is not the case and then and you have to escalate it to try different drugs and different treatments and we also try various non drug treatments which are fantastic the exercise diet heat etc having having gone through that you do need to escalate things sometimes and the Canadian Pain Society has a treatment algorithm which in the last iteration has included cannabinoids so this is kind of a real breakthrough a real move forward I think in terms of our society and how we think about the use of cannabis in the treatment algorithms for pain so as you can see in this publication recently you start out with all the traditional ones and absolutely as a physician that's exactly what I want to do I want to try my patients on the traditional treatment first see if it works along with all the ancillary treatments is that we talked about with diet exercise etc you then escalate it if that doesn't work you might go to something that's a little more have more side effects possibly more risk but may have a benefit as well such as tramadol and opioids and when that fails this is when we start to think about cannabinoids and I'm going to discuss with you in a minute here what the rule what the evidence do to support that is and then of course there are a bunch of other fourth line medications that can also occur they can also be used sorry I'm just gonna keep an eye on my time here it can also be used for treatment when cannabinoids and other traditional medications still work as well and these are listed over here as well so plant therapy for pain management has a long-standing history you know them because you've used them alright so for example the willow bark gives us aspirin I would hazard to say that just about 99% of you have taken aspirin at some point in your life and that resulted in us learning about how that works in our body so when aspirin when willow bark derived aspirin and aspirin we went and asked what how does it work in the human body we discovered the assistant called the prostaglandins same thing with opium so the over the the poppy seed the opium poppy seed gave us morphine morphine is a drug again that you know in the narcotic family and we've got a bunch of synthetics that have come along since then but that was that's a pain medication that you are all familiar with or at least are aware of and that in fact resulted in us learning about the endorphins in our limb body and their can and the in kefflin system as well so we learned about that as well well cannabis is no different so cannabis itself you know which comes from the cannabis plant we have now started to identify the active ingredients I should say now it's known for many years but we're starting to learn more about them now but they're what the active ingredients are in this plant just like aspirin just like morphine alright so THC and CBD are two active components that are inside the cannabis plant that that we utilize for pain management we utilize it for a lot of other things too but we're going to talk about pain this has resulted in us actually learning about how that works and that's through the endocannabinoid system so the endocannabinoid system is extremely well studied really well known and teased apart down to the molecular and cellular level we have a really good understanding of this system and how it works we're now discovering how we can manipulate this system so that we can get better pain management and other benefits the cannabis has alright so as I said plants have a long-standing history and pain management goes back over three thousand years you know Egyptians have there's there's evidence where they were Gyptian relics dating back to the 16th century BC appear to have ascribed medicinal benefits to cannabis so when you look at it internationally there is some strong evidence of long-standing use of this plant and I won't go into why we have really kind of created this taboo around cannabis but it really there is a specific lineage of how this came about through through the American government we can discuss that one-to-one at some point it's a it's an interesting story so does cannabis have does does cannabis have any evidence for success in use and the answer is yes it does alright so I'm gonna give you the pro in the con so there is multiple randomized control trials which are in medicine we consider you know sort of the PSLV the source of treat of studies that are done and their multiples trials done in various different disease entities such as HIV or multiple sclerosis or chronic neuropathic pain and these randomized clinical trials have on the hall shown a benefit for the use of cannabis and these are just some of them listed up here there are there are there are many of my colleagues that would say well there's no evidence to support the use of cannabis and they will quote a number of articles showing that there's no benefits so I'm gonna try and explain to you why there exists some controversy in medicine and how we're getting about that controversy now but there is evidence and there is evidence to support the use of this of this plan what's interesting though is when it comes to plant therapy unlike traditional pharmacological therapies which have a single agent that we can often derive from a plant figure out what it is and then chemically synthesize it we often forget that in plants there are multiple active ingredients and so I'm gonna encourage you to start thinking a little bit open your mind up and think a little bit wider here then a single entity a single molecule and think about plant therapy the entire plant and I'll explain to you why I think that's an important component but for one thing for example the chemistry and composition of cannabis is such that there are over 70 different phytochemicals either plant derived cannabinoids that we know have similar cannabinoids that have similar sort of makeup - endocannabinoids that are in our own systems so they mimic chemicals that are already in our body so these are plant derived chemicals that mimic what we have in our body okay and there's actually almost 500 distinct different compounds in these plants and we're only starting to now understand and learn about them more and more but again the key ones that we understand really well are CBD and THC alright those are the two active ingredients that we understand better the thing to keep in mind is that some of the controversy that comes around the use of the whole plant is that the plant will change what it's growing how much THC it has the kind of CBD it has based on the climate it's grown in and the soil is growing grown in how long it's growing for etc so there are some properties which are that haven't been sort of standardized by nature and give us different and therefore they give us a different outcome in the plant and it's not a dramatic difference but it might be a slight difference enough to make one person taking it for one study respond really well and another person taking it for the same study but taking a slightly different plant derivative not respond as well so those slight differences can occur and they might be just the different type of plant types so we're understanding that now better in medicine and in science and so what we're doing is we're standardizing how we grow the plants and we're we're breaking down the plants chemically so we understand what's in them and that's what we're using for studies now so that we're actually making it more uniform making our product more uniform so that we can see what the true outcomes are in a more uniform manner when we when we enter into scientific experiments so so here's the real cool part about this whole plant right so I talked to you about THC I talked to you about CBD but there's a whole host of other components that we have now found that are very active in various aspects of disease so these are for example terpenes terpenes are what give cannabis the smell so THC and CBD don't have any odor you that's not what you smell so when you smell weed when you smell cannabis right what you're smelling is the terpenes and these terpenes by the way exist in a lot of other flowers okay so when you go in okay I'm I don't cook but if you go and haze various different herbs I don't cook well but if you go use the various various different herbs they all have different smells those smells actually the terpenes that you're either you're actually smelling so the terpenes exist in a lot of food groups that we consume daily now all right and they also exist in the cannabis plant it's also what gives the cannabis plant the smell all right some of these have actually been teased out and have been shown to have effects on on various different disease entities so for example there are anti-inflammatory actions there are anti malarial actions there are antibacterial act actions there analgesics or pain control actions there anxiety makes you calm Z down there they are various different they're sedatives etc etc so there's various different attributes that some of the these terpenes have and these exist in the whole plant so this is why I'm encouraging you to start thinking about hope therapy because imagine now you have THC and CBD which actually have very strong activity for pain control which I'll show you in a minute but you also have all these additional components in the whole plan but give you these other activities that help you with the pain and management or for that matter of fact it might be to help you with the sleep because you're having too much pain anxiety etc right so there are other components that help out in the whole plant in order to activate a lot of these components we need to heat the plant top and we need to heat it to a certain temperature to get the active ingredient out because the way they exist in the plant is as a is a carboxylated acid so not the way you think of hydrochloric acid but it's just a stable stable form at sitting in the plant and when you heat that it releases that the active component so this is why for example you know for generations people of for example smoked cannabis as opposed to you know just consuming so this is where juicing for example has some controversy around it because in juicing you don't actually heat it up you're actually using the unactivated format but there are some benefits that have been shown there as well anyway the reason I bring this up is is because I will talk to you a little bit about smoking and vaping and stuff just so you kind of have a sense of where where this medicine is going let me just switch gears for a second here and talk a little bit about the endocannabinoid system so that you can have an understanding of why it works so the endocannabinoid system as i said is really well studied we understand it well there are receptors there are at least two receptors that we're we have studied well called CB cb1 and cb2 receptors they're found throughout the body but the but the highest density is of cb1 receptors is found in the brain and in various parts of the brain but the most important thing I think to take away is that what's really interesting is that there are almost zero CB receptors and almost zero endocannabinoid receptors in the brainstem the brainstem is the part that controls our heart rates it's the part that controls our breathing so when you hear about a fentanyl death in the media the reason that fentanyl kills or carb fentanyl or other morphine or other things the reason that they kill is because the in kefflin system the the these so fentanyl etc have receptors in the brain stem so there are lots of receptors in the brain stem so when fentanyl hits the blood and then gets into the brain it goes to the brain stem it causes respiratory depression and the person then dies usually of a cardiac arrest because there isn't enough oxygen to go to the heart to allow the heart to pump and they die they have a cardiac arrest this is what causes death from morphine fentanyl etc okay cannabis does not have receptors in the brain stem you'd probably have to consume 30 or 40 truckloads full of cannabis to try and load up the brain enough and you'd probably not be able to do that right and even then chances are that you would just throw up and maybe feel sleepy and go to sleep so there are actually no recorded deaths from the use of cannabis itself in terms of respiratory depression I should say you know specifically the way we have seen with the fentanyl crises so that's the first probably myth that I would like to dispel because I think one of the evils of this plant that has been that has been sold is the fact that it can cause that it's you know a drug similar to fentanyl etc but it's not it doesn't have that same sort of ill effect all right so it's something to think about we also as I said have a really clear understanding about how the systems work fairly good I shouldn't say it's perfect right there's lots and lots of studies going on but we have some good understanding about how it works and so if you recall that hope Hathway from when payne got to the brain and then back in the brain you now have receptors for cannabis for cannabinoids and these receptors actually the the way cannabis works the way THC and CBD work is by blocking the signals from one nerve to the next so when the message comes up to the brain then one nerve cell now communicates with the next nerve cell and tells it this is a painful episode happening do something about it what cannabis does is it blocks that signaling between the two it down regulates it down plays it so you don't have as much activity going on so the interpretation of that pain or pain itself starts to minute diminish right so this is how we feel this is one of the mechanisms of how cannabinoids work it works in the brain to slow down that that transmission of information so that you don't feel the pain so you get pain relief alright the other way that it works is in the peripheral system so we there are there are cb2 receptors remember I told you the cb1 and cb2 receptors there are cb2 receptors that are all over the body and the main area that they sit on is in our immune system where inflammation occurs so when you now take cannabinoids into the system one they go up to the brain and stop that that flow of bad information or information of pain and two it goes to the inflammatory system and it down regulates the inflammatory system and inflammation we know releases a bunch of chemicals that cause you to sense pain to feel pain and makes the pain worse especially neuropathic pain so by doing this in a two-fold manner what you've done is you've decreased the the central nervous systems interpretation of the pain you've also decreased inflammation in the peripheral nervous system so overall you're diminishing the amount of pain but also think about this there are significant other advantages here why because we know for example that some of the receptors in the brain work on anxiety areas so it's an angle it ik it makes it calms you down so it's nothing like being in pain gets you all wrapped up and anxious but but a cannabinoid can go in there and work on that system as well to create less anxiety what about sleep because when you're in pain you certainly aren't able to sleep partly because of the pain but probably because you're thinking about your pain and thinking about everything else too as a result of that well we know that cannabis or cannabinoids also work on some sedation and they work on similar pathways as known entities such as our sleeping medications that benzodiazepines right so see racks and a bunch of other sleeping pills that we that we as physicians prescribe our patients to help sleep it works on the same sort of a system so it helps with a sleep component too so all of a sudden you have a plant-based product that has multiple components that have multiple activities and this is why some of some of the the naysayers you might say in medicine and science say well this is like snake oil it works on everything how can it work on everything well the reason it isn't really working on everything but it's working on the root controller right it's kind of working on your CPU your main your main information in your computer so rather than working on a whole bunch of different lower-level instructional things it's working at the brain center of it all so it controls a bunch of other processes as a result of that so that's the way to start to think about the WYD has multiple effects in multiple different disease processes it's not because it's snake oil it's because it really works at a higher level before all the other disseminated pieces of information get down into the body okay like any medication like any plant it has side effects this is not a benign drug right we have to treat it with respect so even though I'm telling you it's a very safe plant derived medication and it is there are side effects and we must be cognizant of these just like any other medication you take from tylenol to advil to morphine to anything else right these are some of the side effects that we see commonly when we use it and these are primarily due to THC less so due to CBD CBD doesn't tend to have as many side effects but you can see things such as you know drowsiness and fatigue nausea and a whole host of side effects that occur luckily these side effects are not are generally not life-threatening these are not life-threatening side effects that you see but they do have side effects so anyone that says it's a completely clean drug and won't have any side effects they're lying right so you it does have side effects to be aware of the other argument that's used by a lot of my colleagues is well cannabis is a gateway drug no it'll get you addicted and and you'll start taking I don't know cocaine other things right so there are multiple levels of arguments that that that you can use against this but one of the interesting things is that there are some great amount number of research articles that are in published now showing what the dependency so we'll put gateway drug into sort of the dependency category but there's a bunch of other arguments you can make about it not being a gateway drug including a bunch of really good research out of the Mayo Clinic but the butBut the dependency part is really interesting because this is really interesting publication here as you can see you know in terms of dependency you can see where it fits in the schedule of things right so you have things such as codeine and and morphine etc the opioids which are higher than than cannabis alcohol significantly higher cocaine obviously and then even nicotine cigarette smoke very very addictive so if you really put it in the in the larger scheme of things you can see how the dependency of cannabis and especially when it's used in medicine and there is a big difference there especially when it's used in medicine is almost you know it's very low it's not non-existent but it's very low right and so when you look at the overall harms it certainly falls on the lower lower rung of that of that ladder of problem automatic drugs that we have in medicine let me just diverge for a second and talk a little bit about the about use of recreational versus medicinal so I'm gonna get through a couple of controversial thoughts that I want you to think about okay so I know when I've had a hard day in the or and you know and I need to go home and relax a bit I'll pour myself a scotch and that helps me relax that's alcohol so when Joe down the street goes home and lights up his joint or vaporizes because he's had a hard day at work he's also using the same sort of a chemical as he to chill out probably true the you know the important point that I think to make is that we have stigmatized cannabis in some pretty nasty picture right at times and and I'm not saying it's not without cause I mean there's obvious obviously that's two sides to every coin and I'm not saying that we should bury our head in the sand and say no this is a perfect perfect drug it's not at all but if we if we utilize this drug in a smart way we can we can take Joe and we can learn from Joe because maybe I shouldn't be drinking alcohol which is a class 1 carcinogen rated by the World Health Organization alcohol you know versus cannabis which is not a carcinogen right so maybe I've got something to learn from Joe and something I can think about right so just a controversial thought to see it in your brain the other thing that I want you to think about also is medicinal versus recreational use so in medicine and I'll and I'll be one of my last slides we'll be going over this but in medicine we used about 1/10 to 120th the amount of cannabinoids in medicine than a recreational user we use so a recreational user will try their their goal a recreational users goal is to get maybe high right in medicine our end goal is not to get high we consider that a side effect the the end goal is to actually treat the symptom treat the pain right so I'm losing my mic you guys can hear me ok so so we have different end goals and different amounts of the cannabis or cannabinoids we're using so when we when a recreational user smokes let's say they vaporize some cannabis they're gonna get about 10 to 20 times more of THC than we would ever use in medicine so for most my patients and by the way the average age of my cannabis cannabinoid patient is I did I just looked at the numbers last week is 71 so that's the average age of people that I'm treating with cannabis right so it's not the 30 year old coming in to want to get high right it's it's a genuine pain related and or muscle spasms sleep anxiety etc so that's the average age of patients we treat but the important thing is that the amount of THC or CBD I'm giving them is about 120th what a recreational user uses ok routes of administration so if you think about let's just think about fentanyl or morphine when you're in the hospital and you're in pain I just I don't know I I took out a kidney stone from you and you're in a lot of pain I might be inclined to give you IV morphine will give you some some morphine through the IV and within a couple of minutes you're gonna feel better ok but but when you go home you know I can't you can't go home on your IV and you can't keep feeding you IV morphine so maybe if I'm a traditional physician I'm gonna give you you know fentanyl patch or morphine or oral sulfate or some other form of oral or transdermal means of giving you the pain management or a pill right so there are different forms or activities that we give people already so cannabis or cannabinoids are no different there are different ways that we can introduce it to a patient for either acute use we're in a lot of pain or chronic use where you're where you need a low level of activity throughout the throughout the day so smoking or vaporization and I'm gonna tell you why I think smoking is horrible but let's say vaporization has a very quick onset within five minutes you have pain pain activity going on but it has a relatively shorter duration to 2 to 4 hours in your system and then it wears off all right so it's got an advantage in that if you're having an acute crises lots of pain you're getting in the medication right away oral on the other hand is something that takes longer to absorb Oh step back sorry am i leaning too much okay I'm sorry oh that's way better I can hear myself now so oral oral treatment works differently in that it takes longer to absorb it's got to go through the GI tract it's got to get absorbed into the bloodstream it's got a pass to the liver and then it gets to your system and so it takes longer to get into your system but it lasts longer six to eight hours right so it gives you that nice longevity and then there's other formats right so whether it's sprays in the mouth or transdermal patches or creams etc those are not as consistent in terms of their absorption profiles right and that's true for any medication not just cannabis all right so smoking smoking heats the cannabis up to anywhere between six and nine hundred degrees Celsius it gives off carbon carbon monoxide during their during the smoking process and it potentially may give off cancer-causing agents that are in in this plant that are being burned off now having said that we don't have any studies and it might just be because we haven't studied it adequately but we don't have any studies showing that cannabis causes lung cancer like we do for nicotine okay but maybe it'll come in the future so I don't have the answer to that so I think the safer way to go about this to say you know smoking cannabis will have the same sort of effect that nicotine might all right so it gives off cancer-causing agents the other problem is that when you smoke cannabis you lose about 30% of your cannabinoids so 30% of your cannabinoids don't come out don't actually get absorbed into your system so if you're paying I don't know four or five dollars you know per gram or whatever it is you're losing 30% of your medication right on the other hand vaporization has a much you can control it better you can heat up your cannabis or cannabinoids to a certain temperature and you get very little of the toxins coming off and you absorb a much higher amount of that medication all right so when we start to introduce our patients and usually it's two oils that's how we start most of our patients so but let's say that they're having acute crises and they're willing to try vaporization then that's the right direction we go for quick-quick absorption versus smoking which we discourage all right so driving in cannabis I just thought throw this in because I think this is an important thing to think about as well like any other medication cannabinoids are also a medicine also need to be treated with respect you can have it it's you may have some level of sedation when you take cannabinoids especially if you're taking THC for inflammation and pain it might make you sleepy when you're driving and stuff so bottom line is if you feel impaired don't drive don't operate heavy equipment don't do what you you know wouldn't normally do if you let's say if you were really tired you've been up for 48 hours and you're really tired well you wouldn't drive hopefully right or you went out with a bunch of friends and you had a bottle of wine you would drive so treat cannabis in no different way in that way be safe about it right if you know that you're that it's affecting you making you sedated then don't then just don't drive right so some of the things that did I touched upon let me just kind of give you a quick overview that I'm going to give you some some interesting take-home points here so we talked about cannabinoids and how their whole plant therapy is very beneficial because they're there they're a bunch of other terpenes and other things within the whole plant that have benefits have multiple benefits we talked about the fact that when we when we understand cannabis we understand the endocannabinoid system when we understand the endocannabinoid system we have a new system in which we understand how the pain nerves are being modulated how Sleeps been modulated how anxieties being modulated we talked a little bit about what pain was and the kind of pain that cancer can cause and the bony pain which is often inflammatory in nature or fractures and therefore cannabis having both essentially acting ability to surpass pain but also peripherally acting on the inflammation way of suppressing pain it's a it's a it's a great drug to be able to use a medication to to use for pain control and then we talked a little bit about the safety aspects of cannabis as well as I mentioned to you I highly discourage smoking I think there's multiple reasons including the fact that you don't get your medicine properly and that there is potential for cancer which you don't have evidence for but it there is potential that the fact that THC that the THC content that we use to treat pain is about one tenth or one twentieth or less than the recreational user in our practice when we prescribe cannabis we start low very low and we titrate up to get your pain management if you start to get side effects you're getting too drowsy you're getting high you're feeling couch locked or any of these side effects these are side effects of the medicine we say okay that's dial it back we have to try either a different approach or a different combination with CBD and THC because CBD does not by the way cause all those side effects so all the side effects were talking about are THC driven right so that is the sedation etc so we then change the ratio of CBD to THC and we get something that fits correctly for the patient we talked a little bit about yeah so so basically the effects of the high we talked a little bit about the recreational user versus the medical user we talked about the safety aspects and the fact that the that the brain stem does not have receptors for the cannabinoids and so it's very safe we talked about the driving issues as well so just I want to just end quickly with how the process works sorry I hope that projects okay but basically the way that that medical cannabis is being administered at this time before legalization and I and I can I can't see why that would change after legalization is currently the patient would go to their family doctor have a discussion with their family doctor about about the potential for one to try cannabis there are a bunch of resources that we are happy to provide the family doctor who may say I know nothing about it I don't think it's a good idea we are happy to educate our colleagues as well to help them understand where cannabis fits in all this once you've had that conversation either your family physician would then go ahead with the process of getting you're registered with Health Canada if they're comfortable doing that if not they would refer you to someone who does that so for example we run a clinic that does that so we would get a referral from the family doctor then one of our physicians would then see the patient do the evaluation make sure that there's they're appropriate for this one of our counselors would sit down and talk to you about what cannabis is how to use it where to get it all that kind of stuff so one important thing here is that dispensaries so there are lots and lots of dispensaries out there I'm sure there are some fantastic dispensaries some extremely knowledgeable individuals in these dispensaries but at this time dispensaries are not the legal Avenue to obtain cannabis so until we until the laws change the only place that you can legally get cannabis is through a licensed producer and a licensed producer does not have a storefront that is Health Canada's ruling so the licensed producers when they get the the information from the doctor to them they will register you you will order on their website and they will ship to you directly to your door the cannabis the cannabinoids okay the oils and the plants so at this point in time that is the only legal Avenue to get it all right I think there's I'll take that in a second and I think there's like as I said I think there's there's lots of dispensaries that are very helpful and probably have very good products but we can only speak to the legal route right now and that's the only legal route right now you had a question about that I think yeah so so growing your own is absolutely possible yes so I can I'll I'll take that into the question answer I'll just I'll just end quickly by saying that once that information is gathered we we then fax a letter into the licensed producer and you're registered with Health Canada to be able to purchase the cannabis off the websites and they get shipped right to your door the actual container that you receive it in that is your your evidence of licence as long as you leave it in the container that is how you show that you have a medical license or medical letter to use cannabis for medical reasons okay so I'm gonna end with that for now this is basically what I was just saying right now and this is just our contact information but we're not the only game in town I'm not here to promote us particularly I'm just saying that there that you family doctors can do this there are lots of physicians who are comfortable than doing cannabis work and and you can choose any any condition that can help you with that but we're helping we're happy to help through that process as well so I'm gonna end my talk there but I'm gonna take that question right off the bat and before I take other questions is that okay do I have time to take some questions okay perfect so yes you can grow for yourself again you still need it to be registered through Health Canada so what you do is you go to the physician the physician would write the letter now instead of me faxing it to the licensed producer so that you can buy from them you would then get a hard copy of that letter saying I'm authorizing you to grow or I'm giving you the letter to grow you will then take that letter with the application that's available online and you send that to Health Canada and then something happens in that black box and you get back a little sort of certificate saying that you are allowed to grow that and so that is the current yes you can do that of course that medicine is only for you and it's not to be subdued and sold and passed on to your friends or anything like that right so that's the whole idea of self growing and and so yes that is still available come legalization as I understand it you'll be able to have up to five plants I think it is per host two plants okay I thought is five plants anyways is this any way Health Canada or they will they will define exactly what that will look like you know with with legalization as well yeah sorry I didn't hear that okay so so yeah so so yeah absolutely as long as you repeat the question sorry so so the question was is there an advantage to to putting it in tea so this gets back to juicing so juicing and teas so tea is difficult because teas you have to really heat up you'd almost have to boil the cannabis it to create the tea because you need to heat it up to that level in order to activate the cannabinoids and then you can consume it in a liquid form at cannabis and cannabinoids are not water-soluble generally they are oil soluble so tea might be more difficult to actually get your medication into your body effectively right and it's gonna be erratic one day you'll have lots another you might not have enough so I think it's not a safe manner same with juicing like juicing basically works on using THC a so that's the acidic form and your and your and your extracting that but again we don't have clear evidence of where th CA and CB da fits in the pain management but more so we don't know how much and how much of it you absorb because it's liquid or acidic format versus an oil format yes yes you'll have the same sort of okay so sorry so I'll just repeat that quickly the two questions were how do you know the dosage when you're growing your own and the second one was there's other formats such as suppositories that maybe you can take and and whether that changes the side-effects I'll take the second question first and that is when you do a suppository yes that is a great way to absorb it it's just another mucosal surface just like your mouth but the side effects will be the same so if you're absorbing the medicine the medicine is what's causing the side effects you'll still get the side effects whether it's done it should be the same because it's whether you're absorbing it through the mouth or through the rectum it should give you the same effect but there are some local pelvic absorption that takes place in a different format so there might be some subtle differences I think it's individual to individual for sure but so there is some benefit to it you know right and then in terms of the dosage so that's where you need to go see you know like a cannabis clinician who can start you out in a very low dose and usually for growing we we anticipate where you might get to based on your history and what you've told us and everything and we'll say we think you're gonna get to this and so we'll we'll make sure that you've got enough of a plant count tips to get that and then we back it down and say don't take that much right off the bat start low and work your way up the ladder to get to the dose you want to get to okay I'll be around I'll be around afterwards and so I think we're running short on time and I'm happy to take questions as well and answer any questions you might thank you very much good for you", "n4Rb4U7J-yA": "what's up world
