{"WsLW4rqgs50": "what is up guys I am the 4/20 gamer and today we're gonna be reviewing this clear shatter from Queen of Hearts it's a mimosa clear shatter here is a wonderful budget product that I got locally and today we're just gonna be reviewing it giving you guys a good idea of what you get with this purchase and also if this product is any good in terms of like taste effects so much more we're also gonna be talking a little bit about this channel without further ado let's jump right into the video what is up guys I am the 4/20 gamer and welcome to my 21 of cannabis centric lifestyle show where we discover more about cannabis if this is your thing please consider liking this video and subscribing to my chin so this chatter comes in a basic glossy envelope with their logo a queen of hearts in the front with that gold foil for the crown and also for a little girl so almost like a holographic yukio card on the back is that Queen of Hearts logo and a sticker to tell you exactly what you're getting inside very basic product we're gonna go ahead and open this so inside get a parchment paper with a concentrate in the center as you can see I used a lot of it so this is not going to be a blind tasting I've been really liking this product thought I share with you guys first thing you notice when you open up this parchment paper is just how clear this concentrate is it's a nice light golden color and I'm like on the yellow side it's very stable and almost glass like exactly what you expect from a shatter and in terms of looks this thing gets a solid 4.5 out of 5 pretty decent looking product let's talk about the genetics and terpenes mimosa is a cross between Clementine and purple punch this hybrid is known for its fruit punch and citrusy aroma the three main terpenes that you would find in mimosa are mersin pining and limonene so I expect to smell and taste something herbal piney and citrusy we're gonna go ahead analyze the smell a little bit yeah because it's so stable like in cold in here you can't really smell it so I'm gonna go ahead and warm it between my fingers a bit release some that smell you get a hint of the citrus and a little bit of the sweetness but overall you can't really smell it too well so in terms of smell I'll give this thing a 3.5 out of 5 pretty decent smell let's go ahead and taste this thing now you see I've broken off a pretty healthy sized dab I'm gonna be using it out of my puff go peak on the green if you don't know what the puff peak is it's a portable electronic dab rake one of my favorite devices that I own [Music] in terms of flavor first thing you notice is the sweet citrus taste of the strain very typical of what you expect from a mimosa very good very delicious vibrant in terms of taste I would give this strain a 4.7 out of five mimosa is definitely one of my favorite tasting strains of all time and this mimosa is definitely fair emoji so in terms of effects I give this thing another 4.5 right away you can definitely feel the tension in the back of your head very classic of a sativa type of effect here's something that is perfect for that mood boost that you've been looking for this strain is good for like depression and good for daytime activities just going out doing something you want to be two days there stun and this would be a perfect product for that situation so overall this little s that gets a 4.7 out of five it is definitely pretty good and if you had the chance to try it I would definitely try this one this is the Queen of Hearts the most clear cheddar that wraps up the string review portion of this video now I'm just gonna talk about what I have in store for you guys you peeps at the weed too so let's talk about the face review yes it's still happening it's still at the subscriber count that we mentioned last time we're almost halfway there I decided seven months ago that we would combine both the YouTube subscribers and the we tube subscribers and call that the goal honestly let me tell you guys the true reason why you know I haven't revealed myself yet the true reason is honestly because of privacy being a Asian person I'm Asian in this community brings with it so much stigma we were taught at a very young age how to think about it what to think about it so that's basically why I'm like deathly terrified being judged basically specifically my family I'm really afraid of being judged by them thank you guys so much for watching my video this has been a quick sesh and review of this Queen of Hearts the most shatter definitely something pretty cool pretty worth it if you have the opportunity to try this product definitely try it and please come back and tell us what you thought of it until next time thank you guys so much for watching I am

pop culture since well pot but as the popularity of Deb's continues to grow so the questions about the many forms these concentrates can take all concentrates are made through a process called extraction where marijuana's main ingredients are concentrated into an essential oil the main three solvents used to create Deb's are butane co2 and ISO isopropyl alcohol after extraction the resulting Deb's can look very different today we're taking a closer look at the three main types of concentrates shatter butter and oil oil is a gooey sticky liquid that can be kind of hard to handle while butter has a creamier consistency from being whipped finely shatter is smooth clear and solid all three can be used in vape pens and oil rigs but finding the right concentrate for you is a matter of preference shatter is the purest and most potent form because it involves a second extraction process that removes fats lipids and waxes this can result in over 80 percent THC however it also means that some of those tasty terpenes are removed therapies are responsible for marijuana's unique smell combined with THC terpenes create the flavor of the pot or concentrate your smoking butter retains more terpenes so it tends to be more flavorful but less potent with THC percentages in the 70s oil tends to be the least refined of the three this form also known as honey oil or butane hash oil can retain a full flavor profile however THC levels are generally less consistent unfortunately availability often determines what type of concentrate you smoke but hopefully this little guide helps those lucky enough to have a choice thanks for watching and stay tuned to hi x comm for more Deb related content including how to select a nail and the rig you [Music]", "DI9-QYSWuhI": "Hello everyone, Nick Tennant here. I'm very\u00a0\nproud today to present you another Precision\u00a0\u00a0 product - our new CRC color remediation and\u00a0\nchromatography column. It does a lot of different\u00a0\u00a0 features, like variable media, and I want to show\u00a0\nyou some of the key aspects of how we designed\u00a0\u00a0 this particular piece of equipment. So the first\u00a0\nthing that you're going to notice is you've got\u00a0\u00a0 two very big columns in the back here and that's\u00a0\nbecause these are surge tanks. You need to surge\u00a0\u00a0 your solvent off of your material in a very quick,\u00a0\nrapid manner. We don't want to leave our solvent\u00a0\u00a0 soaking on our material for a long period of time,\u00a0\ntypically with a hydrocarbon that can be as short\u00a0\u00a0 as three to seven minutes, and what we need to\u00a0\ndo is get that solvent off of that material so it\u00a0\u00a0 doesn't pick up undesirables. So what we do with\u00a0\nthis column is we put this on the back end of for\u00a0\u00a0 example a hydrocarbon system and we're surging\u00a0\nthat solvent off into the surge tanks - and\u00a0\u00a0 that's exactly what they do. Everything on this\u00a0\napparatus is obviously jacketed, everything\u00a0\u00a0 can be controlled, everything can be metered,\u00a0\nand you see that with the variety of features\u00a0\u00a0 here - but that's one of the first features\u00a0\nthat really is setting apart this particular\u00a0\u00a0 chromatography and color remediation column from\u00a0\nanybody else. So once you surge your solvent\u00a0\u00a0 into these surge tanks, what you're going to do\u00a0\nis you're slowly going to feed it out and you're\u00a0\u00a0 going to do it at a metered rate. That's going to\u00a0\ncome out and it's going to come up through here\u00a0\u00a0 and be fed into your actual chromatography column.\u00a0\nNow this is where you're going to hold your media,\u00a0\u00a0 this unit can hold a variety of different\u00a0\nmedia. And anybody that's ever worked with\u00a0\u00a0 chromatography or has ever worked with any\u00a0\nsort of remediation you know that it's almost\u00a0\u00a0 infinite what you can put in this column in terms\u00a0\nof blends and different medias. And we're going to\u00a0\u00a0 look at some of those later in the video and\u00a0\nI'll explain some of the science behind why\u00a0\u00a0 it works the way it does. But the important part\u00a0\nis you have a nice large volume of media that you\u00a0\u00a0 can put in here, more than adequate for your\u00a0\nsurge tank, you can meter, you can control the\u00a0\u00a0 pressure. This whole unit is rated up to 350 PSI.\u00a0\nSo if you want to experiment with temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 if you want to experiment with resonance times\u00a0\nthrough your media, if you want to experiment\u00a0\u00a0 with higher pressures or back charging nitrogen\u00a0\n(the units equipped to back charge nitrogen),\u00a0\u00a0 you get that higher pressure that higher\u00a0\npenetration into the media. This unit can\u00a0\u00a0 do all that. Obviously when you look overall at\u00a0\nthe craftsmanship, something we're very proud of\u00a0\u00a0 obviously, you've got the the stand that's been\u00a0\nbeautifully powder coated. You've got everything\u00a0\u00a0 made out of beautiful American stainless\u00a0\nsteel. The unit you can see it has all the\u00a0\u00a0 junctions and fittings are either compression or\u00a0\nthey are sanitary clamp, tri-clamp they call that,\u00a0\u00a0 and all the valves everything is rated as\u00a0\ncleanable - which makes it GMP-ready. Which is\u00a0\u00a0 fantastic for anybody that's in the hemp market,\u00a0\nanybody that's looking towards cGMP compliance,\u00a0\u00a0 anybody that wants a traceable product and all the\u00a0\npaperwork, operating manuals obviously, are all up\u00a0\u00a0 to GMP standards - in terms of the IQ, the OQ, the\u00a0\nmaterial certifications, so that's outstanding.\u00a0\u00a0 Some of the other key features of this unit, you\u00a0\nknow you you can see obviously here the quick\u00a0\u00a0 releases makes it easy to take off your columns,\u00a0\neasy to disassemble, easy to make adjustments,\u00a0\u00a0 easy to clean. Everything is hard piped that\u00a0\nobviously eliminates any issues of contamination,\u00a0\u00a0 it eliminates any issues of the flexible\u00a0\nhosing getting in the way, any issues of\u00a0\u00a0 exterior contamination from any sort of medias,\u00a0\nor any sort of dust or anything in the lab.\u00a0\u00a0 So ultimately you know when you're looking at this\u00a0\nunit it's a ready turn-key GMP ultra-clean unit\u00a0\u00a0 that can refine these contaminants out of your\u00a0\nextract. So let's talk about the science behind\u00a0\u00a0 why this unit works, why it's relevant, and\u00a0\nwhat we're really trying to accomplish with it.\u00a0\u00a0 So when we extract from a cannabis or hemp\u00a0\nplant we're trying to pull out the cannabinoids,\u00a0\u00a0 the terpenoids, or the terpenes, and we want\u00a0\nto extract those in the most purified fashion\u00a0\u00a0 possible. But what happens is sometimes we\u00a0\nget contamination, sometimes we get mold,\u00a0\u00a0 sometimes we get mildew, sometimes we get\u00a0\npesticides, sometimes we get heavy metals,\u00a0\u00a0 sometimes it's just degraded biomass that's\u00a0\nbeen oxidized that we want to remove things\u00a0\u00a0 like Pheophytin and things that are providing\u00a0\ndiscoloration or contributing to discoloration\u00a0\u00a0 or a low quality product. And the way that we\u00a0\ndo that is we do it through selective medias.\u00a0\u00a0 So there's a variety of different medias you can\u00a0\nuse and the universe is like infinite in terms of\u00a0\u00a0 the media's you can use. Some of these medias\u00a0\nthat you may be familiar with, or maybe not,\u00a0\u00a0 they could be things like chinit, could be\u00a0\ndiatomaceous earth, they can be different types of\u00a0\u00a0 sands, different types of silicas, different types\u00a0\nof carbons, they can be blends of any of those.\u00a0\u00a0 They can be different types of preparations of any\u00a0\nof those different densities, different pressures.\u00a0\u00a0 So all of these things kind of come together to\u00a0\ncreate this wide, wide variety of different media\u00a0\u00a0 that you can put into this apparatus to achieve\u00a0\na desired outcome. So maybe I'm somebody that\u00a0\u00a0 is in California and my neighbor sprayed a\u00a0\npesticide that's coming over into my field\u00a0\u00a0 and now my crop is contaminated. Well\u00a0\nwhen you extract that, obviously this\u00a0\u00a0 myclobutanil, or whatever it is, it could be avid,\u00a0\nit could be any of these pesticides - it's coming\u00a0\u00a0 with that extraction. Ultimately, it needs to be\u00a0\nremoved by a device like this. So what we've done\u00a0\u00a0 at Precision is really spend a lot of time in\u00a0\nR&D developing our tech behind this. Developing\u00a0\u00a0 uses of the media that can go in this,\u00a0\nso we've got a great SOP for pesticides,\u00a0\u00a0 we've got a great SOP for color remediation,\u00a0\nwe've got a great SOP for heavy metals,\u00a0\u00a0 and we continue to expand this knowledge in this\u00a0\ndatabase so clients that purchased this product\u00a0\u00a0 were able to get them these new proprietary medias\u00a0\nand proprietary media blends along with the SOP\u00a0\u00a0 to achieve these desired results. Which\u00a0\nis outstanding. It provides a very,\u00a0\u00a0 very streamlined way for our clients to create a\u00a0\nvery desirable end product from almost any kind of\u00a0\u00a0 biomass under the sun, which is outstanding.\u00a0\nSo let's take a look at some of the medias\u00a0\u00a0 generally, so you get an idea of what they look\u00a0\nlike, what we use, how we think about them.\u00a0\u00a0 I'll give you a close-up of some of this stuff,\u00a0\nso let's take a look at some of these medias and\u00a0\u00a0 have a little explanation around them so you\u00a0\nhave a better understanding of really what\u00a0\u00a0 we're doing from a scientific level here.\u00a0\nSo obviously one of the most ubiquitous,\u00a0\u00a0 generally-used adsorbents is activated carbon, and\u00a0\nyou can really just see it's just black. It's like\u00a0\u00a0 a black powdery substance, and the surface\u00a0\narea of what's in this right here - this is\u00a0\u00a0 about 100 milliliters. This is probably about 25\u00a0\nfootball fields of surface area and it's because\u00a0\u00a0 the activated carbon has a very porous surface\u00a0\nright, so you have all these different molecules\u00a0\u00a0 that can be trapped in there all these different\u00a0\nconstituents of that miscella that can be trapped\u00a0\u00a0 in here. And really what happens is all these\u00a0\ndifferent medias that we're going to show you\u00a0\u00a0 have different pore sizes, they have different\u00a0\naffinities for different molecules, and that's\u00a0\u00a0 ultimately the science behind it. So this may\u00a0\ntake out something really, really, really good,\u00a0\u00a0 this may take out something really, really,\u00a0\nreally, good - but they won't do the same thing.\u00a0\u00a0 So let's look at some of these medias even up\u00a0\nclose. So here we have a different type of media\u00a0\u00a0 and this is one of our proprietary blends. This\u00a0\nis a mix of coral sands with some other things\u00a0\u00a0 that are impregnated into it that I can't talk\u00a0\nabout on camera, but this does a really, really,\u00a0\u00a0 amazing job. I'm going to show you some samples\u00a0\nof what we were able to remediate color wise\u00a0\u00a0 and still get a very, very stable cannabinoid\u00a0\nprofile and terpenoid profile. But if we look\u00a0\u00a0 at this - almost looks like sand on the beach and\u00a0\nit effectively kind of is - right? I mean that's\u00a0\u00a0 coral sand to some degree.\u00a0\nSo actually what this is,\u00a0\u00a0 is coral reefs that have washed ashore and\u00a0\nthey've degraded over thousands and thousands\u00a0\u00a0 of years and those coral reefs have a capacity\u00a0\nto adsorb certain components and they may absorb\u00a0\u00a0 certain things out of our miscella that is\u00a0\nundesirable. For example pesticides, for example\u00a0\u00a0 color, things like heavy metals - all these\u00a0\ndifferent things that we want to remove\u00a0\u00a0 we just have to find the right lock and key.\u00a0\nAnd when we talk about extraction, and you've\u00a0\u00a0 watched some of my other videos, we talked about\u00a0\nthe lock and key methodology or the lock and key\u00a0\u00a0 sort of way of thinking about how to isolate\u00a0\nthese molecules, and that's exactly what we're\u00a0\u00a0 doing with these medias. We're just doing it after\u00a0\nextraction. So lock and key with the solvent is to\u00a0\u00a0 get it out of the plant, now how do we get the\u00a0\ndesired molecules from the oil to a purified\u00a0\u00a0 fashion without any adulterants. So I'll show\u00a0\nyou another media here. So this one is actually\u00a0\u00a0 chitin, or some types of the impregnated versions\u00a0\nare called chitosan, and what this is is actually\u00a0\u00a0 from crustaceans. This is from shrimp shells,\u00a0\nlobster shells, crab shells. This is actually\u00a0\u00a0 crushed crab shell and they actually impregnate\u00a0\nit with some other things. Sometimes you'll find\u00a0\u00a0 impregnated medias that are impregnated\u00a0\nwith silica or activated carbon,\u00a0\u00a0 or things like that right. So all these medias,\u00a0\nthey're all throughout the earth they can blend\u00a0\u00a0 something like this with diatomaceous earth,\u00a0\nyou blend it with activated carbon, you can do\u00a0\u00a0 different ratios, you can do impregnations.\u00a0\nAll sorts of different combinations,\u00a0\u00a0 and ultimately you just have to find that right\u00a0\nlock and that right click, that right key,\u00a0\u00a0 and that's what we spent a tremendous amount of\u00a0\ntime doing here so that our clients don't have to.\u00a0\u00a0 We give that magic formulation, that magic recipe,\u00a0\nwe put it in this machine and out comes an amazing\u00a0\u00a0 result. So let's have a look at some of the\u00a0\nresults that we're seeing and showing to our\u00a0\u00a0 clients with these types of technologies. That's\u00a0\na room temperature extraction. Very, very green.\u00a0\u00a0 And we did this intentionally to really take\u00a0\na lot of that chlorophyll out of the cannabis,\u00a0\u00a0 but this was done with just aqueous ethanol and\u00a0\nreally you understand a lot of that chlorophyll\u00a0\u00a0 is coming over. You can some of the stuff\u00a0\nis actually settled at the bottom there. But\u00a0\u00a0 really, really dark color. After using a one stage\u00a0\non one of the medias here, you can see the fallout\u00a0\u00a0 and the combination. It's starting to lighten up\u00a0\nthat color, and you can see kind of in the bottom\u00a0\u00a0 of this where that media has selectively bound to\u00a0\nthose constituents in there that are undesirable,\u00a0\u00a0 that are creating that dark color, and we've\u00a0\ngot a somewhat purified sample. And then when\u00a0\u00a0 we move to a second stage or a second formulation\u00a0\npass - that's what we have. And you've got your\u00a0\u00a0 cannabinoids and your terpenes still retained\u00a0\nin there, but you have I mean you've got a water\u00a0\u00a0 clear extract - so that's fantastic. I really love\u00a0\nyou know the science behind this and and it goes\u00a0\u00a0 pretty deep and pretty wide. You know we're just\u00a0\ntalking about sort of organic medias when we talk\u00a0\u00a0 about some of the things that I mentioned, but it\u00a0\ngoes even deeper than that because you can have\u00a0\u00a0 synthetically or man-made medias. Things like\u00a0\nion anion exchange resins where we're actually\u00a0\u00a0 grabbing these molecules out of there through a\u00a0\ncharge that's just kind of - it's going to suck\u00a0\u00a0 it in. And this is where you can start purifying\u00a0\ncannabinoids and purifying individual molecules.\u00a0\u00a0 Whether you're trying to remove something\u00a0\nor you're trying to isolate something,\u00a0\u00a0 these are all things that can be done. So the\u00a0\nimportant part is that you have a very robust,\u00a0\u00a0 very clean, very universal platform that's\u00a0\ncompliant - that you know is going to be\u00a0\u00a0 around for a long time. Obviously, you can see\u00a0\nthe the quality of construction with our units\u00a0\u00a0 is like everything else that we do - it's the\u00a0\nbest in the industry. So I really appreciate\u00a0\u00a0 you taking the time to watch the video. I think\u00a0\nit was a great time well spent for everyone and\u00a0\u00a0 appreciate your support. Give us a call if\u00a0\nyou have any questions, we're here to help.", "OhQyYIxpYh8": "blue dreams shatter comin at ya uh-huh what to do everybody is all day and I got this shot off Fort Hood and they all ready to see me opened up pump I know y'all can see it glowing already look at that say 100 the Beast try to get some sunlight on it so you're gonna see this pretty good for real huh okay guys I'm just let me get this situated at the right angle focus bom-bom-bom it's now time the taste test so what up dude guys ladies adults so what's been crackin what's been going on with y'all hit me up on the comments I always read all my comments always respond hit me up anyways I'll strength up yeah whatever will crack this turn it down I don't give a damn first first and first we get this blue dream devil once again today we're going to use the ceramic dulles now cracking it out on the squirrel tail piece red carpet or micro torching it getting down so what you guys dab it on what are you smoking what kind of rigs are you using got emails you got torches big torches little torches what kind of damage you got court stammers titanium divers porcelain Devers what do you got man ceramic porcelain never never have to work a nut that's crazy if I just cracked like crazy easy I don't know them I'd be interesting to try find out experiment look that I want to get a quart snapper I don't have a cord severed all have some they're like paddles but they're nice divers but they work pretty darn good it's just getting you got to put a large dab you know does the whole thing no one about I was going to use my clean turbo peace with the turbines in it but I decided against it decided to go with the honeycomb squirrel to squirt ball so anyways you guys have tried any blue dream before I'd like to know what you guys think about it everyone that I know loves it shattered legs but all they had some wax oh I got the center column in the wax with white dude whoa almost like my dad's on the floor but that's not why I said whoa have you ever heard of tain TI ng that orange drink you make season with your water like orange flavored drink these have commercials like this monkey there's a chimpanzee excuse me you'd be like in a mug and if you already sued the gym and xena gratitude who you doing karate you should come fight people Nikki would like kick at the screen like tang it's a kick in the glass but for real though if tang is a kick in the glass this blue dream chatter is a kick in the ass like straight of you it's like a punch in the mouth like right when I hit it it was like blueberry oh if you know what i mean is just like that's what i was confident stuff so much news that was like a satisfaction come oh but [ __ ] while we're here I mean she bust out some more stuff oh I'll give you all right wait will do the column that's a new leader guy got some Kong that's super cool I think it's Hong Kong it's not Kings oh it's Hong Kong but um I mean shoot right here let's get down on the titanium yeah hmm that last step got meat hot i heated because this one [ __ ] ha at last I saw someone on it not one thing about these nets up to 10 will get hot they get hot past the ones the thing is that how they get hostile fast to get cool just as fast if not faster you know I'm saying because you're heating it up with torch then you're just like cooling it off with room temperature air I guess it's like you're sticking it in room temperature water but air instead you know me so it's less dense I guess you know it's basically the same thing as a soccer girl hope I didn't get it too hot Kool pedal cry sweat start drooling in there Wow I gotta say itanium now just one kicks this one's eyes I gotta say it man straight up it takes bedroom that one has meant its needs to be seasoned like a million more times because i seasoned it like five times as much invested in this one this one's still tastes better maybe it's the shake oh wow man that blue dream woods it's the potency that's what it is it's not that's all sorry guys like a punch because it looks like my nose like I just care on the dentist or something but anyways guys thanks for checking me out thanks for viewing you don't say it i really appreciate it well as can i say thank you keep it gangsta keep-chilling stage slopes a smokey you don't know me never ever [ __ ] you can't contact me contact me i'm trying to trying to contact you guys i'm making these videos trying to holler at y'all trying to get the feedback feedback me I get a little bit but not as much as I like you know I'm talking to you talking to everyone anyways guys who y'all want to check out the aquarium i were really done much to it but i've been cleaning it up get it more presentable who that didn't give me got me yeah we got about a minute a half left Tong Tong Tong told them I just got a little pup old black guy I used to have up there right now I got a light for it but it's currently on that tank over there you see the little but that little tiny thing right there oh look i'm editing the video right now to check that out she was cracker yes my stuff I got my I got do get my screen right here beside do it yeah you can see those lines I need to clean the back glass and it's in the front a little bit too well you can see it's gettin it's gettin real clear you see those little rubber rocks I gotta punch that saying don't know my gosh let's click on the lights you to look at some level it looks so much different so crazy this is what it's like being a fish since fish fish I this is real fisheye lens right here hedges Soviet alright guys later hope y'all enjoyed you", "2iceqqWiVDA": "gyah da word up where I'll be washing this [ __ ] so wheeze legal word figured to make episode 4 why is my light on still all this [ __ ] up here I think I think they took down everything that was like you know buds that you would want to trim up in smoke Ben left everything that's like brett makes some oil out of it so it's looking like to me it's mostly all the ares [ __ ] speaking of that since the CBD oil and plus our CBD products like the different ratios of pills like we've got a we have three to two which is some people call it one point five to one but it's a three to two for instance 60 milligrams CBD 40 milligrams THC which is perfect hunter but it doesn't happen but that would be a three to two and that's like the CBD OG it's actually a two to one flower but it makes it three to two oil like same with canna tonic two to one flower that makes a three to two oil and then we have a ten to one flower that's called XXX and it makes a four to one oil so THC is a little bit more soluble in the butane and propane than their sorry THC is more soluble in it or something or maybe the CBD possibly gets ripped out in the [ __ ] d waxing process who knows but uh no actually because on those runs i don't be waxing to win rise which could pull it out there who [ __ ] knows THC and CBD the molecules are made up of the exact same atoms I believe it's just a different isomer correct me if I'm wrong scientists if I have any watching this but yeah here's some CBD [ __ ] that we got some sharp shock down there more CBD crew [ __ ] and that makes a one two for that shark shock ratio we have so that would be like let's say 80 percent THC twenty percent all right sorry Adi adverse at KFC 20 percent CBD so it's not really mentionable but it does have enough CBD in there to change the effect versus our diesel so yeah that's those so yeah our our four two ones come in ten milligram the ten milligram ones have less than I think it's like two point four two point three milligrams THC and ten milligram CBD the twenty fives have I think six milligrams of THC and twenty-five milligrams of CBD and then the 50s have like 12 milligrams of THC and fifty milligrams of CBD and then of course our three two twos it's like it's 17 milligrams THC twenty-five milligrams CBD we don't make these ones in ten milligram and then the 50s are 35 milligrams CBD or THC sorry 35 milligrams THC and 50 milligrams CBD and init sometimes we even go even further and make a hundred one hundred milligram CBD pill takes a lot of [ __ ] oil that is a lot more valuable in smaller doses because not everyone is trying to get wrecked on CBD oil but some do have high tolerances but for them they could just take 257 so today not really extracting or doing really anything I figured to kind of make it interesting I would show you how I finished the slab kind of like I did in yesterday's video where I had the what wasn't yesterday's video but it was numbers episode three which was on the 21st I think today's a twenty well no that was the 22nd that we did that video I can't find remember I said the dates in the video and you guys see one day they were uploaded so that's the day I might as well grab this [ __ ] in my backpack because I bring it home you should have a [ __ ] another I are done in another heat gun at home that be practical right also our pills we're going to start putting them in these little crack cocaine baggies or whatever versus the mylar ones that we put our oil and sorry about this pump one sec let me go ahead oh my god he must be on the moon or no vice versa he must have a million dollar pump if you follow my Instagram you hear me talk about that [ __ ] with different altitudes and all that how it it's no different as far as what's in there it's the pressure on the outside of the gauge that gives you these faulty readings like that like let's say I was in Denver Colorado no different in there with the same 8 CFM Robin air pump but my needle will probably be right here but it beat the same low pressure out there or in there it's just that work five inches of mercury lower because we're [ __ ] however high your altitude is mile high whatever the [ __ ] that is 4,000 feet or some [ __ ] but yeah people think you can't pull this deep of a vac in Denver as you can down here at sea level just because that needle doesn't go as far people are funny but yeah and just also the the barometric pressure outside today it's higher so that's why that's lower if it was raining like a [ __ ] that [ __ ] would be a little bit closer to 30 and there would still be the same it just has to do with the pressure on the outside of the gauge so no this chamber isn't pulled any [ __ ] deeper than yours if you have this pump I mean different pumps can pull the different capacities but no this isn't at some crazy message mysterious [ __ ] negative 31 HD that's not possible this deeper than absolute vacuum so even even your [ __ ] million dollar NASA pumping so oh I didn't even tell you what I was doing so I'm gonna go ahead and start deflating this so it can that can happen while I'm well I'm telling you what I'm doing here and I can show you what them bubbles do because it's slabs on a higher rap and doesn't have one above it you see them and they don't leave a [ __ ] bubble in them versus if you let that [ __ ] out real quick that's just something I learned maybe this is different for you if it is I mean like if you're doing something that works and you see me stay and do something different don't just do something different if what you're doing works and keep [ __ ] doing it that makes sense right so yeah if it works whatever you're doing works keep doing it then you'll need to change something that's not broken I'm not telling anyone to do that this is Rico who are having issues and answers so uh now what I do I used to cut the same squares of parchment for grams and 1/2 grams but now we do larger squares for the grams than we do for the half grams but they all still go in the same white mylar bags but they're labeled gram or 1/2 gram or whatever you understand so the first thing I have to do since the cutter my dad got me is it wide enough to fit all the parchment the roll why so you have to fold it hot dog style like that remember hot dog and hamburger from kindergarten like that the next step which is that take these [ __ ] and this is just what I do it I'm sure you've been doing it for the longest time I was using the acrylic containers because any time my package is parchment which I'll tell you my mistake on that in a minute but anytime attackers your parchment put in the mylar bags I would do let's say the grams that way and then I quit the half grams and acrylic containers not directly on the acrylic I would use my my little 1 inch circle and heed and hole puncher and I'd punched me a little circle of parchment out to put the oil on in there so it wouldn't be stuck in there but my personal well I put in parchment the way I do it package now the parchment I was using back then was the foil back to parchment so you couldn't really see through it versus now I use this [ __ ] so when I package and I put it in a little container like I'll probably show you that I'll put it in the mylar baggie you can actually still see the color of the oil through it and someone I mentioned that on Instagram so see how it's foil on the back and I would use this also to put this [ __ ] in the bag so you still just see foil you wouldn't see that well so someone come in to buy six grams wouldn't buy six single grams and that they would buy [ __ ] twelve half grams in the acrylic ones because they could see what they were getting so now packaged different in it's a lot cheaper and a lot easier which I used to say I don't need to do the cheap way but whatever [ __ ] I'm doing the cheap way so now what you do with these this is 15 inches wide I know because I measured it so you go like this you have my fifth [ __ ] assistant now and I'm still [ __ ] packaging because they have other jobs too and I'll explain why cuz I'm sure twenty or thirty minute twenty thirty comments oh but you're existent I'll be your assistant I'll explain why I'm when we're out there smoking why you guys gave me my assistant because I make videos I need someone to come help me I'm sure I get fifty people going sure I live in the same state I'm gonna come help you but then you would get paid but the thing is we don't trust you not just me even if I trust you let's say I try to do with my life um I have bosses that have to trust you too and in case you didn't notice anytime a room comes down there's anywhere from a 6000 watt room or a 4000 watt room or 12 thousand watt room worth herb drying which you would be around so in you be around all the oil and all the equipment and starting material starting material so you guys would need a lot of trust so it's not necessarily what you can do and I'm here I am telling you now before we're smoking but it's it's a trust issue so it's it's mainly not how good you are at packaging or how good you are helping me make oil so far I haven't had anyone I mean I'm training they do now they let me make well cause he's a [ __ ] he's got a PhD in microbiology so that really really helps he knows all the [ __ ] smart [ __ ] but the mechanics is actually doing the extraction that's what I he has to learn so back to what I was saying for as far as someone coming in here to do this for me I'm not always gonna be here there's not going to always be someone here babysitting you yes you're on camera but who cares if we got you on camera if you went to [ __ ] Florida with the weed you know what I'm saying so that's the issue with that so pretty much I stick to only people who already employed or I want to employ because it's a what do you call it volunteer situation as far as collective gardens go but I can only work her well how many people do it because just because we already trust him to [ __ ] work in the shop then obviously then we trust him to be out here doing this so now I'm going to five so I didn't mention what I did there but I went to uh I started off with the end of it at the 10 inch mark and I had said left me with five overhanging because remember 15 inches so then after that I went ahead in a cut it and I moved over to can't assume these are backwards I've moved it over to UM [ __ ] I'm so sidetracked and I'm trying to get these papers right so damn it okay so effective missing so I started with it the end of the thing at the tin mark right there sliced off five inches and moved it to five sliced off five more inches and now I have three five inch by five well I guess I underestimated so they're probably five by four and a half and then I'll go yes this is H H mixing wondering you know I need you is get like some of them [ __ ] shave you [ __ ] by me wanting them x-ray table so I can lay my dark ass [ __ ] [ __ ] that should have been food-grade but I needed to make him to shatter because I'm gonna peasant one of those slabs and go and throw that [ __ ] on it on an x-ray [ __ ] table so I can make it look all gold and then be like yeah it's at this shot so all the patients can go there and get [ __ ] disappointed when they find out that it's as black as the [ __ ] they took this morning oh I don't know if that would be healthy so I just fold it in half and now I felt like this and I have all of them I think there's a 15 of them here and so I doing like that right so now they're folded and then you can set them up with my grandma's on the left side and that's just a quick demonstration yes I still use the cheap [ __ ] I don't even know how cheap the scale is you guys would probably tell me but yes I still use I have one at home and I one here and next door they got the nice scale this is what I weigh the weed on it's one of them balanced e ones where's my tear Toph right here boom so just more [ __ ] drying got a frog in my throat this morning guys so yeah that's the half gram size ones it's a gram size one and then I just kind of sit here chipping away now that it's deflated I can go ahead and show you what we're gonna do it is [ __ ] weird to lock oh well just let someone get hurt [ __ ] one arm sucks with the powder-free was there was a nursing assistant we had the powdered gloves and going from a [ __ ] musky ass hand that was just in a glove into a powder glove you don't really have that issue but doing it with these which always use powder free she loves Hannah weed or oil or anything like that because you want to smoke that talk oh speaking of toffee powder I bought a pocket [ __ ] and it came with talking powder put on it and then it keeps the the material feeling more [ __ ] like I guess I don't know but I never used that [ __ ] cuz afraid of getting my peel and burned I don't know if that's exactly appropriate for YouTube I mean Here I am with [ __ ] weed but I'm sure they'll blend but can give me in trouble for talking about [ __ ] pocket [ __ ] so here's the slab on the parchment dah-dah-dah still not looking as pretty as it is and remember those bubbles keep in mind these indentations from where they were because those are gonna open up after we flip it and hit with heat gun and if I flip it and let's say let's just say this was because it's been purging for 48 hours there no sorry 46 hours so let's just pretend that it's only been purging for 12 hours if I flipped it over right now put it back in the oven it would do the exact same thing and it's going to do when I go ahead and hit with the seat gun only I'm not trying to go in there and [ __ ] pull out even more turps after I'm done purging it as you guys saw my mistake last time I didn't have my [ __ ] cut already twenty-fifths I think please it yesterday was his 24th DJ's 20 I delete this is my only black curling shirt I've got four or five green ones I've got at least three blue ones and I got two red ones so pretty much half of my [ __ ] t-shirts or these shirts and then a lot of my other t-shirts are of that real-deal extract [ __ ] when we have those shirts made and then the [ __ ] and ex-partner goes around running around still calling it using my [ __ ] name and my [ __ ] logo so I decided it [ __ ] it I make one for her well healing just call this [ __ ] was going [ __ ] ain't gonna steal that name so yeah so that's why I don't wear the real good x-ray shirts no more unless I'm at home and I just feel like wearing a shirt around the house damn it I [ __ ] up herbal evening shirts too from using them in life like doing extractions to keep at the bottom of a pool of dry ice and they get all ripped up and [ __ ] up I should be using that really likes track shirts for that so remember just like last video before the flip I always do this and you don't have to do one side than the other you could do one side and then a third of it and then the other third of it yeah that works too or you could even do like I get in the last video where you do it over something hell someone's probably going to make some [ __ ] pyramid thing like this to do it over whatever you're going to drop it on the floor whatever you're scared which I've done this with hundreds of slab to still have a droplet on the floor so I mean I've dropped slab but not from that and it sucks from dropping slabs because the only thing you really do from there is dissolved in alcohol and winterize it and then now you've got some winter ice [ __ ] any others does but it was on the floor okay one on the floor isn't gonna die in that alcohol that you're scared of at least and if it's any particulate [ __ ] it's getting filtered out Oh someone's calling me decline so I like about this phone it doesn't ruin my whole video when I need a phone well I do hate like if I'm filming a skate trick or something like that like it was yesterday and someone text messages me and he goes okey-dokey now time for the damn heat gun which I have to remember to turn that [ __ ] down because is using it for decarboxylated in combination with a griddle but I like the heat from the top in the bottom to not waste time and this thing happens to fit perfect in a lab stand like this so you can have it blasting down onto your top of yours in okay so here's what we'll do we'll start right here at the front of your screen where you can see the best maybe we'll turn the light on somebody getting in the regular way I'm out 133 yeah that's fine and I just tested it on the table loaded on the table with I argon to see how it was gonna do I mean if I can put my hand on it then it's not too hot dude this smells real good this is the royal camp and this is actually from the stuff that I made the dry cept with I put all my B grade rice if back in the tube the first run a royal Kim that I did and I still have more to run but the first one that I did was with just straight I'll show ya any second I'll show you after this slab to that whole thing and all this is doing is speeding up what would happen if he tossed it back in the oven and didn't pull it back they just let it sit there for 30 minutes since I'm not trying to wait 30 minutes well it sits in there and then I can forget and come back two hours later and it makes it one CH of [ __ ] turd bubbles what you mean is other volatile [ __ ] that got extracted with the volatile non porous all of it and there's nothing volatile in there other than [ __ ] butane just blue so 16 year old kids mine wait these see this selfie shot you dis [ __ ] I'll do up d1 in the video and I might even post one on Instagram because for some reason though he's tend to get the most [ __ ] lights not that I'm fishing for likes but I mean that just means people enjoy the picture which that's why I'm here to put up [ __ ] people enjoy so now it doesn't look like it did and quickly well it's not completely cool back off I do have to uh to do this with it okay make sure don't have that bond with the parchment because when you do heat up one side it does heat up all the way through yes I just lost the dabs work boohoo sure some tears of a shed you want it to be able to not be sticking so now here's what made the first batch row Kim what I do if you watch the great gardener video where him and him in a bubble man took the bard with the seeded barb and they held it they did one of these numbers they would hold the branch like this and they go so I do that over another tub and then after I've pulled all the branches up I go and run it so that's how that works so now let's go get another pair of gloves it's like you know what [ __ ] it the ones that I originally was using a minute ago go ahead because I didn't touch that nasty wood thing [ __ ] it I'm touching my slab let me get a real pair of gloves not like I'm not gonna be [ __ ] package when I'm packaging or what someone else is packaging that is a glove funeral day you haven't even got to the point where we smoke and it's [ __ ] almost 30 minutes in hope no one's upset say do you know people like to watch the dabs [ __ ] maybe I'll take my little uh slab selfie I'll take the screenshot from this video to use so now that I got this on the next step is to put the hat on backwards so the bell of the Hat doesn't stick to the slab in then third step the fools then I think this makes a difference you put on your lab coat even though this wasn't on for earlier parts of this process you put it on for the picture and people like it don't you know my [ __ ] or not already now this is where it's weird because normally I used the front-facing camera to do this so I don't know if I'm gonna be in the shot so I guess I gotta set my [ __ ] up so usually I'm right here my slabs right there this should work so then I go at my camera on 5 second timer I push ding I got five seconds to and I hold it and then I hear good click and I go like this we get that out for whether it'll stick on it and then I'm already getting hot so I quickly have to go and take off this book in lab coat which makes the whole difference in your process you were on one of these oh my god this [ __ ] PP ends go down tariffs coke [ __ ] prices go up only good things come from wearing a [ __ ] backup plus prejudice people think you're smarter so I think oh one more thing to do get high let's smoke the [ __ ] that we just [ __ ] finished this part looks like it wants to come off keep stuff verse not keep stuff can tell a difference and when I say Keith I don't mean [ __ ] keep the [ __ ] out of it I mean pulling a total of counting the B grade pulling about 35 grams off of 600 grams is over pound and then only taking out of that 35 grams only getting like less than 10 fullmetal then taking that stuff that wasn't full amount putting it back in the tube with the weed I mean it's not like I run this train over and over to know the difference in yield but it [ __ ] stinks damn cop coffee filters make it too good Deborah why am I wearing gloves one gabbing okay I gave a little bit of oil to a friend who just like smokes whether they're blunt smoker and they just got a lead pipe they don't have any way to dab anything like that so I gave them some oil and said the clear on top you got that beer weed I get text messages last night it's making my weed light on fire like yeah let that [ __ ] melt into the bud first then you just get like 30 more extra hits off the bud than you normally would have he's my we get some fire oh man I remember back in uh when this [ __ ] was new before there was lab testing and a lot of logic used and there was a lot just dumb [ __ ] where people was like look if it makes butane come from the sky and land back into your already first oil and dumb stupid [ __ ] like that and there was people just I mentioned earlier I said people think the only volatile thing that's in that mixture of 400 different [ __ ] compounds or more they think the only volatile thing there is a butane when all the Terps are [ __ ] aromatic hydrocarbons which are [ __ ] flammable so there's so much [ __ ] that is you know ignite that we do extract from weed yeah my favorite thing about these ceramic nails is that you get them [ __ ] your hit is the same every time we get them brand [ __ ] new every dev you get a brand new and [ __ ] and it's not like an unseasoned taste I mean it's not we're not dabbing on titanium so you're not gonna get that but ceramic I mean you do get a burnt down case if your dad too hot like if I'd out in the next book in 30 or 40 seconds I'm not going to be enjoying it to him yeah I was watching those Mexican kids down in Texas the skate will get a major crew I found I mean I think it was when Josh Katz I did a shout out I was when I found him or maybe it was the foot no it was that Hannah Montana skating video when the Halloween last year one got popular there nice [ __ ] rip that that inspired me to get on a skateboard yesterday and hurt myself smashed my balls a couple times so that was fun yeah but I think we're good Cheers that's one [ __ ] that yeah I brought home some the first lab I'm bringing that back that woman is the [ __ ] who had to take a walk for that speaking of my smartass assistant this is still here people were clipping I think and snow had something to do with it nope snow cap was in this bag like a [ __ ] here ago oh you'd like cuz he knows I know that hydrocarbons is like the main structures that I [ __ ] enough so he drew a propane molecule right there just stick show me how why it's nonpolar you mean why different [ __ ] tonight and I pretty much already forgot most of the [ __ ] they showed me but he kept trying all these different [ __ ] molecules like water I mean like Gaddy that's totally Mickey Mouse [ __ ] water molecule second came out pretty tomato hydrochloric acid and then he made um acetic acid which was I think in vinegar or is vinegar some [ __ ] like that and then he made I think not methane but there's something he made something so that was cool give me one laughs look at that selfie slab no you saw how I pull the slab out of the oven looking probably like most Year guys at slabs and I flipped it over one last time and did that and now it looks like this so that's how you do it in case you were wondering I'm gonna get the packaging now so I hope you guys enjoyed this video peace", "_fnIWDmaWHA": "I would up y'all there's a little bit of controversy on the field of lyrics from my song top down off the lg bomb let me break it down for y'all cookie fan provided the

I found him I named him and biscotti and I named gushers not only did I select them and name them I went on a worldwide campaign with the [ __ ] and popped it off I rapped about it in my songs I brought it to the artists to athletes to the elite smokers and you know influences in the world I was repping biscotti so hard I almost named and Scott Storch is my witness the big pescado biscotti like literally almost named to my album biscotti and I rapped about it in so many songs and trust me I really campaigned hard Frodo's and on transe is this without getting into too much detail this doesn't even matter I'm in a good point in my life if I put in all that work and all that effort to hand select to name to blow this [ __ ] up globally everybody knows about biscotti because of me and I'm not no longer participating in that and I can't grow myself and I have it and I can't use the names for anything then why would I [ __ ] with it why would I smoke it and it's nothing personal to

same way we ran it up you don't run it up again cookies now one more thing purple punch look no disrespect to the breeders a purple punch to the growers of purple punch what's going on in California right now is a bunch of people are growing it they're packaging it on the REC market and then renaming it a hundred different things and after buying 15 different styles of weed named all kind of names and all being a purple punch it was played out to me I said but punches so Blanc you can have it now some of my friends go purple punch some of my friends actually bred purple punch no disrespect to you but do we get got somebody I see Packers up 30 different ways mm-hmm keep it", "MUOqWC1UirU": "[Music] really boring really it's efficiencies kind of all we talk about you know math and numbers on how can we save a couple pennies over here on energy versus using big screens like if I had to boil down what was said today is that uh membranes which is a big filter that that was kind of like the takeaway that I think will be most valuable to the most amount of people that was something that it's been out there but it's been not as openly talked about as it was today so that was interesting I thought I saw the hesitation and no his eyes saying it out loud and then he went with it so it's interesting it was immediately there and he was just like all right oh yeah dread pirate is here with some of this crc and that stuff was incredible oh yeah I think it was a dinner but uh oh look how about that you got the good stuff who is no with he was with Harry and Ken and ace from beaker and wrench that was a good one I like that one dread pirate he's on the forum he's the guy that first released the CRC tech on the forum kind of like the first draft of it with him in the end Oh fab guys it's like a remediation of the impurities that you don't necessarily want or need to smoke a lot of them are color compounds and other random things you do tend to pull a little bit of some of like the ethers or not eat there's uh esters and and aldehydes and alcohols which kind of changes the smell we still got a really bright turkey smell from it and all the mids but some of the lower ones seem to sometimes tend to drag behind in the column in the Sierra see I definitely see RC stuff that looks amazing and then tastes like trim you know because it doesn't get rid but i've also had I've also had some CR Sita I think people aren't filtering enough and I definitely dab some that had some filtration media left in it davin on yeah something that people need to like make sure they're filtering that [ __ ] you know that's my main thing I heard that a Chas the a Chas bold did the same thing don't be shy I mean that's the future of you know with great power with great power comes great responsibility and when we're starting to take these chemistry routes that isn't you know they're not it's not just you know making some charas what is going on with dead skin and [ __ ] yeah it's returning returning a point into actual you know trying to adopt pharmaceutical science and as absurd as homegrown pharmaceutical Sciences it's what this one country that's something else so what this industry has done for the last seventy years means since Prohibition we've had to find our own ways about doing things and that right there is the culmination of it it's you know the ultimate [ __ ] you - that's the ethereal the ethereal who I guess really whatever is trying that's that gets to a personal level almost a spiritual level but what this means this is what happens when people you know are you could call it entrepreneurship you could call it capitalism but you know this is innovation the fluid innovation in progress I mean we're watching it happen day by day and man it's just fascinating to be able to be a part of it come to work with a plant under while being under immense oppression or you know obstacles or just you know legalization or whatnot sacrifice the potential for your livelihood to even do science with this plan in the first place kind of comes to I guess like that accumulation where it's like this is the best science we could do and bama's you know it's like next-level [ __ ] you know well this is you know this is what happens when people innovate for themselves and we're not relying on massive corporations to take our innovation you know by the hills and do it for us because when you get to a certain point I mean you just can't I mean that was Dustin's talk you can't beat the open source it's not happening you would smoke that blood starting material credit to the Grover credit to the processor it's all parts of the whole it takes excellence in every step possible but the interesting thing is really the potential that we have to do I mean these same refinement techniques will take the will take place in other industries and other nutraceutical I mean we talked about a lot of mycology today and all these same refinement techniques are going to come up sooner or later and it's cool if you can use cannabis with it but I know with I'm sure I don't know I'm sure the ball container corporation is pretty happy with all of their mason jar sales and I'm sure there's some refineries out of Texas who has see these new places popping up they're capitalizing on it what kind of technique thing a different industry will learn from us you know compared to you know [Music] [Music] just like you guys are doing cool crazy [ __ ] that people do extraction that's actually they do co2 they do co2 extraction and also I don't know they they make like a distillate product which has terpenes that they post inject to like flavor their stuff it's it's pretty phenomenal opportunity we run like super high margin which allows us a lot of flexibility to run R&D on our product - I think that that helps and the type of person that's in cannabis in the cannabis industry right now is not the same type of person that may have gone a more traditional route with a less you know they're they're they're not as willing to take risk right as the typical cannabis person is because we've been taking risk the whole [ __ ] time so you kind of have a different type of person and that there's you know there's pros and cons to each different side but one of them is that we can have rapid development and adaptation of new technologies better than any other industry we've that I've seen we can scour the internet for obscure little pieces of data and convert it into something that's making billions of dollars like what show me another industry that's doing something like that this is like the first cannabis cannabis snowman that I've been to since I got a 10-year federal prison sentence for a cannabis conspiracy yeah so this so you know just just being able to come back and see my like I've known Boris for 20 years I've known you know a bunch of these guys so just to be able to come out and see these guys now my homies 10 years later like you know industry leaders and leading the way and and they ain't got nothing to worry about you know I mean and it's cool and I feel like that's amazing you know it's a beautiful thing to see and you know it's definitely something we need to pay reverence to but we also need to realize there's still plenty of people locked up because of this bull should we do it every single day",

reviewing blue city diesel also known as blue diesel blue city diesel is a cross between the New York City diesel and blue and on blueberry is very blueberry strong characteristics as far as um the smell the initial smell and the in the bag at a container or whatever it comes in when you get it it has a very strong blueberry gassy funky type smell - in a good way - it has a lot of pretty colors in it Purple's light blues dark greens light greens seems like it may have like a nanner in there - but I haven't found any any sees that they are hermaphroditic but it is very strong very tasty the dry taupe is just like I was smelled it tastes just like that and it also tastes the same money on when you burn it it has a very young diesel is in there it makes very good with young with the blue burgers it's good for nausea depression anxiety appetite stimulation paying any it's a pretty decent hybrid it covers on the gamut of both sativas and indicas i hope you enjoyed this until next time peace [Music]", "bxYzc9srLsQ": "yo what's good youtube it's cosmos and this morning i was wrong that's right i was wrong about crc bro i really was i i've been telling you guys and this was my personal thought was that crc was only for budget material now this homie proved me wrong all right look at how crc this is you can tell this is very heavily crc well not very heavily but it's been cr seed right look at how terpy this look how trippy this is right now i know you can't smell it but this smells like a jar of limes in the best way possible there's no added terps to this crc or anything like that this is just good material ran with less media so look at this mimosa right here bro look at this look at this that's beautiful look at the layer of terps on that i wish you guys could smell this get some smell-o-vision up in here because god damn bro the terps on this mimosa just reach out and just grab your nostrils and pull them right in dude oh so gassy and so nice and now the crazy thing is with crc gas turps are normally the least preserved terps if you run a gassy string sorry i accidentally stopped the recording through a heavy crc you will get no gas turps back now this homie he proved me [ __ ] wrong bro he's like dude you can run crc and have the chirps and have it be really really flavorful you just have to run less crc so instead of using a whole column which is what crc is color remediation column maybe you just pack a little disk of crc maybe use less crc i think that right now what it comes down to is that for budget products you have to use a lot of crc to make a very bland product but for a little bit higher end you could maybe run tiny little bit of crc and make some fire product like this [ __ ] right here super super fire honestly let's take some dabs of it so i guess here's where i'm at you guys i wanted to record a video and just kind of just kind of say i was wrong bro it's something that's hard to admit sometimes that you're wrong but um i was wrong about crc i was man i was i personally was like i was like all right crc i said this in the last video about crc i said crc in my opinion is only good for budget product nobody should be selling crc for above 15 and g out the door and i still feel that way about budget product i really still feel that way about a a really really budget material ran as crc it should be sold for around 10 to 15 g out the door but this homie who made these opened my eyes to the fact that crc doesn't just have to be budget and to the fact that if you use just a tiny bit of crc it can actually do a good job at creating an overall nicely balanced product and i think that uh i just kind of wanted to get that information out there to let people know that well crc while it can be super poopy budget stuff that you know just very baseline budget um it can also be [ __ ] awesome so let's take a couple dabs of this shenanigans and let's get going from there today we're listening to some billy marcia fava he [ __ ] kills it i'll leave the link to his spotify down below i asked him on instagram if i could play some of his songs during a sesh on youtube and he said yeah for sure man go for it so uh yeah super stoked to be playing his music check him out if you haven't seen or heard of billy's music i would definitely recommend it it's [ __ ] awesome he kills it um let's start with this girl scout cookies right here this is burner's cut of cookies so it has that um kind of like that lime um that lime note to it really really really tasty on this i want to say um not as much terps you can tell you know it's kind of wet with the terps there but not quite as much chirps as that mimosa will actually move around with the jar as i kind of moved the jar that was very very turkey without further ado let's take a little dab skinny of this uh cookies here and then we'll take a dab of the mimosa first dabs of the day about to go live on my twitch right after these dabs here excuse me okay we're good cheers yo so tasty that cookies is definitely more mellow on the gassy tarp but it still comes through you get a little bit of gas a little bit of lime the smoothness is divine oh yeah i'm riding now yum yum yum okay that was a good one yo first of the day too right there okay so if you guys are kind of just catching this on youtube randomly and you guys are like who the [ __ ] is this cosmos guy or whatever you don't know my spiel and my deal well my name is cosmos i smoke hello weed you know i take dabs mostly um and recently i've been blazing down every single day on my twitch i'll leave a link down below it's twitch.tv 420 cosmos but yeah we've been really curating the community over there i've probably been streaming almost every day for the past year and just been going really hard with my schedule these past few months especially i also started a podcast on my twitch every monday wednesday friday from 2 to 3 p.m pacific standard time where i chill and chat with other content creators that smoke down artists and companies that are in the cannabis industry and we just talk about you know whatever they do and uh weed and just chill yo it's awesome it is awesome so definitely follow it up on the twitch if you guys don't yet um my instagram as well cosmos 420 twitter cosmos underscore 420 [Music] yeah all the shenanigans you know oh the shenanigans just wanted to give it a little plug there and then we'll get this next dab going what time is it right now 23 after bro okay i go live every morning on weekdays at 10 30 a.m pacific standard time so we got to get the second dab heated like now now now because i have breakfast too i didn't eat breakfast yet okay so what i'm gonna do i'll probably start my stream and eat breakfast during the first dab of the stream um or just kind of while i'm getting it started up just a quick break [Music] all right let's get it y'all yo so if you guys are diving down along with this video i would love to hear what you guys are dabbing down on in the comments as well as your thoughts about crc man because i know i had some pretty um i had some pretty uh quite thoughtful thoughts about it you know and i previously didn't like crc and i was like well maybe it could be okay and i was like yeah it could be okay and now i'm on the boat of like well [ __ ] it can be [ __ ] fire too dawg like you got some fire [ __ ] crc just with the right amount of media um and all that shenanigans so it's crazy it's crazy with that i'm going right here oh [ __ ] that was a good song i shouldn't have skipped that whatever too late it's too late [Music] [Music] one second mikko let me take this dab then i'll get you some water let's take a nice glob for the second dab here nice little boy oh it almost just fell off the dagger that's a giant dab we're gonna no we're not even gonna put a little back we're just gonna full send holy [ __ ] cheers everyone [Music] oh no [Music] oh boy actually i don't have ground way bigger than i thought holy [ __ ] y'all oh i'm gonna start up the twitch stream let's go catch you soon everyone holy [ __ ] that was probably like a half gram oh peace out y'all", "Z9xCmaeWQYk": "so you like clear color remediated shatter huh it's got to be clear it's not clear it's no good I'm sorry to tell you that's not the case at all color remediation has given us the ability to further refine our extracts and that's that's nothing but but reason for joy however it does not need to be completely refined to this point to be enjoyable and unfortunately in a lot of cases people that are refining it to this point are robbing the plant of some of its natural essence shout-out to Murphy Murray dread pirate and I'm sure many others but those are the only two I could think of off the top of my head the shout out to the processors out there that are that are doing this crc thing and and truly they understand ads or banned chromatography and they understand that this is this isn't bleaching and when done properly the Terps are even louder there's nothing to to get in the way of them your percentage is skyrocket there's so much less plant matter to be in the way of your terpene to cannabinoid ratio and then how much of the hundred percent that makes up so CRC is an absolutely wonderful thing it's the the natural step for evolution as far as cannabis extracts go but I guess just buyer beware you know it could could be the best stuff you've ever tried and it could also end up melting kind of dark and leaving very very interesting colors this is pretty clean no but sometimes you'll notice some very very dark reclaim and you're smoking white clear shatter or almost white clear shatter but it's but it creates dark dark reclaim and of course when it melts it melts dark this stuff as as you can imagine when it melts it should look almost like water and that here if you see pigment appear during the meltdown then obviously the anthocyanin chlorophyll plant matter filtration wasn't successful it was clearly still plant matter there and even if your melt is okay but you think well a little more color than I thought they would be but but it still looks great that's that's not bad so check your reclaim if you reclaim start showing up dark like dark reclaim look like the kind of reclaim that shows up in your rig when you're taking dabs every flame it looks like that you're smoking on some polished hurts if it melts like this and you know you got yourself some fire so once again shout out to Mary Mary the whole team over at Santo Gardens and dread pirate shout out the future 4200 for all the information and all the love that he puts out into the community and I guess to that to that extent shout out to the entire good life gang but as I mentioned your CRC oil should melt and or vaporize and/or reclaim as follows okay guys probably should have saved you on some heat up time there but what can I say I'm not a filmmaker so let's use the heat up time some shut up 7:10 Montana shout-out to you guys we're having some fire clear BHO some some properly CRC material and shout out to the 710 extractions that's me we're making all this solvent that's fire that it's just just shattering the analytics and then of course tighten that shut up dude Glaser highly educated Gordo's scientific and of course mr. Connor still don't know what this is well of course you do it's a thermometer to very very accurately take the temperature of my quotes and if you're watching this on Instagram I'm sure you know it is right now if you don't know what it is congratulations somehow you've hidden from most of Instagram for a couple months anyway if you're on YouTube that's very possible this would be the first time you're seeing it and no this is not a dabber or anything even though there is a diving attachment for it I personally like to leave it on or not threaded in so that I can stand my Yosi so there we go we're green 5 85 86 so we got a couple seconds I like to leave the dab robbed of it because I like to stand it up in that little 3d image 3d prints damn this is what your clear should melt like ladies and gentlemen I hope you all are having a great week great weekend and a great start to year no chirps left behind hmm oh I see why you call that grape soda okay god [Music] right okay so before we get in here do any swabbing or anything like that let's take a look at what we're left with okay a half ounce of weed yeah that's all right and oh thank you tripod you did a great job of holding that phone still no look should be at least at least one little spot of reclaim sorry guys can you see it it's not reflection there it is look at the color of that very reminiscent of hash when it's being freshly made that color if it's a very very dark reclaim let's go right here on the front there's almost always something just underneath it now it's not another good sign is that it doesn't very heavily reclaims a bunch of your oil is we condensating and turning into reclaim in here I'm by that I mean it seems like you're creating more reclaim than you normally do then obviously we have a color up job they did not technically refine or filter anything they just lightened up the coloring particulates in plant matter and things like that things other than the cannabinoids and the terpenes reclaim a little faster and they reclaimed very ugly very dark not like a very very light sandy here so ladies and gentlemen hope you're out there enjoying all your crc clear clear clear clear if it's not white it ain't right or some dumb [ __ ] sounds racist this [ __ ] if you ask me but anyway um for those of you out there you know banging on your clear and being all hype man about it sweet I'm with you I'm glad you're excited about your missing make sure it's truly clean now because some of us actually know what's up by some of us I mean many of us know what's up so don't be the hype man for some clear that reclaims dark with it melts down dark that's just polished turd hope you all having a great day didn't really have any more of a reason to make a post than other Jin really just to share this clear shadow with you and my my thoughts as a chemist behind it and then of course I wanted the opportunity to shout out the people that in my opinion are doing this process properly Brent you know who you are 710 Montana you know I love you guys and specifically or more a little more a little more notably Murphy Murray and the entire Santo garden team which to be honest with you they of course they don't make shatter they make fine fine live resin sauce and THC a so they wouldn't even produce a product like this but if they did make shatter I bet in Murphy's would be even more clear just know hate 7/10 I just I gotta say it she's good and and dread we don't really know each other or anything but I've seen your work and I'm always impressed so I'm very confident that that I'm shouting out to of the right people and again I think a lot of us would be either a little bit further behind or maybe even worse maybe have some information that we paid four-oh if it wasn't for the likes of future 4200 so to wrap this baby up shut up future 4200 shout out dread pirate and shout out Murphy Mary and the whole team down at Santo Gardens alright guys just because it's clear doesn't mean it wins the prize peace", "ABsAiM5hBmk": "assalamu alaikum welcome to you're a student today i will discuss about chemistry chapter 4 this is SSC chemistry and chapter is 4 there

going to look at several ways to smoke shatter wax and rosin along with the pros and cons of dab rigs and nails dab pins vaporizers emails and nectar collectors you can find all these products and more at the wizard puff com online head shop and you can save money with the code roughhouse I'd like to thank wizard puffs for sponsoring this video perhaps the og of ways to do dabs is the trusty dab or oil rig fitted with the titanium nail or quartz banger and is truly one of the most effective ways to do a dab you'll get a huge hit instantly and usually get the most out of your wax - as it's fully vaporized in seconds dab rigs might be one of the most effective ways of doing dabs but there are drawbacks such as needing a torch and gas to heat the nails and also a recovery time to reheat it now for the next tab also when you introduce open flame and exposed high heat into the process you also sacrifice safety to some degree dad pens on the other hand are probably one of the safest ways to do dabs these types of pens usually use quartz ceramic or metal coils to heat the wax enclosed inside of a sealed glass or metal cap these types of pens can be effective and give big hits but usually will take several puffs to smoke the same amount of wax as doing a single dab off of a nail another common drawbacks to wax pans is that the unvailed wax builds up and they require constant cleaning to keep functioning properly some vaporizers that are made for dry herb can also be used to vaporize wax to these devices usually provide a cup or pod that inserts into the dry herb heating chamber to vaporize the wax these types of devices can be very convenient but the cons are that they often do a mediocre job of vaporizing wax as they lack the heat that's required and the small pods can be cumbersome and leaky so it can be hard to keep the heating chamber clean for dry herb nectar collectors or vacuum systems could be considered the Dark Horse of DAB methods these types of devices use a heated tip on the end of a handheld device that you dip directly into the wax there are both electric collectors as well as those requiring external heat sources such as a torch one big advantage of the collector type rig is that you can get huge hits when you're dipping the tip directly into the wax but they can have a bit of a learning curve and a little bit awkward to use perhaps the biggest favourite among divers is the email emails are very similar to the standard titanium nail on an oil rig with one key difference the emails have an electronic control center to set a precise temperature and a heating element that will keep the nail continuously heated and ready for a dab the pros of emails are that it's ready for a DAB any time that it's on and you can set to precise temperatures and you also you can do back-to-back dabs without having to reheat the nail they may also arguably be safer than using open flames and are clearly more convenient than needing a secondary heating torch cons are that they usually require a power source to operate so it may not be as portable as the other methods and it's also very convenient to use so you might find yourself smoking through your wax very quickly and passing out on the couch very early whichever method you choose dabbing wax or rosin so long as it's free of impurities is actually healthier than smoking cannabis flowers by not smoking or vaporizing the plant materials you are clearly putting less unnecessary chemicals into your body and by taking concentrated doses you're required to smoke less frequently not to mention that the time it takes to do it to have is far quicker than the time it takes to smoke a joint bulb or especially a blunt but if you're an everyday diver like myself a nice email setup likely be the way to go but if you only occasionally dabber prefer to vaporize then a three-in-one vape pen that does wax too might be satisfactory or any or an inexpensive wax pen might be even better or perfect for the beginner just looking to dabble in wax shatters and rosin concentrates again I'd like to thank the guys at wizard puff for sponsoring this video you can save money on a lots of the products that you saw in this video with a code roughhouse and wizard puff comm I hope you enjoyed this video on how to smoke shatter tabs and wax if you did please visit Rafal

smoke some green it today I'm gonna give y'all a concentrate challenge who what I'm bringing y'all today is um my name is one double whammy dab all right so pretty much you have to keep drooping down that one's about them droop dumb as well but get to debs right and pretty much at the same time double whammy boom get high so before we get started with this I'm gonna ask for some help um guys help me reach 1k and once i get 1k he's going to be kind and sponsored my one gram deb so he said whenever I get to 1k subscribers co-sponsor my mom Graham dad so um right now behind behind camera I'm training for the one gram doubt it's gonna be really crucial and I'm giving my all good I mean I'm not a heavy heavy dagger this is gonna be really really crucial for me I think half a gram is gonna be really bad but I mean it doesn't hurt to try if I feel is the fact that I tried right and I also want to thank y'all if I do get to it I will be thinking y'all again yeah help me get to 1k and I would do that one gram dad for you guys alright so now that we got all the talking out of the way let's go ahead and eat this bad boy up I'm a path forward real quick alright guys look because I'll

like burnt hair and chemicals and soap two of the other grams tasted like mild chemicals and mild flavor I was very excited to try this shatter so that was very disappointing anyways the way this stuff bubbles up though is like some [ __ ] wack ass [ __ ] I'm wondering if anyone out there is seeing some [ __ ] like this like I'm gonna show you guys here in like just two seconds but you know the way this like bubbles up yo I know all shattered bubbles up but this stuff like foams up like so straight up it's [ __ ] up it doesn't necessarily taste like soap exactly but like taste the chemicals you feel me [ __ ] we're gonna go on a melt shot for you guys here this is a purple space cookie sativa so I actually think it's the strain is why this shadow it's legit shatter but like I feel like they added some [ __ ] black [ __ ] so I feel like the strain itself is like purple space cookies good tasting strain I feel like that helped with the shitty taste almost the other shatter I had was a I actually got some zombie shot it was so excited that's what I'm smoking on for weed right now is ami cush and that should tasted like burnt hair yo I cannot [ __ ] you know like what the [ __ ] should I be alarmed and not smoking the shatter a hundred and ten percent hundred of my bucks though gone you know hold for now it gets me high [ __ ] I know I'm stupid as [ __ ] but yo your kid [ __ ] wasted a hundred bucks on this [ __ ] we're gonna make a little bit of use out of it I mean it's not even like the the stuff that doesn't taste like burnt hair like this stuff right here it's like an manageable you know it's like I'm completely manageable it's just definitely like you'd rather smoke either she's chattered I'm not even gonna put that much in here yo I just literally want you guys to see this milk that's all see that [ __ ] yo what the [ __ ] that shit's [ __ ] [Music] filming I just filmed bread before this one I took [ __ ] gigantic dab like probably point two point three I don't know why cuz I [ __ ] hate the shadow that's why anyways that was a very small one and the taste was a lot less there and it was a lot more better I've had some if anyone's tried sweet leaf concentrates I don't know if they're still making shitty shadow but I've had the last time I went to them they had shot it like this and we switched up that [ __ ] real quick you feel me if you are a Canadian though I do you can message me on my Instagram medicated Canadian if you want to find out where to order from in Canada but do not border shadow from can abide post dot CA yo do not or at least their shadow I've been tried their brand products that can occur I believe it was Clark loud Co or some [ __ ] I don't know it sounded a lot more better this is just like manufactured stuff from them I'm pretty sure like so uh I don't know man I'm talking out of my ass this [ __ ] shitty [ __ ] I think I could actually manage another bong coke here just I thought I'd grab some drink apparently not I did he got some good dad's laying around but you already know I gotta get through the dragon before the princess [ __ ] falling on the bright side it's smokeable and it gets me high on the dark side it could be killing me and wasting my money you know all in all it was a learning experience we were never ordering from these people again yeah that was like really the main case I was like even if the shatter from them it is shitty at least I tried it and found out that it was shitty like you know they might have had the [ __ ] most golden [ __ ] in the [ __ ] world but I didn't know but now we know this definitely wasn't small little bong toke zombie cush hopefully you guys are joining me on this one and not the dad because that was very unpleasant just kidding it actually wasn't that bad I'm being way more too exaggerated all right if you guys tried this other shot it this zombie cush I'm not exaggerating whatsoever and that's [ __ ] up burnt hair and chemicals not lying anyways enough talking I'm done with that I'm talking I'm done with the negativity of that shatter Cheers make sure I don't [ __ ] myself [Music] let's scale one to ten right now I'm feeling Wow I'm probably about an eight nine I definitely say my mind actually eight in the half perfect I nailed that all right I literally do the video right before this one I'm surprised I'm not at ten yet I took two dabs in to Banco first hoax of the day - you know the bong talks were not as big as I usually take because I took those [ __ ] shitty dabs and my throat was parked it yo well I'm just like rambling now yeah we're gonna go on another small ball in Tokyo I hope you guys enjoyed this session as much as I I [ __ ] just went out all out on this yak lemme know if someone did make it at the end because I absolutely love you it's go on this last their nose and we're gonna get out of here this is actually gonna put me sky9 this is definitely gonna put me at a 10 yo Cheers [Music] we are almost a 710 subscribers yeah we are gonna be celebrating very very hard at 7:10 yo I literally like plan this out I was like my goal almost well for 20 and 710 we're like sub goals for me we're almost there I think we're nine or ten away or some [ __ ] you can you hit that sub for me and you're gonna get a dope-ass video when we get seven-time hit that like for me drop a comment means a world hope you guys enjoyed this as much as I always do now I'll see you in the next oh my god peace out [Music]", "1yusZO3YeG0": "so we're back inside guys the final product has to be gasps good enough that I felt comfortable and bring in also just like the other day it was getting very windy and I didn't want anything to fly into it even though I had to cover it up with some aluminum foil still just wasn't really comfortable with how windy it was getting so we brought it inside Michigan has it now oh this camera so like I was talking about in the other videos maybe you can see how cloudy that is but you're gonna want it to be completely clear or else popped like you're not gonna want any of these you can see a fairly large bubble here and like I was just explaining this to my dad once it pops the butane inside of it is gonna like evaporate out and that is gonna be your medicine that's gonna be your final medicine that film over top of it so over here you can see one that just popped and it made all those little micro bubbles and in between them all there's like a film and you're gonna scrape that up and then my dad asked me why I'm not popping them and it's just due to the agitation you don't want any agitation so I figured that gonna be something you guys wanted to know as well that's gonna be a nice scrape right there we're still at 100 Fahrenheit and we're gonna be at 100 fahrenheit for quite a while we got the air purifier done and the event running so [Applause] I'll be back in like 12 hours probably to scrape this my phone but yeah I'll be ready about this so we are back guys and we are gonna be scraping the purple push the string blanked on me there for a second so we got our gloves on it's been degassing for I don't know like 12 hours it's just sitting on a piece of printer paper now you guys hang at 110 oh yeah and hear the bubbles popping which means it could have sat longer but those bubbles would have popped themselves I guess I'm putting a lot of pressure guys there we go tell you right now it's stable enough to touch house a bit of a sappy you feel but we're just going to now use a clean dab tool scrape this off let's throw it out on that mat for now I'm gonna do something that you normally don't see people do once this is all scraped guys we'll do another quick pass same side and we'll collect a bit more and then I'm I'll just go ahead and scrape this off camera and be back with the final final a little bit I have the tripod right in front of where I'm scraping so a bit tricky oh I'm sure you've seen like a lot of different things to make this process a lot easier like paint scrapers and no master craft has a little tool like a little oven cleaning kind of tool but I don't know it's just easier to just grab a razor blade I guess I usually use a paint scraper but for some reason I didn't do it this time now here's the first two scrapes I'll show you guys um so they're fairly dark but they're very very thick I almost i rolling pin these to get them really flat before they hit the purge but do it with my fingers so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and scrape this all up we definitely got a better yield off of this purple cushion off the silvers super Silver Haze once it's all scraped up guys I'll be right back so what's up guys were completely bad the [ __ ] out and we're in the room about to turn on the back purged for the preposition like I was saying 25 grams in 4.7 pound I'm feeling it okay so I'll show you what we're working with we topped it up with oil very important thing we got an oscillating fan pointing directly at it to run for longer times at a cooler condition got the vent and we got a purifier in here we got a 4.7 of some very dark super super stable sappy shatter I guess why I'm not really sure what to call it right now it definitely snaps and you can handle it with your bare hands without getting any product on you so we're gonna purge this out like I was saying till the morning I'll show you guys the first pull and then we'll take off so close off the left valve open the right plug your purge in everything was right put the switch but the pictures start building you guys can see that we're coming into negative 30 kill popsicles the color is initially changing that is starting to slowly muffin up [Music] [Applause] [Music] so I've been watching quite a bit of this guy named Bret maverick on YouTube he knows the chemistry and physics behind all this stuff I don't I'm willing to admit that I'm self-taught in the sense that I know what I need and to know that I would watch multiple videos but Bret Mavericks a really really smart dude who goes into super detail about everything and currently learning about the different pressures and boiling points and whatnot on them so that's what's happening right now that muffins getting pretty tall she was saying how the first poll is very very important you stood not degassed this chamber you should like kill the pressure or kill the vacuum and then just leave this pressure and if it doesn't drop within 24 hours that's when you should start purging with a bit of heat as an external source but if it drops within the first 24 hours here in the zone it's like the temperature zone [Music] anyways guys we'll be back tomorrow so yeah so the bad guys and that's been running for 12 hours now you're not gonna let the pressure out of the tank because Bret maverick said so and he makes a really nice product so we're going to try it this way this is a purple cushion still in its full muffins gauge I'd say it's beautiful it was 4.7 going in absolutely beautiful I cannot wait to tango with this purple Kish but we're gonna leave it for 24 hours and see if that muffin deflates I'm pretty sure that's a muffin I guess it was really it was a really really thick glob going in yeah we're gonna leave it for a little bit guys and then we'll be back so see you soon so guys and with the 16 hours held under pressure and muffin deflated it's a main slab now I left the pressure out of the chamber we're going to take it out now I haven't actually handled it yeah so I'll pop the lid off and we'll take a look at it like I said has been sitting for like 12 hours or sure it probably couldn't sit any longer someone needs to use it there it is guys [Applause] [Music] there will be some pictures at the end of it but you're gonna try and pop it off here let me drop some love just in case these are size large I hate large gloves his meeting was and I'm like the only person I know who does I'm assuming this is gonna Bend ever so slowly yeah so here's the backside of it guys damn and it's as you can see it's kind of a toffee that could be because there is still bit of liquid butane when I scraped it or that could be because there's just lots of wax lots of wax on the capitate of stocks and whatnot in the cystal if there's but regardless I'm not upset I've found that bublik Isha's and purple kush I'll usually extract them just something like this I don't know I call it like a sappy shatter because if I bend it back and forth it's still gonna be a very clean snap watch I haven't done it but let's try it just like that look at those uh entrapped Swiss cheese air bubble things okay that's it for this video guys there it is clean break as suspected so yeah it's like a sappy shouter actually we'll be right back when we're gonna take a nap and then it'll be the end of the video okay okay guys so we're back in something I didn't show you in the last video is how I store it kind of like fresh fruit and lie Verizon store it in the freezer you don't have to but just in a cool dark place is fine preferably anywhere not warm like 72 Fahrenheit I think however if it's stable it should be find in warmer temperatures as well I've had stuff actually wax up on me and turn until I get crumble from sitting in like ridiculously warm car temperatures during the summer though but so some of this raw unbleached parchment paper it's gonna rip yourself off a nice piece and as you just seen we broke it in half into a couple little cookie crumbles [Music] this is gonna fold it across [Music] it's so nice to wrap one of these up that has some actual weight to it yeah I just weighed it and like one of them was like 1.9 one of them was like 2.3 so so you just fold in the ends and then you just down reaching in you just slip it in and then just like that you got yourself a beautiful package little mini slob or a couple grams or grammar whatever yielded this is just how you would buy it at a dispensary now it would probably say like Peter extracts or like Paris OG or some [ __ ] like that on it but the clarity 7/10 or something like that but this is how I package it and then store it in my freezer I just keep it a little Tupperware container my freezer guys so let's take those down nice nice little triangle does almost like a heart still are often propane got it from Hank Hill I'm just kidding and I thought way too hard about that I was like gonna say something like because I used propane and propane accessories and then I was like not so cliche all this totally just a gun from Hank Hill but I think earlier so we're just gonna let this cool off for a few seconds so overall with this purple-ish I was really happy assuming it stays as stable as it is and doesn't like wax up overnight kind of thing they'll be all good so Cheers I really need to get a carbon cap I really need to go make some supper alright guys hope you enjoyed this video picked up a bit of knowledge somewhere in it if you enjoyed it give it a like [Music] yeah subscribe for more peace", "hJbnNnt-1nI": "hello everybody welcome back to the low show i'm robin as usual and today we're doing a bit of a uh public service we're going to be talking about bho butane hash oil butane honey oil what i want to do is show you a trick at home that you can do to ensure the quality of your butane honey oil butane hash oil so you'll just need some 99 isopropanol you'll need a jar and i would put a fluid ounce into the jar and this is the big the big part where it takes all the skill we have to take all this shadow here and dump it into the iso and i'm going to put a full gram into here so here we have a gram of uh butane hash oil in about a fluid ounce of isopropanol and we're going to give it about 45 minutes and we'll see how it looks after it does a little bit of dissolving this particular gram was donated to me from a friend who bought it from an illegal market for about thirty dollars a gram so if the price is too good to be true there might be a reason behind that so we'll check in with this in a little bit of time here okay so magic time you wouldn't know this but five hours have passed i don't look much older but i feel it um what we're looking at here is five hours of the isopropanol removing whatever cabinet cannabinoids were attached to whatever is in there it's been removed and now you can see that the the iso is quite yellow so the color from our shatter is now liquefied as cannabinoids will do but what we'll notice when we zoom in closer are a ton of particulates and non-cannabinoid uh pieces of who knows what it is whether it's a clay silica a pine resin which i don't think it is because pine resin should still dissolve in isopropanol but it is a cutting agent and what that does is for one it increases the uh the profits of the people who are making these slabs and deciding to cut it with whatever garbage that's in here when we don't care about the quality of our concentrates it leads to adverse effects honestly good things aren't cheap and cheap things aren't good there are healthy mediums between quality and pricing i personally would not consume a single piece of butane hash oil propane hash oil without doing this test if it was purchased by somebody who i didn't know i didn't know their program if i can't say the exact process that was taken to make this i'm going to dump it into isopropanol and see what's in there and i will have to sacrifice a portion of that gram so it's worth doing um you might be shocked and surprised with what you find and i think if you do find that hold them accountable because that's [ __ ] [ __ ] so um enjoy smoking and uh sorry i got angry there uh you know keep tuning in and anytime we come across things like this that we feel like sharing we're gonna do it so check in check you out [Music] you", "mYKbQysVUT0": "[Music] [Music] welcome back we're gonna get on talking about our extracts now so I mean anything that don't know us where the beard bros we've been we've been doing concentrates before we opened up the shop so we've you know mall one month uh lots of awards tops up there while most summer for concentrates yeah so number one thing is quality and quality to get quality we need to make sure we're starting with quality flower so if you've seen our other video flowers we make our concentrate from that caliber of flowers absolutely and yeah then we use the top-of-the-line gear so closed-loop systems vacuum only purge until it's it's clan we kind of got like a process to it so it's more or less on time you know any it's really around that ninety hour point yeah so we're really stoked that you guys are watching this video and are interested in our shop and and getting our concentrates so we're 45 a gram for our our shatter which you know I don't know if many people are comparing for this quality so we really want to make sure it's quality and it's a reasonable price for patients to access for this quality you can't go wrong with that yeah right so there's five dollars a gram twenty-five dollars a half gram right now I have 16 flavors of shatter amazing distinct different flavors of shatter six flavors of wax and six different libraries ins and I mean for that selection that quality in that price you you literally cannot go anywhere else in Canada yeah these are just some of our flavors like this is our cotton candy pretty notorious for the beard rose gotta check out the flower video if you haven't cuz we talked a little about it how amazing that quality is on the the flower transfers to something that looks like this is a staple here beautiful stability wonderful amazing the flavors are great then we get into this tuna I mean this is your your typical authentic in the coffe shatter have you in economy and the the glands are so resin del that it becomes a bit darker just to clarify it's not color doesn't mean quality so I mean if it's darker doesn't mean that it's not a high-grade because it all comes down to the or if the grower matures his plant further and makes it more resonant darker huh doesn't mean that it's gonna be quality like one of our heavy coaches out here like this Master Kush this comes out a bit later but he's the same growers that the same crew as a cotton candy so it comes on a bit later because they finish well they get they got another with a microscope and they watch those glands a lot of guys like to take it really further I mean that purple cush will come out probably darker the critical mass a bit lighter I mean it just varies right so it's not always about how light it is later just means it's gonna be a bit lighter on the smoke and like a lot of sativas are lighter because a lot of guys don't mature them to ten or twelve weeks or they want they take them bit sooner so that's why you usually get a lighter one but yeah so that's tuna there this is actually white rhino on Khan County so this is our Cup winning way around a flower that's a beautiful one and these are thick pieces to Brad and they're still coming out really nice and clear yeah just beautiful yeah really thick amazing that's our nuke in there yeah and that's another you know another indica dominant so like Brad saying it doesn't always always make the color different but yeah I liked look at that beautiful color really fruity you can definitely taste the shish-kebab out when you do dab it really nice you know for those that aren't really too familiar with dabbing you should really check it out I mean this is an extremely potent clean way of medicating you're eliminating a lot of the carcinogens I mean you don't have any plant material it's a lot it's a lot better for your alarms for bother you're gonna wake up feeling a little more you know a little more pep in your step you're really kind of I know if you're on the go you'll eliminate some time you don't have to sit there roll up a joint just throw it in a pan throw it on a rig and you're good to go Leszek such a good point all right you think about percentage-wise I mean most joints are nowadays between 20 and 30 percent each seeing the flower a 30 you're not going to get much better than that right gonna be like yeah that's go so you still have smoke enjoy which is like our coffee candy by the way thirty twenty nine point five percent of number yeah yeah but when you concentrate most of our shadows over between eighty and ninety percent right so I mean they're about the difference you need you want the role joint you're not the smoke a big bowl you can just do a couple of dabs throw it your pants you eat a lot way less and and you're and you're gonna have a less less of a smell to right so a lot of people I gotta be more discreet for work but they still need to medicate radicals you know yeah you always you know kind of go under the radar of your landlord a lot easier I know I've I've been able to hello family maybe you know hide a little dabs from them every once in a while of family occasions maybe Christmastime grandma yeah you know watching I you know one of those being our our beard tears here really really amazing a high quality Phoenix tier it's I mean some of the other Phoenix tears we've carried here they're really awesome they're really good quality but I mean I can see through this it's a very beautiful amber color it's made with an ethanol as opposed to an ISO alcohol which a lot of other products are using or sorry a lot of other extract companies are using for their products and ethanol to ingest is just a lot more healthy than I so they do use you know the safe amount of parts-per-million with that with that I so but still ethanol is just better for you so also the amount of cannabinoids and yeah this one here considers I mean lower grade I mean it's gonna be less there's 217 milligrams of THC and that one and this one there's 540's it's pretty well double not to knock anyone elses stuff but they uh you know we we are really sticklers for quality here and it comes out we've listed all the cannabinoids on there you have a very in-depth right now I've got I've listed sorry three six nine there's ten cannabinoids on there and I mean when you get into the municipal property as a cannabinoid so you can really kind of pinpoint what you're looking for with those and makes it a lot easier yeah so is it more or less a no there's a difference like we try our beard stuff we try to bring it almost comparable price I'm not it's the exact same price and it's although we don't charge anymore and yeah you know use very top quality top quality stuff that's great so yeah that's that was our beam exteriors we got different we got one two ones we've got high CBD Phoenix tears absolutely oh yeah with the you know with the the CBDs we've got two different kinds of CBD strain shatters right now so if you guys are looking for a little more medicated shatter you know you have that option so there's that too and they're both tasty I think we've got one on the sativa side one on the indica indica side they're both tested one two ones I believe they were both around nine percent THC a what else we got going on here we got we got our THC a pills that are actually really popular starting to catch fire right we've also got just or THC pills they're both made with a coconut oil base and 100 milligrams of either THC a or THC really good products we've got one with a veg Caplin with a gel cap so if you're a vegetarian or vegan no problem you got that option you know I myself I could eat we have amazing edibles here but when you eat edibles every day it's really hard to get them down sometimes you know even if they taste really good capsules have been saving my life you know it doesn't matter how hungry are you most people can get one pill back and then you know helps everything else go down but those are really awesome very very high quality good coconut oil based pills there yeah we've those range we've got hash caps and those are just the the beer brothers produced once we do carry a lot of other we're not gonna go over everything we honor honor what's available you can just come and check out like look out our menu on our website and have a little more detail and we'll WW option saw your bros CA yeah alright we're also gonna talk alone here for concentrates I mean we do carry a good line of edibles without some more valuables but we do got like the caller mrs. Baird's doesn't have a beard but she's our in-house banker and she does a lot of gluten-free organic and healthy ingredients so we do pride in those they're organic mostly that really could we have really good ingredients which is also really important with edible though with ingesting because you want to have those good ingredients those bad sugars and non-organic things with GMO they can contribute to your disease or whatever you're trying to fight cancers and stuff like that so we try to make sure at a bolder top-quality try to keep it as medicinal as we can I know we didn't really talk too much about the waxes and live residence we don't have any Slough so but we do have fantastic waxes yeah I got six flavors and that varies that goes up announcing with our live resins oh yeah what we sell in our live resins for our live resins are $75 a full gram 40 to $40 a half gram which is very absolutely insane I mean most people if you haven't heard of live resin you're thinking that's a lot of money per gram but if you look around people are selling them for hundreds of dollars per gram yeah I've seen live residents go for $200 which is yeah kind of kind of unreal yeah totally the pass the savings on to the patients as much as we can here so that's number one so we don't want to keep this video too long this is marvelous explain any explaining more about our extracts got any more questions your feel free to give us a show here at the shop Morgan's one of our staff your Alapai one over one of our top guys and he'll answer your questions pretty thoroughly I can't I'll try to find out how to yep and you can I think there's a come on Instagram you can message us you can email us so yeah look forward to helping you out and helping you with any issues you have thanks guys [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "j3CRe2-R8Yg": "cheers this film [Music] [Music] yo what's up guys Ronnie ray back -

it's not like plastic paper so yeah it's cardboard it's not paper - that's a plus but besides for that like it's nothing really too fancy there's definitely like wait [ __ ] more cool like I mean like the packaging is whatever I mean like you're gonna throw it away anyways it doesn't really [ __ ] matter but there's some companies that like that go out of the way and it makes it go faster packaging you know what I mean so it's just even though it doesn't really matter it's just kind of cool sometimes but on a scale of one to five I'll give that like a three out of five maybe a 3.5 out of 5 just because like like I said it's dope as [ __ ] for what it is like it's just a [ __ ] envelope or like for being just like a generic envelope it's not like them just a plain white one that they did their own thing I mean so look at that like half a point for being like creative and unique but they can get something more unique you know what I mean but besides for that it the next thing the looks of it looks of the shatter on a scale of 1 to 5 this shit's looking [ __ ] fire it's looking I can see like a lot of that you can see the Terps in it's looking like a little saucy ass definitely looking [ __ ] fire I don't know tumble down below in the comments what you guys think of it good you guys already [ __ ] seeing it but here's another look at it definitely looking [ __ ] fire now I constantly pick up this leg trip I pick them up all the time this isn't my first time trying them because I've worked in love their products probably they're an arizona-based brand but if I'm wrong and down below in the comments but I already know the kids are gonna be [ __ ] high quality all the time and especially for the price point so I believe their grams like normally like $40 45 50 and they chorus and like better like THCA like tops up shelf [ __ ] that goes for like more like 60 80 but like this stuff was up 40 dollars a gram yeah that's just 40 bucks a gram so but 40 [ __ ] dollars a gram that [ __ ] is [ __ ] fired and they're constantly like I would say like at least once a week or once every other week they have a buy one get one free deal so you can pretty much get it for like 20 bucks a gram you can't [ __ ] beat that right there like that's not [ __ ] steel you know what I mean fire uh so the price point I mean not the price point oh I guess we could do both with the price point I'll get that [ __ ] like a when they had the buy one get one free deal five out of five laptops but even like forty bucks a gram for this [ __ ] that's still like a five out of five for like a four and a half out of five that's this isn't [ __ ] fire like I mean just off looks and then like the looks of it like just like I'm having I mean I've smoked their [ __ ] product like their products before but in this video I haven't smoked any of this yet but it's based off the looks this [ __ ] looks [ __ ] fires it based off the looks I'm gonna give it like a in between a four and A four and a half out of five so like up one two out of five that makes sense you know what I mean oh yeah enough talking I feel like I've been rambling let's get into [ __ ] smoke now so I'm gonna get a little smaller not a small dab but a little a little decent dab you know I mean because we're getting a little taste test first see how this is so look you guys can like show you guys how well it's gonna be kind of hard for me show you but like you obviously see how it's melted on the side it's just like super saucy you can just like screen that up I don't know how well that's the cameras picking that up it's like the sides are like super turkeys like sauce you know I mean our room is cold as [ __ ] so it looks like there's no weight like noted but that's [ __ ] fire um but yeah my good at like a little decent dab nothing crazy big get a little taste test going see what this just isn't like and then other we take this would take a couple of bigger dives and get a little high test going see how I'm feeling you know what I mean so that's not Vince's it's a little bit like um shatter sugar flats like kinda has like a little bit of a sugar texture to do that that makes sense but say here's the dab like I said it's nothing [ __ ] huge nothing too small but it'll get the job done mr. Bellamy smoking that up for the nothing too fancy that's like a generic rigna didn't like name-brand but to recyclers that's where you do a pretty dope right but now so it's good this tastes though it's going to go one the pot like I said yeah [Music] my card caps so I'm just gonna use this um it'll work it'll get the job done just a [ __ ] little empty box containing you know what I mean so yeah where's that that here it is so if you guys are smoking on long cheers I hope you guys have smoked with something dank and let's get this little piece that's going because I want to take some [ __ ] fat dabs and get high so yeah let's go choose super smooth super clean the fire honestly on that first not really much flavor like it was just super clean like super smooth with Jonah man the guy didn't even call I didn't even have the urge to off like some correct wedding cake is like a cross train between like your spell cookies and what is it a trick chirayu pie right if I'm correct it's kind of shut up like a sweet earthy taste to it I guess I've been since I guess that's what I could say I had I got a sweet earthy taste to it cuz it didn't really have much flavor um it just tasted fire like some pure wax you know what I mean like I don't know maybe on this next to I'll taste it a little bit more of it'll go on for a fatter Deb multi-hit alone I don't know my rate is probably gonna change after I take this tab but just based off that first hit the this taste I'll probably give like a four or five yeah that's going for it fatter dad now sir yeah all right so I'm take a pretty fat dab right here so yeah let me take a little snake and that [ __ ] looks far like I don't know like you could just see like a little of the Turks in it like yeah like a head like that sure your wax texture to it I don't know like I don't know if you guys can really see you okay there's some oh my finger take my thumb but I don't know how I can get the camera to focus on a little bit better maybe you guys can see it I don't know it just has like the [ __ ] look I don't know it just has like it like some like a turf texture to it but I don't know if you guys can see no oh yeah that's a dive about the tape pretty [ __ ] fat so I guess this would be like a little high reading if for 40 bucks a gram line it should have [ __ ] fire there whatever seals like dripping in our area definitely pick it up yep and if you have like a buy one get one free deal definitely don't miss out on that which is called the quarter twenty bucks I don't even see how they're like I don't know that makes me wonder like how cheap they're getting it for like they cost them to make it like this sign it for 20 bucks a gram you know there's still probably like making a hella profit off but and it's [ __ ] fire sign above you know what I mean but I don't know it's just [ __ ] weird but threat of smoking along I hope you guys are smoking something thank you you guys are cheers Cheers [Music] [ __ ] bro [Music] so I don't know how well that uh smoke showed up on the camera because I think he brought us lights and a makes it like alright for my camera to pick up the smoke sometimes but I took that dad but like the perfect temperature is so light I mean like you think I got a lot of smoke but for like the size of the dab it wasn't as much smoke as a room only thing but like inches because I [ __ ] took it at like a low temperature you know I mean but like I definitely [ __ ] got all that [ __ ] in my lungs oh my god that [ __ ] [ __ ] hurt I'm not gonna lie and I'm definitely [ __ ] throwing highs [ __ ] out so if you guys can tell but not like I've been saying that [ __ ] is definitely [ __ ] fires [ __ ] I got some more [ __ ] on blue dream crumble rhythm comes in like this little box a little bit [ __ ] different I'm gonna be dropping a review on this [ __ ] soon so if you guys want to see that stay tuned but I'm gonna get the [ __ ] high four point three out of five fire is [ __ ] but this I think some more fire wife's out there but you gotta [ __ ] pay the price but for being 40 bucks it's Stephanie [ __ ] dumb fire you're not I mean um like I don't have any complaints at all in fact uh but um uh yeah overall score I'll give like a four point two out of five I know that's like a weird score but I feel like it deserves more than a four but it's not all the way up for four point five yeah I mean so yeah four point two but yeah if you guys liked this video after the big thumbs up comment like subscribe do what I could show you you know what to do how many if you guys liked them down below in the comments give me video ideas suggestions suggestions anything anything you guys want to tell me you don't blow in the comments that's what the comments are for it but besides for that it's been Ronnie ray P so", "cUzOsdhJXQc": "i'm clicking record now all right hey everybody um katie here with love creative i have john bassard am i pronouncing that right i should ask bashar bashar here with me today from waxacks hey john how you doing katie great too uh great to be with you here it's a beautiful friday um excited to chat it up yeah so am i um so today we're going to talk a little bit about wax snacks um a little bit about john and the industry um i have right here some can you just give a little bit of a background on cb cb buzzed absolutely c buzz d is our newest cbd partner um gentlemen um good friend of mine david he runs a store in denver that we're actually in and he has his own cbd line and we had some thc cbd wax max in there he really wanted to use our packaging with his um cbd concentrate so i put them together and yeah we actually are just about to launch them into the market so katie got a vip pack you know low key but we're about to launch them into the market this month dope all right let's um i say we take a rip and then um we can talk a little bit about wax snacks um and kind of you know the innovation in the market and all that fun stuff um i have zipper here shout out to dick nice love the bit people love the dip fam love the dip fan they have a bunch of cool um dabbing devices highly recommend them um they're awesome yeah i'm going with my little ski guy in honor of being up in aspen this weekend i love it all right cheers so they have little inserts in here um and they're all just out so you know how much you're consuming cheers katie yours me oh very tasty oh yes oh yes it's tasty so josh how does that how does that how did that one taste katie i haven't even tried that one yet good very very good i remember i was introduced um how long have we been working together um two years year and a half years just yeah just about two years i mean you john and the puff team are definitely some of the people we met very early on in the industry when we uh started wax snacks moved out to denver so it's got to be probably around two years around two years yeah i remember i was um out for the mj biz conference in vegas with uh lex and that's the first time i ever tried a cbd waxing stab um i had tried you know the the first uh time we did a party with you guys was my first thc dab um but that was the first time trying cbd and i really i think that's when i started to fall in love with um dabbing in general because it can be kind of harsh um if you're not used to smoking absolutely that's kind of what got me involved with akd i um was not a huge concentrate user really at all um lex who uh who's the president for wax max principal investor he um in college went to college together down to tulane he was a big concentrate user and so every time i'd go over to his place and he'd um you know he'd be using concentrate i would just you know i would have no idea what i'm doing so i pretty much make lex set it up for me i'd be like lex like you know you know me you know i'm a boy like hook me up just give me a little piece i don't want to get too too too high i want to feel good like just set up the whole process for me he's picking out pieces on like a parchment paper for some shatter and i just i don't even really know what's going on i'm just you know hitting it whenever he puts in front of my face and the same exact time yeah it was it was i mean that was only like three or four years ago it's changed a lot even since then but lex you know right around that same time lex kind of brought me the idea of wax snacks and i was like man like you know me as more of a novice user someone who you know enjoys using cannabis loves the plant knows all the benefits about it um but not a big concentrate user i'm like that's the only way i would ever dab so that's really what sparked it for me um and then after that you know we kind of started getting everything set up to move out to denver to launch the business and as soon as we graduated that's what we did so um with wax snacks um what what's what makes it so different and so cool like um obviously um for for people who do know it they understand like it's for dosaging and stuff like that but um can you just explain it for people who don't really even know what dabbing is yeah absolutely so just to kind of give everyone an idea like you showed them so this is our thc product so big idea is we're able to pre-dose pre-packaged um pre-load concentrate dabs in a single serving format kind of like uh k-cup you know k-cup for for concentrates and so the benefit for that is just kind of being intellectually now able to speak about how much cannabis you're consuming you know knowing how much you know creating a baseline that allow you to know how much you need to consume for x reason you know whether it's medical recreational you know you can now educationally know yourself and then tell others you know how much concentrate you want to consume and so that's that's i would say the biggest piece the second piece is really just the portability and ease of use travel um so again with your dip this you know this with the dip honey badger you know all those electronic nectar collectors terp pen it's like a match made in heaven you know now all you need is a pack of wax necks you just need that and you can you know come up to the mountains and get high very easily you know there's no more needing to carry you know rig blow torch you know scooper although wax next works with the blow torch you know we really think we're with the where the no the future but where the industry's going is that you know these electronic devices are really going to be the key and so that's that's how we kind of shaped what we have right now with wax snacks with that in mind amazing yeah like um for those who don't know a lot of dabs come in jars like this uh it's fairly big and it's not dosed out so you would take something like the dipper from here and you would dip that um into here like you would with the with the wax next insert um and the big big difference like you mentioned is you know um for someone who doesn't consume cannabis often or concentrate um is pretty harsh for them dabbing with this you don't know what you're consuming you don't know how much you're getting um absolutely and it's it's so easy to just not feel like you're taking that much and then you know a few seconds after you realize what you've just done in your you know again and unfortunately unfortunately just draws people away from the use of concentrates to dabbing which is actually like what we think is the future of smoking in general smoking cannabis in general i really think that's where the industry's um trending towards right right exactly um so what i know that you got involved with black snacks um kind of in college with lex is that um how you started to have a love for cannabis or get involved in the industry in a whole or did it start kind of before that it definitely started before that um funny enough the way it works out so in high school i went to uh to a boarding school in california and um i first got introduced to wheat out there and before then um you know being a boarding school was pretty stressful it was very competitive boarding school very you know academically focused had to play sports so you just had a lot on your plate the whole time and it was very easy to be very self-critical you know whether it was on the basketball court you know in high school i was just like any type of mistake i would never let myself forgive like forgive myself i just wouldn't like i would just kind of hammer myself like really kind of give it to myself and even academically same thing like if i wasn't getting straight a's i would like it just caused so much stress and so much unhappiness so even close to like the i would say those were the times where i was closest to depression by far as i said getting in this new environment this new boarding school and just like having so much expectations then i get introduced to cancer it's so it seems so corny but there's i mean it's completely the truth is once i um started consuming cannabis in high school i just like i felt like i saw the bigger picture more clear like you know it's like all right you you know you [ __ ] up and you know you [ __ ] up on the last test so what like long term like yeah like what how does that really affect you you know like your your personality you know like all these little intricacies about you how does that really affect you moving forward same thing with you know sports and so that's what i would think really helped me it's like really kind of focus more on the big picture obviously you got to you know go in day in and day out and you know grind it out but you know you're always going to come up short at some point everyone always does and so instead of just like absolutely never forgiving yourself for i feel like cannabis gave me a an outlet to really forgive myself you know just like to to realize that hey this is like not all that matters you know for sure i think i've had like a similar experience too and it's kind of like ironic because a lot of people um i feel like think the opposite before they try it or try it the white right way and consume it the right way um because a lot of people don't and they make jokes i've seen online people making jokes about like um you know cbd and all that stuff like it's the answer to all but i don't think it's the answer at all but i i think it can ground people to help them get there um i had like issue in high school college all of my um career like learning and school career um i had really bad adhd i didn't have good grades i was an athlete and that's really what pushed me by but at the end of the day i was like really what what do i want to come home to and it's i don't think a glass of wine i think a nice joint or a deck or something like that and i i figured out it's because it really does bring me center and kind of shows me the bigger picture like it does for you um exactly and i think it can help people i think it's just um there's a lot of stickers out there and there needs to be a lot more research and innovation in order for people to really believe it and i i do think we're getting um and brands like waxxx um i think is helping people get there and understand that it's not just you know buying a dime bag from the dealer down the street um there's a way to consume for everybody absolutely um i mean it's you know another piece to that is really again like me personally i'm i try to be as much of a networker as possible you know really try and get connected with as many people as possible and what i realized early on is canvas is a great way to do that cannabis is a great way and um you know really just kind of come together come together as one and so me dude i also looked at it that way it's like wow if it's done you know correctly where you're not getting too high you know where you're having an unenjoyable time i think it's a great way to kind of get people together and again enjoy enjoy whatever's kind of in front of you so that that's another piece that i really kind of learned you know those high school college years and i still think again with wax next we have that incorporated again so many people have that terrible experience with concentrates and we want to we want to be the solution for that you know we want to be we want to be the way that that never happens again yeah i think i i think um i try to emphasize on that to a lot of people who are first-time consumers or just like friends who are like i don't want to consume too much is that um there is a way to consume the right way and um for you to get rid of those stigmas and um that people who smoke every day like you and i um have moments in time even now where we smoke too much or we consume too much um and i've been in really really bad head spaces where i've consumed way too much and i'm like questioning everything that i've ever done in my life i question your existence yeah i mean it totally happens and that that's again you mentioned indicated the education piece is so important the education piece is so important what we want to do is again educate people on concentrates and do them correctly you know and it changes person to person like there are people out there who for them it's half a gram right after gram one hit and it's like you do your thing you know yourself you do it but it's like to know yourself you first need to know what you're doing you know you need to know what you're gonna put inside you and so that's what we're just trying to do and really create the you know the safest cleanest way to consume concentrates and through that consume cannabis that's that's kind of the big goal yeah and i think you guys are doing an amazing job at it and i love the products i love the people behind your brand as well and you guys are amazing and i know you're always you know looking to do the right thing and get involved um with the right people um and i think you know this industry like you mentioned just a bit ago is it's a community and it's um a very very loving loving community but um i think that people uh outside of the community have stigmas um absolutely to this day still to this day right and i think it's time to break that um and i also like to say you know consuming cannabis compare it to and i'm saying this loosely um but compare it to consuming alcohol um one person might not feel anything drinking beer um and can have 15 of them but the person next to them um can have just as much as they did and have alcohol poisoning um or they could be the same body weight and they consume the same way but that person didn't eat dinner that day um and now they're throwing up in the corner um i say the same thing with consuming cannabis how much did you eat how much do you weigh um what's your lifestyle like um do you get anxious during the day apparently um there's a lot of things to take into factor um just like you know there's you can consume too much of anything absolutely it's i mean everything you know is self moderation you know everything you know whether it's again alcohol weed you know i think everything you know where you're good at and you know when you get to a point where you're not good and you know again that's i think that's how you live the healthiest lifestyle is do the things you love to do you know in moderation know know yourself a little bit what right what's gonna kind of cause you to go over that ledge and not so a lot of people enjoy it rather than over indulge in it and yeah i think wax nice is literally the perfect product um that describes that um and that really pushes for that um i'm super stoked for what you guys have coming forward um i feel like there's so much you guys can do your brand and your vision um so i wish you nothing nothing but the best appreciate you appreciate you katie yeah we're just on the precipice a lot of good things to come um again really just trying to get this packaging and failing um service you know brand behind you know every concentrate company producer out there that's really the goal so that's what we're going towards um i mean we're only going to get there by working with wonderful people like you john sheamus ben everyone over at puff creative we love you guys again we've known you guys in the industry just about as long as anyone and couldn't have asked for a better uh better group of people to work with so appreciate you guys always always send you guys much love yeah you as well how about we do uh one more dab hit um for the end of this this podcast let's do it uh this friday on a very very good note um do you have anything fun planned on the weekend no like i said i'm up here in

back to the 2x4 flower tent we're here on day 45 and today our topics are flushing phenotype hunting and terpene profiles but before we get started if you like learning about cannabis the science of cannabis or you just like watching quality cannabis content make sure to hit that subscribe button and turn on the notifications so you don't miss out on any future videos and as always welcome to cannabinology [Music] so here on day 45 everything is coming along beautifully we've just entered our flushing cycle and we'll talk a little bit more about what that means in just a few minutes the first thing i want to do is sort of just give a rundown of the tent we're going to start over here with our breeding plants and we'll just go through these quickly and we'll talk about our phenohunts and some of the turkey profiles in a few minutes so the first thing i want to talk about is this bewitched bx2 right here this is our number one phenotype what we call the lavender cupcakes phenotype has some really delicious uh sort of a linoleum heavy kind of lavender grapey uh terpene profile with some sort of earthy cupcake notes and it's really really delicious very excited uh this is of course for our preservation run so this is a bewitched uh bx2 cross to our keeper males of the bush bx2 right next to her we have our sfv and these next couple of plants are pollinated with our sex reversed blueberry cookies um if you are interested in that check out some of the earlier videos um the pre i think they were called pre-season six um we did a number of sex reversals and did some sts experimentation so definitely check those out and if you're interested in doing your own sex reversals making your own feminized seats visit our website www.cbgyca.com stskit and we have a lot more information there you can pick up those kits as well in case you missed that link i will also drop those in the comments along with all the other links for the equipment and all the things we talked about as well down in the description so make sure to check that out so this is this here is a super classic strain sfv og crossed to our feminized or sex reversed blueberry cookies and we're making cannabinology really really amazing line very popular for it's high vigor super frost great really interesting sort of exotic terpene profiles extremely high yield it really really stacks so you get these massive colas actually kind of similar in stacking to this although the flower structure on this one's a little messed up this is the blueberry cookies but it really stacks very similar to that but much bigger plants than the blueberry cookies the next plant here this is our purple punch uh sort of a hype strain pretty well known super frosty very purple sort of a light uh grape punch grape soda type of flavor of course this is crossed with the sex reverse blueberry cookies as well we're making purpleberry punch really nice sort of a candy grape lots of deep purples plenty of color in this lime so very excited to have more seeds of this and then here we have our little short blueberry cookies i was hoping this was going to be bigger that we would get more seeds out of it but this is a pretty small very short stretching plant so a little bit short here but this is our blueberry cookies and this is for the blueberry cookies s1 feminized just sort of a preservation of this clone all right so the next two things i want to talk about here are some of the clones that we're running and then we'll hop into our blueberry cookies phenohunt we'll start over here this is the cushman sort of a hype cut here uh really starting to look good very commercial flower look sort of that round dense super frosty flower really looking good really smelling good has a nice sort of sweet fresh cushy taste hence the name cushman's so that's very cool we're probably going to do some crosses with this maybe in our next run with our blueberry muffin do some muffin mints or cush muffin i'm not really sure what i'm going to call it yet if you guys have ideas of what to call the blueberry muffin by cushman's let me know down in the comments i would love some great idea names next up we have our blueberry mac and i guess i misspoke this one is actually a clone this is from seed so this is the mac one capped cut crossed with the blueberry bakery zero which is sort of our our a cut of our blueberry bakery males we have two males that we decided to keep um and this is what i feel like is the better male over the two um so this cross to the mac one uh the blueberry bakery across the back one absolutely beautiful not quite the flower size i was looking for but it did get quite shaded out it really doesn't stretch kind of like the mac one really doesn't stretch pretty slow to grow but beautiful color super frosty looks like it's going to be real real dense i did raise it up on a little sort of riser here this is just uh i think mushrooms came in this or something like that we cleaned it out flipped it over um brought it up a couple of inches to get some more light so beautiful color on this all right moving on we have our kuiper belt another uh variety that's somewhat similar to the mac one actually very slow to grow this one is pretty weak stems but as you can see beautiful frosty flowers already starting to get that that purple in there it's got a really uh really really delicious sort of a sweet uh gravy cushy [Music] terpene profile just absolutely amazing this one probably is going to go into the 65 or 70 days so this has quite a few weeks to go actually same with this blueberry mac i'm expecting this one to go out quite a bit [Music] all right moving over we're going to talk about our phenol hunt here and i will say everybody i'm super stoked about this vino hunt these plants look amazing i'm really really happy with how these are turning out beautiful beautiful flowers really great structure amazing terpene profile there's a little bit of diversity which is honestly kind of nice that way you have you know some sativa leaner some indica leaner but all sort of with that uh common blueberry flavor um so this is four plants of the blueberry cookies bx1 and so one thing that i really like about this is i'm actually finding two phenotypes that are pretty close to identical there's a little bit of difference in terms of flower structure and that's the blueberry cookies number five and the blueberry cookies number three they both have a pretty conical sort of cone-shaped flower both have a really nice sort of round open sweet blueberry terpene profile which is really really excellent i really love this terpene profile very greasy resin which really means there's probably a lot of terps in it which is really something that i'm breeding this for so the blueberry cookies the things that i'm looking for are good flower structure the blueberry terpene profile that the number three and the number five have i'm looking for a little bit higher yield than the blueberry cookies because as i mentioned blueberry cookies is really small a very very short plant doesn't stretch much it's a little bit higher yield and some color so those are the things i'm looking for and i'm honestly seeing that in in all of these plants nice chunky buds pretty frosty delicious terpene profile so very happy so as i mentioned these two the number three and the number five both have the sort of sweet round blueberry terpene profile so these are probably what i'm waiting for is keepers the number five may not be a true keeper but i am seeing this uh fasciation mutation which i believe is caused by an upregulation of a plant hormone called cytokinin which does a number of things um including affecting lateral branching and cell division all sorts of stuff so i'm planning on keeping this because i think i think this uh this type of mutation could be used to significantly boost your crop yield just because the flowers grow really funky and just kind of grow bigger so if you look at a flower like this and you look at the flower right next to it obviously this fascinated one much bigger so i'm hoping we can sort of play around with this stabilize this trait and get some really interesting looking flowers and boost yields much more quickly than with sort of your standard breeding methods of selecting looking for the highest yield breeding that selecting again i think we could use this and i think it would be really cool to have a whole plant with these very interesting cool looking flowers on them all right but we are talking about terpene profiles here so the number three and the number five both have that blueberry terpene profile and then we go over to and then we go over to some of these other phenotypes so for example here is the number two phenotype and we'll get a little smell of this one thing i did notice about this one it has really big trichome heads which is pretty cool potentially really good for extraction as far as terpene profile we went ahead and just sort of rubbed our fingers on there that's a great way to test those terpene profiles it still has that delicious blueberry flavor um but the undertones those so it has some sort of deeper a little bit gassier earthier sort of undertones in there really really amazing though very excited for this one i'm potentially going to make some rosin out of this because of the larger trichome size i think it'll press really well and i also think this one's going to be a bigger healer than the other ones unfortunately this one did get a little bit close to the light so we did get some of those flat tops on there as you can see but i think if i uh had monocrop this we could have brought that light up just a little bit we would have gotten some really beautiful flower structure on there as well so i think this is probably a yielder decent purping profile i would definitely consider this a keeper and i'm in my f3 or my bx1f2 which is basically an f3 i am gonna probably run this one and the number three uh just because this one has amazing trichomes beautiful beautiful trichomes and probably higher yielder so i do want to hold an f3 of this number two phenotype and an f3 of the number three phenotype the number three is definitely the one i'm leaning for it has the flower structure it has the exact flavor that i'm looking for it's got perfect height beautiful beautiful beautiful flowers i already said that i just love how these flowers look i'll give you a little close up there absolutely gorgeous dense frosty looks like they're gonna have some great color really really stoked sorry i know i've spent a lot of time on on this number three phenotype and i'm super super excited about it all right so then we'll go over to the number six phenotype so this one is actually very different from the other ones obviously uh it's a little bit taller a little bit more sativa leaning i mean i actually really like the structure of this at first this one kind of like the number three got a little bit close to the light so we've got some funky growth here a little bit of fox tailing but that's okay one thing i noticed about this phenotype is as it was growing it was actually one of the shorter ones in the beginning but it stretched for a longer amount of time and actually met the canopy of the taller one and i say shorter and taller it's only a difference about an inch or an inch and a half between all these plants but some minor minor height differences really the unique thing here is the flower structure being much more sort of stick like a nice big stick of stacked up flowers much thinner leaflets probably leaning more towards the sativa-like effects just based on how this looks it looks more like a sativa plant so we're gonna get a little smell some terps here so i really just like to sort of grab one of these outer leaves rub a couple of trichomes off just to get some [Music] flavor yeah so this one's very different it's got um what i consider sort of a haze type of flavor it's got a little bit more citrus a little bit more earthy in it definitely sort of a unique phenotype here so this one probably would be a keeper for some people if you're looking for that sativa with a little bit of your sort of citrus and berry notes um this could definitely be for you it's not too tall it looks like it's not going to take too too long to finish probably in the 60 to 65 day range and of course had this not gotten so close to the light we probably would have gotten some better flower structure on here that said i probably will not be keeping this i am keeping it for now but i'm probably not going to move this into the f3 round um just because it's not really the turkey profile that i'm looking for with the blueberry cookies it's also not really the flower structure i love the sort of conical or not the conical the sort of pole like stacked flower but it's not the structure i'm looking for for blueberry cookies specifically one line that i may use this in is in the cabinology in the the thai stack line or the thai exotic which of course is an offspring of this sfv and blueberry cookies here one of those the number two phenotype has this same structure really really uh stacked these really long colas so i may cross that uh do a femme cross between this blueberry cookies and that can have an og since they have a similar structure maybe stabilize that structure get some some more terps in there and things like that but that's all to say that this is a keyboard just not for this line and i am very excited to try out the number six all right from here i do want to jump into a little bit about our flushing cycle we are here on day 45 and day 45 uh usually it's a little bit early for flushing and i'll explain why i sort of consider my flush period starting now but for those of you who are just tuning in who don't really understand what flushing is and why you do it i'll give a really sort of brief overview overview so flushing is basically where you take plain water and you dump it through your media and what that's going to do is pull out any nutrients that are left over from your flowering cycle especially when you use mineralized or salt nutrients you get a lot of buildup in your soil so you might be going and pouring in your nuts at you know 1.5 1.9 2.0 ec um but over time that's going to build up and i've seen build up even in my grows up to three four five thousand if you're not flushing and doing maintenance flushes throughout your cycle which is okay you don't have to maintenance flush it is a good idea though so towards the end of your flowering cycle you do want to flush out any extra nutrients this is really going to help the senescence or the death cycle of these plants is going to help them flush out bring out more color a lot of people will say it also helps with the color of your ash and the smoothness of your smoke there is some debate there's not a lot of evidence to say one way way or the other scientifically but my personal belief is that flushing does help with the color of your ash and it helps make your smoke smoother and more enjoyable so here on day 45 what i consider the beginning of my flush cycle is when i switch my res to plane water so i'm on drippers here i have a reservoir that these come out of and generally for the most for the majority of the cycle were somewhere around the 2.0 1.9 to 2.0 ec on day 45 which is about three weeks before i plan to harvest most of these plants i switched it to plain water no nutrients i used the water from my dehu so it is distilled or sort of close to ro water but you can do this with tap water it's totally fine and i just let that plain water water my plants for the first week and that's going to help bring down those nutrients i happen to have done a number of maintenance flushes in this run so i do know that my soil is somewhere around that 2.0 to 2.5 ec and so i think about a week of plain water should bring that down below that 2.0 mark so that's your first week or what i consider the first week of the flush period after that uh once we get to two weeks prior to our harvest we are actually going to flush do a physical flush pouring lots of water through the medium to get that soil ec down to about a thousand or below and that's really going to help those plants flush out if you have any questions about flushing about this sort of pre-flush period anything like that definitely drop those down in the comments and i'll make sure to answer those there or in a future video uh so that's uh pretty much our update for day 45 but before we sign off today i do want to remind everybody that we are still doing our 1000 subscriber giveaway we're somewhere around 930 or 940 subs at this point so 50 60 70 more subs and we'll be at that 1000 sub mark so if you want to join that uh 1000 subscriber giveaway all you need

"jbn9-JQgw28": "[Music] what we have here is a sample of what we would get out of a supercritical run pressures of about 1,800 psi you can tell the consistency is a little syrupy kind of thick so harden up a little bit if you've got it in a fridge but what we're going to do now is go through the process of taking the plant waxes and fats out of this and come up with a sample that looks like this and this sample is good enough to pull up into a syringe and load it up into a vape pen we'll start the process here we'll go through the steps and see what it takes so first what I've got here I'm warming up some alcohol this is 200 proof pure alcohol we find it's a little easier to mix these two together when the alcohol is warm got a hot plate you can put it on a hot plate and use that as well just for convenience I have this sitting here so this is what we did I'm dry off the bottom we're going to take this over to the scale we're going to weigh it with this sample and what I found is about a ten to one ratio is what's been working well you know ratios you could use but ten to one seems to work really well for us so what I've got here is about 800 milliliters so that means I'd use about 80 grams of extract here so we'll stare that out zero the scale and we will dump in about 80 grams of this all right close enough and now what you want to do is make sure that you've got this sample stirred together as well as you can there's methods for doing this as well just for our sake right now I'm just going to stir it up it's the same stick here that I've put it in with but you want to get a blend here you want to get this whole thing blend together so you don't see a mix here at all they self they actually sell plates you can stick this on that will warm this up with stir sticks on them as well so that you can sit there and have it automated and stirring a product for you but you definitely want to get a good mix on that so you don't have any any clumps or anything like that I can see clumps on the bottom so make sure you get all that off mix all that together as well as you can okay well after we've gone through that process what we're ready to do is I like to throw a glove over the top of that just to keep any contaminants or anything from getting into that and at that point we're ready to put that into the freezer take a look at the sample that we've had in the freezer now we recommend 24 to 48 hours is a good time for for the separation to happen so let's check the freezer its head to the funnel we've got the funnel in the freezer as well the main reason we do that we don't want to shock the sample with heat or with a vast difference in heat so if we freeze the funnel we get that closer to the temperature we're able to preserve some of the oils that might otherwise get damaged with heat let's grab the funnel and the filter now with this process you're going to need a little rubber stopper here that actually just is like a spacer between here and here which creates a seal because we want to hook up a vacuum line into a vacuum pump I'm going to have that in there with a good tight seal and then I'm going to lay my filter in all right back to that and we've got a little spray nozzle this is a spray nozzle alcohol I will take this and I'll pre soaked this filter just to make sure we get a good seal with the bottom of the funnel you see the bottom of the funnel has holes in it and when we turn on the back you're going to see that suck that paper right down to the bottom of that funnel and that's what we want that way we keep the edges filled so we don't get any of that oil to go past or 100 needs of our filter and back down into our sample once we have our sample ready and we're pre soaked here we've got a seal just start slowly slide that to the top of the filter and you'll start to see it come through first they're poor in the church with his blow pressure then they're taking that out and putting that in the oven and be carving it bring that back in the system is running it at higher pressures you can get everything else flood and then reintroducing it sir boil to the other one so that's for the guys who are hardcore enthusiasts you want the cannabis Terps reintroduce back into you can see what's happening here see the difference here yeah got some liquid here on this side saying salad but here I mean look at all that guys save this and it'll still have a small trace amount of THC in it and they'll take you to make that into lotions or so it's gonna end of my sliced ice cream right looks like though they don't seem what's good left until it's light job scope and with this process and actually refrozen of sample this is you can do this and they save up to three times probably I saw that on your video yeah like two or three times yeah if you wanted to get it receive a lot of very small a lot of times via satellite that rolled and I ran through this yesterday the same process I took this yesterday and I want to see what's going like that it came out real nice and clear see the floating same man so even when it came out real clear looked fantastic and I thought you know there can't be anything left in there sucking in freezer again overnight and there still is so it's really funny I feel like if I ran through that process one more time to go shut down pull the back in and there you can see don't come any to check always what okay so that's what we've separated there with that process okay from there we are going to take it to the rotovap data is really important so you guys are going to do trial and error so the only way you're gonna be able to figure out where you stand is by collecting data yeah right so I'll show you an example of a worksheet that I have that I use of the information that I'm collecting I'm practically and you guys can figure out what works best for you but we found that you know collecting all the data you can just helps give you a baseline and to improve your product and repeatability is such a big thing you want to be able to repeat the same quality of last year this is a two liter flask and it's a standard ground glass joint so you guys wanted fish them last way or anything okay fine tip it down alright and you you want to explain the advantage of this oh sure well we'll see what we're when we're pulling it out depending on the viscosity of the oil when you're finished it can sometimes be very thick yeah and and then it's difficult to get it out of the area what we've done before I'm seeing people do is put the bottle upside down and let it drain we've seen people use a heat gun put it in an oven you know kind of warm up the oil and get it rating that we were doing it the top after we took it off the root of that so it actually flowed out pretty well what this bottle does is it has an adapter piece this isn't f1 it just gives you a wider mount so just easier to get a tool in or anything if you are doing anything nice we'll see getting it out you know these are the standard bottles like I said getting it before out of here if you all becomes very thick this is difficult and you may have to add you know something using the heat gun you don't want to do too much you have a hot spot designing the oil industry yeah so you know you're gentle but at the same time you want the stuff and back into like a hot water bath you could just a warm it up people to get that gentle warming and then put it upside down we just we took it off the rotovap it was still warm and we put it upside down and it was able to flow out okay you know but I'm using it practice it is when you start right yeah yeah it makes it easier use it and really if you're learning from multiple samples of the same things don't worry about getting every last drop out of it it's when you go transferring between different strains something like that yeah you know you're going to have to clean that out even in that case you're not going to necessarily lose at all because you can wash it with alcohol and then have an alcohol flask let's just say let's go between down now that I hear that good so we're going to take this sample though we use a little photo here industries you could use a bigger one if you like I'm singing a Phillies big moment that that whole combo I think Nick was talking about is on the website the combo includes the funnel and this flat for 550 I think Oh to that angle yeah yeah all right the winner will go to the rotovap and this is really easy setup here good thing see how that threads in and out Josh so we're going to bring it out here a little bit got this lip on here it's going to go underneath this clip right here and take it here see it just clipped so what I'll do is I'll start to thread it up a little bit till it gets closer where it won't fall back down just kind of hold it up in place felt like that when we turn the vacuum on the vacuum you don't want to tighten it too much I've too much data and that lip on that is kind of rounded so if you did it was kind of it might have sexy to pop over this know what I mean uh-huh so you just get up there snug like I said when we turn the vacuum on vacuums going to help hold that on there you know so flashings in place now I'll go through this real quick here it's pretty simple easy up and down buttons are up and down up and down for good gonna hit the head ultimatum gotcha okay if I want to say I've got this shows your bottom and solid stop for your bottom basically we're going to come down yeah so it came down and stopped at five point nine okay and you can adjust that just hold this button to set that and then that says here right there kind of like what not good that was probably at the right depth right there to you when you say tool and what I did is I change I changed my zero day the heart stops at zero to say zero yeah yeah so then you can walk around the mic dial dial until the point and if you put it in five point nine then press and hold it then it'll say five nine there that's the new zero well then it will know that and that way you just can't bottom it out you try to hit the bottom of the yes okay so that's up-and-down for that temperature set is right here you have switched up here and now I'm controlling temperature here what yeah I we started it yesterday at sixty see guy Celsius yes and so once we get that set to where we want it and click this button right here that's on and off for the bass there I think Roland just turned it on because I just shut it off so what's happening with this blanking right here to show you that the bat is warming thank you yeah and once it gets to the temperature 60 it stays it okay I said a sample that we came up with her yesterday all those and alcohol says stop condensing then this is a simple and that's when you said you took it and that's about the consistency we're gonna get that okay great and stuff we got with a lot of very hot if that were true sorry this shirt give me that so we started with a message right cool Oh dance hall said yeah that's right there is definitely a nice consistency and quality for putting it so they as realize exactly that's what wind up with this this KNF unit is a fantastic city was great yeah a little bit okay right then I just have one more question for okay just because we're using a different machine you know for ours when you take this and you take this and you hook it up the way that he did on the end of there mm-hm then what would I write there yeah you can have a disconnect at or this is just a hole for us I'll do it I'm just gonna break vacuum on this with this is just the boss I mean so you can disconnect this if you wanted to put you know a key in line if you were going to be doing it on a regular basis you know we didn't want to have to keep pulling this off oh I can say I know a piece of - even though I'm able to - sighs but that's all we've done then I just you know so now there's no vacuum on this you see the get alcohol ooh got yet no nothing so when we do that then we just turn this on 100 I'm hydrated for vacuum for vacuum filtration and the concern is what we're talking about before you don't necessarily want to pull as strong a vacuum as you can because you'll start to pull down you can rip the paper or start to tear those sounds and things down through the paper and then you're gonna have to do it you know another filtration and seventy-five to a hundred it's a little bit of a general you know you don't our machine 75 to 100 okay you don't need to pull all the way down to a you know a descending vacuum for filtration you you just want a vacuum assist just help me counselor how we looking Roland getting down then let me get to either will it stops dripping you know right now pretty much got yeah and that's the question to its you know you're saying it's much thicker so the question is how much alcohol you want to take out do you need to remove all of it well for face you think yes and that's a question what you're doing you know what you're going to do with this afterwards yeah put edibles we'll just take it straight out of the first one take all the wax out right if you don't have to do those steps you know I don't know that's awfully push it is easier to work so Nick this morning that a lot of guys can take our customers have been taking some of this extract straight out of the cup and then just mixing that diluting that and there's solutions out there PPG are probably propylene glycol isn't like that they using e-cigs right but and then this coconut oil a more natural approach right so the guys can take that right out of cup and mix that with that consistency that's good enough to go into a pen right so a lot of guys are doing that just like that the problem becomes you're cutting the concentration of your extract so right you're you got the plants and are the the fats and waxes mixed in with that too which will cause some issues in a bait pen right yeah so you're cutting concentration risks you're not so and then also they introduce terpenes from other plants you know terpenes are common throughout the plant families after you have like say this right here would be fantastic because this is just your straight oil we haven't cut this with anything right - alcohol I see how that is turning the syrup and you can just kind of see the syrup in that normally the one that he gets moved after huh you can do that yeah you just unscrew this one we can I counted this it comes with both oh it does yeah come come both yeah so you'll have at least two flat all right this is Swiss made a mess German to release the back yep so over here about to hi Todd but not yes yeah it's been ticket row yeah okay push and hold that long I push the stop button first I hit I'm in just push and hold Vince out come in this and come back up yep there you go right you transfer it out of this would be a lot easier I like to wear the gloves it gets sticky your stuff is tough to get off your hands right you really only need to get real crazy with cleaning like that when you're going to change strange writing you running different materials and you want to make sure you don't have any cross-contamination then that's when you need a about cleaning right this is one and they've got they've got this too but they got the two liters right that's correct yeah so this is a three litre usually gonna be a bit smaller than this one it will still have to hang tight yes the opening here so you could definitely get in there with a better tool and get that clean down so much is good yeah exactly and again washing that off if you're going to change samples washing that off with alcohol real well and saving that alcohol and a flask that is just for that sample will be the way to do that and this fits right on - right this fits right onto here yeah it is funny so that's it okay same setup the only other thing I didn't really show you on this is a the ability to adjust see what this is doing is tilting the whole thing and so that's so you can figure out how to get the majority of this into the water right so for your flute sitting here you can adjust the angle great exactly just depends on what you've got in there so you got the ability to do that in the end okay I think you guys will have no issue with any of this equipment and this is probably more complicated than that so I don't think you'll have any issues with that you know as far as a cleaning process hey did I really just say that it's first cleanup or anything else on this maintenance wise do we have anything if they have to standard maintenance you know there is a two-week sit if every splashing there's a tube that runs through here and there is a seal in the top here we just take this office here that you know there's a problem with the seal it won't hold vacuum so see how this comes apart I'll do is if you could hold this so that way I don't have to take any of the coots or wives or or even the bottom off okay okay so that that's all together okay this comes off don't think your name to rubber seals holding that in place on inside there's a button underneath I'm sort of doing it okay okay cuz otherwise this your spins can't press the button underneath and then locking blue okay now this is a yo-yo Scotty so this is the part that will wear out over time but we shouldn't be talking about any time in the near future so now you know to me again but we have these available and I think they're about 60 bucks and then it clicks into place so where this could have lights in you I see that oh yeah yeah so that seems easy to take out and clean as well if you have to where you get the bump we're talking about is oil carryover then you can see how this comes before it yeah why would you have that much maintenance if you do it the right way you do it later yeah after cleaning itself yo this girl is actually on first yeah you kind of feel just by rocking that around where that needs to be all right that's it let's just for just four stakes here figure out what the dump the rest is in here and we'll go get an idea on how much of the alcohol we actually uncovered that's about where I started it is amazing when you watch that we just had this nasty concoction of stuff put together with this and we were able to make it look so clean right alright well what's happening is I mean alcohol is a different boiling point then then the other oils too so even water so I mean when you figure out what that temperature is with the vacuum it makes the process extremely you're going to leave that much in there but again gets you a little spray bottle with your alcohol and then just spray it down and then I like to just give it a shake shake everything up try and cook the whole inside of it and then just clean all that up and save all that into another flask lay down label it whatever if if you're not just dump it out reuse it just dump this out and just put any sample in here if you got the same sample there's not much worried to clean it like that well I think that about covers that you guys

for another concentrate review it's a little wake and bake session for me just got about a half hour ago got another hour before I got ahead into work so I figured I would shoot a quick video today we are checking out a shatter from a concentrate company that we have never had a look at before here on the show this is from incredible extracts this is their Black Label so it says incredibly grown so I'm guessing that means this is their in-house so kind of their top tier product I've heard a lot about Incredibles this is actually my first time trying their stuff and as I said the first time we've had it on the show this particular stuff I got here is some sour band onine sour band is a strain sour band is a strain that I have not seen too much recently but a few years back it was real popular especially the area I was out in Bay Area California there was two shops in particularly out there that I hit that they used to grow the sour band and made a lot of different products from it some really really good sour band full melt but Dan and I used to go to those two places and we would smoke all kinds of different sour band it's usually gonna be a Sour Diesel head band cross I'm not sure what the oh nine is on this one I'm sure there's a few different cuts of it so it's probably just alluding to which cut it is so again this is a sour band oh nine go ahead and get a dab heat it up here guys go back and watch something funny I remember me and Dan doing a really big one time the only the only video on the channel we ever did in an accent I mean we did this our heads full melt bubble hash in a British accent pretty sure that's episode I want to say either 17 or 19 of the actual CCC episodes if you're at all interested or bored you can go back and watch that rocking the Jamie glass client today nice little spinner should give me pretty good flavor you got all cleaned up first out of the day it's always a good one always my favorite day of the day this stuff has a real beautiful look to it it's gone the you know the brown parchment so it's kind of a little bit more difficult to get a true sense of the color I should have thrown it on some white before I did the close-ups but it definitely is a really really nice light color the consistency is what I would call pulling snap these close-ups I took outside it was probably a little bit warmer than room temperature not super hot but you can tell us a nice pull and snap now that I've got two here inside it's definitely a little bit more of a shatter but it does have some gift to it did a nice fat one for the first day of the day yeah when I was doing the close-ups I opened it up earlier and I was smelling it outside I guess that would have been yesterday when I got home from work and when I was doing that close-up sight I took a whiff of it and it smelled good but it wasn't really a strong smell probably because I was outside that wind blowing and everything but opening it and smelling it now it definitely has a pretty good nose on it for just some regular shatter and I don't believe yeah this isn't a why present this is just their Black Label which again is the in-house no Grunch adder going on a DAB here this sour band [Music] I love them I find just the right place to film the video where I got the light coming in from the right direction we're gonna blow a cloud out it just smokes you guys out like the cool super smooth I didn't get a whole ton of flavor off of that Deb it was definitely like a nice subtle kind of more of like a creamy flavor the flavor I got off that dab wouldn't remind me of a sour or a headband there's gonna be you know more of a usually more of a fuelie kind of a more skunky a little bit more and I know this is the sour headband cam Terps are pretty distinct for me on the palate I didn't quite get that with this one what we'll try to get a little bit different temp one thing I've been noticing lately is certain stuff tastes better on certain temps you know I will attempt it a lot and you know as you guys see on the show but I also like to take something a little bit higher everyone somehow and you really want a nice thick full hit I don't like you know how to have it you know a scorcher but a little bit a little bit hotter to have to give you a little bit thicker clouds sometimes it's nice but I've been noticing on some strains I got smoking this I think it was gg4 great bake makes the other day and for some reason whenever I took a hot bath but it tasted really good like usually above a certain attempt to flavor of the dad but for whatever reason with that stuff I took a couple regular dabs and then I took a couple hot ones on accident i really like powers for some reason maybe I'll going all the hotter on this one it's kind of cool I really like their packaging real clean packaging came to the full-size sticker on the inside so it's kind of cool good for branding and whatnot it actually has the test results all right here on the back so it shows you know THC THC a CVD CPGs DBA terpene content this one comes in at 5.4 1% terpenes so that's pretty good you know seventy four point seven seven percent THC zero percent CBD I wouldn't expect to find a whole lot of CBD and sour or a headband in variant that's no surprise there but and then it's got eco-lodge Salmonella mold yeah so it's got all the testing and everything all the ingredients and everything right on the back real nice clean packaging definitely definitely digging that right here in these black sleeves I'll tell you what though this child's sealed the top it's got a picture of some scissors it definitely requires some serious scissors I busted out some kitchen shears that are in pretty good shape real heavy duty ones and it's it was a [ __ ] for me to cut through this thing so definitely good childproof packaging no doubt about that staff probably ready for me over here [Music] yeah I don't think it worked on that one that's a stop now right there you have to go in for another one Incredibles I guess a first time I've actually tried their products first time we've had them on the show I've been hearing about them for a long time though pretty much ever since I moved out here to Colorado they they are really digging in the edible game they do all kinds of different edibles I'm pretty sure they've been doing that a lot longer than they've been you know producing the hash mass quantity but they also make their own clothes loop machine pretty sure it's called the incredibles machine so this is incredible extracts and then they've got Incredibles which is the edibles and then I believe the machine is called Incredibles machine or something like that but uh yeah definitely these guys are you know all over the place doing a lot of different [ __ ] so it's pretty cool yeah the stuff you know this looks real nice smells nice I'm gonna get another dab here to kind of get a real full picture of the flavor on this one definitely already feeling a buzz sight in here like I say they're my first abs of the day so that's usually when I feel the effects the most is right in the morning and this stuff is setting in real real nicely behind the eyes yeah it's just my whole body my whole upper body especially my shoulder just feel kind of loose and a little bit tingly right now so definitely liking the buzz from this stuff I haven't been smoking a lot of just regular shatters lately it's smoking a lot of rosin and a lot of life present mainly but definitely you know pleased with this one decided to take a trip back to shatter Lin and do a video on some chatter because we hadn't done that in a while so I was definitely say I'm happy with this with this pick up the stuff quality final dab here [Music] got way more flavor on mountain you know - that's uh definitely still getting kind of like a creamy thing but there's a little bit of sour undertones in there too you just kind of get that diesel e finished where the first one I kind of just taste it a little bit of sweetness initially and then it went away that one I can still taste it just settle right on the palate so but yeah this shit's are definitely definitely some fire incredibles extracts pick this up grow life Colorado Springs and the other than that thank you guys for joining me for another episode of the CCC I'm Shane [Music]",

doing a review on a select co2 oil cartridge the strain is cinex which i believe is a cross between cindy 99 and pineapple express so um i grabbed this one because this one looks really really nice you've seen it you can check my other videos if not but um check out the other co2 oil carts from them and they look like some standard co2 oil like fairly dark oil this one looks incredible same price same like batch as all the other co2 oils but it looked great so let me turn the camera around and show you then i'll take a couple puffs [Music] hmm [Applause] [Music] hey [Music] wow [Music] alrighty so let's get into this um first off i'll correct myself by saying it is actually a cross between cindy 99 or cinderella 99 and vortex i had not heard of vortex prior to this but seems like a good strain um very interested after just reading a quick leafly article about this strain seems like it's heavy on um less on the mirror scene in the cardiophiline which i get bored of seems like it's heavy on pinene and limonene potentially which i really like so first off trying to make more videos but struggling to find the time and motivation and also more so just not get greedy because i recently just bought like a gram of six star hash rosin that i was wanting to make a video on but i just got into it way too quick and didn't even take a picture prior to me opening it so i feel like that's not the best way to make a video so i'll buy another gram eventually and get a video on it and it was super great um but first let's start with what we have here cine cynix um so let's see it first off amazing for their co2 oil you normally don't get anything besides like that dark black oil basically which i'm not against for the price that it goes at it's pretty good stuff wow that's one of the best cards i've had in a good while um definitely has like a little base layer i always notice a heavier notes first a little bit of like that peppery taste but it is strong with the definitely taste a good bit of pinene in there and then maybe some like lemonade as well lemony is always light to me so if there's a lot i couldn't tell anyways that really really evens it out it's not it's always like such a standard boilerplate co2 oil taste which is a lot like whiskey or like there's usually a lot of humiliating in there this one it's got i mean it's got the slightest bit of that taste to it but it has so many other like terpenes going on that it overpowers that easily and that it's good it's uh it's very citrusy but it's like a heavy citrus it reminds me of grape with but it doesn't it's not like grape flavor it just reminds me of grapes grapes like a heavy fruity taste to me it's like um orange and mango is kind of mixed with like a peppery peppery main taste yeah so that's all i got on this one really but i mean that is a solid cart right there for their select co2 line highly highly um hats off to them because that's really really well done so thanks for watching i'm going to try and get more videos out especially some new brands not just the same old stuff but unfortunately there's not many new brands to work with so yeah i'll see what i can do but thanks for watching and grab one of these check it through the window of the cart first but even the dark ones look are pretty decent in my opinion but i mean if you see one like this go for it alright thanks for watching you'll have a great", "M491LHuF53Q": "all right although we're doing seven grams gorilla guchigi number four and the nuts master XP we're gonna use to set a gram and I'm

made for educational purposes by adult medical marijuana patients in California if you are under age of this somewhere where medical marijuana and/or marijuana are illegal do not try this at home sup guys chefs here a chef's calm put together another concentrate review for you I'm looking at some killer concentrates nug run lazy OG shatter lazy is going to be a good hybrid I'm guessing probably 60% indica 40% sativa depending on how much food I have on my in my stomach it hits me either way if I have an empty stomach its first thing in the morning and I haven't eaten breakfast or anything like that and I take a big fat gap with a lazy eye hypnotic a sativa a very energetic very talkative dry mouth right away if I eat a big meal like if I have a huge dinner and then dab some lazy right after dinner it's a completely opposite effect the way it hits me is more lethargic more relaxing more completely indica like my head would get very very numb and relaxed my body gets really relaxed my eyes get real heavy and red right away so for me it's a true hybrid that hits me either way just kind of you know depending on what I have in my belly as far as looks go it doesn't get much better I mean it's crystal clear yellow gold very very pliable very workable - some people would call this a SAP instead of a shatter but it's definitely a shadow I've had this piece you know maybe to my fingers here so it's a little bit warm but even with its warmth it pulls right apart like that as you can see the smell it is pretty unique - lazy it's very spicy I'm picking up a little super Silver Haze in there it's really nice the taste with a the the smell comes through into taste a lot of times that's not the case but with the Lazy what you smell is what you get a nice clean piece with some cold water and the flavor is unbeatable an average sized dab is all you need with the Lazy I'm not really feeling the need to take big giant globs in order to get nice and high the the THC level is high enough that just you know an average-size the app puts you right where you need to be let's get right into this Cheers [Applause] then they'll just ate up that Deb completely desire vaporize in a half a second real clean flavor a little bit of maltiness a little bit of sweetness that I wasn't expecting but real spicy like I said the smell if you like the smell you're really gonna like the flavor they were very similar but when I exhale the inhale it's real spicy but when I exhale I get this a little bit of like a vanilla like a malty flavor almost no complaints at all real nice I've been munching on my bag of cookies here as you can see I'll talk about this later so I've got a pretty good amount of food in my stomach and the amount by the immediate feeling is just relaxation my eyes get a little bit heavier I can feel my back you know they let the aches and pains I normally have in my back slowly they'll start to get a little bit that they'll start to reduce a little bit here and there but for the most part the thing I like most about it is the immediate hit I mean as soon as you exhale you know you just took a really good dad I just realized what time it is I have a meeting I have to head out for so I want to wrap this up if you enjoyed this video click the thumbs up and like it make sure you subscribe to my channel I am chubs as Jeff's calm peace", "CzCxTSOSEms": "hey guys it's Keith here today we have some $100 an ounce diesel now this stuff just totally blew me away when we walked into the greenhouse and this did come from course greenhouse dispensary in Colorado Springs they have some unbelievable $100 an ounce strains that I mean usually you just got so much character and smell and look in these buds this diesel smells delicious hmm I mean it is so pungent it is so is so oh man it is just it is one your strong smell to it yeah they're spectacular you can tell that there be buds but they are some of the best be buds that I have ever come across and they're good structure and solid nugs but it was that fragrance it blew me away no green to it at all just good hint of even a sour to it yeah sweet earthy piney fruity the whole ball of wax and it was unbelievable yeah that is just so crazy like you would really expect this to be so much more expensive some dispensaries could easily charge much much more for this you know but you know like say it is it is be buds it's not your top-shelf buds and it's gonna be a little more steamy have some seeds in it and all that stuff but you know for a hundred bucks only else you just about really cannot beat that when you shop around you will find a lot of good deal else's but not very often do they have the pungency that this diesel had and really all of their hundred-dollar houses are that way they had some great strains in there some hundred dollar an ounce Maui Wowi strand a deep herbs wanna know your if you've got seeds in here too you could just save those and plant them I would love to have some seeds out of a string like this days oh yes absolutely and will definitely will definitely get to grow some of this we did get a few seeds with this so and the stems are not that bad no they're not they're yeah your worst case scenario is some of your more scraggly stems and the buds are a little smaller it's a little dry you've got some little you know pieces like this going on but really overall this is top notch I would I'm surprised this wasn't much more so really a great plus for the greenhouse a big thumbs up on there the quality of their hundred-dollar Alice's are just great for sure though try some yes I'm gonna choose one of these new dark nugs oh yeah like see here's the seed right here is it but the good thing is these are perfect seeds yeah seeds are perfect for planting yes and we're gonna plant them fully mature ready to go great useful beautiful there's a seed right there so we'll save that yeah I cannot wait to get this in the ground make it out way to start hmm start our grow room series you know when you pull the nug apart you can really get a burst of those piney fruity fragrances very surprisingly pungent for the price and the diesel is closer to the stem and fragrance then to the outer side of the bud you smell that diesel and you get oh yeah then diesel is strong next to that Steve is there really good I am well pleased with this with this with this choice yeah we will most certainly be going back to the greenhouse yes we will and here's two more seeds whole garden of diesel mm-hmm it's good size snug right there mm-hmm several good size snugs in here yeah very good looking nice and good full dance walnut yeah very plump little legs so I've got a boat loaded I've mentioned you have also seen some perps going on here so I can't wait to get a taste I'm definitely seeing some / yes it was fired up smooth as a cloud nice white ash in the bowl so it's been flushed good it's got a great cure on it - can't complain about that one - smooth man thanks is so premium own taste I am shocked that this was not on a higher shelf it has to be because of the sheets the seeds yeah the Texas the cream I actually think the taste is is more flavorful than some of the more expensive strains that we've had oh absolutely oh good more the earthy piney and woodsy tastes yeah I'm definitely getting the fruity pine and and a lot of the earthy sweet and spicy just about the things you would expect diesel to be by going on they're very good this diesel is gonna be a sativa - so those sativa characteristics are definitely starting to come about and that has just got one of the most pleasant dankey diesel II after tastes on some of these hips it really looks nice yeah if it wasn't from the seeds I don't see why this stuff wouldn't be 160 170 dollars oh yeah for sure it's got a very pleasant aftertaste and it lingers for quite a while it does mr. really this is the best of both worlds you got delicious smoked great cure flushed very well and on top of that you're paying about $70 less for the ounce and you have a ton of seeds to add to your garden perfect seats not any of them crazy immature Steve's or mutated seeds but these are ready to go in the ground perfect mature seeds they're they're dead leave ready for planting and we're going to find out here soon oh yeah we're gonna get some of these in the ground ASAP we've got a little indicating our grow room already some of the other seeds we planted didn't sprout but we weren't sure they were mature anyway but these seeds are we're really excited to have them and we can't wait to show you our little indica and these new sprouts perhaps good least that one is it's getting big really good that your way to bring it update yeah this stuff does appear to be flushed well I've burned a little bit over here in the corner and there is a gray ash there yeah I really like this diesel very impressed and see I prefer a little bit milder strain sometimes anyway like the bee buds of a great strain because that way you can just smoke a little through the day and still carry on and function you know late at night you might really want to put a buzz on and get you some high THC buds going on maybe a little pass or something but a string like this through the day that tastes this great and has a buzz that's not just crippling to you or debilitating it just makes your day that much more pleasant yeah for sure for sure and this also is not so expensive that you find yourself hacking and coughing all the time and a lot of times the top-shelf strains will just have you on your side coughing but they're so good but this stuff is really good it's got the seeds but it's got all the rest - so very flavorful yeah right oh yeah very nice very uplifting very creative hi definitely definitely impressed with this one here as far as a rating probably to go with an 8 on this one you know the seeds and the stems will take it down a little bit you know but the price bumps it back up so you know at least in a you know tempted to go with an 8 and a half but there are you know it is heavy seeds there's a lot of seeds in here so that's gonna be good for our garden but it is more tedious when you're wanting to roll some or smoke a ball you got to get them seeds out and you're going to have your bowl pop it in your face and those horrible smell of a bird seed so you know a little extra work but it's still gonna get to eight because it has just been done very well yeah I think I agree with you on all those facts we could lose some of that there and everything and the seed part but the hi was good and everything so I think I think it's worthy of innate you know and for me I'm a little bit torn because for what it is I would like to also give it a high score but comparatively speaking for the a buds I would have to give it a low score so what I'm going to do is just give it a score for what it is and I will give it a 7.5 because of the seeds however I myself wanting the seeds I consider that a blessing but in all actuality seeds are not desired but the taste and structure and buzz totally make up and the price totally make up for the seeds so on that I would go ahead and give it a 7.5 that would be my writing for it sounds fair so yeah definitely good so be sure if you live anywhere near the greenhouse or even if you don't if you out drive 40 miles you know sometimes you got to do it because it's worth it hundred dollar Allan's totally worth it to pick up and look over all their strange steps very helpful so they'll let you check them out smell them see what you like you know so definitely don't be afraid to ask because they don't mind helping you stamp those out some very knowledgeable yes very good staff definitely very pleased with the staff they were very great so I guess that's going to do it on this one guys so definitely be sure to like and subscribe and comment and share and all that good stuff and we'll catch you on the next one I'm Keith I'm hey I'm Calista", "RXwSjiP-j9U": "today we are gonna be doing a review of the legendary Sauer D now before we get into this the

Haze and Sour Diesel super Sour Diesel knocks out stress and pain while fostering creativity and euphoria super Sour Diesel energizes making it great for daytime use new uses however should be cautious when trying this strange super sour diesel produces strong cerebral effects which may be overpowering to the novice okay I'm not a novice let's get in here you guys and even though it's in the bag you guys this is dispensary grade I just got a little bit for my people last night and yeah they opened up the door and he smells came rushing out it was so beautiful this you guys is super Sour Diesel yes I'm sorry I was sitting on a little bit so that butt is kind of flat yes sir you guys the whole room is just built it doesn't it doesn't really smell like a Sour Diesel what I smell really is Silver Haze let's open it up and see what's happening now smell the slight Sour Diesel when I busted the butt open slight Sour Diesel and a lot of silver haze so let's get up in here let's see we get um hey I hope you guys slept like kings and queens cuz me personally y'all always know how sleep like a king one thing that's been bothering me guys while I clean is balled out cuz I had a discussion with somebody about about slavery and they were telling me that you know black people owned slaves too and you know the whole time that I was growing up they never said anything about black people on the slaves the reason why they never said anything about black people enslave is because black people never owned slaves you guys please stop trying to make this a point in history because it never happened listen you guys remember how white people how they tell you how white people looked at slaves back in the day they look they're slaves like we were farm equipment like we was farm tools black people wasn't [ __ ] - white people back in slavery days we was like less than dogs they would treat their dogs better than they treated black people so how do you think that a black man can walk up to this white dude and go hey sir I have this black man I want to sell you they would probably take us both it just doesn't make sense for if I see how how white people treat him treated my brothers and sisters you know this is way back then you know I'm not talking about now even though we're being killed now but if I seen the way white people treated black people way back in the day why wouldn't I as a black man want to sell another black man into this you guys it makes it sound like we're so stupid that we're ignorant enough to have our own people as our own slaves this is a point in history that that the powers that be are trying to clean up their third history their past they're trying to clean up their past to make it look like they wasn't the only ones that owned slaves they probably wasn't the only ones that owned slaves but I can guarantee you one thing black people never owned slaves never they never started bringing that up into light the last couple years the whole time I was going to school nobody ever said anything about black people owning slaves why they never said anything because it never [ __ ] happened anyway you guys we're getting into this super Sour Diesel as I'm busting it open this this just wafting into its wafting into my nostrils oh I love it love it dude he let go we got the ball Pat we got the ice in the ball let go is that like a good old toenail pitch right there only if smoke was coming on the bone sorry oh it started how real smooth like it wasn't gonna do nothing whoo then it expanded in my lungs and really what I taste

that was really tasty and I'm starting to feel a high but it feels like it's coming from the backlight like I can feel it coming towards my eyes I feel it coming all through my body but I feel it

to turn Fame because that's all y'all here today maybe tomorrow put a fan at the door sorry y'all and have you blown cool areas anyway I'm gonna scale of one to ten one being that [ __ ] Tim being that most awesome [ __ ] we're gonna give the flavor critique of super Sour Diesel we're gonna give it a nine because it is a really beautiful flavor these are flavors that my mind can comprehend because I've had both of them separately before so most of the exotics that I had or the hybrids my mind can't really comprehend because maybe one of the pair I haven't had before so I don't understand the flavor but I understand the flavor of this and I have to give it a 9 it's a really good sweet soured easily flavor you guys know how I feel about Sour Diesel I'm not too fond of super sour or super Silver Haze but I haven't had it a lot I've had it a few times and I've had I think dispensary great but um anyway yeah I definitely give it a 9 um yeah yeah definitely definitely a 9 definitely yes definitely a nine-member y'all remember Rain Man it's a 9 definitely not it might new before y'all talking I was an old-ass movie the movie came out around scar-faced ha in it that is really delicious and now getting on my own nerves with the coffee because I want to get I want to taste it more you know I don't want to [ __ ] call all the table carpet is just to get me to that elevation you know I'm saying that's why I don't mind it I don't say I'm not intentionally coughing but I don't mind coughing because it gives me to that point whenever I smoke a J and I'm not coughing of course I get high man but I don't get that in chicks all right you know that monster ha you know what I'm saying but when I'm coughing and I'm coughing like profusely like the way that a bum man shook off you know this is I believe the second most potent way it may be the third I think this is the third most potent way to get high off cannabis um edibles being the first vaporize to be in a second bong being a third I believe Blunt is fourth and I believe that joint is first or the least it's not really first it's the least the joint gets you the least highest out of all those it goes joint blunt a-bomb vaporizer and then edibles edibles are always at the top because um if you can OD on on cannabis the only way to OD on cannabis is through animals because if you OD on on smoking weed I think you probably have to smoke something like I forgot what they said like 4000 pounds or a thousand pounds in an hour or or thousand pounds and ten minutes it was something impossible something stupid that's the only way to OD but the only way to really OD of cannabis is through edibles and what the [ __ ] is the OD you passing out that's all it is it's not like an OD like on [ __ ] heroin where you actually have to do something let's get your ass to the hospital if you don't shut up so here when they get you oh dear oh let's get your ass to the hospital if you don't smoke too much cracks that you [ __ ] you you oh dude I'm smoking crack let's get your ass to the hospital if you ate too many edibles and your mother [ __ ] asked them I'm passed out an OD don't edibles let's get your ass to the bed [ __ ] night-night [ __ ] go night-night I'll holler at you and then probably in the morning or the next day y'all see them saying the other day so nobody minds odn on cannabis okay I don't even feel like I was getting any smoke do we end of it okay thank you very much I am I feel like I'm at a level time I don't like level toys thank you very much okay bacon a little piece net get that on the bone for the - cheek of this Jake right here okay I feel a high creepin in it a little bit more I hate breaking blood open like this or breaking down like this because it takes some of the trichomes off of it that's why it's bad to grind your weed because if you grind wheat you know how many times those little pins are hitting your weed each time to imagine your finger hitting that but a thousand times that's how many times those little pins are hitting that we did she break it up now matter although strike homes are going if you have the right grinder the trichomes the keith is going to the bottom of that grinder but if you bring them with your fingers you're wasting most of it that's why I'm trying to break it open as little as I can if I'm rolling a blunt you know just bring it up a little bit and let it go you don't sit there and like pick each [ __ ] hair off the buds you know I'm saying like you got some tweezers and [ __ ] you don't do that just trying to pass one little info to y'all if you don't mind uh-huh yeah you know I got to tell you guys I think I got the most awesome channel the reason why I say that because all the people that all the youtubers I seen they talk about haters that they don't had I told you guys before so far I've only had two haters and one of us one of them I converted into a subscriber thank you for subscribing bro um you know the way I feel about a hater man is if if I'm saying something you don't like then there's no need to write a book or a paragraph about it just move on to the next the next youtuber you know I'm saying the next video that you want to watch maybe all my videos aren't good I'm hoping to please everyone and make everyone happy because I want everybody to subscribe to the channel right now I'm at 49% out of 100 people that are viewing our subscribers which is actually beautiful but I want to get it a little higher maybe 75 to 80% we need to get these subscribers up to God so I can start doing these giveaways oh I don't know what I'm gonna start giving we're really don't but I feel like it should be we oriented but if it's we oriented I may have to deliver it personally it won't be we because I'm gonna do that if it is we hey that might be a good thing to you tell me where you're located at and I call your local dispensary father's credit at the dispensary or something that might be a good giveaway to 10 one being a [ __ ] Tim being a good stop of the high pratik of this super Sour Diesel we're also to give this the same thing as the flavor of God we're gonna give it a 9 I don't know if it's a highlight or a loan on it's probably more than on the lower level I really want to give it an 8 for the hide I really want to give it an 8 for the flavor but it keeps creeping and creeping in Cleveland that flavors in the back of my throat I feel a slight burden on the middle part back of my throat where I recommends to my friends abso-fucking-lutely if you guys get a chance to run into this fence regrade super Sour Diesel grab that [ __ ] roll that [ __ ] like that [ __ ] and smoke that [ __ ] dad what'd y'all do I'm taking another row I think you

seed stock that I am selling on the website I grew these a couple years ago and this garden that I'm about to show you is it was just all tilled up topsoil like we went over somebody's yard and just tilt it up you put in a very minimal compost and the garden did great so check it out so right now right now we are 65 days from germination meaning 65 days ago we put the seeds in the ground so not too bad for being only at 2 months old from seed so all these yellowing plants right here didn't get a lot of compost mixed into the ground whereas you come back here and you just kind of see that bigger greener fuller plants those ones had a lot of compost actually rototilled into the ground well actually not even a lot just a little bit and these ones Hart didn't really get any compost child into the ground it was really just plain water and full plant juices and compost teas for watering this these ones right here had a little bit of soil amendments mainly just compost and some perlite in the ground and they were also watered with full plant juices and compost teas so not bad for 65 days looks like my flash is on and do redo this part pretty epic garden for you know just a little backyard crop don't miss out on these it's only 70 days from seed to harvest I'm planning all of them so if you don't get in on it you're gonna have to wait till this fall to get some pretty much

patients do not report negative side effects when using this strain and say it provides relaxation and focus diesel has lemon lime tastes it has 16 thc and less than 1 cbd with this 16 to 1 thc to cbd ratio it will produce euphuria but this may be less intense than strains with higher percentages of thc such as upwards of 20 or more thc patients say diesel is an excellent strain to treat social and general anxiety but it could certainly treat other conditions as well diesel would benefit anyone who needs energizing effects with body relaxation daytime relief of medical symptoms improved mood

your reeks of berries and that Sour Diesel smell is very prevalent in there just from the bag when you draw taupe if it's um it tastes like it's very strong very tasty now like a tart berry type dry token everybody and engulf your palate on your mouth and then once you fire it up it um it has that same berry taste but it's like a cranberry a very tart cranberry sight taste to me it's very sweet it's very clean burning like you know I mean it's not like is its strong but it's not going to have your coffin and all that kind of stuff but it's very strong cuz I got a lot of pretty colors in it blueberry is very prevalent in the the appearance of it you know what I do the purple hairs and every leaves and everything that's in the butt and it's a very good strand I would recommend it to anybody if you ever see it as an indica dominant strand the blueberries been living more dominant enough from the research that I've seen over the arm the Sour Diesel but it's good for pain anxiety

what's going on welcome back to another strain review today we're going to be reviewing Sour Diesel aka sour deep good this is an excellent sativa dominant strain named after is poachin diesel like aroma and it's thought to be a cross between gem dark and super skunk making it like a potent string this strain tested between 20 and 25 percent TAC and the planet self-taught it's a fairly lean and he tends to [ __ ] sale a lot when it's ready but you can he's thinking of the room is pungent fuel skunk sit his nugs good this train is really potent and it's very popular in United States because it's energized and positive high most people use this for depression or stress but it's also good for anxiety and pain relief as always we're gonna try it out off already clean Bow Wow when you grind it it the smell is overpowering his punch and it's really pungent like when I was breaking I was barely it smells good and it is a little strong but once you grind it it's really purging like I could smile I will be here like he suppose like I had a bunch or something is is really pungent Wow it smells so good has an earthy taste to it not too crazy about the taste let's see how he feels this year how long it takes to hit again I'm not too crazy about the taste we should try it out of a wrapper riser you guys not about price right I'll show you in a few yeah no not too crazy about the taste it has a bad aftertaste too once you boil the small the earthy taste comes in you blow it out and it just stays behind I don't like that earthy taste I think it was gonna taste a lot better yes it's more a little citrusy he's you know I wonder why it tastes like this this is brought out the volcano you guys already know this puppy right here it's turning around you know wait for that to hit that 445 we're gonna fill this up and then we gotta try it off the volcano let's see we didn't fill this one up right here and they're gonna see what it tastes like out of it you know what does everything tastes a lot better out of the volcano like it's completely two different flavors completely distinct flavors I will spoke down and then you give me this you tell me this is called some fake ass name and this is the real deal I believe you I believe these are two different strains because they taste completely different they even feel completely different going down there's no aftertaste it tastes a lot better I still don't taste the citrus that I smell earlier but it doesn't taste like Sour Diesel my point being it tastes like if I was smoking or out of these this little bait pants I ran out of this one but he says mood and he has a taste of one cartridge my body feels really relaxed but my mind won't stop thinking I thought it was gonna pull me at least as well but my mind will just won't stop thinking I can't stop thinking about these lines now but I'm like to relax to work on any design Hey it's not gotcha potato motifs you know I'll get up I'll do what I gotta do I don't feel like I gotta be stuck on the couch or anything like that but my body feels really relaxed and my body running my mind just I can't stop thinking my throat's a little harsh and I think that's from smoking it out of the oh it was harsh going in with a nice nasty aftertaste it's in about seven minutes and I'm stoned like don't I think it's because it's multiple and a full back from the volcano Lister you're another of those game yeah I mean it's so different my shoes which was another go to heart or my throat this is like the second or third strain that I have come across that is a little harsh in my throat all the restraints are pretty smooth mmm the vapor so far none of it has been harsh if you guys see the review of the volcano and my brother I guess the vapor is too much for him shall vapor could be harsh to some people but not to me the flavor is better after babe I'm just finishing this one so nice to stay there and the race I just gonna flirt on my baby another thing I don't like about it is I don't know if it's the strain or or what's going on but I can't stop thinking and it's not I'm not thinking about random thoughts I've just my toes are center focused on creation like I want to draw something I want to design something and I maybe throw a little bit of gaming in there but my point is that I can stop thinking about drawing or design so there's I guess it feels like somebody just went and hit a creative switch and now I can stop thinking about drawings and designs you know what that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna draw something for my deviantART page and play some games well guys if you guys liked the review let me know in the comments below don't forget to Like and subscribe for more reviews coming up and I talk to you guys to the next one peace [Music]", "Wxt5ag2k9ac": "[Music] the way whoa thanks for watching back here the strain of you and today I got some Sour Diesel Sour Diesel is also a well known strain in the cannabis industry crossed by a lot of other strains nowadays chem dogs already stuff like that and butts are looking frosty sugar see they could be a bit more compact [Music] with little BOTS so not too happy with that but yes our diesel has a mazing grapefruit taste smoked it before and when I saw it I just know I need to purchased it but when I smelled it I didn't notice the yeah the grapefruit fruit flavor that I noticed when I was smoking it before so yeah I'm very curious if fellow tastes that nice Sour Diesel taste so we'll check it out here I got the information from the website lifting Sour Diesel this is D fostering gentle astronaut and thank everyone smoking some of his sour D yeah roll of little joy god I mentioned I'm not happy with this smoked it before and Sour Diesel has this name because it has a very pungent diesel taste diesel because it has a bit of strange yeah diesel like bit grapefruit and I don't notice anything that and it wasn't one of the cheaper strains today I bought some amazing super Silver Haze that's about ten dollars and this was 1250 I mean I just I just feel ripped off and I wouldn't have something like this I mean when I saw it I it was it was okay but I mean you don't get a chance to inspect other butts and to be honest I don't want to smell all the butts when I buy them I just think they need to come with good quality today I also bought some bubbles and I'm not a bubble smoker but it had an amazing pungent mandarine taste or harder because yeah orange taste to it and I thought wow this bobo's I better could smoke that bubbles instead of the sour D it doesn't taste like sour D so yeah I'm not happy with that these strains are amazing and both were like 10 dollars a gram this is 1250 and it tastes like like crap to be honest I mean I'm happier I mean it is not it's not polluted or something but it doesn't taste like 1% or a birdie maybe I you make a mistake gave me some white widow or something but I'm not a fool I know what I taste and I what I see it doesn't look like a potent strain but sometimes I have smuggle offender before and doesn't look very potent but it was amazing when you smoke it so and sometimes but yeah don't talk too too fast you know but yeah at least you you the greenhouse to get in in India gave me these strains and they were perfect but yeah thanks for watching game people have a great day peace [Music]", "IAT95kn9T84": "[Music] Sour Diesel comes in around 21 22 percent THC on average it's a poly hybrid some of the stories a little unknown but we know that it's a Massachusetts Super Skunk - a Northern Lights 5 and then maybe two and ohok in CHEM a little unsure on that part what we have is a strain that finishes the end of October outside 77 days indoor Sour Diesel at least the cut that we run at the shop has a tremendous yield potential and so we're looking at anywhere up to 12 13 pounds in a three to four hundred gallon pot outside and 3.2 pounds under a de 1000 indoor thus our D is it's a foundation strain of modern cannabis it has a very rich fuel like flavor coupled up with a very nice citrus tone that clears it and gives it a very uplifting effect unbelievably popular with smokers and with growers it's a longer flowering strain and so you have to make sure you pay attention to that seventy seven days is a little while indoor and so you have to make sure that you get all your inputs planned so that you're able to know that it's not gonna finish in nine it's going to finish in eleven and so it's an important consideration so you can get all your nutrient timing in place Sour Diesel like most of the cushions is magnesium hungry and so I would say supplement with additional magnesium all through veg and into flour in terms of velocity it moves like I'm saying both the track star you see it and then it's going the east coast is the main market for this cultivar but well done Sour Diesel has basically an unlimited distribution [Music]", "QOZ_U8j1UYs": "[Music] hi my name is AJ I wouldn't say I'm the creator of Sour Diesel I am servant and keeper cannabis it comes in varieties or cultivars not strains strains are bacterias and funguses and things like that in 1992 I was working as an intern at wetlands which was a nightclub in New York City I met a guy there asked me if I would smoke some weed with him and was telling me oh I'm a grower he ran up to me it was like check this [ __ ] out that was the first time I'd ever seen chem 91 well the first time I ever tasted the the chem dog I just it almost tasted familiar to me and I just got this weird feeling and I was like we're gonna be friends we're gonna be together for a long time you know from the moment we met it was like going home for me some people feel that way when they start a relationship you know with with another person or with any but you know we were always on the prowl for like the best weed back then I mean it was never tough to get weed in New York it was tough to get good weed well people didn't understand is that we always had cheap weed in New York you know there was good weed around but it was hard to come by and it was very expensive but you had to be out there looking for it I mean that's why we hung out in Central Park we had to like constantly be on the prowl for a good weed kids today don't understand you know we were like facing like prison you know and there was such a negative stigma attached it's a cannabis back then it's not only with the cops you know love to come and find you but your landlord or anybody else might love to call the cops on you for doing it and police are cracking down on what they call quality of life crimes like traffic violations subway fare beating and public drunkenness and those small busts lead to bigger bust because what broken windows theory is all about I mean if some guy is urinating in public he's and if we got if we got a problem I think they were looking to arrest you for anything you know we were terrified to smoke weed outside so scary you know were scary times sometime I believe was in 93 I found a seed bag of diesel so we were now growing these new offspring of what was cam 91 and we were doing small things in the 90s because that's all we needed to do we thought they were huge at the time well [ __ ] ten lights of this rumor oh you [ __ ] dude you know like we just kicked it up to 20 you know like that was huge you know I was gonna call with this 20 we're gonna be in deep [ __ ] [ __ ] all right you know instantly it created mayhem I think people were you know begging me for diesel and you could never have enough diesel you know we used to call all we'd that was good diesel we just say that's diesel you know it was a huge pit bull we'd be like that pit bull is diesel this weed is diesel back then people were afraid that that we was sprayed with chemicals and you know kind blood was just coming on the scene in New York you know I remember the first time I actually like possessed like a quantity of it in my hands and looked at it and I said this is the diesel forget it like cam Dawg forget all that [ __ ] we're gonna call this the diesel what made it Sour Diesel is that it made everybody sour you know you could never have enough and people would become more and more bitter as time went on because you just you couldn't produce enough for everybody so now you had to pick and choose who were gonna give it to and that's what made you know the Sour Diesel sour it was just souring relationships all over the place you know first of all you have people in New York City that are not living in noir okay you know you have here you have grocery stores where you know they sell tomatoes for $20 there's boutique markets for fancy things in New York City you know I feel like I had the opportunity to focus on quality because if you have a product that's flawless in New York City you can get a fortune for it and I don't think that's the case in all places I don't know if that could have happened anywhere else quite the same people accepted the fact that that's what that's what the prices were and they were happy to pay them look up was that they were getting hem dog and Sour Diesel raised the bar and brought awareness to the public that you know that there is something better out there that's why I stuck my head out because it's time to like turn the world on it's a good week [Music] you", "AoBHCh5G2EU": "[Music] and this one is diesel diesel is a cross between according to you know who you listen to it's a it's a cross between bubba kush and Sour Diesel but some people say it's also a cross between Sour Diesel and purple fish so it just depends on like I said what source you're listening to there are also several strains of this around so if you're going into a dispensary chances are you may be able to find purple diesel and as always I am going to show you that's a nice size one in there so is this purple diesel it actually has a pretty high THC level and when I say pretty high standard testing I've seen anywhere from twenty one percent all the way up to twenty eight percent so as far as THC levels it's pretty hot so again this may not be one necessarily that a newbie should try straight off the bat if you do one you know just and then wait and see how how you do with it this isn't one that you want to finish a whole block if you're a newbie so if your new head oh and I'm sorry if you're an old head and you're used to this you've been doing this for a while you know what do I say toke up until you choke up okay so nice to deal with that it's very windy here so you may not mean I see anything so what else oh aroma aroma when they talk about aroma they're talking about of course how it smells and everybody says you know Diesel's sweet diesel smell earthy spicy pungent a great out here grape alot flavor profiles are about the same you're gonna see crepe you're gonna see a sweet diesel you'll see Sour Diesel when it comes to taste flavor your little woodsy that kind of thing me personally what I can say even though it has a very high THC level and I talked about this before it is more dank than candy land or Charlotte's Web that's my own opinion it's to me it's not overly strong though I don't know if I'm just kind of getting used to it but it's not overwhelmingly pungent or dank to me okay I definitely get the spicy and the earthy and I get the diesel I do get the diesel which is odd and it's not something that you know when you when you're eating desserts you're not gonna say only has a nice Diesel's flavor you know but it's just something we kind of forgive when we're doing this okay so we've gone over roma flavor medical benefits so a lot of people will say that you know this is really good for chronic aches and pain anxiety depression I've seen that it helps with various eating disorders headaches and migraines that type of thing I can personally say you know this was a good one for me oh this is also one that you would you say wake-and-bake this is you know a good waken Baken okay because this is one that you can do and you can go on with your day it's interesting to me because I think bubba kush was was an indica and then Sour Diesel is supposed to be a sativa so you have these two different you know types merging together but this one is supposed to be sativa dominant so like I said it's a good one for weigh in Bakke it's a good one if you want to infuse certain things to add to butter or oils or whatever so this is a good one where you can go out and still socialise with effects so usually for me I've always seen like this you know you have this sense of euphoria yeah I absolutely agree with that more focused more energized more energetic those ones I actually have to say I agree with one of the negative side effects was cottonmouth or dry mouth and I did not experience that but I do have experience with that and I can't say that it made it any any worse than it already is but it was not one that for me I had experienced trotting off with but I can say that it's a nice one sorry out not out per se but it only goes for a couple of minutes at a time but I can say that it was a nice one is it one that I would add to the rotation it's one that if I'm in more pain or I need a specific I need to fill a specific way and I would definitely use it I tend to go toward the more higher CBD and lower THC strains but when I do the reviews of course I can typically review things that or not what I normally do because I don't do them that often but if something like this is something that you want to try there are CBD products that you can add to the flower so always keep that in mind if it doesn't have a higher concentration of C being in it you can add to it okay so but anyway again this was purple diesel and it wasn't to date so it would be one that I would recommend if those are the things that you know the benefits that you're looking for if that's what you're interested in okay alright guys I will talk to you later [Music]", "61sk4goV5Pk": "[Music] guys hoping the CCC I'm Shane tow and we're doing a flower you for us it taken us murder yeah we we are looking at some strawberry diesel from I'm s oh yeah the real deal strawberry p4 you ever do in here before was it on here at okay so chance I know I can't remember we've reviewed strawberry diesel somewhere that's the point that time I know I got it did upload a video of some just some nut porn bloodshot so I got other stuff but I don't know if we've done a full review here on the CCC it's definitely an interesting strain and some that we go to a lot yeah it's definitely a really bomb strain it said it doesn't look actually this bastards lose no yeah every we got a half oh here and they're all huge whoa and then it's really really frosted nice weirdly like sometimes with the strawberry doesn't the best look yeah this is definitely a good batch but yeah that like toke was saying it has has a different look to it traditionally it's a it almost looks premature the way the hairs don't really never get that dark dark orange you know the trikes always stay pretty light and pretty clear concentrates many firm especially the oil use it turns out like yeah a good we should also mention that this is the real deal strawberry D that was from purple from back in the day it's just now Oh strawberries that I met down in nice you know say seeing growers and all that zinc same botanist just the real deal strawberries down there definitely an interesting strand like I said it's something that we both go to a lot of our local favorites it's a really really nice uplifting soaring sativa high that's not always easy to come by it's really really a little bit of did you see yes sir nice feeling super July Social Research one of my all-time favorite waking matrix yeah sure hitting the little dc-dc tubes here me too yes nice car Wow [ __ ] I have not smoked this in plataform that's a string LeGrande summer let refreshing on a flower set almost feels like like some crazy fella drink or something and become since your mouth watering anyway it's just a really nice nice feel on the palate to have a refreshing flavor of weed like this it's just different I think the flavor is the best part it's sweet and subtle at the same time and it's true I keep wanting to say refreshing so I bring that yeah we've we've had this discussion before and that's that's the words that probably comes up the most is refreshing the strains beer you're not gonna find a lot of other strains like this that have the smell and the flavor this particular batch the smell isn't the smell is what this train is supposed to smell like and it's a pretty strong yeah it's pretty trunk for for how strong usually smells this is one of those trains where the flavor is much stronger than you would expect for based on smelling it you know although this has got a really good cure a nice gummy nugs yeah but they did burn really really well in the bowl smokes yeah smokes perfect Utah whoever was growing this liked to smoke it too just because the flash job on it is supreme the flavor comes through amazing it's just I can't get enough this way somebody took their time go around here like this little tiny one I like it actually but it actually works pretty well as control this one kind of personally I enjoy there's no I'm not used to that there's no substitute for you know especially like you know just right in between two pieces of glass no this is a brand new herb our first should I've taken with this home thank you just hold it down a little extra long make sure he gets how was that a second girl insanely it's so smooth so tasty not a ton of expansion but there's something there just utterly refreshing like almost mouth-watering it's not something to give me cottonmouth what I feel like there's a really nice flavors left on the palate it's not crunchy or strong or upstanding at all it's not super loud flavor but it's really Pleasant like a little bigger bullet and I thought I did flavor is just as good with this right now [Music] this is a sweeter than I remember it Oh mom this is a really good batch it's not on meds right now they got this stuff all day I took their signature strain check it out this [ __ ] is fine if you're a sativa lover something just want to sum up all day if you need a break from some parkouring because a new flavor change or oh geez I get to cheat out of something like this gives me a nice break and it's just fresh it's fresh it's a heady smoke but it's not overpowering it still make you feel high although you're alert and active and productive which is sometimes hard to find in this drain it's not only things that I find really really good strong solid status like this yeah I'm gonna get this one nine out of ten yeah I gotta agree that's exactly I have to say yes I just throw my reading at Missy has to be mad at saying yeah it says just on point I'm not surprised that we're rating this you know pretty much the same based on most of the batches that I've tried this I mean you've also charted yeah I mean I've been smoking stuff for a while three years maybe like a long time since before I was going to humble stuff so I mean yeah the day and I still following where it went from Alameda at San Jose and I hate word to hear their delivery the club genetics hoping around a little bit but we kind of kept our own yeah yeah I always gotta keep an eye on this drive to my favorites - all right guys thank you for joining us for another strain of you CCC I'm Shannon I'm told", "OofUoCvbJ9c": "SAFETY PROTOCOLS WERE NOT IN PLACE WHEN THE EXPLOSION HAPPENED.

today we've got a little bit of drama alert going on I just want to be completely transparent with you people with you people I just want to be completely transparent with the community um some of you may have noticed a little bit of drama going on on on YouTube or sorry on Instagram I actually don't have that here I can actually put the picture up I'm gonna bring the picture up here I want to show you guys something about crop king seeds we're gonna have a little talk about crop king seeds today I'm gonna try my damndest not to actually no there we go disconnected even I don't know what is going on with my internet today I'm back I'm back I don't know what is going on that is really weird here we go let me let me bring up this company here I wanna burn them all right there we go okay so crop Kings seeds has started five new sorry for new companies to hide their well to hide their poor reputation crop Kings seeds has a pretty bad a pretty bad reputation I'm again I'm not gonna get into why that's up to you to decide I'm not trying to tell you to buy seeds or not to buy seeds I just want you guys to understand that there are multiple companies under the exact same roof so we're looking at beaver seeds which is new Sonoma seeds which I've grown Sunwest genetics which I've also grown blim Blum blimburn seeds I've never even heard of that but that's their them as well that's that new black company right there as well as crop King seeds all of these companies are the same company you need to understand that all of these seeds are coming from crop king and they are just different labels merely to deceive people into buying their seeds now again I'm not trying to trash crop King in any shape or form here I'm just trying to a little PSA if you will now I will be very transparent and explain the situation here a little bit crop Kings seeds was my very first supporter on this channel so I trying not to completely burn my bridge with this one I I have no love for crop king anymore so that's irrelevant but crop king seeds did sponsor me and I won one of their contests and they did some nice things for me not gonna lie as a company they did some nice things for me over my early days of this of youtubing however when my liaison the fella that I was dealing with on the regular basis no longer he he like changed jobs I don't know if he quit or was fired but he left he is no longer working at the company the new liaison was absolutely rude to me didn't know who I was or what I was doing and didn't help me at all and then shortly after my affiliate account was deleted so all of the money I made from affiliate marketing was lost and then they're trying to tell me now that I only made $20 and that the TOS states that you have to have a certain threshold and I know for a fact 100% for a fact that I made more than $20 on the affiliate marketing now I don't care they can keep the money they obviously need it that bad if they're trying to steal it off of people on disability and small growers that were trying to help them out if they're willing to take my money and and dr. things they can have it that's fine there are lots of seed banks out there I just want you guys to be aware of what companies like this well this company specifically does they basically left me high and dry in a time of need and then we're very rude to me and then deleted all my accounts and basically ghosted me for almost six months and then had the audacity about three days ago to send me an email and said hey we seen you did a review on one of our one of our grows a while ago and we would like to offer you an affiliate program and I'm like are you [ __ ] kidding me I'm like you guys [ __ ] owe me money from the affiliate program and there are yes 100% there are other youtubers that have quarrels with crop king seeds I'm not going to talk about their names you guys can say whatever you want again I'm not here to point fingers or spread rumors but I just wanted again everybody to be very transparent about this and just sort of tell you what's going on again I've had my experience with crop king seeds have been mixed as far as actual quality goes some people have had great experiences and I'm not trying to tell everybody that they're bad not to buy them I've had some I really like their CBD cheese it's a very unstable genetic be very aware that it's this is actually their CBD cheese right here it's wonderfully good smelling stuff but very unstable all of their uh it's just I don't know what to say man I've had a lot of germination issues there and here's the only other thing I want to say bad-mouthing them before I just smoked this joint and cool down is their customer service is [ __ ] terrible crop King if you do watch this hire some customer service liaisons some one's because your customer service is second to none for the worst ratings if you look up 90% of the problems is with your guys's customer service heck that's how I became an affiliate when I emailed you guys about a problem I had and your guy told me to [ __ ] off and he [ __ ] swore at me on an email and then after I messaged them back and said you guys are [ __ ] [ __ ] or if you are you really gonna treat me like this I said I'm a small youtuber but I will blast the [ __ ] out of you guys if this is how you're gonna treat your customers and oh I'm sorry I'm sorry we we took that guy out of the seat there was a guy yesterday he was having a problem and he was grumpy in bla bla bla no no excuse I'm sorry I'm a new person let me help fix this and then they kissed my ass hard hard so that I wouldn't trash them again I'm grateful for the things that they have given me I'm not trying to completely say they're a horrible company or anything like that I just want people to be aware that they are wearing masks they are wearing four masks indeed trying to hide their name and that's fine every company deserves everybody deserves a fresh start whether you're a company or a person all that kind of stuff man everybody deserves a fresh start but they're not hiding this [ __ ] man I'm not letting them hide it they were so and they had a massive whoever's in charge of the Instagram stream last night had a massive freak out on me from my post I wish I have some of it saved oh it's my other phone damn it I have some of it saved screenshots just because they were being crazy I got seriously 18 posts from them in about 15 minutes they were all like why don't you tell [ __ ] you're not telling the whole story you got bridges to burn that you burnt to and I'm like like what how did I burn a bridge tell me please it was uh it was interesting some people saw it for sure again it's just uh it's just a drag when drama happens I'm not a fan of drama and this is why I'm trying to sort of clear the air I just want people to know what the [ __ ] was happening that's it I know someone conjoint and cool the [ __ ] down after I smoke a joint I'm gonna probably forget about this and leave it at that do I do I hold massive ill will towards crop king yeah am I gonna let it go yep am I gonna harass them [ __ ] no point meant they were kind of rude to me on the on the thing last night they kinda tried to accommodate me but I just I wasn't having it man they they're lying to me they're straight-up thieving from me they're saying I only earned $20 when I know for a fact I have family members and friends that I sent there that bought more than $20 worth of affiliate sales so I know they're a hundred percent lying on the stats and I'm not the only person to have had this issue with them so just be careful be careful when you get into bed with companies that the terms of services are usually you breed that [ __ ] man read that [ __ ] really carefully before you enter a contract with a company be real man that's why I'm smoking a joint life is too short for drama I just wanted to clear up the air and smoke a joint and then I'll move on I've actually had a lot of people ask me here this is something I can finish talking about while I'm smoking this joint I got a lot of people ask me what's the good seed bank if if crop King sucks if crop Kings not a good seed bank they're not a seed bank by the way they were a seed retailer that has multiple labels that makes it look like they're a bank but they're not anyway if we don't use crop king who do we use I know people have problems with True North I people have problems with this and that and I love growing marijuana people have problems with lots of different companies the reality is look for the strains that you want that's my suggestion there's lots and lots of good reputable seed banks out there I'm not even saying that crop king is that bad I'm just over it I'm done I'm washing my hands of it that's all yeah Google is a wonderful place it depends where you live in the world if you live in America there's a different sets of options if you live in Canada there's different sets of options if you live in the UK or Australia different options you know I've been hunting all over the world for a few seeds I got some seeds I'm buying here at the end of the month I finally tracked the buggers down but I got to get them from a weird little hole in the wall from the UK somewhere man so you know in chat there people are talking a ton of frickin good seed banks I can't do to tune terms of service of YouTube I can't actually save this one or this one or post any links to any of them but there's a lot out there man but I highly suggest strain hunting I highly suggest finding that strain that you liked smoking from the dispensary or your buddy had chocolate or white widows your favorite or whatever your favorite strain is look for that strain and then find out who sells it and buy from them I'm not saying crop king seeds doesn't sell a sunflower seeds they sell cannabis I'm not saying they're terrible but I can't promote them any longer that's all Durbin poison yeah that's a good one and see that's the thing is you get the seed banks that are accessible might not have that strain so you might need to do a little bit of googling and find a seed bank that has the strain that you're after that's the best way to buy but be careful be careful there's a lot of scammers out there and in the early days I don't even want to get into this early days of crop king had some financial issues let's say and let's just leave it at that I don't wanna I don't want he said she said stuff anymore I'm trying to let it go I've almost done this joint and when I'm done this joint I'm gonna be done the conversation about crop king I heard white rhinos being rebranded as black rhino by the breeders hmm I wonder I wonder cuz like the white rhinos are extinct now or something I wonder if that has anything to do with it now crop king is done sucking my energy I am done with it your stickers are still not here they were sent they'll be there today maybe tomorrow then hopefully tomorrow they should be I have the other one here but yeah for anybody interested in the stickers these also come in shirts where's my sticker stack and oh here it is and the tuff dabber stickers these also come all in shirt formats which you can buy on canopy or gross com by the way that actually brings me up to a quick little point folks for anybody interested I'm gonna have to do a another thing about this but this is just some recent news that develop doo-doo dee-dee-dee-dee breaking report breaking report it seems that my old code got compromised somehow ended up

brennan founder of sabine holistic health sabine holistic health is a non-profit organization that assists medical cannabis patients with medicine costs medical cannabis is a safe effective medicine never covered by insurance that patients struggle to afford no patient should have to forgo medical marijuana treatment due to cost all patients who need medical cannabis should have affordable access to it today i'm discussing three hybrid strains an indica dominant hybrid deep purple a sativa dominant hybrid purple sage and a 50 50 sativa indica hybrid east coast sour diesel i'll discuss their effects and some conditions that patients report they are effective for medical marijuana patients love hybrid strains for their balance of indica and sativa effects so let's look at these three hybrid strains when talking about specific strains it is important to note that any batch of a specific strain may vary slightly in its percentage of thc cbd or other terpenes and cannabinoids environmental factors such as sunlight nutrients and temperature can influence the final output it is always important to read medical marijuana labeling carefully and consider the individual nature of a plant it is also very important that medical marijuana patients and caregivers are knowledgeable about strain types indica sativa and hybrid thc and cbd ratios and the medical uses of all cannabinoids and terpenes present in the cannabis plant you can find links to all of this information in the description including a free downloadable chart of all of the cannabinoids and terpenes in the cannabis plant and their medical uses this will help you in choosing a medical strain and finding the most effective medical strain to treat your symptoms choosing a medical strain that fits your needs is the most important part of using medical marijuana successfully high cbd strains are non-intoxicating and equal ratios of thc and cbd produce a mild high if any at all the strains i discussed today can give you an idea of the effects that strains of similar types and with similar thc and cbd ratios will produce however to choose your best medicine you should consider what type of strain and thc and cbd ratio will meet your medical needs and give the level of high that you want or do not want to feel if you are not familiar with how to choose a medical strain or these topics check out those links below these are three hybrid strains that i'm discussing today hybrid strains are created by combining or crossbreeding two strains meant to bring out the best in both strains hybrid strains can really be the best of both worlds by combining the best qualities of indica and sativa strains and balancing them together sativa dominant hybrids are usually energizing with relaxed and calm tones indica dominant hybrids are usually relaxing but not sedative and 50 50 hybrids are balanced between energizing and relaxing the first strain today is deep purple deep purple is a 90 10 indica dominant hybrid so it leans very heavy on the indica side this makes deep purple almost like a sedative indica strain and it is very relaxing deep purple is a cross of purple urkel and purple corkle deep purple is known to produce happy and calming effects with deep body relaxation it is also known to increase appetite and may induce sleep deep purple has twenty percent thc and less than one percent cbd with this twenty to one thc to cbd ratio it will produce euphuria or a high deep purple is said to be a potent strain that should be used in small doses it has a grapey taste and smell deep purple tastes like a grape snow cone and has a floral grape smell patients report deep purple is effective in treating a decreased appetite nausea insomnia sleep disorders depression stress pain muscle spasms and multiple sclerosis it can also treat other conditions but these are what patients report they most often use it for deep purple could be beneficial to any condition where deep body relaxation increased appetite and calming effects are needed it is an indica dominant hybrid but may be more sedative than most indica dominant hybrids this is why it is important to look at the uniqueness of strains the next strain is a sativa dominant hybrid purple sage purple sage is a cross between sage and an unknown purple variety it is a 6535 sativa dominant hybrid with 16 thc and less than one percent cbd with this 16 to 1 thc to cbd ratio it would produce euphuric psychoactive effects but they may not be as intense as other strains with higher percentages of thc purple sage is a combination of the cerebral high of a sativa and the relaxing body high of an indica purple sage is much more balanced than the previous strain deep purple purple sage promotes creativity and being social it is an energizing strain with a calming effect typical of many sativa dominant hybrids purple sage is excellent for stress relief patients do not report any negative side effects with purple sage and say it is effective in treating pain inflammation fatigue stress anxiety and depression of course these are not the only conditions the strain could treat the final strain is east coast sour diesel which is a 50 50 sativa indica hybrid it has 19 thc and less than 1 percent cbd with this 19 to 1 thc to cbd ratio it will produce euphoric high effects east coast sour diesel is noted as a potent strain that you don't need to use much of although a 50 50 hybrid east coast sour diesel is uplifting and energizing but still has calming qualities 50 50 hybrids are usually a balance of effects but east coast sour diesel leans toward the energizing sativa side this could be a result of the other cannabinoids and terpenes in the strain and why it is important to consider the individualized properties of strains in addition to generalizations about strain types east coast sour diesel has been reported effective in treating pain inflammation decreased appetite eye pressure and post traumatic stress disorder it is important to remember that any one strain could affect you differently you should find what works best for you by considering your medical needs and through trial and error having knowledge of medical marijuana strains can point you in the right direction in finding your best medicine medical marijuana patient logs can help you record the strains that you've tried and how they made you feel or treated your symptoms these can help you find an effective strain and provide a measurable tool to show how medical marijuana is working for you to talk with

okay look at this guy's I'm not exaggerating I want you to see oh this is ridiculous okay there we go you just gotta get it just right but man guys you gotta fix this okay key relief I don't like your little styrofoam seals but this one seems to be good so I have to give you the benefit of the doubt here it is puffy and it returns to its shape when you push it this is a good seal good job cheerily if I've had some of them pop off so I'm glad that this one's good I got to get my nose in there real quick Wow let's take a look at that nice you know it's interesting if I had to match this to a strain off the top of my head the smell of it I would say lemon OG Kush the look of it is even similar but let's take a look let's see what we got here oh man I love these nugs they're a little loose they're a little loose and flowery whoo okay let's see what we got this I have to say um this smells a little different than a very different actually than Sour Diesel do I smell strawberries in it hmm not really it's like this sour or pungent smell I don't even know smells dank say that much get a nice close-up of it get a nice close-up of it over here on the macro lens how that would get a nice close up with this macro lens here there's some pretty looking bud look at it heck yeah as you can see it's a little loose and airy but it's plenty sticky let's play tag um well I guess I should as I stick it it isn't it isn't like really moist bud this isn't the dankest but I've seen but it looks interesting that's for sure that's really cool you guys think of that look decent [Music] I some strawberry diesel right there alright so now that we took some close-ups let's weigh this sucker up and see how much we got put this on there and tear it out where we go looks like we've got 3.6 grams so just over the mark on that one that's fine and we can't ask for more than you bargained for right so let me get most of this back here in the container and I'll pick out a nice dank one this one looks good right here you use some of the sheikh - i think with the first one pack bong bowl you know it just seems like a good idea to me this is a like I said it's not the dankest um I gotta say um let's watch this okay so this is a little dry definitely definitely a little dry watch I mean you hear it yeah and I hate to do this I don't want to make sure that you know you guys see what I'm saying like see it just it all fell apart right there so it's dry definitely drawing I noticed that just as I was breaking it up look I mean that blood just crumbled to pieces and I noticed that that is kind of a trait with this kind of weed that grows these big petals I don't know exactly what you call them but you know the ones that are really prominent each one so cure leaf definitely need to improve on the cure because you're drying them out too much I have no you're afraid of mold and mildew and all good you know bad stuff like that but come on now I want me some some good old medical marijuana stuff but it'll be fine I've put one of those beta packs in it it should be good all right let's get this pack and smoked try this out I'm really looking forward to this sounds like a really interesting extreme I'm not gonna pack it totally full because I got four videos to make here we're all this good stuff back in there I might end up pressing that one later no wat to see if there's a super tank one Isilon I'm gonna press alright got my trusty 18 inch fireball 18 inches of medical fury alright here we go alright man as a nice light smoke we got it a little tiny bit left in there but nothing special well I have to say that uh smoke was nice and light it wasn't like a harsh smoke which is great I don't really care for hearts move that much and you definitely feel it's starting to set in hi my eyes and the forehead that kind of thing so I can feel that pressure that I like to feel that lets me know I'm medicated and I have to say I'm pretty pleased they like I said they could work on the cure I'm hoping that Hecky relief you could work on the cure I'm hoping that you know they're not all like that then again let me just bring up the fact that I have you know pointed out in the past that these styrofoam lids are not as good now I don't know if that's the deal this one was sealed so I guess I really you know I can't really blame it on that yeah it was probably being overzealous in the Cure and just you know coming to Florida probably afraid of getting mold in the buds so you can work that out and get it just right yeah you'll have a winner all right thank you very much for watching strawberry diesel 20% THC about 30 to 50 with discounts 47 dollars retail for an 8 tune in next time", "b43Idr-CI_4": "hello everybody and today's the day we've been waiting for for the past 12 weeks this is the chalk day on the AJ Sour Diesel like I said this is a week 12 I've run her three times before but this time is the one I've gone the longest there was a lot more knives if you look at some of the other videos or a khole as I should say but I've systemically chopped them off because I wanted to taste them along the way to see what they were doing how they were tasting interestingly enough on this run I would say it's been the least gaseous and flavor although the gassy sour D smell is there that you normally smell that is just so beautiful when I've been smoking it it's been completely completely dominated with a very sweet berry almost like a jam flavor with a hint of citrus so it's kind of interesting I don't know what changed this time I think I may have used a little bit of more of some of that sweet and I think it may have affected it unfortunately everywhere it read online it says there's no way possible you can alter the flavor but it seems like it did have some kind of effect so we'll see sorry about that finger there but just kind of wanted to give you my final thoughts on her I did like running her the full 12 weeks I could definitely see the difference in the nuts because you can see they're very very full calluses are swollen right now if you can't see the the microscope but if you looked at it you would see that there's about 10 to 15% amber as you see here this is a bleached top I had had a few more that bleached but she just got a really dense really heavy very gassy and the smell of a nose and the in the flower room but like I said when you smoked her very fruity other than that very happy with her gonna run her probably a couple more times and then put her away so they so after following up and now we're going to be featuring the candy land I have a keen quad cut for PCG so that will be coming next stay tuned", "sC83FYCRMKg": "- what is up we got the East Coast Sour Diesel live sugar we're gonna

good luck oh god I don't miss the beach a way poachy no wait", "x1_2Z0er_rQ": "yoyoyo would have positive vibrators it's your boy Brandon aka the bird egg grow back with another video so in today's video we're gonna do a quick review for the honey vape brand Sour Diesel so a lot of you guys that tune into my PVR live streams and vlogs you guys know I'm a sativa smoker I prefer sativa I'll smoke some good indica though you know I'm just trying to chill or you know I'm trying to cash out and get lost in my feelings like Drake I prefer the happy uplifting euphoric energetic creative type of high you dig that's me right there so how was that med men in Beverly Hills this is the what the back for med men looks like men men's like the Apple of cannabis there's a lot of them very commercial a little bit higher price but the good thing about stores like that is that they'll have like big sales during the holidays so Memorial Day weekend they have 50% off select stuff so I picked up the Sour Diesel and the Jack Herer both have you sativa dominant strains the cartridges you might get it a little bit different effect than the flowers just because of the different type of chemicals and stuff they got to break down with the oils but for the most part it is what it is so I was smoking the jack yesterday it's a half a gram and I was feeling pretty good so today we're gonna go run some errands and we're gonna test out the Sour Diesel the Sour Diesel is a full gram one thing about the HoneyBaked cartridges I read some reviews and there were similar complaints to what I had initially when you take it out the oil was stuck it's like very thick and hard and it doesn't really move in I've never seen that with other vape cartridges before let me show you what I mean by that this is what the vape cartridge looks like usually when you turn it upside down the oil will move in the cartridge but these honey vape cartridges the oil is not moving I don't know if that's good or bad but I tested out the jack yesterday and although it didn't move it still got me feeling right once you heat up the bait the oil starts to move a little I read in a review that they had the same problems with these honey vapes is when they got it they thought it wasn't hitting strong because the oil wasn't moving but then they left it upside and then the oil liquefied after they left it in the Sun and then after they hit it they got more vape smoke with each hit so I'm sure that's what it is but I mean it is fine even though it doesn't move it still hits pretty strong and you get the effects so maybe the oil will last longer if you're not hitting as much each time because it takes longer for it to heat up and liquify alright so today we're gonna run some errands head on down to Ontario home mode get it in the morning like Alonso and see how we're flying today Sour Diesel honey bait [Music] so we're rockin with the sour diesel HoneyBaked archers today heavy sativa rockin some biggie which I'll know about these right here that was one solid hits 12 2000 it lasts for I'll giving you some day-to-day updates shout out to all the Buddha lovers out there in the world all the usual suspects that tune in to the PBR live streams I see y'all why fly low when you can fly high I'll holler at you guys soon let's get right all right positive vibrators it's 108 p.m. I smoked at 12:20 not high anymore so we're about to blaze before we go into Ontario Mel's displays a little bit all right that's one more rip it's 109 we'll see how we're feeling after a while let's get right it's 313 and the last hit lasted about maybe about 50 minutes I just hit it again see how long it lasts all right I'll just got back to the crib after a day of smoking this right here this is a honey baked Sour Diesel one good rip at 580 seconds usually last you about anywhere from 45 minutes to 1 hour so you'll be feeling pretty good if you take 2 you'll probably be flying high for a couple hours so depending on your tolerance level this is not a page sponsorship for any vape only negative thing I would say is that oil doesn't move so it takes a little bit more time to heat up other than that it gets the job done Sour Diesel got me feeling right when a happy high-level appreciate the positive vibes stay tuned for more chronic reviews this your boy Brandon aka the bar egg roll signing off I'll holler at you guys to stay flying high so saying or so saying oh you know ii i'm signing i'm swaggin I'm burning I'm burning", "SWYyEs31GK4": "hey what's going on guys this is green steam 23 and today I got

[ __ ] smoking video and we got a new piece in this video we got a jade bowl i don't know if you guys have smoked out of these stone pieces before but they smack [ __ ] so before we get into the video and everything else we're gonna go ahead and take a hit today we are smoking on black dog it's coming in at how much percent 22 22 sorry about that we definitely just lost the camera so um but before anything else we're going to go ahead and take a hit so grab your bongs your pipes your bowls your blunts your joints whatever you're smoking and cheers yeah a little bull shouldn't be able to rip like that i swear to god oh man oh wow okay so today we are talking about a little bit of a grimmer topic um and that is a fake shatter now this is kind of dirty so don't it looks usually a little bit more like shatter but um i've had this for a minute mostly because i've been waiting to do this video actually but um these are known as the dabs of death otherwise known as fake dabs aka pine rosin um there's like tons of adverse effects to smoking this [ __ ] but the problem is with it is it looks exactly like dabs i mean at least like shatter um it looks just like shatter it snaps breaks just like shatter it even i mean it even smokes and it gets you high which is questionable but um some of the definitive like the defining factors that you can use to like discover that it's pine rosin is that it will taste like black licorice and it leaves like a waxy uh feeling on like your lips and inside your mouth it'll also leave like white residue on the outside of like a nectar collector or like start to accumulate in the water uh if you're using a bong or like not a bong a rig um and then there's a couple other things too like uh what's it called it burns up in black smoke and then also it's see this is this has not been in the freezer if if you know anything about shatter typically you got to throw your shatter up in the freezer for it to snap like that but this is just snap and pull like even if you don't put it in the freezer so it'll snap like this at room temperature and uh and then all those previous things you can use to kind of determine if it's pine rosin it can still be hard because there is some uh there is some terpenes that kind of taste similar to black licorice um but this is like straight black licorice i mean like if it's terps there will be like underlying flavors with that black licorice kind of flavor or that pine flavor this is just straight this is like completely like you just bit into some black licorice um which i hate black black legler one eternity later anyways now that i'm done with that little stutter fest i hate the taste of black licorice so the second i touched these dabs the second i smoked these dabs like i was super stoked too i got like an eighth for eighty man that's like a [ __ ] steal and the [ __ ] and the [ __ ] the second that i smoked these dabs i i get this overwhelming flavor of just complete bad black licorice i mean like i just ate a jelly bean like that black jelly bean that nobody eats and everybody throws away yeah that and um like it just seemed off right off the bat but i couldn't really get any clear answers when i was googling it and um that's that's honestly one of the main motivations for me doing this video is because it's something that not a lot of people know about and i didn't even i had no idea about this before this happened to me and then like not even like a couple months later i ended up like i ended up going to my buddy's house and like he literally had a [ __ ] ton of this but didn't know it and we were smoking it and everything and and i was like yo i think that this might be pine rosin and it turns out it was um which it's really shitty that like that this type of stuff is entered the like weed game you know because before like yeah you could get ripped off like oregano or like catnip or some [ __ ] but like you're not gonna die like this [ __ ] like in this [ __ ] won't kill you per se but it can cause like irreversible effects like this can like i personally suffer from asthma which i know i smoke cigarettes and i smoke weed it's stupid but anyways i have asthma and um this can cause asthma these pine these pine resin dabs they can cause asthma uh asthma like symptoms just after smoking them they're extremely harsh so when i hit them i mean i was coughing up a lung and i mean i don't even wrong dabs already kind of kill me but like this was just like over the [ __ ] top and i mean it it it honestly hurt like and i i had a hard time like breathing for a few days after i was after i did i just probably smoked like a point five of this stuff before i ended up re like finding answers to what it was because at first i found like stuff online pointing towards the terpenes which i'm not saying that those i was saying earlier in the video there is terpenes that do taste similar but the difference is that you're gonna get like the the dab citrusy flavor as well if that was in your dabs um whereas like this is nothing but that um and everything was pointing towards that until like i came across this this reddit forum that said pine rose in the dabs of death and that's how we ended up here so before we get to the rest of the video we're gonna go ahead and take another hit actually we'll take two if you can hear my girlfriend in the background hitting it she's joining i didn't get the cough the first time so i had i had to milk a little bit and get the call you know what i'm saying oh god damn this black dog some [ __ ] some [ __ ] bro [ __ ] god damn but anyways um as far as the pine resin goes you know i just want to put out this video out there because i don't know if any of you guys have encountered it if you have let me know down below in the comments um but i'm concerned you know in general i have asthma and i would not wish anybody like getting asthma like it's kind of the worst so you know i mean i i wouldn't want anybody to just like smoke these in their 20s and then all of a sudden have asthma for the rest of their life like i was born with asthma and i just never outgrew it you know i mean that's kind of that's pretty shitty and i'm sure there's more effects i i didn't do like a bunch of research into it but i i mean i this is all the stuff that i learned through trying to figure out what the [ __ ] i got sold and um uh what's it called i would just generally say if you can avoid buying street dabs or not street dabs street shatter specifically it's much harder for them to fake crumble or live rosin or butter another thing to note about pine rosin is that uh that i forgot to mention a little bit earlier in the video is that it can also be mixed like into regular shatters so you can get shatter like when i was talking about the terps how there's like some terps that like kind of taste like pine or like black licorice but you'd still get the underlying taste of dabs there's also the possibility that it's it's this mixed into regular dabs into like shatter so like i said before my general rule of thumb at least for me now and what i would suggest to you guys if you're gonna buy it off the street don't get street shattered don't do it again that it's just there's a fat chance i've i've ran into it like a couple times now and um in general shatters just the one that they can fake so i mean you might as well just stick to the crumble live ros and butter all that stuff i mean if you're gonna go that route and if you go to the if you go to the dispensary by all means i mean i my first video back i was smoking that sunrock shatter because i personally my favorite kind like my favorite kind probably other than live rosin is shatter i like shatter um then i've had very very good shatter so it makes me really sad honestly that that now i have to avoid chatter because i mean it every other drug has its thing like that get that's used to fake it but like i mean dabs really the only way that anybody could really do stuff like that is like sell you a an amber rock that and you just don't notice like or some [ __ ] i don't know [ __ ] that's like the only thing i could think of or like i don't know but i don't think there's really anything that matched up to dabs and now now there is and hopefully they don't like find something that works like as a as a live rosin or as a butter or anything else so that you don't have to be wary all together but for now those seem to be safe so we're going to go ahead and get to the end of this video but before we get done we're going to go ahead and hit this bowl couple more times so if you guys want to grab your pieces once joints and everything you know the deal cheers i got tons of content getting ready to come out for you guys

going to be visiting with my friend and he's got plenty of stuff he used to work at the smoke shop and he's just got like all the best dabs and uh just weed pieces in general i'm probably going to do like the puffco carter versus a rig um and see if it's worth your guys money and if you guys want to go forward with that type [ __ ] i'm planning on doing tons of reviews and like a vlog as well um

of this age when we went when we first started smoking you know I back and it's have a good he'll like something kids would smoke you know how we're just smoking kicking this money powerful start book definitely I miss my strength like this the chem dog the og the the Girl Scout you know like okay I'll throw back and stuff I wish I'd like a throwback series where we smoke like maybe like a

green grapes oh I remember that some green crack but that crack in your crack what else there's so many strains we tried it's funny it's like damn imagine we we were able to record all the sessions you know we were able to do it you know what we should do bro have a jar every time I come every time you come we'll link up drop a nug in there and we'll fill it up and we'll roll a fat ass more than just different strains every time we could just record that is some fire see so again a little bit about this tree it's an indica dominant dominant so it's a hybrid how much the indica dominant [ __ ] 25 percent THC and zero CBD I've noticed it started to add a lot of CBD CBD you know you guys don't know I do have a chest injury it's not like two years ago I saw my chest at the gym and ever since then bro like it just doesn't feel right you know something I try to work it out and I should kind of aches my dumb ass fall it didn't really like I stood I stood and all that stuff but I didn't go to like the doctor because I thought it was just like a hold like a nerve or some [ __ ] yeah but uh so sometimes you know I gotta burn for the pain and [ __ ] you know definitely camped out for is a fire a straight man right now I am [ __ ] lit we're only like the bro that's the beginning with the joint bro terminator my friends just be like good like 5 minutes 10 minutes and it's still going bro [ __ ] man that cam dog is some some loudness man it is it's some guys some guys huh just gotta make sure the cameras are hey but it's crazy I'm looking at this camera bro this cameras pretty lit and the bullet is on point it's just the other one is about a lot more complex if that makes sense in it's a little complex and [ __ ] that make sense now this one there's a lot smoother like the g7x you can actually see yourself yeah there's a billion and this is this is the first one to I'm trying to sell this one and get the second one imagine cycling the same the quality was just probably just a 1 so [ __ ] makes you guys drop a like though let's not mean what you guys cuz right there man y'all take it take it so you sure not like y'all can't even [ __ ] stays on your face [Music] Oh blow he's not disappoint bros there ain't nothin but the thing is like the tree is on point and it's a fire but it is a little bit pricey you know you know like for this he gets like a 40-yard eight but I thought you got to deliver to your house and it's in fire but you know that's tag so that's tax and we also offer instagrams on our twitter is down below so if you guys want to hit us with the follow you know hey just what to follow but that's text uh-huh $40 for an eight yeah bro it might even mean $40 because I remember this one I seen the chem dog before before yeah it was on it was on sale pretty much those like I sell before the sell I seen that it was like $39 so $39 he's starting to do the delivery and the taxes yeah there's still that's gonna be leggy almost as close so $50 a dance we're just being real with you guys man but usually with the front yeah it's worth it you know one you know got a drive through the club it comes to you so it's ready to go and it's some fire does not disappoint so if you guys have the cash man then too you don't have to deal with them shady as neither's that'd be skimming you yeah no that's your five point at the little baby blue cute little baby

camphor and I go is everybody will see you guys in the next video up in the cut Staley stay stay hungry", "t0w2P0r_3xw": "okay everything's copasetic welcome to the first what I'm not welcoming you [Music] welcome to the first wheat strain review of the gungeon injure channel um what I have with me today is NYC sour from this sounds like an ASMR video no an NYC sour from bewell Healing Center in condado Puerto Rico they don't give it to you in this container though they give you to these little baggies that are really annoying so I transfer them over to the containers that I get from clinic of Verde so Big Ups to clinical Verde for that [ __ ] can I help you what's up do you want to smoke some of this I didn't think so so that was keyd so we're gonna do I have my bolt here I got a little ground just in case you have to eat another Bowl and have a joint for walking we're gonna take a little walk after this so NYC diesels usually like the first weed that you get when you're smoked when you're young and I remember this growing up um according to folklore this strain got popular in the early 2000s so this is the weed that [ __ ] were smoking during September 11th so interesting strain nonetheless we're gonna go ahead and spark this bowl I've already packed now it is a hybrid indica sativa hybrid I'm a big fan of sativas but we'll see what happens with this hybrid it's move it's not heavy it's a very familiar flavor he has classic classic taste it burns like it's in a paper already it kind of tastes like it's rolled in something very nice okay so we're gonna go ahead and do the set of the set in test I have a my my pub G here so we're gonna play around a pub G I mean just to see how well this sets it okay I think we're set cool we'll hit this one more time so and had a minute or two in I don't feel anything yet it's a little heavier on a chest upper chest area but that's classic reburn so my homie here keep a hat on let's get tropical see how are we there we're gonna play actually around we're gonna do a quick round today we will make it a heat round just because I don't waste your time for too long so we're gonna play in a minute match or a 15 minute sniper training but I think either one works just me start so that Bowl is starting to get cached a little bit so we're gonna see if you can pop another Bowl before I land from the airplane oh [ __ ] they're jumping already [ __ ] okay oh [ __ ] just punch me in the face already all right what are we gonna do what are we gonna do no pressure everybody's watching no pressure start off to the side loke man what he's out there I usually like going right outside the come in always looking fly I think this is the sniper training I already got my one shooter I am playing this on mobile this is really fun you can hit me up on here a mobile naive Akeem or get my phone number I don't play often but this is a great precursor into whatever I'm doing when I'm smoking because I do not like to smoke and then go right into my activities um just because it gives me higher anxiety I'm a big sativa smoker so I get higher anxiety when I go right into the activity because it's like you weren't high now you're high and then you're doing the work and then you know that's too much of a brain jump for me so I usually like to do a little bit of a brain relaxation some massage and then get into the work I mean these rounds are like we've very varied there's already 37 people in here only so these are very very small maps um sometimes I'll play a big map I'm gonna have time but we out here see I like this this low-key stuff you know I like to talk to nobody I have to see you live for a minute I don't think I'm ready it's uh I feel it starting to creep a minute before it's starting to creep I feel it like crawling so at this point you get the first stages of it's settling him introducing itself hi I'm New York City sour do you remember me but that's cool because I've become more focused now for me my mind wanders a lot and that's okay the sativas allow me to engage a lot more confidently with what I want to say that's going into my head into just put me to sleep let's see nobody I should be careful just dirty people but I gotta get to the safe zone right here they don't know I don't [ __ ] around i I kill the mobile game I don't have a console whoops and I just bust off a shot so they may or may not know where I am now [Music] Thank You NYC diesel see this is good for my nerves man I mean even though this is still look like there's nothing happening this is pretty high paced for what I'm what I usually play I mean granted you're running most of the time but I could sit and point my gun around if I wanted to and just look for people but I think right now we're gonna get to the safe zone find us about to post up still nobody do did you do we'll take one of these thank you my silenced gun nose got a little itty-bitty bullets though I don't need that in my life okay mobile look at that it's a person just fell out a [ __ ] tree never in your life do that I don't play that homeboy he had a cool mask on good I didn't shoot it off all that I wish I could take that home with me I can't where did that guy come from I'm not that high he looked like he just fell didn't me okay so now it's starting to creep behind my eyes a little more see at this point I would smoke more so I think that's what we're gonna do gonna shot oh wait let's get into the safe zone because you want to compliment the hi ah [ __ ] I'm out of the zone already all right let's post up right here ah shoot somebody's here and just like that it's over folks 24 out of 40 I don't even make it halfway he's picking my [ __ ] up [ __ ] you bro I couldn't right when I was deciding to sit that's why you just never let you guard down the job well so it is a little racy good for activities I probably produce on this that's cool so I think we're gonna hit a ball I'm gonna take a walk with the joint it's about only 10 15 minutes later what are you doing in my way we're about 20 minutes in total as someone who smokes a lot I say a lot is like I usually smoke and I'm not high all right now is it good coast if you can catch it correctly you can like put that bag out so we're going to do that now on the way I don't condone now I have a legal cannabis card which means I'm allowed to smoke in my home I'd do it outside because don't care out here since it's legal at least medicinal it's a little bit less crazy for people so we will not finish the whole thing though also it's good to keep it low-key you know it's not fruity it's not plasticy but it is like earthy it's a little bit gritty it's like it's like I know it's like Smokies the wrong town by smoking now yeah that's good it's a good flavor I do forget my water this does have a little bit of a higher mental engagement so you will be thinking a lot more than you're saying mark 23 minutes in and I've reached breaking point I believe in knowing your limits yes occasionally smoking to your brains and it's cool but if it does interfere so what you have to do not cool so there's a breaking point so for me breaking point was at 23 minutes and I'll describe breaking point breaking point is Wayne you have when you should like you know that the smoking will enter figure with the activities so like you gonna say when you're high enough it's not good to push beyond that a grown-ass man I don't need to be doing that in celebration maybe but everything in moderation and I'm a firm believer in parking man there's more for later I feel like if I did smoke more of this I might get floored just too too high to think but I don't know we'll see I love the air I mean I love the walk this is good is great for activities I mean this is also seems like a great contemplation thing if you're by yourself this is great for thinking I'm sure coming up with ideas is really cool on this this is definitely not a relaxing one like I would not relax so as we get closer to the beach I'm just going to start filming the beach and [Music] okay so it's a little over an hour later [Music] flavor profile taste in my opinion as a person who prefers to TVs it's a 3 out of 5 it's not the tastiest but it's also doesn't taste like the utter crap oh the burn profile I'd say 2 out of 5 you know it's got a little bit of a kick but but you know you can catch it it's not unhandled oh you won't be gagging um head high I'd say 4 out of 5 this isn't like a jack herer which on my chart is a 5 out of 5 it's uh you will be engaged and focused on details but you can manage if you're a seasoned smoker a little bit of a challenge - so functionality or function ability like in public I will say this one's a 3 out of 5 you got to be just chillin somewhere by yourself or you got to be like with with people you trust you know I wouldn't I wouldn't be somewhere you wouldn't know I was weirding people out filming the beach and stuff and not knowing where to stand for a second you know there's no right way to stand so I'd say the paranoia factor also mixes in with that paranoia factor of anxiety it's all part of the game baby oh let me know what you think let me know what I should include the next one let me know how to know how this one let me know if you enjoy this strain let me know your thoughts and opinions what's your favorite strain let me know what strain I should try out and put through the the pub G test and I'll see you guys on the next video I'll subscribe I love you and I'm 9 Viking the ganja ninja deuces [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] nobody [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "i5fuNWGBVhg": "welcome to marijuana etiquette today I will be sharing with you the top five rated sativa strains number one and Misha haze honestly out get this strain not be number one amnesia haze is an all-time favorite and Amsterdam's coffee shops and quickly became one of the most recognized TV strains of all time amnesia is no random name for this haze indeed under her influence you might have a hard time keeping track of you're trying to thaw while she is incredibly inspiring and creatively boosting she is one of those strains with which you can come to realize the ultimate purpose of life but then forget about it she has a unique smell that's easy to remember sweet and lemony with a balanced earthy undertone with an average THC content of 22% and Mia haze can take you to the other side after all she's one powerful mistress number two Cali miss Callie mist is a very well-known almost pure sativa strain that comes from the master breeders of serious seeds she delivers a very strong energetic and clear minded high one that is said to be particularly enjoyed by women Cali mist has a sweet and nutty taste that induces a very potent high the THC content of Cali miss tends to be in the region of 22% so you know she is one of the big players number three Sour Diesel Sour Diesel is one of the original sour strains and is one of the few sativa dominant varieties Saira diesel is behind the success of our Sara strains that have become so popular recently this smelly powerhouse is the parent of many hybrids so if you like sour she's the big mama as you would expect the bud has a very earthy sour and jet fuel like taste with pleasant pine undertones while her THC content of 16% is a bit lower than that of the other contenders she still packs a punch the high is long lasting strong and mind centered without any body effects whatsoever number four trainwreck as the name suggests she's a heavy hitter with almost 90% sativa Genetics she will induce an intense cerebral high that very slowly fades out however what sucks trainwreck apart from other sativa strains is her indica body load along with the cerebral stimulation she will almost death we find you to the couch and tingle through your limbs this rather unique combination is the reason this strain is a favorite among medical users it's a complete high with a cerebral Rush and physical relaxation the bud has an earthy pine quality to it and produces a zesty lemon undertone with a THC content of 18% trainwreck is a respectable sativa that will surely satisfy number 5 Jack Herer Jack Harris an old-school sativa dominant strain that has gone down in history as one of the most decorated and renowned strains ever named after the activists in cannabis Paragon Jack Herer there could be no other fitting strain if you're looking to see what premium old-school cannabis was really about with 55% sativa genetics Jack Herer isn't as pure of a sativa as the previously presented strains and yet it induces a superb clear potent and happy cerebral high the but itself has a predominantly pine flavor with strong woody and earthy undertones it produces a very potent high that both encapsulate the best sativa and indica effects you can expect a strong and clear head high that will leave you happy and uplifted whilst the indica affects simply and gently lower your body into bliss the THC content of Jack hair can vary between 20 to 24 percent so it is definitely a strain for those who need some power this concludes the top 5

starts back in the day probably 1990 the story I did ditch now it's a soul that has three seeds and it's a little different okay let's take it up okay well we really need to start before that because now we're in in near 91 and I'm on tour come home just from Madison Square Garden shows and there's a man that walks by my house he's a hippie and wave you know comes back around the corner and next thing I know is I'm buying a sheet of paper because hey my friends are over here around the corner we don't have a place to stay go out meet these guys you know so here we are it's September right at the you know Brent had just died and won't be stepping in good show and so I need this guy he walks by he sells me some acid well I was happy in and then you can say my friends are over here we'll have a place to stay but he's funny on it so it's gotta be nice hanging out like nice conversation and stuff and talking bro he's the second person they started telling me about growing next thing I know was a month 12 we gather going down RFK and we requirement seats from bucks I had already been grown for like six months seven months now what year is this this is probably early 92 okay so we read RFK and we acquire some really [ __ ] Holly but it was green house were on and we got these few seeds this leads up to the chem because this is how I meet the connection for the candor right okay so I start growing this stuff called the RFK which was just a [ __ ] hash play even today meeting my friend Joe we talk about this planet so I got that I got a couple sister plants nice sativa number two we called it the one was the one arcane and the number two and one was this very skunky green now I'm hanging out with G again and we're going to see fish at the Roseland he said hey I met this guy he's some Massachusetts and so we hooked up with them start talking Papapa at this thing like that he's got this I got that hey Cutlass I said yeah I'll give you this for that okay he had the chem this is like early 92 okay he had to chem that he acquired from Colorado just like these guys said he'd gotten he told me like six seats but this guy says 12 seats whatever that's fine he was grown he had grown too he had come to Kemah boom that was the wrong dog and was it D 8 WG like everybody says that it it was the og right and people were like yeah what thank so much he ate them Yuki yeah it's really it's dogs but we call it well and I look at I just walk away but this so it's so now early I guess is 92 and in fishing playing in the Roseland was and so I go up to Massachusetts and I'm bringing in my product okay sell them with girls and coming back with the other girls difficulties okay so I gave him the number two and I had another plan I gave him he gave me the Super Skunk and the Kendall now this Super Skunk was beautiful I got these two plants I'm growing them for a while and now I find a nice place in noodle on Staten Island thank [ __ ] two-bedroom loft see love addict huge kitchen garage yeah right cuz I hadn't grown in Elton villa on the island like a rock so I had to move I know I've been going back and forth Massachusetts for a while hanging out my friend that and so like now I got a connection upstate New York I meet these people on tour and at the following year what happened looks ok so I went also in this time I went over the Amsterdam these guys all went to Woodstock [ __ ] up there this is before that so I went over the Amsterdam time to go anybody's over there looking at all those idiots I came back with Northern Lights the Jack Herer the Oasis ok Northern Lights 5 and Big Bud but the one I prime L in Hawaii and the one that I used I took the cam and I took this desuka scum ok and I started breeding with these seeds that I got males Adam and I would beg up pile in little plastic bags each smell you know get rid of it and now I had Hawaii to use ok and I had given it to my friend FB just say that and he was still in it and I had the Northern Lights is what I believe I had a Northern Lights super scum crossed into himself twice and pollen II might accidentally with some wine I've got a half a pound of it we that had seeds in it what the [ __ ] this so I sold most of it to the guys and the Upstate crew they come back to me and one of them happens to be like this guy Joe that is in the article with with Adam where he meets him over in Amsterdam Greg Enix Greg over in Amsterdam and he was living up there I had a really calling and I sold him he grew some and I grew some of the seeds and believe it or not these were pretty stable for him but his cuttin was a little bit better than mine so the Sour Diesel what I know of has no no dog it's the super strong to Northern Lights and a little bit of Hawaii [Music]",

with everything he does because he have so many followers it's like the when you're popular people don't want to just pet the back but pet the cat backwards because they're afraid of the repercussions from a person who has a lot of influence I mean I felt that way about people before but I haven't felt that way in a long time that being said don't [ __ ] be intimidated by people in their popularity

get the [ __ ] cloud I was like you don't even know if I want to be [ __ ] like recognized to be next to this guy it's a [ __ ] idiot seriously dude I'd say it to his face the fact the matter is believe this Northwest cannabis club I didn't even have my Instagram going at that time because it was in transition between primo and and the entertainer so it's just like whatever dude just remember all the [ __ ] sack riders that are jumping on his bandwagon they're not extractors and they're [ __ ] you they're just all living in the past dude they're AI cavemen here's the thing just ask yourself this did you honestly think that the BHO extraction world and all the extractions involved we're gonna remain the same for the rest of the rest of the time that there wasn't gonna be something new coming in eventually to empower and offer a whole nother realm of possibilities I mean because chromatography has been going on since like I think it was like [ __ ] 1836 or some [ __ ] I mean go on for a long time you think [ __ ] didn't just get invented it's just getting applied to to the marijuana industry now here look here's also the thing how many [ __ ] pounds of trim did myself and countless growers that I know simply toss a tossed into the fire before there was the possibility of extracting something of value out of it everybody threw it away because we didn't know better but if you threw high-grade lead away now without somebody blasting it everybody would think you were an idiot my point is if you knew what I know about CRC and those of us who work with it on

messed up on and um so uh that's why you're not seeing the bag here i know some of you like when i rip open the bag and [ __ ] um but trust me the bag is right there um so this is take two um i got your snoopy's kush you got a floyd and the one we'll be doing today it'll platinum diesel this is this is a heavy ass sativa um and i'm already high from it because i already did a take so um we'll see how this goes this stuff is train wreck-like i mean this stuff is a fire acidity but for anybody looking anybody along that's looking for a real good sativa to vouch for this stuff just like the hawaiian haze um but just like in the other video i will give you a look at the old snoopy's kush for sure but in the post-production i kind of learned from my mistakes so we can uh get a better view check this stuff out guys super frosty nice and trimmed this is dense stuff man real dense here's the whole egg dense not bad until it stuffs fresh real fresh totally digging it but if you check my page i already have a review for this stuff so if it's any different like any major different than than the last stuff then i'll uh i'll make another video but i mean this stuff's looking straight up on point it's got that master kush clean just that absolute mr clean smell and here we go platinum diesel now mind you i already smoked a nugget of stuff for my other video so check this out nice and hairy dense um seed pods we got good seed pods going on real dense man squeezing so uh yeah for sure this stuff is definitely on point check this one out it's got that kim dog um headband kick to it not quite an og but kind of on that path you know what i'm talking about so uh without further ado we're about to get lit and then i'm going to do another video to do the third video um i'm going to do another q a um i got some uh you know i don't want to say an overwhelming you know response to my last one but uh let me pick a different boat out of here i saw that one earlier i was looking pretty prime um i was uh i [ __ ] i just lost my thought dude i'm stoned so forgive me guys i know this video is gonna suck but bear with me for at least it until i smoke this [ __ ] and then if you want to come back come back for the q a video i'm doing another q a video that's what i'm talking about doing a q a video and then do i'm doing another q a video [ __ ] and uh because i got i got i got a lot of responses from that one everybody seemed to like that [ __ ] um let's do a drop test and so i'm gonna do another one i got three or four more messages with questions and stuff so that works for me um i'll crack open a beer answer some questions um you guys feel free to send questions add you know comments i don't give a [ __ ] what you say it doesn't matter talk [ __ ] it doesn't you know i'm not you can't hurt my feelings so it's all good leave comments um you know messages twitter um whatever you know so i said i was actually surprised at how many responses i got from that video people were i guess kind of in you know anticipating some kind of you know video where i answered some questions and and didn't just review you know the buds so uh i got some pretty interesting questions lined up so we'll take a look at those but uh without further ado we're gonna do take two platinum diesel i'm already wrecked from the first one here this is proof of the first one this is the half roasted bowl and i'm you know listen to this video and then goes into another video where it wasn't hard before but uh yeah that's just a half roasted bowl so not lying to you guys this stuff's got like a like a real zippy high to it but it kicks it's got that instant kick like an og behind the eyes kind of so stuff well well grown bang bang here we go do this [ __ ] stop this it's gonna like it's got the same taste as as it smells see again that chemical that dankness that that sour okay like i said it's just you know like it's kind of like a really good sour og um i would just have to say if you've ever had saurogy oops sorry if you've ever had a good sour og this stuff is on point with the with that with an a plus how rho g i would say um i'm digging i'm [ __ ] ripped i'm i'm good remind you this is the first you know that the first take was the first smoke of the day so you know and that you know had me lifted and uh and i was editing the video and [ __ ] it up so i was like [ __ ] you know these guys got to check this stuff out though so for sure stop by the oh it's i probably haven't even talked about high quiggle um high coil in long beach um 15 a gram 45 and eight both of these that's unbeatable you can't um you can't not going to find this quality for 45 anywhere else dude i mean this stuff right here just down the street um at one love is going for 60 60 bucks for four grams um i easily got hooked up with probably you know 3.7 on each of these easily i would say probably no less than 3.7 maybe even more i'm not i'm a bad judge i'm a bad judge at eyeball and [ __ ] so i mean i mean these guys might be giving me [ __ ] 20 grams i don't i mean definitely not but you know what i'm saying like this is i but i definitely know for sure this is not 3.5 because i've seen some 3.5 stacks lately and it wasn't from high quiggle and let's just say they didn't fill up the jar or anything like these so um again high quiggle's killing it with that 45 cap now and they're coming with you that that same [ __ ] they were saying for 55. this the [ __ ] ain't the [ __ ] did not go down they're coming with you at that with that same hard [ __ ] man that snoop's kush this is the same this is the same thing as snoop's master but this is just by a different grower that they used to have so if you've ever been uh the high quality you got their snoops master this is the same [ __ ] just by a different grower and it's it's the same i mean there's really not a whole lot of difference in stuff you know this stuff's very well manicured um i can't complain for 45 hours [ __ ] and his platinum diesel i i reviewed it for a reason you know i well although i had already done the snoop's push i could have got something different i had already had a gram of this stuff so i knew what i was getting into and i wanted to share with you guys so i know there's some of you guys out there that email me and and [ __ ] like that they're from long beach to go to some of these clubs and you know hit them up and [ __ ] like that so for those of you out there that like the good sativas if you tried the hawaiian haze i recommended that stuff's hard hitting real quick to instantly ain't no creeper [ __ ] so um all right i'm going to continue another video i'm going to do a q a i'm going to crack open a beer and uh i'll see you guys in probably about five minutes peace [ __ ]", "tY6bRcpc1Q4": "[Music] that you can use to extract cannabinoids and terpenoids liquid co2 is one of them there are lots of others that fall into the category of hydrocarbons that includes butane propane heptane lots of other things are also hydrocarbons gasoline for instance but of course we don't want to use those for things that we are going to be taking orally so the difference mainly is in the specificity of the molecules that it will ultimately dissolve out of the plant material and there are our pros and cons to both butane actually gets a fuller terpene profile and it's faster but ultimately you do need to get rid of the solvents at the at the end the nice thing with co2 is all you do is reduce the pressure and it reverts back to a gas and then we re pressurize it and put it back into our recycler so we do use a lot of our co2 more than once and there's no residual solvent there at the end when what once it comes out of the machine the co2 is gone with other types of hydrocarbons those solvents are also relatively easy to remove and they've gotten a lot like a bad reputation in recent history and I think one of the main reasons for that is that butane is really easy to get cheap and dirty and the butane itself is not necessarily harmful it's whatever might come with the butane that once you dissolve or once you concentrate all of that down then the contaminants can also be concentrated and that might be a problem but clean pure medical grade butane is a great solvent for cannabis and butane itself whatever small bits might be left over is essentially harmless when you but so this sort of I don't know what I want to call it demonization or chemo phobia around hydrocarbons is somewhat unnecessary it's very easy to do it safely and correctly and cleanly but people in the past who were on the black market or didn't know what they were doing or doing things in the cheap and dirty way have you know given it a bad reputation so ultimately you know there are small differences on a molecular level of the things that these different solvents will dissolve you can use cold ethanol as well is a pretty good solvent and that that is being used more and more as well so so yeah I think one of the main reasons we like the co2 is for worker safety there's way less risk of accidents happening dangerous accidents happening ultimately co2 is very safe and it's gone by the time the extract comes out of the machine [Music] [Music]", "yuGe-I-vTLU": "this is sex science an experiment on cannabis and desire I'm curly Joe and this is Jose hi cannabis has always been a really important part of our relationship we use it for social gatherings going on adventure connecting to one another or a fun night in watching a movie personally I like to pair cannabis with my sexuality I find that it stimulates my senses getting me more in the mood and allowing me to be more present in my body yeah I on the other hand don't really associate cannabis and sexuality because just in my experience I when I consume I like to chill and relax and although my senses get heightened they're more of like listening to music or watching something or observing people so not I like an action getter no very just like hang out okay here in Los Angeles I'm a sensuality and cannabis coach being in the cannabis space really allows me to not only learn about the hundreds of different strains of cannabis out there but to experiment with them as well so I've been conducting some research on which strains lend themselves to enhancing your sensuality and which don't so this is episode one and we're starting with a heavy hitter a very high in THC sativa called Sour Diesel which has a reputation for being nature's viagra well does it make sense why we're starting with that one well we're gonna hope that it has a different effect on me then my past experiences with different cannabis and I guess we'll be finding out I really excited to see if it works I think both of us are so we're gonna go into our science lab and conduct some really thorough investigation right yeah we're not gonna come out until we have all of the facts yeah real science happening right now so stay tuned for a post video on our results we are coming to you from post experiment what we're calling sex science science that involves sex just in case that that wasn't clear on what that meant so what is it three days yes three days of testing yes rigorous testing yes so it has been three days since we came on and explained what we were doing and that's because we really wanted to take our time and try it more than once and there's some bumps along the road over the past three days we've been testing a strain over the past three days we have been really busy in our science lab testing pairing sex with the cannabis drink called Sour Diesel so Sour Diesel is a pretty intense strain it's a sativa and it's really high in THC you want to note that we you know said we were gonna experiment with this strain but instead you know we went on with life we were hungry we made dinner something happen with our garbage disposal we had to fix it like yeah and these are totally things that happen in all relationships like life gets in the way from sex a lot what I get asked a lot as a sensuality coach is how can I get more in the mood how can I get more turned on so I want to have sex with my lover more or how can I help him or my partner get into the mood and I gotta be honest I was really not into it I was like I don't want to do this I was fired it's I'm late or it's late you know I was like I'm not really that into it and that that happens all the time in as well right the results on that one that time that we experimented which one I'm talking about the first time yeah well you were a little too like too high it got me too much in my head and I was having a really hard time just relaxing me and getting into the body but do you have to share or comment on they work for me are you saying that this strain and this experiment number one type number one yeah helped you boost it was everyone was ready ready yeah but there was no like slot and there was no lagging behind okay and have any other strains or any other experimenting with cannabis have you noticed that it's more of well you know again yeah everyone's you know sometimes everyone's just relaxed like you're trying to go let's put it this way you're you're ready to go on a Friday night and you're with your friends and you're like hey let's let's roll let's get out of here and sometimes are just kind of like I'll be right there I'm not ready yet you're like dude I'm ready why are you ready okay so your brand so what I'm hearing is that the brain is saying I'm ready it's Friday night let's party yeah but your genitals are like I just need a minute yeah I'm cool yeah I just smoked weed yeah relax so we wanted to make sure that we were conducting our science thoroughly yeah this is real science but this is not fake science this is real and attempt number two was really really fun because we we've looked we're so high yeah had the giggle I'm sorry laughing a lot like all the way through anything you want to know about your experience with the tent number two did you notice it would be here your dousset - I was again we were already it was time for the party and everyone's like ready I'm ready look good it's about time so all right cool so that's really really valuable information because I hear that from a lot of men is they really enjoy cannabis but sometimes it does disturb their libido so good to know that Sour Diesel the rumors are true it is nature's viagra super super cool right cool so I love it my favorites fan now what's more if you have any strains that you love and really really really enhance your sexuality please comment and let us know and we are open - we're on it yeah anyone wanting to suggest a strain to us we were definitely willing to you know do this until the science is complete right in the name of science thank you", "OGZoF4f5TFg": "what's up YouTube and I'm back I got another new trainee game coming out

deeply connect and some fun what do you recommend so the the question there honestly would be if you are concerned about falling asleep or not because sometimes people are and if you're not concerned about falling asleep a lot of crushes tend to be the body high that connects these dreams yeah the body high that comes along with indicas can often produce additional sensitivity body sensitivity and so for example something like the sour cherry Kush or the plush berry or this well the sex cush is a little meditative but you get the idea which is you know something like this is is is very has a very nice head body high that can be really stimulating the banana cush is it could be a good choice too a lot of people find oh this is a great this is a great description here The Hustler coach so oh gee coach a lot of people find stimulating the Kim dog is a little bit has a little bit more of a head height to it so this is going to be something that is body calming fairly fairly quickly body call me with a head high but then the head height wears off that's one of those other things that's interesting in hybrids is that very often when they have both sativa and indica characteristics the head high part wears off more quickly than the body high part and the body high part is a part that that makes you feel relaxed and maybe sleepy so a good hybrid like that would be a good choice but yeah if you're really looking to bond with a partner though to some people actually really enjoy things that are way more energetic if they're having a night in and the goal is to make sure that they are you know kind of connected and focused and attentive to their partner so that's a completely different way to go but that's that's the next you know the next question with a goodbye tenders

go ahead and subscribe right now and I hope you guys like my video and today I'm really excited I'm gonna be trying this little guy here hopefully actually um okay you guys could see it I'm gonna be trying this new dizzy pod this is a sativa and this is my first time trying the Sour Diesel is that how you pronounce it so I'm super excited as you guys all know I'm oh I only smoke sativa except for hybrid if it's more sativa dominant then I'll smoke that too the only strain that I actually smoke and that I love is the pineapple express that's actually one of my favorite favorite rums dizzy so I'm excited to try this one and we'll see how antes I'm very very excited to be honest with you okay let's open this and I did end up purchasing a full gram and this is yeah so and then we're just gonna be chit-chatting I have a little bit of my other pod so I'm gonna put it there it's pineapple Express honesty like that's my go-to strain out of all of them and I have my water here because if you guys have seen in my previous videos dude I'm like the worst when it comes to I'm like a coffer I cough so much it's like sometimes a little bit embarrassing but let's try it let's take a hit so hopefully did I blink and this is my pen like lq it's the rose gold do you see so if you guys don't mind go ahead and just roll up your joint do whatever and just take a hit with me and we'll see if it's bomb or I've heard that it tastes I want to see how it tastes that's what I'm and see how it makes me feel after this I'm just gonna go and do a little bit of shopping grocery shopping I'm always doing grocery shopping that's all I freaking do seems like that's all I do but anywho cheers you guys whoa dude I'm gonna cough holy shmoop holy smokes holy smokes hmm I'm so sorry so antenna I feel like because I'm so concentrating and coffee yeah I don't enjoy the taste of it so one more hit just a little tiny one it's honestly I haven't smoked all day I'm really really trying to cut back and I've been doing a really good job um-hmm so that was the that was a the first the first hit is always the best like oh you know what I mean so let's let's just take another little one and see hmm dude my eyes like instantly there just do you guys see they're like you know what I mean even on sativa like my eyes fill up it should not is it just me but anywho obviously it's doing its job no complains about that they are always bombs dizzy is always on point there was a minute that there was a video that I know I have and I'm like what the heck's dizzy for guys honestly I was not aware that um there's a black market for her for pods I'm like really like I didn't know that it's like seriously uni Penn State assist yeah so so my dad dizzy I'm just very careful shoot dude I haven't had sativa for a while guys I've been smoking on just pineapple Express and pineapple Express um whoo let me just take a little pineapple Express kind of like that's how you love that string because it has like a good balance of indica and I think it has more sativa the percentage wise it has more sativa so but it's still like for me personally it's such a great balance of indica and sativa like it's not too much where it's like right now honestly I feel like okay let's go let's go let's go you know what I mean like I don't want to be sitting here and I think I'm just gonna be rambling and I I'm sorry for that but um I feel like pineapple Express is a good balance for me I like just Bailey being like I'm like just chill and I think pineapple Express does that for me and so team oz on the other hand I forgot why I kind of try to stay away if if you know if I if my shop doesn't have the pineapple then yes like this time they didn't have pineapples so I asked what's a teat what's that sativa strains they had and because I can't do indica like I I just can't you know because my mom so if I you know I still have to be on the go like but a good go you know what I mean like a balance so like I say that's what the pineapple Express does for me but sativa kind of gets me more like antsy and I forgot that filling till right now and right now I feel like you know I just want to get out and do my shopping yet but overall it was really good if it's a little bit I can't describe the flavor was no it wasn't sweet or anything like that I'm very very subtle and I enjoyed it so uh yeah I think it's definitely worth it I list as he can't say enough about about that as long as like I said you made sure that it's certified so don't just cuz there is fake ones and dude I remember like taking those hits and it was it would burn my throat and but like a burning I'm always coughing regardless of if whatever I do if I do flour I smoke I just thought Mac offered a slightly smoked I cough I'm just a copper period but uh hmm well with those with the fake ones that I I didn't even know they were fake but obviously they were because they would do they were like do I don't even know what the hell I was smoking do you guys have this is very like important [Music] make sure you that it's certified at you know what you're smoking you don't want to be smoking and you don't know you don't want to be putting stuff in your body that you don't know you know if it's like safe to do so so be be very very careful who you're buying your pots from you know cuz you're a girl know so so some research and you know I finish like maybe one or two of those and I'm like what the hell is going on you know study but no it's not it's not them they're they're bomb-ass how their qualities i honesty i the other oh it's the other brand that i that i like but the only reason why i haven't bought those is because my pal you know i've gone through three different batteries and dude like maybe I'm just buying like the wrong pens or whatever but usually the cartridges will taste like burnt and I know for sure it's not the cartridge because that Brad is like amazing it's blue moon I'll tell you guys room right now but this other brand honesty its bone bucks look blue moon a blue moon am I saying it right blue man dude oh moon rock blue Dreamettes is that beer mm-hmm moon rock yeah they are bomb guys like how long like I said as long as you're you're buying it from like a legit shop and you know that they're you know their product is legit then yeah moon rock is another one that I honestly I love love love their flavors are so bombed the high is so bomb and on yeah aunt Stasia did the first time when I started smoking I think I know I didn't start with dizzy but as soon I was getting other cartridges from a different dispensary I can't even remember the name those were bombed to but I would keep on buying just that bread because I tried other ones and I'm like you know trying to like see what I like so sometimes I end up buying I was buying stuff I didn't like and I'm like what the hell I'm just like wasting money cuz if I didn't like it I was thinking to smoke it you know like no and so I was just you know so I kind of that's why I always stick with with dizzy um once in a while our like I was all try other stuff but for the most part since I know this you know I love pineapple Express and I love how it makes me feel you know it's like why buy the other ship but I mean that's just me there's sometimes like I said I'll try something else but for the most part I kind of stick with dizzy so huh but you know when I'm not broke I will but right now no strictly just what I like and you know but overall guys definitely this is bomb like always like I said and so yes guys I definitely give it a thumbs up and thank you for watching and I will see you guys in my next video more amore parsec Weedon besito", "xl82ZxOl8tg": "due to people chronic here another legal Oregon medicinal or recreational product I suppose it's the clay wool I got some super Lemon Jack crumble they have some quite fancy packaging so I'm doing a review of their company I've never heard of them that they have a wax seal on their shattered container how crazy is that in a plastic pretty fancy they got all kind of information on the bag nice packaging looks like what we got here is the super Lemon Jack sixty seven point six seven percent THC with two point eight five percent CBD so it's it's it's an intermediate concentrate it's not too strong I'll go ahead and take it out of the package to show you guys so you got the plastic outer coating it has one of those sticky bottoms comes right off of the paper give you some information about what it was made and all that I got the wax seal then pop it up and you can open it clay foxface on it or layered clay wolf super lemony just like my lemon Turk sugar I reviewed look at that nice and crumbly I like that because then the crumble reminds me is some really good hash super super lemon aroma super lemons we go ahead and give it a rip we'll see kind of review I can give you this the first time trying it go ahead and hit it here on the green goblin at 557 Fahrenheit low temp and get a good flavor licious dab so dabs ahoy everybody [Music] it's your pretty hard it expands good but real smooth as far as the taste entering exiting it was a little harsh on the but just pure expansion no aftertaste no bad butane smell nothing and yet some of the even the legal products you get have that terrible butane aftertaste I could tell when I smoked dirty wax and even some of this stuff on the legal market is getting a little ridiculous as far as how low-grade it can be I don't recommend anybody buy saps anything that looks super sappy is usually not very good as far as that goes anything that looks more solid like crumble and stuff like that even if it's lower priced it usually is cleaner and it's smoother so I I'm gonna have to give the claim wolf another little rip of this super Lemon Jack just to see if if I approve or not we're really good it gives expansion just like you're smoking some fool melt ass or something a real clean XL this is just some stuff you could probably rip midday and it keeps you awake it's it's fine it won't make you tired or nothing like that but it'll give you an exceeding high and super Lemon Jacks higher sativa I believe anything with the super Lemon is is really exceptional I really like the lemon Terps and lemon flavored up and getting so yeah the clay Wolfe extracts I'm gonna go I mean it's my first shot with them I've never tried any of their other products but uh I'm gonna go ahead and give clay Wolfe at least a seven on the one-to-ten scale as far as BHO concentrates so yeah go ahead you guys see this stuff on a shelf give it a try let me know what you think and thanks for tuning in Kuban chronics channel stay tuned for more oregon cannabis reviews and other cannabis information and adventures thanks for watching everybody", "NiaPli8UDB0": "welcome to episode 4 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "xE5f9QWHPIY": "what up you too my [ __ ] and my [ __ ] it's a new week new

today we're going to talk about two of my absolute favorite things sex and cannabis if you've ever had sex chances are you've done it with alcohol in your system so where sex is great but have you ever thought about bringing marijuana into the bedroom it's an amazing bonding experience when you consume cannabis together but if you're the only one smoking make sure to be honest with your partner about your state of mind if you take it slow and do your research you will never regret bringing cannabis into the bedroom so here are my top reasons why you should explore cannabis and sex cannabis can replace your anxiety with confidence and focus sex can be really intimidating and when you're intimidated it's very hard to focus you might be thinking about your weight or how you look when you're naked or you might even be thinking about that meeting that you have tomorrow morning sex is best when both partners are present and focused on the task at hand and that's where cannabis comes in certain strains of cannabis can quiet your mind and reduce anxiety so the next time you're looking for an aphrodisiac you should reach for cannabis cannabis can deeply intensify the pleasure sex and who wouldn't want that I know I certainly would cannabis heightened sensitivity throughout your entire body and that is absolutely perfect for set don't be shocked if it takes a little bit longer than usual to reach the finish line but I promise it will be completely worth it hmm cannabis lowers your inhibitions so you can have fun on your own terms uptight rigid sex is no fun and that's why a lot of people turn to alcohol you have to be really really careful with booze though because if you have too much you might not be in control of your actions and you can possibly make decisions but you'll regret the following morning cannabis on the other hand is great because it allows you to put into practice those moves that you were thinking about before still being completely in control don't forget about oral sex pot can bring out skills that you never knew you had and your partner will be very thankful for weeks cannabis can boost your mood and it allows you and your partner to share something special together the high you experience from cannabis can give you a huge boost even after a really tough day happy sex beats angry sex any day so find a strain that makes you feel euphoric and uplifted who shared experiences strength and relationships so smoking together during foreplay will pay off big-time before during and even after sex whenever you smoke with someone you automatically form a connection so that connection combined with the passion and experience of great sex will strengthen the bond of any relationship don't forget about cuddle time after the fact because cannabis only adds to that post-coital bliss if you include cannabis in your sex you will stay happy long after your clothes go back on whoo bringing pot into the bedroom isn't all sunshine and mind-blowing orgasms unfortunately so there are a few things that you do need to look out for if you've ever consumed cannabis you've probably experienced cottonmouth so make sure you can get all of that kissing in and have plenty of water nearby I know this me may be a little bit graphic but your mouth isn't the only part of your body that is affected by cottonmouth so make sure to have some Lube on hand as well it is really important to know the effects of that particular strain that you're using so make sure to give it a good test drive before you bring this particular strain into the bedroom some strains can dull your senses or lower your libido and that is not sexy at all being locked to your couch during sex does not make for a passionate skill lover so make sure that you're going four strains that will get you high and not stoned the strongest couples are made up of best friends who have passion and chemistry really hot sex cannabis enhances all of those things so now you should go and explore cannabis and sex with your partner I can't wait to hear what you think and I'd love to hear your personal experiences feel free to shoot me an email or tweet me at Molly peckler and I can't wait to hear from you soon", "FAvzxV22f88": "just took down my first Sour Diesel huge [ __ ] plan y'all can see how many big ass coughing branches like a blinging excuse colors

product two different videos on each product by the way I can cover more we'll talk about them we'll look at him smoke somebody anytime like his [ __ ] any time you like this video me hit that like button up tums up subscribe if you like it shares somebody else can peep it out you know I mean P game with these great products also comment if you have any input or any questions anything saying alright I'm TC 420 TC sash TC smoke whatever their PC at you with THC Chronicles I also wanted to let it be known not every product that comes through actually makes this channel even only the best products based on what we actually liked it that's also why we tried the products first noticed in most videos we've already tried it and we state that and pawn showing it and that's the reason because we don't let the best products actually hit this channel and and based on what a 23 humpin smoking since I was 12 what is that 27 years based on his people like me that are 27 years deep experience healing so so only the best products in United States really hit this channel man but I got a couple new products like I said I'll do two different videos first ones first we're gonna be going over some Matt strand dad's buy CBD Colorado's best dads potency seventy three point nine percent total TVC 67 it's not the highest but it's really good shape it is fire so drive your lighter up get your dad about get everybody get ready cents if you want to along this video or just watch again this is an 18 year or older channel 21 or older whatever is for adults and medical cannabis patients I'll probably switch us around in a minute where I can get better lighting better viewing but this is what we'll be going over today folks will be opening it looking at its Melanie smoking some of it talking about it if you can see - well there like I said I'm gonna switch this around I just do like my background but I am gonna switch us around a little bit folks I'm gonna make the lighting a little better bear with me all right you too I sure I want to say that's better y'all quite a bit better right the life anyways like I was saying but we're gonna go over there Pam and this is Colorado's best dad honestly there and they're notorious train guide but let me zoom in and tad here this is the old spot if y'all notice but anyways it's a lot better lighting I got it all set up here for the lighting but on this one this one in Colorado this one of the notorious brands for dad folks Colorado's best ABS they're a real well known dad company and I don't think we've covered them on the channel honestly yet matches because most products would get that or buy them have it make the channel yet there's a first for everything both and now this product has common engine I want first I want what I like about a CBD Colorado's best aspirin is it comes with a cool sticker and they are well-known notorious brand folks throughout the United States this isn't just this isn't just I guess many Colorado more easy but I mean not so what far out over in the California cuz they got their own established notorious brains which we've also had on the channel on some of the older videos I think those were just flower screens but anyways I like Colorado - because it comes with a sticker guys and it is a well-known string put it on [ __ ] everybody knows you stoner lady yada-yada open it again remember this sign I stopped even tearing the seal all it does is make it easier time to get down around and they're not a seal the top or nothing does it block anyway remember what I always say one side top here other side to the side flap by hand wide open it also has a smell man y'all hear me talk about all the time that we don't get a lot of [ __ ] there's a lot of smells and you know and you know what we do I'm most as we get they got a slice in there no need a hint of his mouth ain't got some of them have more than others like I said folks this was the best dab honestly that I think I've ever done in my life it's that UK cheese sugar sauce you ain't seen the video on them folks go check it out anyways I got it open here bang you notice it's got that residue but anyways anyways yet she got these tears apart it's like that kind you want to keep her on a frozen pizza or maybe get it frozen before getting out and stuff like that it's chill and I'll lay it flat picked up the camera show you guys in me and I want to finish open there's some other stuff that's wild like Colorado's best dad and just a lot of stuff with it I think is just as sticky I believe usually all their products have a sticker them I think just got one yeah yes you got one down and he's got to get it out there we are but hey my cooling sticker that comes with it Colorado's best dad anyways I got a few of these stickers noticing if you notice already I'm like my player signing a few things in you but uh I'm gonna turn the camera around show you guys it all out out all out on the wax paper to assess you all right I got it turned around here and mean you know if you can see that but it's almost like seeping through the package it's real wet like you're almost sticks you'll see I've already tried this routine when I first get them folks I try them first thing before I make a video out of them and only the better products that I enjoy actually hit the channel and I make a video of that's why I can get look at it is tear apart a little bit select up see that strange more like a running sauce type sugar I don't know if you can see that but yeah it actually doesn't even see this here but it actually leaves a residue on the wax paper if you see that but I've been having a real hard time getting off like seeps through so I don't like that cause that kind of least a lot but the quality is pretty good this is at least a seat you know and I only put anything above fives on my channel or try I think it's a 6 or higher I'll put it on her because that's why I try when I first get him so both these so this is about a half a gram all right back edge 9 times says she already puts in my trusty dusting container and ya ain't use this [ __ ] cuz I still have that UK cheese left I've been very carefully kind of stretching it like I said some of the best I've done and I just wanted to touch with you guys so yeah that's what I'm saying I got this loaded up in the canister trusty dusty scoops and that will fit this room I'm just using the straw y'all know I've been using I got different straws me I got another glass straw man when you see me in the video but I I don't I like this I like just a regular glass straw I like the ones with a little double opinion them use their longer I broke this off and filed it honestly over time it's great way to keep using try it ain't yet I don't know gotta kind of know what you're doing what time yeah that says shoot me [ __ ] cheers y'all I'm like done a video in a minute it's been a little crazy actually I do post one of the day right but it's been a little crazy things been going on starting to slow down those I got another video coming up on another product I got in line I got two products laid out from all the ones we've been having leading videos on that I think are kind of standout and good I like it and as I've said before y'all see I says total THC on the potency table chart we didn't call it only 67 3 that's why we sad never really folks the best strain of flower flower that I've ever tried in my life was not the highest THC potency of flower I've ever tried in my life if that makes any sense to you know I'm saying the effects the taste the smell of my favorite kind was not also the highest THC potency none same and it was called strawberry cookies with a Z I mean the cookies real hard to find I'll actually put the strain info to that in the comments cuz if you find it at a dispensary know where it is anywhere in the United States let me know and that strawberry cookies with a Z onion I'll put the exact parental strains in the comments from everything there's only one article on the end of it me and my boy did it I'll have it in the description it's real British doing hard fun one more when I get ready to do a video on the other strain and I'll post them probably one to nine one more we shade everybody the supporter I think I got a video that's got like three thousand views so far that's pretty cool that's pretty late whatever I'm like hell yeah - whatever be like me but that's the Russia there's heart and I can't believe it was the it was just me unboxing the I didn't expect that but that's hella cool y'all really that's pretty good job I am doing a game like I said it's the first product by CBD I've had probably had I've had probably honestly five or six products that'll buy this company but only one like the last four months is came through and it was this actually made it most I've tried were actually over in Colorado and stuff but I would not have put none among the channel this one I actually would have actually made it but it still only Peaks it like a six on the HC crown 110 I mean did the THC crown won a teen chart I mean I want to say it's a good

medicine costs medical cannabis is a safe effective medicine never covered by insurance that patients struggle to afford we seek to help patients with serious medical conditions afford medical marijuana today i'm discussing three medical marijuana strains that all have banana in their names two indica dominant hybrid strains banana kush and banana og and a sativa dominant hybrid banana diesel these are sweet smelling and tasting strains that can relieve many medical symptoms so let's talk about these banana strains all medical marijuana patients should be knowledgeable about thc and cpd ratios the medical uses of all cannabinoids and terpenes in cannabis and strain types this will allow you to choose an effective strain that treats your medical symptoms with or without intoxication and other effects that you need use the links in the description for in-depth detailed resources including free downloads regarding all of these topics to help you in choosing a medical strain finding the right strain is the most important part of successful medical marijuana treatment these strains can demonstrate the typical effects of indica dominant and sativa dominant hybrid strains these are the effects most people experience when using these strains which could vary by individual due to our unique endocannabinoid systems and medical needs these are also the conditions patients have reported success in treating and not the only conditions these strains could treat the most important thing is the cannabinoids and terpenes in a strain the first strain banana kush is an indica dominant hybrid strain that gets its name from its sweet banana smell and taste banana kush is related to two other well-known strains o.g kush and skunk haze banana kush is a 60 40 indica dominant hybrid 60 indica 40 sativa hybrids are loved for their combination of energizing sativa effects and relaxing indica effects banana kush leans heavier on the indica side and is known as a relaxing strain that has some uplifting qualities it offers body relaxation but may not induce sleep these qualities are typical of many indica dominant hybrid strains since banana cush is a calming strain it is best used at night in the evening or during times of relaxation banana kush has 22 percent thc and less than 1 percent cbd with this 22 to 1 thc to cbd ratio it would produce euphoria or a high this is in the form of body relaxation with happiness and uplifting effects banana kush is a relaxing strain that treats pain quickly patients have found it effective in treating anxiety pain stress depression decreased appetite nausea and insomnia the next strain banana og pictured here is another indica dominant hybrid that is relaxing and calming without sedation typical of many indica dominant hybrid strains banana og is a 70 30 indica dominant hybrid 70 indica and 30 sativa making it a combination of indica and sativa effects with increased relaxing qualities it gets its name from its parents og kush and banana banana og has 25 thc and less than 1 cbd with this 25 to 1 thc to cbd ratio it would produce euphoric effects that relax the body and calm the mind it is best used at night in the evening or during times of relaxation patients have found success in treating spinal cord injuries pain stress inflammation muscle spasms decreased appetite and nausea with banana og however these are not the only conditions it could treat both banana kush and banana og would benefit any condition that needs body relaxation without sedation high thc nighttime relief improved mood appetite or sleep the final strain banana diesel is a sativa dominant hybrid and a more energizing strain than the previous two strains banana diesel is related to the first strain banana kush as well as super sour diesel as a sativa dominant hybrid and like many sativa dominant hybrids it is a more energizing uplifting strain and can best relieve symptoms when you need to be active and focused usually during the day banana diesel has 23 percent thc and less than 1 cbt with this 23 to 1 thc to cbd ratio it would produce euphuria in the form of a cerebral experience with body relaxation banana diesel promotes energy happiness focus and creativity with relaxed body effects patients have found it effective in treating shingles eye pressure stress depression pain inflammation and nausea but banana diesel could treat many conditions that need energizing effects high thc and daytime relief of symptoms these strains can give you an idea of the typical effects of indica dominant and sativa dominant hybrid strains it is always important to look at the individuality of strains and their unique cannabinoid and terpene profiles choose a strain that has cannabinoids and terpenes that

Welcome to Rew's Basement! I'm Rew, this is...not my basement! Anyways, this week I got some- What do I got? Sour Diesel? Got some Sour Diesel by Hoe-new? (Honu) Haw-new? I'm not sure how you pronounce that, but anyways,\nthey call it their Turtle Terp Line. Anyway, Sour Diesel, for those of you not\nfamiliar with it, it's a sativa hybrid- em- I don't know about a hybrid- but- I- Everything's\nreally a hybrid nowadays without the land strain. It's not a land strain, it's a hybrid to me. So, it's- it's a sativa- it's a sativa for\nthe most part. Anyways, it's really good in medical- medical\ndepression, um, that kind of thing. Ener- real energetic, uplifting, um, s- uh-\nit's- ba- what is it? Chemdawg 91 and Super Skunk are the believed,\num, parents of it. Nobody's really sure, it's kinda one of those\nmysterious strains. But, anyways, uh, we're gonna go ahead and\ndab on a little bit of it. You saw the up-close from the intro to the\nvideo. We're gonna go ahead and taste it right now. *takes dab*\nYou know, it's got that- that real earthy taste. You know, the Sour Diesel flower has that-\nhas a little bit of a- the diesel taste, you know, the NYC Diesel, uh, that kind of stuff. This really doesn't- I'm not really tasting\nthat, um, in th- in the extract, but I am getting a nice aftertaste. I- It just stays in your mouth- This is- This\nis by far one of the tastier- one of the tastier strains- and it- it stays tasty for a while\nand you've just got that- that taste permeating through your mouth. I've been- I've been- I been doin' on this\none for a while tonight so, yeah, it- it's nice. Sittin' about 79%, it says. Not one of the highest ones, but definitely\na tasty one, and, like I said, medically, it's- it's world renowned in the medical world\nso, if that's your thing you might wanna check that out. Me, on the other hand, I use it and wanna\ngo play some video games. I just got a brand new PS4, so I'ma go ahead\nand do that.

strains we were going to do each strain in a different bong but at the moment I just can't seem to locate the one more for my one bomb so after I rip from the first bone we're going to take a moment I'm going to pack that same bong again and then use that and look at that bowl later and look at the two strains here folks the one on the left fruit punch and fruit punch is known as a push and then this one right here folks strawberry diesel and yeah there's definitely some strawberry taste / scent to it just from you know like smelling it lightly but it's like my lips it's like whole a strawberry and that one's supposed to be fruit punch which is a push and one thing before we head on into the bowls yeah strawberry push or story strawberry diesel it's got some of the Strawberry Cough sativa to it and some of the hybrid New York City diesel and then with fruit punch here it's a hybrid but I'm not sure exactly what strains make it up and I don't know the THC content on strawberry diesel but for the fruit punch Kush um it can go up to around 20.4% so on that note folks we're going to start off with fruit punch then we have two paths another Bowl and OB strawberry diesel fire and whole and just like the smell and taste off the strawberry HOF [ __ ] line and some fruitiness off of government so this is the group punch pushed up by remote it took a few seconds I was thinking to myself okay it's not that super fruity and then all of a sudden not hardcore but all the signs of fruitiness popped up so it's definitely fruity and cush keeps us so high and kicks [ __ ] ass and anytime you have LG cush mixed in with a strain that's fruity doji hood helps bring it out because there was a time when I was doing a lot of the blueberry cush and that og brought out the blueberry and that more than any other blueberry strain I ever had oh yeah that is a little fruit punching not super hardcore but enough to get some notes of it in the milk so let's finish this bowl then I'm gonna go down and you're gonna wait I'm gonna bite back you know everyone this video ends up being long please stay tuned rip some balls smooth easy easy smoking strain it doesn't have any Hirsh knees to it and after you exhale a few seconds later some fruity notes do pop up fruit punch style and in a good way seems like it's kind of mellow on - hi - yeah but yeah oh of course coach indica what am I talking about anyways hold on a sec book like that strawberry one came from so how's everyone doing doo-doo-doo-doo how's everyone do you do stand up trying to splice up in two videos since the cameras already going that's it we're going to do it as one big video and folks I mean not a fatty strength before no hundred percent sure there's been times all right don't have the info but John no I'm going to say I probably haven't had any screens before because I'm this taste isn't like dead-on familiar for cannabis and then obviously I have not tasted any strawberry and astraying before that I can remember at least that I was not going to go crazy for probably so yeah that's a nice freakin fruit punch drink oh yeah cushion rules one of those awesome I'm Nicola so now we got the strawberry diesel in here that's a really calm strain well anyways Cheers strawberry diesel oh my goodness as the exhale was finishing some strawberry popped up and I can get a little bit of strawberry in the background I get some earthiness and a taste that I'm gonna say is that these will taste whole not not like eating a strawberry not exactly that way but it does give you a little strawberry taste mix in with earthiness and diesel taste these are two good strains but this one has mmm has a hybrid New York City diesel or snoot gap and the city bus driver very caught so with this one it's not feeling mellow like the other one I'm starting to feel this at evil upstair effects but it's not one of those holy crap super super crazy strong sativas but yeah so these are good fruity strings and to each their own but I'm still gonna say you're insane if you don't like the fruity strings firon whole and this one it's smoke not insanely harsh but there is some harshness to a compared to the other ones but I've had maybe a harsh restrain before and I would say the earthiness and especially the diesel pop up more into strawberry but it's in there and you might see me in a video with them both in a bowl or blunt or whatever so that was first fruit punch cush and then we finished with the strawberry diesel they both kick ass I've got a nice mellowness and actually a mellow sativa too with a little bit of heaviness those are great strings hope you enjoyed hope you got mad at cable with me I have a great one folks and until next time peace in the pot thank you for tuning in and there's still need buy video from tits beer bong course when you rock on time we have a guy coming up right now not only a [ __ ] city legend is becoming a 20-wide lunch walking watch

] [ __ ] I or say", "MyNQn0jL7pg": "what is up can of Fame and check it out for today's video I'm gonna be trying some of this sour tan G times the white honeycomb this is a hybrid by white label extracts and I'm really excited okay I've tried a lot of white label products here on my channel and I've been very happy with like 99% of them all right consistency is key when it comes to cannabis products here in the industry it's very key don't care what anybody else tells you consistency is key and white label is pretty consistent so I really enjoy that so for this video I'm gonna be testing this out putting this to the test this is coming in at 81 percent THC with no CBD big shocker I know and 2.76 percent on the terpenes on the flavor scale so again this is a honeycomb and I got it broken up here I got a video I'm gonna show you guys a better view of this on this video where it's not broken up it's in like a big form so you guys would get to see it when it's in like a cake form almost but right now it's a I have it all broken up into pieces but yeah I mean it's it's some nice stuff it's some very stable honeycomb okay you actually have to like break it up in order for it to just crumble it just doesn't you know fall to pieces right away and I also like to know that I mean it's got a good color to it it's got a nice good color to it some nice honeycomb it's an actual honeycomb huh alright so let's show you guys a better view of this product then let's get to smoking this so here's the honeycomb it is beautiful look at that honeycomb and look at the stability on the honeycomb it is perfect perfect little cake [Music] all right so for this dab I got the Oreo milkshake rig here by Empire Glass Works one of my favorite rigs by them just because I've had some people actually from a distance believe that it's a real Oreo milkshake it's really nice it's got the Oreo cookie up there all that dripping dripping in the chocolate sauce anyway so I got a nice little chunk here of the honeycomb I'm gonna try this out and I just want to say much love guys I hope you guys are having a good one thank you for watching my video appreciate it and let's put some of this white label to the test [Music] a bad first hit nah bad I'm a little disappointed so far because I'm not getting a whole lot of the tangi anybody who's had tangi knows it's super potent on the terpenes go [Music] it's not bad it's definitely definitely a hitter okay I'm not gonna say it's a heavy hitter but it's definitely a hitter you can definitely feel it's got a good height to it but I'm a little disappointed just because anybody who's ever smoked Angie before any kind of tangi doesn't matter for sour tangi tandjile and tangi whatever it doesn't matter okay you know that tan G's got that suspect irking to it that just you know it's got tangi and unfortunately I think this one leans a little bit more on the white side okay so this is a sour tangi but it also is crossed with the white all right so I think it leans a little bit more on the white side because I can kind of get that not getting so much of anything sour or tangi on that so a little disappointed because I love sour tangi I do a little quick little Reedy purr just because I don't like wasting my dabs I feel like I'm just wasting it if I just q-tip a pool of dabs out of there and it's just uh it's just a pet peeve of mine I mean some people's cool with and others whatever [Music] let me know if you're a fan of tangi in the comments section below on this video okay because I love it it's I'm not gonna say it's in like my top 5 favorite strains but it's definitely up there [Music] still nice even on the reheat still nice bonus points for the reheat tasting still somewhat smooth okay because a lot of times when you reheat some dabs like that even if it's just for a few seconds it still doesn't taste as it is the original dab obviously but it's still smooth so bonus points overall I would give this product a thumbs up not to just one just just a good thumbs up it was $24 recreationally for this gram of honeycomb which is really good it is trust me and medically of course I believe I paid medically eighteen dollars for this now that depends on what dispenser you go to you'll probably get it for more likely 20 20 20 to 18 depending on again what dispenser you go to to pick it up at but $24 for recreational which is a great great deal for some nice honeycomb like this okay it's not bad it's got it's got a good you know profile to it I was just a little bit disappointed like I said just because I guess my expectations going in to this dab was a little too much on the tangi side you know what I mean I didn't really expect the the white to be more dominant in the terpene you know Department but it is what it is and overall I still give it a big thumbs up alright don't give it a big thumbs up not two but one big thumbs up alright so if you enjoyed this video if you like white

and it's been flowering for about ten weeks now and you can see it still has white hairs most of it's pretty much brown hairs but it still has a Brad we one second let me pull it a little closer make sure my lightsaber burning it my fans in the [ __ ] way and I like throwing away [Music] [ __ ] get you guys a better view from the bottom can get it in there turn it around get one of these shots better here we go [Music] it's [ __ ] crystally but I'm getting bugged already man this is my 10th week of growing and it still [ __ ] throwing white pistols come on now you know enough already come on start [ __ ] throwing Brown pistols and only Brown so I can harvest as you can see my leeks are yellow is because I've been flushing already for about three weeks about two weeks two and a half weeks I don't know maybe longer I have no ideas up here starting to get like a little pinkish purple ten ugly at least but it's alright the bud still good over here my newest addition to this well a budding wise let's see if I can get you there to talk shop kind of going purple already and the temperatures are not here this is mr. nice guy perv well it's pretty uh the buds are for forming pretty decent you know not bad about a lot of branches what I want to ask you guys is for the growers that are experienced out here you know the really experienced ones I have that purples you know the perfect going on not no purple stem but her believes you know what can I do to help that shade get out you know I flush my plans very often and I hear people saying that it's like a buildup of nutrients or some kind of lockout or something you know I hear that all the time that my plants have like a stalks in it you know and well not my plants but the reason why it's purple is because I was like a toxin in it and that's the reason why they go purple like that well I flush the [ __ ] out of over the still doesn't help them so I don't know what the hell do you know alright here's one of my newer ones that came in the flower box just recently is my OG Kush stems getting very fat honest good branches thick branches right here is what I talk to that still no signs yet I don't think I've been looking pretty often right in this area right here for the people that I'll know when it does turn female or male the sexes will show right there right in that area that's where my hairs will pop out or the seeds whatever you know all in sacks or the little pistols depending on what it is hope it's a female I took two clothes of it and it's in those roller pots and a really good thing over here I'm not even sure how many weeks it is in the flour maybe about two weeks three weeks so I don't know I haven't really been keeping up with this plan I haven't really been given it nutrients you know just a little bit of flushing here and there damn it's looking good [Music] like I said guys this is my Sour Diesel when it's ten weeks in a flower the hell do I do with the white pistol would you guys pick it would you guys let it grow longer than ten weeks come on now I'm on my ten weeks already that's [ __ ] a ten week strain that's all it should go but it's still going alright so this seems going on they're here got another little baby it's an OG Kush seed it's a purple OG Kush back here I know they're looking kinda bad and all that but this is my oh gee cush I had the one that's in the flower box and my other one over here back here is a purple OG Kush also and this beast right here is Casey Jones for the people no normal Casey Jones is Casey Jones is a trainwreck cross with Sour Diesel crossed with the tie and it comes with this [ __ ] right here Casey Jones and my god these [ __ ] these branches my goodness they're just growing on top of each other the [ __ ] stem is like oh my god it's almost two sides two times thicker than a closed clothesline closed hangar or whatever the hell well yeah as you can see it's growing very healthy there is no burn there's no damage it's a very green healthy plant get it off ah [ __ ] what the hell is a I don't know what that is I just noticed that right now [Music] see my lights might have touched another t-shirt I got a couple more plants over here give me one second to get them one second guys I don't want the window sill that way we had a really nice day today out here and I wanted the sunlight you know the natural sunlight to help them out I'm going to go to get them out and show you guys alright right here is my white rhino see it's growing very good very healthy starting to throw off little branches already my white rhino looking very damn good all right over here is a clone that I took of my mr. nice guy that's in my flower now the one that's flowering in mr. nice guy this is a clone I took of it and I clipped off all the leaves you know like all I made them all flat like that and you can see I got a lot of new growth you know it's already throwing a lot of deep roots and then over here really popping out but I have another mr. night uh what the hell is this oh gee cush another og cush purple purple OG Kush whatever the hell you want to call it we'll put this back in there right away that's right right there rearrange my plans I have like I said I took these out so it could be in the sunlight for a little bit all right so there's my little ugly clone yeah it's pretty ugly but it's coming back so that's all that matters it's actually alive now so I'll probably be sticking that outside in about a week maybe two weeks when he gets a little warmer you know the day times are really nice but nighttime is one cold [ __ ] all right done there yeah oh yeah here's this other one guys forgot to show you this one this is also purple OG Kush yeah man I planted so many of those og pushes you know I'm not sure guys I it might just be regular OG Kush but I'm pretty sure I said purple OG Kush when I got it it's not a 100% sure if you're I'm wrong correct me but I'm pretty sure that's called purple OG Kush so there's our one purple OG right there right right now mr. nice guy purple OG Casey Jones purple OG purple and just regular g.push to clothes so back to my flower box as fast as I can it's my video doesn't get too damn long give you guys a little shot of my back buds I harvested awhile about a week ago or two weeks ago whatever you can get this [ __ ] to focus yeah you can't really see it very well bloods better go here I'll pop out a button guys [Music] this is after caring for about five days maybe six days I'm not sure it's been hanging drying for about six days and I've been carrying it for about four or five days maybe six at the highest dam at this camera just not wonderful I'll give you guys another shot of these other bugs popcorn buds [Music] all right more so yeah look I'm asking you guys what would you guys do with this would you guys pick this plant it's on ten weeks today actually tomorrow is going to hit the ten week marker would you pick it with a cup with all these white hairs would you let it grow a little longer and see if all these white hairs start turning red would you guys do having a hard time with this I'm having I'm wanting a pick it so bad the end I see all these white pistols that it discourages me no I don't want to pick it when I see all those right like that but like I said I do have a lot of orange pistols to going I don't know so alright you guys I'm going to leave it on that and I'll be making another video right after this one for everyone that always asked me to show my grow box I've been telling them I will haven't made no

and i'm not the [ __ ] expert okay i'm not trying to sound like an expert i don't know everything okay but i'm [ __ ] i have common sense okay like i [ __ ] i know two plus two equals four okay it's not that [ __ ] hard some pink lemonade some cured rosin and some gelato so i have a little bit left of each one i'm just going to make some all throw it in the car to see what happens at the rosin not the rosin there's not really anything left of it but this rosin bro a little a little goes a long way so all right y'all we got the gelato we got the forbidden tangie and then we got the rosin the gelato is going to be the uh white dab the forbidden tang is going to be that yellow dab and the rosin is going to be that sauce right there man let's see how this [ __ ] goes bro i'm kind of hung over today drinking some honey yesterday bro i threw up in the morning but not like a lot it was like literally like nothing let's go ahead and come to the closet because i don't want to dance oh [ __ ] we get hella taste the rosie overpowered all that um [ __ ] gave me red nose oh what makes a cartridge fake um is so so what makes a cartridge fake is if it's not from the dispensary if it's not from the dispensary it's a fake cartridge this point black period if you cannot find that cartridge in a dispensary it is not a real cartridge it is fake that goes for primal that goes for like what is it avion or something like that like those disposables that goes for [ __ ] um i think tko i don't think tko was ever in a dispensary that goes um brands like that bro can it clear that's not a real brand but i have heard can the clear supposedly like coming from a legit source and that they're really clean but i'm gonna get into that also so that being said raw garden all that those are gonna be the rawguard so that being said he said raw garden plug-in plug-and-play [ __ ] um jetty carts um kingpin uh ursa cartridges those are all gonna be real cartridges right but those brands are so big that people that don't even go to dispensaries know about those cartridges it's just like having fake louis vuitton or fake gucci except this isn't just clothes like you're not just talking about clothes no more you're talking about something that's going to be in your lungs so you want to make sure the stuff that you're getting is fully [ __ ] tested and doesn't have any [ __ ] in there oh bro it's [ __ ] this is your [ __ ] lung this is your life your life is depending on the [ __ ] you know kids die kids have died because of fake cartridges kids end up in the hospital because of that bro that's what makes a fake cartridge but with all that being said there is companies out there that are are supposedly legit right where they have all this testing done and they know it like they're the ones who made it from the from the beginning blah blah blah right okay cool saying saying it is saying it is tested and it is clean once it gets to the hands of somebody in the streets you guys know this bro the street has no [ __ ] rules no rules whatever is in the streets you can't really complain about it if you get robbed for buying drugs what are you gonna do tell the cops that you've got robbed for buying drugs like there's no rules in the streets so saying i sell somebody this pugging them they don't really make i don't think they make fake plugin plays because they have to do like a whole battery within and [ __ ] like that so companies should really start doing that they have they should make it where you need a whole [ __ ] kid just to use the cartridges like you're going to end up wasting more money but at least they're not going to be [ __ ] replicating your brand that's unselfish for me to say because i could just be like nah [ __ ] that i don't care i know i'm going to a legit dispensary and i'm getting it reeled every time but there's people that you know can't go through that and they can end up with fake real cartridges but back to what i was going to say man i could sell somebody this this plug-and-play right and i could and i got it from the dyspo right but that person could do whatever the [ __ ] he wants with it he could he could take half of it out put it in another cartridge put some function in there put put some function in the other one and now you have two cartridges for one and boom that's that's 60 bucks a pop that's 120 in your pocket just like that that's the streets you don't know what the [ __ ] is gonna happen let it be from somebody who's given to you straight up who's not making money off of you or if they are making money off of you at least like make sure it's sealed make sure they like you have the receipt from the cup make sure they have the receipt of them buying it from a couple days ago bro like this shit's not [ __ ] a toy bro like this is your luck some people can't afford to make these cars legit um they have you know the whole the whole thing the whole [ __ ] that all these real companies got and they have that stuff but to get your uh cartridge in the dispensary that's like a whole nother story you gotta pretty sure you gotta know people for that at that point your your your brand has to have a certain amount of sales i remember i had a homie who was making his own cartridges and he was telling me that he was like trying to get it into the dispensary and she's like that i'm pretty sure he was capping but he was said that he was trying to get into the dispensary and that they need to show proof of a certain amount of sales every year to show that you know they're going to sell product and you know you gotta go through a lot of [ __ ] and i'm pretty sure you have to pay money and the other route you could take is just making your own damn dispensary but that's a whole lot of [ __ ] money and some people you could say that they do have clean products but at the end of the day they could just be saying whatever the [ __ ] they want to say at the end of these these boxes man all this writing could be duplicated easily it could be duplicated but when you go to a dispensary and you see these percentages and you see all this other stuff it's not made up it's not a made-up number if you see a cartridge and the cartridge has the percentage of thc printed on the box you see all these all these thc percentages on here man on all of these bro they're all stickers they're all stickers how do you they don't know what it's going to be they don't know the percentage look these are all stickers you could all take them off they put it on later they have the boxes laid out for all their strains but look even this this is all sticker it's all just a sticker it's not it's not printed on there so that's one thing you could easily tell if the [ __ ] percentage of the thc is printed on there bro dip just leave and then you have a company like fireman right where they do have the sticker percentage um the tc percentage on the stickers the strangers on the sticker but look look at all this stuff bro non-gmo this could just be printed bro who knows you're not guaranteed to have a safe product it's just you know i'm saying like i don't know i feel like some people are gonna comment and still not [ __ ] understand bro some people are gonna comment some dumb [ __ ] like but this is this video is for the people who want to know who want to be smart about what the [ __ ] they're doing and not end up a [ __ ] tweet like me and i'm not sure there's anything else i need to include i think that should be it to be honest um i don't know man most of you that are watching i'm sure you're in california bro once you're 18 just get yourself a [ __ ] dispensary license and a medical card i mean and just go to the [ __ ] dispensary yourself bro you'll be a lot better bro you're smoking exactly what you read on the box the strain all that [ __ ] if it's in the goodness just straight in the tv it's going to be as a tv filming it was og's lge it was gelato's gelato like that's how dispensary is so yeah like i said man i'm about to make a video on this um dispensary pickup that i just got um i got another strain not gelato but the same brand of these two was like a 818 right a 1a brand collaboration with bear labs and then the other one is like a different uh brand collaboration so make sure to check that out man that's going to be it for this video hopefully

CCC I'm Shane tow and we have got a constant rate review for you guys today checking out I think this is the first time we've done a review on the Gold Coast extract yes these guys popped up a little while back and have been doing a lot of really fired up runs uh you should brought up a couple of samples yeah I think we've all met him right here their cups or something like that I'm the cool dudes and it makes a bomb oil and I was down at the Bertoni show for a what does that called the goose fire gallery in Long Beach and I head over to hang out with them and they had some of this og Thin Mints times purple snow and it is Turkey so it's so it's so they put two strains in this it was og Thin Mints cross so Girl Scout cookies boji and then with what some purple snow in my opinion the perps know pretty much overtakes the the whole thing on the flemings talking to further the whole driver so the perps note my opinion kind of overtakes the power a little bit more really stinky it's it's per Peter P that's for sure it smells like that that good old school berkel or something just straight great be sweet can be like yeah and then like a turn but it definitely looks nice house like a really it's good really light got kind of a little bit of go yeah Goldy orange II kind of tint to it but the look and smell so far are really on point it's a little bit more like the it's not straight shatter or straight sap it's kind of in the middle which is more like bravery a little bit the south side let's say dude ha no it's more set the oil that I've been smoking lately I said big in the set me too in my opinion sap is the best oil a lot of extract artists on us it's easier to purge then the real chattery stuff that comes out real hard and chattery it's more of a strain dependent thing you know I like suck it's just like every time I yeah every time I get some stuff that's really gooey and sappy like this it happens to also be really really stinky tasty so that's kind of I'm hoping forward this one we busted out the villagey 2 today for the first time in a long time two of the oldest pieces in our collection is probably together and I have a few things we'll do the oldest vela many - yeah yeah and chocolate collab over there I think that was this fourth mini - right mini - number three and four right next to each other so that's cool since I've actually used to raise these awesome I still love it sometimes it's for a little bit but then it when it comes out it's very much my bus I just got in a while but yeah why don't I hit this one yeah hi this meeting carved a carving in the ground had to hit up a couple spots dude I am getting kind of a cookie flavor off this it's like under there I mean obviously it's firm right a little as soon as the smoke gets your mouth you taste prayer a lot of times I don't get a lot of flavor on a dab or it hit it anything until the exhale thanks Hales usually a lot stronger for me for this one the inhale was really really / P and then on the exhale I almost got a hint of that kind of doughy cookie flavor that we've you know become used to recently it's pretty nice you're our captain you got the infinity now on there it seems a cool man you can use that any piece fit any piece of your collection which is definitely pretty nice that woman got a shorter hole in the middle it's it about you for Bobo yeah woo oh right upstairs for the first 80% of the taste experience I'm so tasting it it's totally perfect and then you get a little bit of cushiness and a little bit of the dough cookie dough II hanging around for a little bit but pure slap in the face for a while lastly as I breathe out now what's kind of left on the palate is a little bit of pushing this a little bit of OG a little bit of 15 minutes in there but I was just kidding herpy doughy it would have been nice to see the the product that went into this I'm sure it was pretty fire yeah they crisp yeah you can definitely tell you can tell by smelling this and then once you take a dab definitely is a nug run and man mmm I bet those were some fire nuts cuz this [ __ ] really really stinks super perky man I would have any I haven't really had any purple or any perfect dominant oil lately so it's good to get some purple your life sometimes kind of rainy day today actually not not really raining but it's looking like it's about to yeah and sometimes it's nice to just sit inside on the rain dance party and then kind of shitty up here it's usually really sunny you know usually more shitty done done by the done with the beach and stuff and I don't my syrup in the mountains Joe come on dude I'm feeling this stuff right away her eyes up this morning want some weed so these are my first abs of the day but regardless as the stuff should really come on strong yeah we get to rely on business at cold temperatures Wow yeah that's a really really strong flavor Jesus I really like this up pretty smooth they actually have a butter version of the shatter of the SAP 2 they butter it on the tray I did was actually really good um I don't know I guess the chatter cuz I'm used to the look of the SAP and stuff but taste wise I couldn't tell any difference the butters you know different they just made it into butter after already shot I you guys don't know how bad I wish we had smell-o-vision so I can just hold it up like that and let you guys get a whiff of it definitely some of the stronger smelling oil that I've come across lately and that's gonna give it some bonus points for me for sure I'm gonna give this stuff yeah I'm gonna say 9 9 10 man this is this is some really really really good stuff yeah and a little bit of that kind of subtle cookie after 10 - yeah it's nice to smoke well that kind of has that double flavor you know or layers of flavor kind of an inhale flavor and exhale flavor oh I think that's what's kind of cool about oil and concentrates in general too is like obviously when you're growing weed you can cross two strings together to get a mix but when you're when you just have been waiting that so you don't necessarily really know what you're gonna get you know in some sense you do because you know what the parents are like well when you have two finished products right next to each other I would imagine it must be cool to just you know be mixing flavors all the time hash making - you know what something that generally has a really strong inhale with yeah has a really strong exhale I love it because also when you're getting when you're consuming it getting stoned on it it's kind of hitting you at kind of different levels you know what I mean like you get a high from a cookie angle and good rapper Bangalore United mean kind of [ __ ] you up a little more I like that nowadays people are throwing half this and half that to two but three quarters this and a quarter that that's you've been making oil out of you know different different flavors I don't know if it's the influence of all the different things went into making this oils like strain wise or whatever but it's definitely you know a nice full body smoke that gets you full body high you know digging it

start this for any further the clean cards moderators i do not know any of them i don't give a [ __ ] about any of them uh because most of you guys say that they're mostly douche bags and stuff and

be some because people are you know still going to be questioning what card they have if it's legit or not and uh most mostly on here you're gonna see legit [ __ ] and i'm interested to see what's legit in oregon washington colorado all that stuff so i feel like these videos they uh show shed light into that you know ever more dark safety but recently learned about reagents and leeches during isomerization and when i understand the only d8 that steak will be extracted from real cannabis to avoid these leftover cans and crusts however these are sold in dispensers possibly because of height delta 9. what method which method to make delta 8 is used to get a real clean stuff and not bathroom chems or is it all blue also i don't care about your favorite brand coa unless you got tests for reagents and bleaches i like you you get it from what i understand the only thing this is the case which method to make d8 it could be clean but they did a lot of lots of cleanup work after the synthesis but not real rn no one test enough for us consumers to know and worse every time so far that brand has been independently tested it variably turns out to be low potency and contaminated to be considered clean synthesized or hemp derived d8 must have safety tests for each and every of the following solvents metals pesticides microbes mycotoxins and reagents and bleaches block to prevent the chills from the dirty pizza from telling you to smoke their dirty deed so disturb spark or whatever i think i mentioned him in the last video he's one of the guys that a lot of people are saying is a douche bag in some sort of way and um he brought up some really good valid points you know obviously d8 has to be safe when it comes out from what i've tried from delta it seems like pretty good you know this is just some stuff maybe that they write to scare people honestly i don't know but uh it is some good stuff that they brought up because obviously you would want your delta eight stuff tested as much as your delta knight and i do see that um but speaking for myself the delta eight brands that i've tried delta eight hemp moon walker serene tree all pretty good i didn't taste any you know chemically ass taste or anything it was just you know some good old distillate and stuff um but then again distillate can be you know iffy as well you know you really can't tell um but just be safe you know just be aware of certain brands and just look out for your own health at the end of the day um like i said this this guy right here that brought up the d8 very good questions but uh i'm gonna have to say that the guy that responded is a moderator of this and he's been known to be like questionable you know what i'm saying like i don't know garlic cookies life hazard ross or live hash rosin cartridge clean pleasant trees that's a [ __ ] nice name liquid trite okay yeah this is only a half gram too it's probably worth so much we're selling for so much real or fake there's the flare right there it says fake and y'all i need help bought this from the weed man and i can't tell if it's there's no lighting and it came in a plastic bag came in a plastic bag come on can i post a picture of a few raw ground cards to help try and verify authenticity and see the community's minions 99.5 percent sure they are real from this message just am super skeptical about cards given my poor health but lemonade lemon pepper from cookies in there not bad yeah i don't [ __ ] with i don't [ __ ] with half gram cartridges or i mean i do but i don't [ __ ] with companies that only sell half gram questions i think that is some [ __ ] [ __ ] and i think that that's their way of saying hey i want your money and i want you to pay for less or get less from it so to be honest anything any company that's still to this day only half grams and are selling it for 60 to 70 for a half gram [ __ ] you washington dispensary anyone tried 30 a gram put in a card in the skittles tastes like grape soda with the hint of wine that's crazy this doesn't taste like great so this is delta eight as well and honestly this is one of the smoothest hitting cartridges that i've tried are none like for distillate usually i'm coughing well most of the time when i'm hitting this is plug play and those those pods and that battery they'd be hitting of course you'll be coughing but this is very a smooth this is a very smooth experience i believe moonwalker is also featured in high times too so i don't know if that brings you some sort of uh clarity but i mean it's it's high time right cheers all right where can i get this tested i know it's fake but i'm curious just about how just i'm just curious to how bad found it on my sister come on bro what the [ __ ] is this 1.1 like what stop solvent free 97 tac like what solvent free or solvent lists and there's a difference right i believe solvent free is no solvents in it at the end product solvent list is extracting without solvents so what that's at best is going to be distillate uh making my own cards terps plus delta e can i mix tears in delhi i want to buy from natural extractions so i've read something about we don't really know how much terpenes we're supposed to be in taking so it's not really good to mix terps homemade you know you don't know the right amount you're not a scientist you know what i'm saying and most of these guys on here aren't scientists as well they ain't going to be able to tell you how much terps and all that stuff to mix delta 8 with so just be careful with that do your research uh i recently just saw that article so it could be like some brand new study or something but it says something about not taking too much or too much terpenes might be a bad thing if uh paraphrase it oil forms around oils from local dispensary here in miami truly i think i've seen truly videos and they're from florida so that should be good i don't know uh the cartridge scene in florida so if if true leaves are fake then just be careful you know what i'm saying you eat raw garlic let's see peanut butter bread sauce never seen this [Music] looks okay that looks so lame with their instagram handle right there on that packaging it looks so crafty looks good west coast cars real or fake no comment i do have some west coast wax though actually no more but did i have some very popular in my state i mean you know a couple people with them obviously improvement there's no branding and everything do you think it's fine because they're getting high i'm not sure i'm just going to pass that anyone recognize this brand as a fake oh sorry it's fake live terpenes delta 9 thc distillate cartridge live terpenes huh not live rising terpenes just live terpenes how do you spot a fake delta eight disposable my buddy runs the smoke to tell me this but there's nothing but the paper and vaping inside come on bro getting from a smoke shop albeit there probably are some delta good delta 8 products and some smoke shops but are you willing to take that risk buying it no like when you can buy it online these people these are the type of people that want it right now they can't wait they can't wait to order online they want to go to a smoke shop and get it they want a little club and get it they want to go to their buddy and get it no patience on these guys really all i have access is to black market but dispensary or so can i put that rsl on but it's working possibly it was probably going to make your butt taste like [ __ ] i bought rso before and i thought it was just regular dab i thought hey you know in a syringe it it was black as [ __ ] i dabbed it it tasted like [ __ ] rso is for the medicinal side rso means rick simpson oil and i guess that's the guy who like popularized it or made it or so so uh you basically use it to to fix your ailments you know what you're smoking on tonight that is the yocan right i believe okay cleaner trash this brand from a local dealer there yet [Music] keep fake carts it's your plug okay i'm gonna end this like if you're getting it from the plug 99 of the chance it's fake you know there's maybe a one percent chance that plug can somehow get it from from the real [ __ ] but come on from the plug from snapchat like really that's gonna be end of this clean carts video hopefully you did enjoy this one i believe this is number four or so let me know in the comments if you did enjoy it let me know if you want a part five and uh like i said like when you comment and leave likes it it motivates me to do more of these and like i said i'm gonna try and get this out today today is tuesday tuesdays i usually go live but i'm thinking that since i'm not going live anymore maybe just do reaction videos on tuesday and maybe on friday as well but or rest it just depends on my mood i guess that day but hopefully you did enjoy this video uh like i said let me know if you want to part five and i'll see you guys in the next one [Music] so", "Z9t4tkZgRIQ":

ocean collective hold on one sec okay so from taking it out of the bag this one looks the most like girl scout cookies in my opinion only because of this dark nugga right here you can tell there's little hints of purple on it hold on let me really focus hints of purple on it and the fluffiness of it is really nice if those fluffy not as sticky as the other one I mean it's kind of getting on my skin but not really what bothers me is that little popcorn burnish right there we're going to macro that in a second but overall looks frosty smells delicious wait till you see this in the macro

you know haven't smoked in to these yet so we're gonna have to see which one really gets us which was the most powerful but and see it's a burnt leaf right there huh I think it's apparently I so I

right so moving on from that as you guys know today's tuesday man and we're moving up on this ship man shipband's coming up march 27th um and like i said we're still not 100 sure other than the fact that we know that the end consumer is going to have an issue getting uh stuff shipped to them through usps fedex or the postal service however we do know that the one way to get around uh this shipman is to be a business have a business license and get wholesale accounts now for you folks out there that don't know you can easily apply for an ein with the irs which is totally free and get a business license or you know if you've got these convenience stores or these vape shops around your area and you'd like you know go ahead and combat this uh vape band from the get-go because really the vape band was designed to it was not designed to touch delphi really what it was designed to do was to touch these e-cigs and it was designed to put the onus on store owners to check um the ids of these guys coming in and getting these uh vape products but with way the way they wrote the law of and they stuck this in the pork of the stimulus bill the first year um but the way they wrote the law it actually extends out and touches everything bait and so as of march 27th um i've heard march 27th april first april 26th but on this channel we're going to talk about march 27th is the closest day uh you know uh you know prepare for the worst and hope for the best um but the the but the deal is that uh you guys can get those get those people to get wholesale accounts contact me at 334-830-8151.com let them get a wholesale account uh if they've never had deltae products in their store before they will not have created any bad habits by starting you know to get stuff that we've reviewed on this channel uh but if they have delta e products in their store um we'll send them out free samples man and they'll find out that what we're talking about on this channel is the real deal and they'll also find out that the prices are much better than what they're getting from those distributors off the truck you take that m a smoke shop or any of these uh just you know these local convenience stores around here they're all dealing with the same distributor and they all have basically the same stuff in their shop and that distributor doesn't know anything about delta a doesn't know anything about cbd he's just looking for a mass-produced product and that comes at a price of low quality and and you take uh you know her down there at the mma smoke shop she's got everything that she ever got off those watered-down delta a carts off that distributor truck for 35.99 and you got and she's got delta farms and blue moon in there for 34.99 personally it wouldn't matter to me if it was 45.99 because like i said before the purpose of this channel is to find the best lda products we can and um obviously you know my goal is to hope you know is the hope that you guys don't make the same mistakes i can if you see a you know you see me do a review on here it's a crappy product hopefully you guys will gravitate towards something that's a little bit better so moving on from that um uh talking about just letting you guys know i got a letter from a guy today or uh talking on youtube and he's over in the uk and we're talking back and forth and he's trying to get some stuff shipped over to him and he asked about this notice to law enforcement now there's a lot of companies out there that are putting this notice to law enforcement in their um in their packages when they send out usually it's a piece of paper as you can see blue moon is a little bit of cardboard box but basically this is just a letter to the law enforcement man letting them know uh that this is a hemp product that is you know it's totally legal totally illegal to buy over the counter to any at any business in the united states i think there's a couple states that actually do regulate it like three or four five i believe but either way uh the majority of the states this is this is legal all the way around and i think those states that that don't have it in theirs because they haven't figured out how to regulate it yet but the fact of the matter is the 2018 farm bill makes delta eight a hemp derived product totally 100 federally legal okay and that's what this card is and for you folks out there that are riding around and i'm guilty of this too i've been preaching this for quite a while you should have one of these in each one of your vehicles just throw in the glove box um you can throw in your centerpiece or whatever the case is uh the ones that are pieces of paper like i said you go to my my site which is whatever guy shop.com and you can go down into the blog and you can find notice law enforcement and download that okay and just keep a copy of that in your wallet man you know if you're walking around hanging out and then it's let's be honest man if i was to roll up on you and you were smoking you know you were vaping this or you were hitting on any of this stuff here i know for a fact you know i at least in my mind i think that you were smoking pot so let's be honest man in a cool way now and again this might not save you you know i understand this is a market employee but you know but why not try it you know what i mean it may save you some trouble at least at least add a little bit of uh uh you know genuine uh what you're telling is the truth when they pull you over and they get this we had a guy out in north carolina got pulled over for and i haven't still heard the end of this yet by the way but i got a message from a guy over north carolina he gets pulled over and because his delta farm stuff smelled like him and they thought it was uh and they thought it was weed they took it from him and they were going to test it for uh i guess stealth and i thc i'm assuming that he's okay because it obviously doesn't have any delta knight toc in it um but the fact of the matter is it smells like it it looks like it and you and it does the same effect some of the same effects as delta intc so why wouldn't it be that you know so if you're a cop you know i get it but if you're if you're the end consumer man it's just cool man to keep one of these in your car man unless you just be safe all the way around okay so as you guys know i'm in my location down here in pine hill alabama and we've been remodeling this place for a while uh running up on a deadline for myself you know basically and like i told you guys before i've been doing a lot of handyman work i've run hand-in-hand business and i had gotten away from that recently uh more or less you know doing stuff online but as i need the money to remodel this store here i've been doing um some handyman work and so the lady missed carol smith over in sweetwater alabama that i've been working for the last couple weeks and i've got some other work scattered around but she's she's my main focus of work i've been looking for some kitchen cabinets for a couple weeks and um i had went to meridian and bought some kitchen cabinets and they just weren't the right ones uh you know i ended up keeping them from my store but the fact that matters i ended up running over montgomery alabama um uh yesterday to pick up uh a drawer set and another kitchen cabinet for her and was at home depot over on east boulevard in montgomery alabama now when i left when i went in there i had a certain amount of money that i was going to spend and i ended up getting the drawer cabinet for like half off because it had this little damage on it that i could easily fix and so i was you know when i walked out i was kind of stoked i actually had extra money in my pocket the first thing i did was got on and started looking for vape shops so the first place i went to i ended up stopping at the only place i ended up stopping at because i got what i needed right there at haiti's apes uh this place is a heavy base in montgomery alabama so 505026 vaughan road uh the phone number is 334-398-8691 i went in there yesterday and i walked in and immediately somebody said hey welcome to heady vapes and so i got in there and i got to talking around and there was two guys in there one was a big round one was a skinnier guy i could tell that the bigger guy was really not happy with me asking questions that i was asking i was probably asking some questions uh that were probably more designed for the owner i just felt like you know with them being working in the store that they might have a little bit more knowledge on it i think the one question i asked him was if he had because they actually have their own brand of delta eight in that place and i was really interested in that because as i said before we're talking about this talking about this vape man and all that coming up you know i wanted to go in and see if they had some flowers and vapes and stuff like that and i actually ran across some good stuff um so i was asking you know what i asked you was i said if you had one product to put forward and you know you know for your brand what would it be and of course the guy was a little bit edgy about it now the other guy he was extremely knowledgeable um both of them were knowledgeable but one guy i think was a little bit uh you know and i recognize it because i get it myself had a little bit of anxiety about me asking me questions and stuff like that i get it man because i'm in the same boat that's why i do the uh delta eight in the first place and i apologize for that um but the other guy uh actually the first guy that i talked about that i thought maybe was getting a little anxious to be asking questions he introduced me uh to their flower they have they have their own flower at uh heady vapes in montgomery alabama uh this one is the kush and then one is the diesel they don't have it's not og kush it's just kush and diesel what i did was they had one gram uh cups like this for ten dollars a piece and i was able to pick each of those out because that's what he recommended and then the other guy apparently he might be the vapor out of the group he was the one that recommended this earthy now uh vape card lemon skunk vape card that i got so uh this is their brand and heady vapes now i don't know if they have any um wholesale accounts i don't know if they're doing any mail order i know they don't have a website um i i go into these stores and i wonder you know what they're thinking about you know it's almost like they're trying to hide a secret but the fact you know how you know secrets bro i mean here's the deal if you had the secret to cancer why would you hide it i mean my but i you know everybody thinks i got like corn on the market you know you could fill these up in your own backyard if that's what you wanted to do folks so you're not cornering a mark or anything like that um he's got this guy here man this earthy now is a really good product um there's a couple issues about it that i don't know i can tell obviously that he's not trying to ship these out he's probably not trying to get any further than what he's got going on that little corner market he's got going on um i i you know i think that's a a mistake you know by not branching out that's just my opinion um i'm gonna try to contact this guy later on and find out if he's got wholesale accounts any type of affiliate things going on like that because uh really what i found was between these two flowers um these are really good flowers that they've got infused with delta a okay and this car is a really good car before i even made it to the interstate i knew i had a good car uh as you can see it doesn't have any coas on it okay but um i'll read the back of it here and it says this is earthy now and it contains less than point three percent delta intc uh for ages 21 and over do not operate machine or vehicle while under the influence of this product consult a healthcare professional before using effects of hemp products may be delayed after two hours do not consume more than once every 12 hours this product may cause you to fail a drug test that's true all right and if you look on the side it's uh says lemon skunk and then the other side is from cannabinoid rich organic hemp but again we don't have any uh any milligrams of delta atc we don't have any coas on or anything like that um there's uh really nothing else on here it's just uh in a sense i mean other than the fact that this is a really [ __ ] good car this almost looks like a garbage like a like a gas station car like if i had walked into a gas station and saw this i wouldn't buy this at all um so the packaging is a little innocuous um i think that they could probably do something better with the packaging but that doesn't take away from what's inside this car man this is a really really good card the only down draw the cart that i saw um that i as you can see i've used i'll put my hand up behind it it's got a nice gold tint you can see there's quite a bit out of it because i've been vaping on it um you know all day yesterday or at least half a day yesterday and you know and some this morning um and i've baked on it pretty good uh it's a really viscous liquid as you can hold it over i'll hold it over where you guys can see um and obviously it's not moving hand behind it again this is a white ceramic tip with a metal core uh these look like viton seals um and this and let me tell you something the little skunk's got like a like a earthy lemon um almost like like a pine tree set next to a lemon tree like like if you could combine those smells that you know that that taste um that aftertaste that's what you get with this lemon scum but the effects man the effects are like way way up there um these are this is right up there with delta farms right after a blue moon um as a matter of fact um i would i would suggest to say that this is probably a little bit you know as far as like delta farms goes you know they got that totally they kind of lend towards more the the earthy flavors and then you got blue moon that kind of lends towards more the the discrete buyer this one sits slam in the middle because you got the earthy and the in the in the like fruity added together in in one cart and um this the effects are extremely good the only down draw that i saw this card is like after a while when i vape on it it did the tube in the middle did get a little bit restricted but it never got stopped up so and i'm going to continue to vape this and obviously when we do the weekly app on saturday maybe i'll have a little bit more information if i get down towards the end of the car that's had any issues or anything like that that's kind of what the weekly

little flower rets a whole bunch of separate ones all together I'll press together unlike some of the buds that are more densely and roundly these these were separate when they grow and they kind of a smashing longer but these this kind of bud structured generally tends to have shit-ton of crystals in it you know it's a more of indica properties which are smaller shorter plants with weird odd-looking bud structures generally are gonna be more more potent strands and will even they'll be more indica style but they'll have a some of them will have sativa effects because they'll you know essentially be hybrids 60 40s or 70 30s and over even 80 20s in the other other direction with this is TV dominant that feels like an indica that's also possible you know with the all of the hybrids these days you really you know with them you know huge entourage terpene profiles of some of these buds have oh man they they could take it to anything for you really they you just have to find the right one for you you know I truly feel like there's a medicine for everybody out there and if they try an off of them they'll find one that they like and stick with it you know you know use what

(smooth music) I love sativas during the day. My sativas of choice would\nbe Blue Dream, Sour Diesel, Super Lemon Haze, great for creativity, great for cleaning your\nhouse, which I never do. - I'm gonna stick with sativas honestly, like right now I'm smoking Zeta a lot. We had this top shelf Zeta\nthat was really delicious, it's a classic strain it's\nbeen around for a long time. Sour Diesel, you can't\nreally go wrong with those. - For a sativa, I've always\nliked Strawberry Banana. It's just a nice, mellow\nif you're creative and stuff like that so, I like doing that. - One of my all-time\nfavorites is Trainwreck. I went to school in Northern California so that was always a staple. - There's a strain that\nwas named after me. It was called Juicy Gia, that was a strain and it was at the store for years. It was a sativa, Green Crack. - Green Crack is one\nof my favorite strains, for sativa because it's an\nenergetic, great daytime stain. It keeps you going. - My favorite stain would be\nWhite Widow or Blue Dream. Every bud is gonna have a little bit of a different buzz to it\nand those in particular just have a nice effect,\nit's a chill kind of. - Blue Dream, first of all\nit smells like amazing, and then it looks amazing,\nand the way it tastes, I was like oh this is for me. - The only stains I kind of stay away from is like kind of the heavier\nmore energetic sativas. I know that my body chemistry\ndoesn't enjoy that as much. Green Crack, just straight\nDurban Poison, Jack Herer, things like that I'm like. - Night time indica is\nOG if you want to relax. OG Kush, Kush, anything with\nthat, OG is my go to strain. I love OG Kush because I\nstruggled with anxiety growing up and I came off pharmaceuticals\nwhen I was in my 20s and I personally found OG Kush\nkind of really levels me out. - Just like straight OG\nKush is a really good one. - I love OG, I'm an OG\ngirl, I like the ones that keep you nice and mellow. Can you tell, right?\n(laughs) - For indica, Northern Lights is probably one of my favorites stains. It's just an overall great\nbody, really relaxing. - I'm an indigo woman\nhands down, I love cookies. A good OG, Snoop executive. - My favorite would\nprobably be the Snoop Lion. Executive branch. - I would say Skywalker\nand Girl Scout Cookies. The hybrids and the indicas,\nthose are really good. - For day midday hybrids, Gorilla Glue, I love Purple Tangie, that was magical. - Tangerine Dream, it's\njust a really nice high because it's super functional. You can just go out\nabout, be social with it, if you want to be creative\nand like go dance, or go draw, or just be artistic\nwith it you totally can. Or if you just want to workout with it, it's a very active high. - I think my favorite strain\nof all-time is probably GSC, formerly know as Girl Scout Cookies. It makes me feel creative, relaxed. Definitely a favorite for me. - Funny, I'll be at work\nselling GSC, now as it's called, and walk across the street\nto the grocery store and there's Girl Scouts\nselling Girl Scout cookies, offering to sell me Girl Scout cookies. I don't offer the same thing\nback but, it's kind of funny.", "H-I9MW8GDrQ": "well hello hello YouTube here we have some more beautiful bud from purple star I promise I'll go to other clubs and around

TS you will recognize the importance of high levels of THC in the strains of cannabis plant so what should you keep your eye out for in 2020 if you want a high concentration of THC in your cannabis the following is a list of the five most popular THC plants commonly grown at number five there is Girl Scout cookies which is probably one of the best strains of Californian marijuana plants available we also lightly seeds as they are feminized and plants should be ready to harvest within eight to nine weeks of germination you can expect a THC concentration of between 25 and 28 percent at number four there is wedding cake which is at a keen price for such a THC rich strain this plant will give you a great sativa hide and you will find that her little goes a very long way at number three Cali glue Auto joins the list with a more than healthy THC level of around 23 percent we also like this as it flowers within 60 to 70 days and can cope with wide temperature fluctuations it was a close call but at number 2 we have Bruce Banner with origins from Colorado it was registered at the u.s. Cannabis Cup with a THC level of 28% which was the highest at the time pride of place and storming in at number one comes hulk burry the alter ego of the incredible hulk with a THC level of 27% and slightly lower than Bruce Banner this took the coveted crown because of its fruit berry and hint of citrus aromas that makes it a little bit extra special what about you have you experienced a mind

this should like what I mean they do they could be pigs being tracked by the pigs feet", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and

share the art of blast pipes with the world here in Berkeley as in other parts of the world were lucky enough that cannabis prohibition is coming to an end throughout my life I've used cannabis to control my epilepsy and I like many others find glassblowing and cannabis to be therapeutic through glassblowing and cannabis culture I hope to change the world one pipe at a time hi guys I'm Kevin here with Dustin and this week we really want to thank you guys for helping us past 10000 subscribers it has been a really cool experience making these videos with you guys and we're really glad that you're getting something out of them and you know really enjoying them yeah guys thanks a lot and we really appreciate are you guys watching and enjoying the videos Kevin I love doing them we're gonna keep making more we have some other cool projects in mind that we're working on so you know definitely stay tuned and we really appreciate all the support absolutely yeah we also had another really cool and exciting thing I've been to we did this past weekend we were up with the secret cup NorCal up in Mendo that was a lot of fun just crazy good hash just some of the best job openings up a little bit Kevin we'll get some close-ups you but yeah the secret cup is a is a hash competition there's different ones held all around the country and some of the best hash makers come from all over the country come out and they brought some excellent products yeah they brought some we we get that we actually got to try a bunch of them because we made the trophies for the the winners we need to eat yeah so the for the top three winners they won a black opal encase droplet with you know a slime or purple ring handle and things like that we actually have some of the winning stuff here we do we have some of this 73 microns sour D from from the bizarre space and Corp you make it some absolute fire pull melt the brain taffy yeah they call it the brain taffy definitely give a big shout-out to space and Korpi for that man congratulations guys you guys deserve it man you worked hard and definitely beat out a lot of competition we also have some Sour Diesel here from almond extract which did beat out a ton of competition and this stuff is very very good yeah a big shout out to our boy Ari man thank you so much for all your help with everything before we've had a session with Ari so you guys should check that out from elephant extracts he won the secret cup really awesome guy and a lot of support and love outs you are and congratulations on that a secret company win man the big win and then we have some stuff from Davenport extracts and this stuff got best butter and this is some really cool sugar wax as they call it it's like got all kinds of crystally looking sparkles in it but it's all THC and the cool thing about this is that there's zero parts per million of residual solvents so all of the entries were tested in a laboratory called SC labs and that's how they decide the winners like the the highest THC was Rumplestiltskin and it was eighty eight point three percent THC was amazing job amazing just nuts stuff so and then of course they test everything for residual solvents your butane you like seen anything like that and for CVD s as well there's some high CVD stuff there 80 80 plus percent animation it was amazing that that stuff was true true medicine really cool to see yeah it's amazing to see all the hash makers and extract artists get together and no area 101 it was a really beautiful place thank you so much for hosting it we can't wait till next year love Mendocino absolutely that was a lot of fun up there it was a gorgeous day a lot of men outside and camping out a great time cool so this week because we have a couple special we wanted to even make it more special and do an up in casement slide for you guys this was a nut encasement was something I started making back in 2007 and hash bead 420 was one of the first people to get one you can check out the link to the video there and I said since it won and basically I started making this technique and a lot of people were like how can you in case something organic in glass and well the answer is you can't and it's an illusion but I'll show you guys how to do it and you can see some earlier pictures of some some early ones here's something that we have right here and there's some forms where they were talking about different you know techniques and guessing how I did it from pouring liquid nitrogen on it to just pouring on glass on it you know so anyway thank you so much for your support are you guys it really means a lot to us we wouldn't still be doing all these videos without your support I'm so waited for you guys so thank you so much and yeah we're gonna do this nugget camp it will take some dads and see you guys in a minute cool guys thank you and we'll see you soon [Music] so the cool thing about those courts now is that you can hear my bring the torch and they're not gonna crack this dress or anything like that good nice and nice hot let it cool for a minute pop your bubble rip on top of there that's a trend with you bubble rips Dustin I mean if I got the cold water I'm definitely gonna be doing some screams so going in here on your 12 millimeter blow tube just gonna even out the end and then flare it to the same size at your color tubing so this week we're just gonna make a blank using some serendipity tubing it's some white coat of amber purple it's a Northstar color going in here and you'll get both sides nice and hot and do it straight to you then you here's a really nice connection on the serendipity to it is particularly soft so you gotta kind of be aware of that when you're working it going in and heating one area and then using your V blade to condense it down create that cool line of stress you can wait for it to cool or crack it off somewhere I'm going to heat it up and take my seven millimeter putty rod and just close it down and make sure that it's a nice tube sealed and I'll be able to shape it throwing in here and eating the front half first you're gonna start to condense it back and you're gonna kind of work it into a tapered shape eventually for your slide and you see that when I put in the flame I'm burning off the reduction and serendipity is a glass that likes to reduce a lot so it's really important that you have a slight oxidizing flame when you're working the glass working back towards your blow-tube blowing that out into that more of a tapered shape and I'm going to use your Mirage flame and I just work the whole thing around kind of floppy on your on your blow-tube but working it back on axis and then using your marver there down next to your torch yeah I mean that's an important point that Kevin just pointed out is that sometimes I work the glass so hot that it's floppy and not really technically on center and there's really two ways to work glass ones where you working so hot and it's never really off-center it so the last final stage or kind of a lot Center and the other way is you know really on center of the whole time in Italy that's kind of the very fluid methodology so I use a little bit of them going in here now and you're pulling out and thinning out the end and you're gonna alternate blowing and heating to open up that hole so what's the vault open I'm gonna use my jacks to just expand it a little bit to about 12 millimeters grab my other blow tube and I'm gonna make a straight sail going in here getting both sides nice and hot and you'll seal them together I let that cool you're gonna go back in here and work it again make sure it's nice and solid so right now I'm digging off the other blow tube and it's gonna leave me a nice space we attach my joint and you take it off and it changed just a little bit and I'll be able to have a appreciate from the end of my slide going in here getting an end where you took it off gonna pull out the end make sure it's nice and even the whole way around give it some heat and then you're going to give it give a blow and a marver to finish off that taper down to where your drug will be at that you need it up put in a little bit of hair in it and explaining the law to create a nice curvature and now you're gonna go in with a precise flame and open up a hole on the side where you can add kind of a window for your encasement you can use this window technique for all kinds of pieces you don't have to use it for this particular thing I really want to see what you guys do with this window technique and the encasement technique it's a lot a lot of cool stuff using the mini torch to open up the hole right where you want it and then you'll grab your reroute to open it up to a bigger size once you have the size that you want you want to take your 12 millimeter to eat up the end and attach it to that hole you know just like you would've bloats you going in for a side seal here essentially both sides nice and hot then you'll go in and come out to your blow-tube so you have just a little note clear glass there you can melt it and blow out to a nice even bubble so you can do all kinds of things like this a raised carb other things it's a great technique just having your tool set going in and I'm gonna condense it in and blow from all angles make sure that that wall thickness is very even on all sides to give you a nice even lens around whatever you in case that's the time you have to go and do a little bit of a fun angle to get the bubble for the right shape yeah we just got to go in there we're keep working the glass convincing and expanding it and it'll eventually get to the right shape it's just about practice and persistence they're going to go in and you open up a hole in the end where you're going to attach your joint so I already got my blue tube and I put it on the end and blow out the hole via the blue tube and that'll let you get make sure you get a nice center hole because you want to make sure your joint is very own setting so I'm heating up blowing toward you're very hot and it's a little bit off-center something to go with my jacks when I open it up I'm going to use that heat to condense it back where it was off-center and open it up and will remain on center going here with one blade to start and then two to finish the opening and then you're gonna go in and add some more heat to the end there so you can use your jacks to make sure the interior wall diameter is nice and even the whole way down the slide but I have that good airflow totally Silverstein it up finishing it off and I'm gonna pop it in the kiln ball and get my hand already you got found a little piece of serendipity rod and a scrap bin while you were getting your supplies together so you're gonna go in here and putty up and this can be a nice little hole yeah exactly it's a really great color and it's gonna match the slide really well and all we need is about a half an inch or so of the glass and then we'll be able to touch my score in the handbook just cutting off before the switch there and then you'll keep this up clean up the end and then give it a nice even heat and appreciate so I'm just putting a little bit of heat to the handle grabbing out of the marver and making a tapered Marva so it'll be ready to attach my handle and kind of be appreciate for what I don't know wants to look like later thank you to grab your join holder put an earplug in the end and you're gonna get your joint ready to attach to your slider yeah one cool thing about using the black joints is that you can really see where the heat is so I'm heating up really evenly but in my V blade which is a great tool now I use a little bit of torque pop it off now you're gonna go in keep that in and you'll use your Jack's to open it up to the same size as the opening down the Edmure slide you need it up and open it up and it's gonna be ready to use so I'll just set that down for a second grab my slide and attach a blow tube and one your plug in the other and now you're gonna go in and heat both sides and you wanna make sure this is a nice even straight sail here keep them both up and attach and you're gonna work us seal a lot to make sure it's nice and solid really important this is a solid steel because this is like the most common place I've seen slides break is right on the joint here so you got to go in and make sure that's a completely fluid seal what I do sometimes they put the flame on the serendipity or the you might have a slide color they use the radiant heat to knock the joint in a little bit making sure not to get too much heat on the actual gonzo I don't want to distort it or get it loose in your joint over Gong is an abbreviation for glass on glass going in there finishing that shaping that seal and then letting it cool nice and on seven no I'm going to use a little bit of twist and I'm gonna take the handle off because I noticed a little D bit in the connection between the joint and the ball and I'm going to take that out for me towards real fast make sure there's no stress left in that connection and now you can put your thread holder back on and take off your blow-tube so you can push your bowl in somebody heat it up and then I'm gonna get it ready for a nice bowl crush so I remove all the clear glass that's in there and we get a nice even heat you know so good yeah so you're gonna go in keep that top and use your tweezers to pull up that clear and then pull the termination and pull it out where you'll open up your hole make sure that's connecting all the way to the center and it's going to leave a really nice color pattern in this area typically because the difficulties and stresses of the glasses it goes through the shaping process just using a pinpoint flame to keep just the center there where you want to open your hole alternating heating and blowing same way you did earlier to open up that nice hole and now you're going to heat around it and use your bolt push with a stainless steel tip on it to make sure that hole is the right size and nice and centered so I'm gonna push it in a little bit with that tip it just make sure it's a little bit smaller than the boys I think give it a quick puff to make it nice and round and now that's ready for you to heat up and then push your bolt so just like pushing a chiller or any sort of pipe you pop it in and just push the ball now rotating as you push to make sure it's nice and centered and even then you go back in and give it an another working with the push after you get your final shape in it you want to go in with your torch to make sure that you remove any small marks that's a bold push it has left now you're gonna go in and grab that hoard out of your kill so you can attach it all enough for a nice handle heat it up heat up the bowl and then squish push and pull just heat it up and put a nice taper heat like we did in the last porn video and you'll be able to shape a nice warmth inside using the Lynx flame to get that whole attachment hot and get a claw to set the tip and as you pull it out that'll let you get a nice tapered form into what morning pull it towards me and then push back again towards the slide why move the wrist away and it makes a nice s-curve in the horn making sure it's staying on axis with the horn at the joint and then you'll pull out that and making sure come to a nice taper making sure you just leave a little bit of the heat and I'm just using basically the radiant heat of the flame to bring to an end of the taper now you're gonna go in and make sure that connection with the slide doesn't have any stress work it from all angles and even though the horn looks white right now it's actually the same color and I'm gonna go back in with labor right now and strike that color in which is because the horn cooled below about 700 and then I heated it back up above 1150 really fast so I'm using my tweezers to shape the final shape of the horn make sure it's in line there using my little mini torch to get out any stress marks from the horn and now you'll tap it on the bench to loosen it up and use your tongs to grab it out and pop it in the kiln for a vise and healing cycle just leave it in the kiln overnight for an annealing cycle and then you get ready to work on your quarter working station you need going for a bubble work first here heating up the quartz like it's your nice low temp and papas green on there yeah I think this is some nice cushy has super nice bubbly just clear domes all the way melts to melt away to almost nothing milking up the drop there in that job is gone now we've been working on some really cool color drops coming up they we get parts on them so I can't wait to see those two we need a couple things for your nutcase might need your slide with the bubble your nut it's a quarter inch tubing one oral syringe a bull a stringer it's a peck stop you'll need your rig and a torch some excellent cold water so first you're gonna put your quarter inch OD tubing on your syringe there and then I'll let you suck up some of the Part B first I'm gonna suck up with the the Part B and which is I need one part A Part B eight verses three parts of Part A so we're gonna use two and a half milliliters of Part B and that should be enough for you know about two in cases so you'll squirt this into the bowl here and you want to use a different syringe or at a different piece of tubing or watch it out to make sure you don't get any Part B in your can of Part A so now I'm going to try to take my part a is three times the amount of Part B if someone have about seven milliliters of solution this time make sure there's no air in there that you have the proper amount and now you'll add that to your mixing bowl with your Part B and grab your stringer and mix it up yeah it's important to use like a two or three mil string if you got once I'm a little bit bigger and you just got to mix it up really good and I like to mix it up so that there's just no chance that there's any clumps of anything and then I get it back in the syringe okay nice and mixed there and then you can set your stringer aside and then you'll sucks them up into the syringe yeah you want to put the whole amount in the syringe and then anything left over you actually be able to put in your freezer and it should sustain it for another day or two so make sure there's no air bubbles in there they've had to put a new piece of tubing to squirt the solution into your slide so what you want to do is you want to go through the nut and decide which one you want to use for smoking and which one you want to use for encasing so after you decide which one you want to do you put a little piece in the end of the slide so grabbing your piece of fire RG there and you'll get inside the joint if you tap it to make sure that it gets through the hole and you can use a stringer if it doesn't quite get all the way through make sure it's sitting nicely in the encasement there best side forward and now you'll grab your solution in your syringe stick it in the slide you squirt that in your we show that end of your to was right above the hole and it just falls down over the but I'd like to fill it up halfway which tops the noggin the front half of the encasement so you'll tap that to get the air bubbles out and then you'll put it in the slide holder that you've taped to your bench there and let it sit overnight to let that first bit of solution Harden so once that's all hardened and you want to put your second half in and the reason we separate it is just because we want that nut to be at the front half of the encasement it makes it look really cool and sometimes the nose will float because they're a little bit lighter than the solution so you're going to fill the rest of that up make sure there's just enough to go past your clear bubble there and then get any other get any extra air rolls out and that will be ready to sit for another 24 hours or so and it'll be ready to go yeah and that's for one of you guys who comments on this video we really appreciate you watching and this is a technique that I came up with in 2008 or seven or something like that and I'd love to see what you guys do with it I've kept it kind of under wraps but I'm happy to show you guys and it's a great technique to to add to the toolbox of any pie maker hey guys welcome back thanks for watching and checking out how to do an up encasement I really hope you guys do some some diving casements and you getting in case anything in glass so let us know how that works out and what you do with it and make something cool with your own work man absolutely yeah I have some questions for you Destin sure first up from Jay s super Ninian you would like to know other finds that are on spoons and other pieces made like these ones and then attached or do you click eat a spot and then pull it out into a horn we do both things depending on the shape and size of the piece and the shape and size of the horn that we want so both are valid techniques and you can do both a little later on as we're building more complicated pieces maybe we can show you some you know actual horn attachments on the piece and you know symmetrical horn attachments and things like that cool sounds good next up Studebaker would like to know what are you know some of those discontinued colors but they discontinued because of the chemicals that were in them some of them had to transition because of the chemicals that were in them as they came from different mines throughout the world and or they became harder to get for some reason or another another reason that a certain color and certain family of colors became hard to get is because they were using gun mounts from cathode ray tubes from ruined televisions they had like they were part of a two to vams and tube televisions basically and they were made with borosilicate glass and there's a limited amount of those and they come out of TVs and they recycled and stuff and melt those down that create a very cool green Sparkle color but um but most of those colors that became extinct actually you know are in existence and here's a great example the droplet that I'm using is basically a sparkly green that's transparent which is here very similar to the original Moss that I Paul Troutman invented which was a great color poem so they're pretty much been colors that have taken the place of these discontinued colors now absolutely and there's more colors available than ever before had when we first started off there was nothing like the slide that we're making this week and giving to one of you guys it was just you know a couple of main you know staple colors or beige and blue and things like that you know well next up Devin would like to know just getting set up what size fan should he have for his ventilation yeah definitely a really important question when you're getting set up your fan your ventilation is just as important as your torch kiln and oxygen system you want to have 800 to 1,000 CFM per station which is a little bit over engineering but um I really recommend having that for your stations that's what we have in our studio and that way if there's any problems with one fan or another you know it's we know there's a lot of ventilation going on to move through the studio cool sounds good better safe than sorry absolutely you wanted to do it for a long time you want to are really good glasses and have a really good renovation sounds good I think we need to give this lightning bolt dabber pendant away this dabber pendant which we're gonna dab some of the Sour Diesel on very nice well this is gonna go to Charles Luke Ennis Charles I appreciate it man I appreciate the support we appreciate everything from all you guys in the ten thousand subscribers and all the people that that watch the videos and don't subscribe we appreciate it also Charles enjoy your dabber we're gonna take some sour deep dives of the award-winning elephant extracts cannabis cup Thank You mr. Globes Thank You Big D and everyone from the secret cup Jeremy yes thank you guys very much thank you re thank you everybody we'll be back next week cool thank you guys [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "KTgqrsP41Ak": "what's up YouTube coming back to you guys with a old-school-style video where we're just gonna smoke out of a hand pipe and uh take some hits off of this out the white got some popcorn nugs of the white [ __ ] yeah Cheers mmm I've never disliked this strain and I've smoked it over the year over the last two years quite a bit um the whites I believe don't get me wrong but I believe genetically the white probably comes from white widow and something else oh no it comes out super nice and potent first THC in my system as of all day hell yeah that's what we're dealing with now almost cade already mosquitoes hate that [ __ ] smoke guys dope [ __ ] accidentally cops in the pipe a little bit look just been feeling like I don't know I wouldn't necessarily say like [ __ ] even though it's probably the best definition for it but uh just haven't been feeling like up for it up for anything really like I'm just been a really sore and I don't even know why it feels like I fell off a horse or some [ __ ] hmm pick yourselves up the white you're not gonna be disappointed unless you go to like sweet leaf and no offense sweetly if I've never been there I just everytime that before I had a Meg card every time I tried your weed from no homie he's um you know that [ __ ] wasn't what I wanted wasn't what I expected I guess I bought an eighth of it or whatever I was just just to try it I was not happy with that company hope you guys are enjoying this like share and subscribe doing this [ __ ] like back when we would have busted out the pipe in the old days guys respect life don't hit me please I forget you don't hit me don't do it Oh oh thank god the white does not have any Terps the taste is very very like plant like it's pure it's a good plan but it's definitely not like fruit or anything like that when you taste it just letting y'all know well I mean this is pretty much a review you know for that strain the white but uh I'm gonna go ahead and bust out some sour D now get that one in there bucket mosquito this is the little baby bug that was mache there's plenty of these little tiny baby nags about a bull sighs y'all are gonna hate me for this but I ain't grinding [ __ ] yeah I know you're destroying the trichomes oh my god no I don't really care [ __ ] off all right sardine when a girl is rude to you what do you give her the sour mmm I love that diesel taste guys everyone's had Sour Diesel come on for the most part I swear we ever had Sour Diesel that's weird you smoke weed and you smoked for a long time and you've not had Sara Dee so that's just [ __ ] I mother [ __ ] well I didn't get it I tried to [ __ ] grab a mosquito fail [ __ ] bastards trying to buy the [ __ ] out you're gonna think this sounds funny too but like y'all ever had an issue being outside in the summer where the mosquitoes just start [ __ ] biting your balls are your [ __ ] dick or some [ __ ] [ __ ] that dude but that if you say you haven't I mean some of you I might believe you say you've never had that for a good majority of you you're lying but yeah so if you see me scratching around my area it's probably because we got the mosquitoes trying to blow me in [ __ ] they want my dick blood [Music] carry the ball [ __ ] one more hmm this bowl is just gonna be mostly leaves get the [ __ ] away from me come on bruh mosquitoes and [ __ ] I got see that see y'all don't think that I'm like crazy and talking to myself [ __ ] yo I got a question for y'all leave it in the [ __ ] comment section below what do you think it'd be like or do you think it'd be alright or cool if I made a video for y'all when I'm on shrooms or something but at the same time I'm not sure how potent these shrooms that I know where to get our so you feel me I don't really I have only trip shrooms twice and I didn't rip them in large doses like one time I had like a gram of really really dope caps that were really [ __ ] fine and then this other time I just had like quarter of an eighth or a a little bit more I had to share it with three people which was [ __ ] stupid but yeah [ __ ] I want to trip really like I have a nice trip and have a have you guys eat kind of what's going don't call me a druggie because of that cause like the only time I ever [ __ ] with anything is if it's natural like if animals weren't able to get into it and eat it as it grows out of the soil then maybe I wouldn't be look at my fat ass losing some weight for real though something about summer makes me like not really that hungry I'm only really hungry at night when it's like dark [ __ ] love this post class this is totally like I do the videos I have a couple hats [Music] [ __ ] matches look at all not like I care anymore yeah let me know what you guys are smoking on this our D and then we started this video off with the Y but you know these two streams are very very different and as soon as I started smoking the soured be my eye completely changed and I smoked two bowls of this I don't know which one I like better kind of want to see the sour at least from the place that I bought it I just feel like it was growing really well so yeah [ __ ] yeah I'll just make you guys know join but you [ __ ] something more bull [ __ ] smoking one so good more bulls oh yeah like Shane subscribe stay high as always and uh Cheers peace", "BdRgA7K4DcE": "benefits and harms in medical marijuana can be debated but more states are legalizing pot even for recreational use a new evaluation of marijuana's risks is overdue that's the topic of this week's healthcare triage [Music] last year the National Academies of Sciences medicine and engineering released a comprehensive report on cannabis use at almost 400 pages long it reviewed both potential benefits and harms we've talked about benefits before let's focus on the harms cancer the greatest concern with tobacco smoking is cancer so it's reasonable to start there with pot smoking a 2005 systematic review in the International Journal of cancer pooled the results of six case control studies no association was found between smoking marijuana and lung cancer another 2015 systematic review pooled nine case control studies and could find no link to header neck cancers another meta-analysis of three case control studies of testicular cancer found a statistically significant link between heavier pot smoking and one type of testicular cancer but this evidence was judged to be limited because of limitations and the research all of which was from the 1990s there's no evidence or not enough to say of the link between pot use and esophageal cancer prostate cancer cervical cancer non-hodgkins lymphoma penile cancer or bladder cancer there's almost no evidence or not enough to say that pot has any effect on sperm or eggs that could increase the risk of cancer and any children of pot smokers using marijuana while pregnant does pose other risks as we'll discuss in a few minutes heart disease another major risk with cigarettes heart disease isn't clearly seen with pot smoking only two studies quantified the risk between marijuana use and heart attacks one found no relationship at all and the other found that pot smoking may be a trigger for a heart attack in the hour after smoking but this finding was based on nine patients and may not be generalizable lung function it also makes sense to think about the risk of respiratory disease in the short-term after smoking pot a 2007 systematic review found lung function actually improved but these benefits were completely overtaken by evidence that lung function may degrade with chronic use lung function however is a laboratory measure and not necessarily a clinical outcome and what we really care about is lung disease once you control for tobacco use the links between marijuana and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease appear minimal almost no evidence is available to link pot used to asthma impaired driving driving while impaired is a major cause of injury and death in the United States six systematic reviews were considered a fair or good quality by the National Academies and the most recent one pulled three of the others it contained evidence from 21 studies in 13 countries representing almost 240,000 participants for people who reported marijuana use or had THC detected through testing the odds of being involved in a motor vehicle accident increased by twenty to thirty percent to study them this is of course a relative increase and shouldn't be confused with the overall percentage of getting in a car accident which is much smaller regardless driving while impaired is a terrible idea although we have good tests to determine two people are under the influence of alcohol no such tests are currently available for marijuana making enforcement more difficult we did a whole episode on pregnancy effects babies born to women who smoke pot during pregnancy are more likely to be underweight delivered premature and admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit according to a 2016 systematic review but there were no links seen for changes in birth lengths head circumference or congenital malformations there's limited evidence for pregnancy complications for mothers and there's not enough evidence to come in on much else about babies and their outcomes memory and concentration there's moderate evidence from many studies that learning memory and attention can be impaired in the 24 hours after marijuana use there's limited evidence however that this translates into worse outcomes in academic achievement employment income or social functioning or that these effects linger after the pots worn off mental health the possible relationship between marijuana use and mental health is complicated the most recent meta-analysis found that there's a significant connection between heavy marijuana use and a diagnosis of psychosis specifically schizophrenia this mirrored the findings of previous reviews that sought to cover only high quality studies another systematic review highlighted a potentially small but statistically significant link between marijuana use in the development of bipolar disorder heavy users of pot are also more likely to say they have suicidal thoughts what makes this complicated is that it's hard to establish the arrow of causality are people who smoke pot more likely to develop mental health problems or people with mental health problems more likely to smoke pot there's a similar issue when talking about the relationship between using pot and other substances so I'm able see marijuana as a gateway drug leading to other substance user abuse but others and a lot of research see this only as a correlation in which people who are likely to use or abuse substances are more likely to use pot as well secondhand smoke has states legalize the drug for general use more cannabis users feel freed from secrecy they smoke more in public raising worries about secondhand smoke a two-year old study made news recently by arguing that one minute of exposure to pot smoke impaired how vessels responded to blood flow for at least 90 minutes a greater impairment than seen from tobacco this was a study in rats though not of humans out in the world as for the risk of a contact eye the amount of THC detectable in secondhand smoke is negligible almost everyone agrees that children should not use pot but concerns are legitimately raised about whether children might have increased exposure or access after legalization although this issue has not been studied widely it's possible that pot the THC and the metabolites from smoke could have an effect in the developing brains of children these concerns are more applicable to adolescents who use pot regularly however not the accidental ingestion reported in the news once in a while new questions almost all the harms the medical literature focuses on involves smoked cannabis we know little to nothing about edibles and other means of administration nor do we have any consistent manner of measuring the level of exposure bottom line you gotta weigh the pros and cons many of the harms we've discussed are statistically significant and yet they're of questionable significance almost all the increased risks are relative risks the absolute or overall risks are often quite low we haven't focused on the potential benefits especially medical ones here but many people use pot even rationally for benefits they perceive to be greater than the harms we've listed we unquestionably need more research and more evidence of harms may emerge but it's important to note that the harms we know about now are practically nil compared to that of many other drugs and that marijuana's effects are clearly less harmful than those associated with tobacco or alcohol abuse people who choose to use marijuana now that it's easier to do so legally will need to weigh the pros and cons for themselves

some good gross cabin this one isn't looking anything special", "V9iiQWPa2i4": "this right here is premium Jack looks beautiful very frosty just from the grain door looks premium to me can't wait to see how it looks in the and the macro lens let's uh let's get the macro right now see how it looks this is the map looks really good let's let's break it up and see how it looks on the inside you can

mmm that's what she said so this the macro looks phenomenal some super Lemon Haze yeah look at all those orange shares hi", "f-DP35X6LaY": "so I'm curious how long does the oil within your cartridge actually last well for our 500 milligram cartridges we'd like to think of it as around 4 to 5 grams of cannabis okay for me it'll last a little less than a week but for my wife it can go a couple weeks okay and for some others it might last a month or two correct right right and - what's the shelf-life of an oil cartridge if I if I happen not to use it right away how long will it last work well with the oil there's not really a shelf-life but sometimes the cannabinoids will degrade over time whether it's with light or heat THC can turn to CBN a CBC can turn to CDL through too much light and that's not harmful but that's not exactly what people might want to have happen correct right so if you have a sativa oil that is high in CBN the CBN is going to make you sleepy which kind of goes against the sativa right and how long would that degradation take to occur it takes a good while at least a year okay so you've got you've got some time yeah it's gonna be gone before that happens and so tell me if I have a oil cartridge and/or it's on the pan or in the package how should I store it storage is probably best at room temperature and you don't want to leave it in your car you don't want to put it in the freezer or the refrigerator just a normal room temperature would be fine and if you live in a hot climate about that if you live in a hot climate it's good to be in air-conditioning if I wouldn't leave it in a car sometimes if if it's too hot in a car the oil will get so thin you're risking possibilities of it leaking got it okay well thank you so much for that answer", "9fuXT85c5nI": "mary j hey what's up it's a hairy dabber now online I'm about to get high today I'm getting on some bay 11 I went to homegrown brownies and stained I talked to my girl Nikki over there and she told me that the bay 11 was one of her favorite strange so I paid my nine dollars a gram for my medical price and I picked it up as far as i can tell the bail evan has got some grand daddy purp genetics but I'm not really sure I can't really find a whole lot of information on it this particular batch of Bay 11 has twenty five point nine five percent THC with a point for nine

colors um so this is some pretty pretty pretty pretty bud pretty nice looking but um it is it is pretty pretty covered in in orange hairs with a lot of crystals it's not white but it is light color so for appearance let's go ahead and let's get this it let's give this a eight this has got a good solid color to it mmm so got it it's got a nice nice smell to it too I like it but it's a soft smell it's like a like a sweet earthy smell not not punching on the face like I like mmm like a like a must like some sort of earthy planting material hmm maybe pine maybe a sweet pine maybe like a cedar maybe like cedar or something for smell let's go ahead and give this just like a five let's give it a six let's go and give the let's give the smell a six cuz uh I do like the smell but it's not very it's not very it's not very punchy in the face it's a real subtle nice subtle smell but it isn't very very enjoyable we might even go up to a seven if I if I like it here to hear a little bit more in a minute let's go ahead and crack this crack this open yeah it doesn't it doesn't seem to punch the smell out that much more cracking and open but yeah let's let's throw this into the end of the helix

the right way cuz is wrong hmm it's nice still still almost no flavor at all this it's so weird this this bud has like usually there's like a harsh flavor but it's just like the flavor is just disappearing but I'm already starting to feel a nice tightness in my face my chest is is is starting to relax a little bit my back is starting to feel better and very bitter oh no just it's a nice body um for effect let's go ahead and give this a 7 um because it's not it's not super super affecting me yet um but but I can feel it I can feel it coming on a little bit more let's let let's go and

there's a macro", "LWgvhmustak": "[Music] p2p [Music] then [Music] what's good yoshi boy p2 peeps uh the hair is looking real bummy we don't get that fixed up though anyway real reason why y'all are here today we're going to be checking out some cold cure premium tier 1 hash rosin from punch extracts this is the white tahoe cookies review here is you know just the product itself we got right here percentage-wise we're going with uh 80 chc for those who are curious i don't really see too many uh other um you know things on the ten or ten the percentages but you know here's what we're working with and of course you know i will always include them lovely lovely close-ups and yeah so normally when we're you know dabbing out here i try to get different angles and things like that but we don't really have the other camera and the attachments i have for this camera are kind of on the wonky side today so you know that's just that's just how it goes but today we're going to be dabbing out of two things i got the little ursa rig and for those yes i know it's a dirty banger i just took a whole gram dab out of that last time around um and i don't feel i ain't gonna lie i don't feel like cleaning it just yet i want to take at least like a few more dabs out of it before i clean it because it's literally only seen one or two dabs so you know what i'm saying oh yeah and the we got the b4 with the sit cup for our other hit there but yeah i'm just going to go ahead and get this thing started up heat up this dab and yeah let's go we'll take our first rib i think that should be good there on the heat here we go for our first dab nice little slab like this hope that focuses in all right i think it's hot enough at least it's been i don't really dab too uh hot too often so cheers guys we got nice flavor off that but of course that is not that hot we're gonna fix that so yeah still getting used to the new banger um it's got an opaque bottom so i can't really see when it gets red oh yeah that's nice see we got most of the flavor in that first um rip the flavor here is definitely a little bit more toasted of course that's all that's on me but we're gonna get a really really deep deep flavor off the v4 so all right so i think yep that's all of it we got all of it out of that so okay so of course is cold here um so it's a lot smoother and of course it kind of has that you know really really cool uh taste to it because of that cold cure of course you know i'm just repeating myself now but yeah it's probably one of the smoothest things i've ever dabbed smoked whatever like even really really good indoor doesn't really get this smooth honestly and i've had a lot of good stuff before so yeah i think cold cure is definitely the wave if you're looking for what is the best you know most smooth most potent kind of uh concentrate to smoke or at least thc thing to smoke you're looking at it right here it's definitely some cold cure live frozen and uh yeah i'm not i'm not gonna say you know all other life rosin is bad or other rosin is all bad and all this stuff you know only smoke cold cure i'm definitely not like that uh you know smoke what you like and continue to smoke what you like type things but just saying you know for those who you know have this is expensive i will say that guys so if you don't this is not you're not gonna find this for anything less than like maybe 80 uh 80 if you're lucky honestly because this is normally like 90 dollars a gram so um you know what i mean it's definitely not really for the bargain shopper uh so you know only i would say only buy this if it's a special occasion or you know you can afford it or if this is just within your means type thing or uh you know i'm saying like for example you only smoke one gram and you'd like it to be the best gram you can get then you know you can go look for some cold cure live rosin you know i'd highly suggest but other than that you know what i'm saying this is definitely something that uh if you're looking to save money this is not really for you but it is really really good that flavor is super super deep like i was saying before um i don't think i touched on too many of those notes so let's touch on them a little bit shall we what else first you know it's a little sweet um not too too much though we got a lot of that gassy kind of taste there and yeah we should be able to get a little bit more of that figure profile down now that i've got that hit packed up um but yeah this is maybe my third live rosin premium or premium whatever it is uh their whole thing is premium live rosin or tier one sorry live rosin so that's the whole thing they like to say for it but i think it is really good it is really really really [ __ ] good all three of the grams i've had i think are definitely worth the price although i wouldn't really buy them weekly type thing you know i'm saying i bought them for review purposes i don't know when i'd buy another one maybe to celebrate something but uh we'll see yeah i'm gonna get this hit cooked up so i hope you guys can join me this once again out of the divine tribe v4 um and i got a little stick up attachment on there and we will be doing a video on the v4 soon i know i promised that a really long time ago and i've been really slacking on it but that video will be coming yeah opponency wise guys this is great even after just one dab i'm toasted this might even be the last dab of the video guys so i hope you guys can join me and if you've been watching up to this point please don't forget to leave that like drop a comment and subscribe you know help the homie out cheers everybody oh wow you guys like a garlicky taste to [Music] it not too garlicky though yeah let's show some cookies we got that the nice signature cookies taste in there yeah i'm pretty sure everyone knows what some good cookies taste like um strain wise i'm just cleaning this out a little bit but try to think of any other notes i can think of well you know you got y'all got me here um and honestly i can't really think of anything else right now to say because it's hitting me tough guys this thing rips once again if you're looking for something really really really smooth i would and you haven't tried cold cured live rosin not resin rosin then you should definitely give this a go bruh once again this is the punch extracts white tahoe cookies cold cured batter you know second coal gear we've had here on the channel and yeah cold here and at least in the rosin world this is definitely the future of you know everything i hope one day this becomes the standard and we get these for like you know 30 25 40 you know whatever whatever the price may be just lower than 90 that'd be great in the future um but for now you know i guess i i i guess it's worth the price you know uh i haven't had too many super expensive grams you know i've only i've only had uh you know i concentrate grams over like eighty dollars like on five occasions now so i wouldn't really be able to call myself a an expert in that kind of field where flower is concerned that i think i'm a little bit better off in knowing uh in terms of those kind of price points but this one yeah so if you guys know any other better live rosin than this you guys like you got to let me know so i can give that a go otherwise though this is super super satisfying loving the high it is i believe this is a indica dominant hybrid um so you know that's kind of my alley i kind of normally buy things like that and i kind of like being slumped like that kind of relaxed feel super kit laid back type thing i'm getting that here but i'm also feeling a little social i ain't gonna lie you know maybe it's a little a little bit of the tiny little bit of sativa that lies within the cookies you know cookies don't really have too much sativa in them but you know what i'm saying like they do kind of make you a little talkative sometimes like i mean maybe that's just me but hey um that's all i got for today's video guys i'm super baked so i probably won't get another rip in just yet you know what i'm saying i got a little i got some other things to do today so you know you guys can though catch a bunch of rips on stream if you want and i'll be streaming on youtube tuesdays fridays and then on the weekends it's just kind of whatever whenever saturday sunday

got me some gorilla glue number four and we're gonna read some stuff for you real fast you know something even people who don't know what it is you know any little information to some background history on it but the strain highlight says gorilla glue number four is developed by GG strains is a potent hybrid strain that delivers heavy-handed euphoria and relaxation leaving you feeling glued to the couch it's chunky chunky resin covered blood spilled a room with budget earthy and sour around us inherited from its parent strains Kim's sister sourdough and chocolate diesel gotta give me a wholesome not shocked with beefs with us sounds good taking first place in both in Michigan in Los Angeles 2014 cannabis cups as well as the Hollister making world cup this multiple award-winning high risk supremacy is no longer a secret and consumers will search far and wide to get their hands on the sticky with Gorilla Glue number four so that's pretty good I'm a reason uh listen what kind of restraint attributes you know what does it do right everybody won't know what it does so this stuff will make you hella relaxed okay you get happy getting euphoric villain you kind of uplift it you know get a little sleepy but not too bad the medical aspect of it stress depression pain insomnia and lack of appetite so if you stressed out a little depressed got some paint on you can't sleep or

mouth really dry mouth you don't need to drink and you smoke this and a little bit of draws you might get paranoid anxious or dizzy and if you don't believe me there you go so here's the medical aspect I know if my camera might be doing everything backwards I learn how to fix that but there you go for that then you got the effects of it all there you go your boy wasn't lying so it's supposed

school weed I used to get my 20s you know taste good as a roll of it you get a little but for some reason when you get the bud you get a little pipe going or a little bong rig whatever you got and get more of the flavor but you get like some earthy after the earthy overtones you know some you know I'm trying to get past a little bit of a paper taste don't know me smoke it like this but that's not

becomes legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the

up-to-date information on what I have new posts out for reviews or tutorials also give me a big thumbs up if you like what you see and leave a comment down below so that I can give you guys the content you would like to see on this channel ok today's review it's a live resin from Empire Wellness this runs 70 dollars a gram and it comes in at 55 point five percent CBD per 1 gram container this is a great product that ships very discreetly and quickly and when you open up that package you'll see a glass container that has your live resin inside of it it has a screw on plastic top with the branding for empire wellness and extracts on there also the information about this product it says 55 milligrams of CBD and this this live resin is actually extracted from two different strains and that is the ACDC and Charlotte's Web strain both of these are well known for helping with epilepsy the seizures that are associated with that pain discomfort and inflammation now when you open up that size-appropriate container you will see a yellow buttery type of consistency for this live resin it's not sticky and gooey as I was expecting it it's actually a little more moist than a crumble so it's easy to just carve off a chunk of this for putting in your nail putting on a nail putting in your vape pen or whatever you choose to vaporize this with I suggest you grab a glop of this and you throw it on those vaporizers or rigs and you start vaping this stuff now the flavor the flavor I got was mixed but the majority of the flavor I got had a very nice lemons move flavor to it although there was a sweetness in there when I hit this on an electric nail and it had almost like a bubblegum type flavor but I only got that sensation just one time the nice thing about this is even though you use a small amount you can still get enormous clouds so a lot of density a lot of volume with a small amount of material I set my vaporizer pen to the medium setting and it work just fine it is very smooth the exhale also has reminiscent flavors of lemon but it doesn't stay on your tongue that long so it kind of dissipates quite quite quickly now the effects within about a minute I could feel that characteristic heaviness behind my eyes the relaxation in my neck my back my shoulders I just felt at ease and very peaceful and that sensation lasted for me maybe an hour an hour and a half I came back I took some more puffs of this from my vape pen and I was set for another couple hours I really like the product it's a relatively high priced product but I think that might be because you're taking it from two separate strains and with the co2 extraction you're just paying for the processing and where it's derived I have to give this 5 out of 5 on my dabber scale it did what I was expecting it to do the flavor was good it was smooth there was no irritation on the back of my throat no matter what and I just really liked the effects so 5 out of 5 on my dad or skill for this this is the live resin wax from Empire Wellness I will provide a link down below so you can pick some of that up coming up I have some more reviews from Empire Wellness including a 99% CBD isolate with Grape Ape turps and their auto CBD flower this doesn't have any THC but it provides quite a nice feeling when combusted alright guys thanks for viewing again subscribe if you can and stay

smokin some myelogram weed shake-a-lator", "vvOrD3iny_8": "[Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another delta 8 video uh this is another delta 8 hemp video i actually completely forgot i still had tincture i still had another one of these products to make a video on and uh what better way to have some apple juice but these are tinctures and with tinctures they actually are droppers or like you basically put it underneath the tongue and let it absorb into your system but i've seen people put it in drinks as well and i'm very fortunate enough to have the pineapple express one if you can tell from the intro uh it also says the amount per serving is 30 30 drop wait serving size 30 drops wait serving per container 30. okay so those 900 drops is what they're saying and then one serving which is 30 drops is 33 milligrams of delta athc so yeah let's see this i've only tried a few tinctures and they're mostly very i would say it's a very alcoholic taste because i believe there's like i don't know was it glycerin i don't even know what it was in there but i'm sure there was alcohol in the last tincture i tried definitely was not good at all so we're just gonna open this oh it shows okay so this is at about 75 milligrams i'm smelling it smells really nice so 75 one milliliter is 30 drops so we're at 75 so that should be about should be about 22.5 milligrams all right 22.5 milligrams here we go kind of tasted like bubblegum it's a very minimal taste at best but since it's the only thing i put in my mouth like i can taste it but like if i were to put it in this i feel like i wouldn't taste it but we're gonna do that um but no not bad i was honestly expecting a much worse taste so let's do another let's do another 75 in here so obviously the effects aren't gonna [ __ ] just immediately take over you know so i will be filming again in about an hour or so uh but yes i wanted to get a shot of me pouring this in here how many shots let's see seventy-five another 75 [ __ ] it we'll do another 75 all right so how many was that so that's about 70 milligrams of delta eight thc in there i think i did over 100 plus milligrams on this stuff so i'm excited to see oh [ __ ] you can see it's just is that chill in there what the [ __ ] so just like that's crazy there's like a layer on top yeah i drink mostly it well that tastes like pineapple and apple now pineapple and apple juice that's crazy good so i'm gonna get back to you in about 30 or 45 minutes to an hour i do have a fast metabolism so it might be a little bit quicker than that but overall you know another good way to take delta athc you know there's gummies there's actually dabbing it there's cartridges and now there's tinctures as well and for those of you who you know i think i feel like like some people don't like to um medicate you like normally you know smoking flower or vaping or dabbing or anything and they want more of a i wouldn't say a better way but a more i don't know how to say it but it's just you know you just put it underneath the tongue and you go about your day that's about it you know what i'm saying and uh you you set it in your mouth and you forget it basically but other than that yes i will be filming or i will get back to you in about an hour or so so [Music] all right guys so i am back uh it's been about 45 minutes i mean i do feel somewhat of a buzz but i honestly feel like what i take like 100 milligrams i think my tolerance is a little bit higher than that but i definitely do feel it i definitely feel it around the eyes and everything um as far as like the drink goes i drank most of it because it tastes like just apple juice now and uh as you've seen from the earlier clip it was just sitting on top i mean yeah it's still it just tastes like apple juice but you can still put some of this in here [ __ ] it so we're gonna end it off i'm gonna take some more but i definitely do feel it and for how little i took you know i didn't take that much i took like what 80 milligrams or something or so [Music] okay i'm gonna take some more real quick before i end it off but i definitely do feel a head change oh but yes uh definitely i would i would definitely recommend it for the people that um don't want to smoke or vape or dab or eat edibles because you know that's a lot of uh sugar you know all those gummies like that one video i did recently there's a lot of a lot of [ __ ] sugar especially in the morning but this is a more subtle way of dosing and uh and yeah it's just a great way to to get some delta into your system and it's legal link will be in the comments below if you're interested but other than that hopefully you did enjoy this video cheers to some regular apple juice i mean there's a slight pineapple but not as strong as it was when i just put it in there but yeah hopefully you did enjoy the video peace out [Music] do [Music] you",

little warm hopefully alright guys have a great day Wow just like that you [Music] [Music] you", "8yWpvcl5SUY": "welcome to community canvas reviews today i'm going to be reviewing a white label live resin cartridge um i had a bezel i think it was or bevel one of the two um bezel there we go i had a bezel distillate cartridge in and i just kind of got bored of it honestly because the terps are not very strong part of it being um they're not cannabis derived terpenes so live resin should spice that up um the live resin that i got is actually less terpy than the uh or it has less terpenes total we'll see what it tastes like anyways but less total terpenes than um uh cured resin surprisingly but either way we'll try it out it's wedding cake which is an indica this is cultivated by green queen farms and it comes in at 84.05 total cannabinoids um and 5.39 total terpenes um yeah so i'll read the terpenes and show you what it looks like but first let me flip the camera around for you [Music] uh [Music] all right let's try this out step one take off the sticker all right um first that's the thing about some good live reds and this um just some i don't know yeah some just good live resin cartridges i can smell that one no leakage whatsoever perfect seal that just smells nicely very sweet and almost like perfumey that's some interesting elements there so it's got a pretty basic um oh yeah that's it's got painting in there a bit smells kind of piney slash perfumey mostly but the leading terpenes and are the basic um are pretty standard beta cardio filling at two point zero four two percent uh limiting at one point five percent humiliate at zero point six percent um beta mir seen at 0.5 alpha pinene at 0.18 cedrine at 1.7 or 0.17 um alpha vista bologna at zero one point zero point one six and finch all at 0.127 so they always have a very detailed um terp list right there but usually a lot of the ones at the end are in pretty low amounts i don't think i can ever really taste them that already smells like it's gonna be way better than the other one was so um got two uh little silicone caps and the branding on this is c cell c240 620 but yeah proper c cell so that's always good um so first thing it's very very clear and light that happens with some white label um i think part of them being just like they they get stuff from different cultivators a whole lot just depends on who cultivated it what the starting material was like i think and white label actually as far as i know white label means like whenever there's um a producer doing white label extracts it means that they're doing extracts for other growers stuff instead of their own stuff so i think they've just made a name of that and that's just like their process but that's usually what that means so um i answered on reddit recently somebody posted a live resin cartridge by white label that was also very clear and wondering if it was real and also they had someone tell them that it was delta eight but they also said it looks like it has delta eight terpenes in it which if you know much about cannabinoids that's not even how that works so um but they came on reddit to verify it and i posted some cured resin and live resin that looked similar and that's just how white label is sometimes i don't know if it's crc i know they seriously well i don't know that but i'm pretty sure they crc some of their dabs so maybe they do their cards as well um i've never had a card that was remotely bad they always put out really good stuff and it's priced a little higher than some of the other stuff i get so i don't get it as often but part of that is it's higher quality too so i don't think they do it badly so all right so here's wedding cake yeah that smells it's just like a general sweet smell it's um i feel like there's like a very even smell of like the pinene and it's like limonene and something else that i don't know which i actually want to say is one of these terpenes in a lower amount and i definitely smell pining at 0.184 so i think i'm smelling one of these other ones either alpha cedric and alpha visceral or pinchol um i'm pretty sure finch all taste i've had finching which i assume is pretty similar just in this last buddies card i had and that was very like like so i don't think it's that probably i've had uh visible alone i think that's pretty sweet and i don't know about cedrine let's see about taste and smell okay upon hitting it you just get a very a much more pronounced and very standard like weed taste um i say that like it means a lot um a very just like nice balance between uh earthy and herbal and like um vaguely like musky taste to it uh not really musky someone says like the other two though um yeah it just tastes like weed usually does for most streams and don't stand out anyways uh that's how i remember wedding cake to be too i've had wedding cake from a couple different producers never a live resin so that's kind of cool but i've had select elites and that's just distillate with their terpenes and tasted pretty similar yeah so um it's not a a real standout strain to me um things like that are like mandarin cookies and like or tropicana cookies was a really good one or blueberry muffin um things like that usually stand out more to me than like wedding cake where sometimes you have strains that really do taste a little bit like what they're named and then you have stuff like wedding cake where i feel like there's maybe more behind the name or they just thought oh that's a good name for it or something like that um sounds pristine or primo or something like that very good very good but doesn't taste quite like wedding cake and the terpenes don't really stand out to me yeah those terps linger very nicely um very present unlike the non-cannabis drive terpenes that were in the last one that's why i switched it out though um i'll have the other one as a reserve in case i run out or can't get any more or something but wow this is nice and the effect on it very nice and full body too um a really good live rise and that's a good thing about the stream too is it um it's just well-rounded very well-rounded so sometimes something being well-rounded enough can make me be interested in it a little more if it doesn't stand out because sometimes that's what i'm looking for like right now for example and the perks of having a proper c cell at that vapor production all right so that's hitting pretty nice i'm getting some aftertaste again but i think it's some of those terpenes or maybe just all the mixing together but it's nothing really strong it's just so so much of like so little it's hard to describe but mostly just like um i'm getting some herbal tastes and some earthy taste like i said and i'm also getting like a weird i almost want to describe it as like how talcum powder smells that's a weird freaking thing but like it's like a very like reminds me of like a rocky taste or something i haven't tasted rocks so i don't know but that's what i imagine rocks to taste like i don't know if that's uh it's not a bad thing too it's very interesting i have to wonder what um alpha cedrine is like the effect is very nice and terps are just they stand out very nicely as they should with some live resin so yeah i think i'm starting to repeat myself a bit so i'm going to close it out here with some smoke rings at least one of those was a ring i'm pretty sure alright thanks for watching uh like and subscribe if you want and stay tuned and um yeah i'm a lot more interested in the cured resin this one's kind of a placeholder but the in the cured resin is a josh d strain which i've done a little bit of reading about because my name is josh as well so i thought that was interesting enough and he has some pretty good uh good-looking stuff and it's a josh d strain extracted by white label and it has more terpenes more cannabinoids more thc cbd um all of it really just seems like a better cartridge honestly it was cheaper i probably should have just got two cured resin cartridges um but yeah stay tuned for that one that'll come around in the next day or two so thanks for watching like and subscribe and stay tuned for more", "nFYmkC_uFO0": "welcome to down and external Baxter come on Devin episode 40 yes it is oh I'm gonna take some dads I'm gonna smoke join

san-x I'm thanks for watching", "0o8Jfu3hihQ": "alright guys so for the strain review this week we have the sour cush it is OG Kush and Sour Diesel cross and that's what I thought chem dog was Oneg but this doesn't look like some ordinary Ken dog to me yeah any time I hear you know og cush cross this over D so I pretty much figure they're talking about chem dog but yeah like you said it doesn't really look like any kin that I've ever seen you see both like really the traits got our diesel and the OG Kush come out strongly in this cross yeah you got the frost eNOS to the OG Kush but you got like the bug can play her blood composition of the sour D yeah I kind of like those those like long kind of spirit notes kind of get in there and move around so they can see kind of push together yeah you guys can see then those are kind of like more speery much more of a city would look more much more indicative of the sour they looks like they were stretching for some light but as far as color goes they have the lime green of the sour but they still have that cushy silver tone to them that oh geez tend to have pungent smell for sure this stuff is stinky real sour it smells like Sour Diesel - that definitely comes out this level it's I'd say about a 70/30 sativa dominant cross the oh jeez like 50/50 the cut that I was told that this one was made with and the Sour Diesel is like straight sativa so yeah it's gonna be a good day time medication with mild pain relief but really just a mood elevator really kind of puts you on a positive note carries you throughout your day real flavorful - stoked on these meds and it's not even top-shelf guys this stuff right here was I think 48 plus tax yeah I'm down at fortune Wellness Center yeah real good bang for your buck if you're going out there check out the sour OG coast it's the guy up at the counter a budtender told me that this is a strain that their dispensary tries to stock all year round so definitely some bump if you're looking for some good og sour sour OG go check it out the sour cush", "XUWLXWWK_wU": "[Music] hello everyone it's me the cannabis reviewer i'm back for another exciting week of grow yeah i'm putting out videos left and right right now because i'm upgrading i'm hitting it and rolling real hard trying to get my buds their maximum yield today is tuesday march 23rd 2021. welcome to my 2020 2021 winter growing season i'm growing cream caramel and i'm growing orange sherbet cannabis plants and i just got in the two extra rapid led red photo pucks today in fact like a few hours ago and i need to get them installed so in today's video we're going to be installing this next two pair of the rapid led photo pack auxiliary lighting we're going to put this over the scrog side and you already if you haven't seen go back and look at my update weekly update video and check out the orange hairs developing on the ladies the the right side has a lot more orange hairs the left sides already start to develop orange hairs but once i drop these babies in there watch out we're talking it's going to go crazy crazy and that's a good thing because uh we want dick thick dense bud or dick fence buds i don't know one of the two that's all right that's what medicated to do for you [ __ ] things up but we're gonna go ahead and start today uh with showing you what the plan is and and so let's come down here zoom in there we are so what we have is on the other side we have that screen if you haven't seen it go back and look at my video like i said i'm putting a bunch of them out right now but i put out a video where i installed uh both of the other pucks on the right hand side so this is the screen basically this screen is what i have on the other side and i measured it out it's 18 inches by long by 2.5 inches or two and a half inches wide and that happens to be the same screen that uh we're gonna i'm using right here this screen right here is the same [ __ ] i just gotta cut it so go back down here make you dizzy talk about what the plan is again okay so now if you do go back to that other video you'll see that i've had an original design and then when i went to go install it and implement it i realized that the design wasn't good enough i needed to make changes and modify it so i did so this design now will reflect those changes we don't have to worry about it so as before we got the the light sitting here there's the led lights um the top and the bottom i should say has these and then if you recall if you don't know this and you haven't know this there's a line of red leds and then white and blue out here and then there's an ir right there might be it's on maybe on the other side depending on how you look at it but there's a single ir in the middle and then on the top we have two boxes one's the power supply that drives the leds and the other is the dimmer box and then of course we have the little slots here to hang the for the hangers to hang it so what we're going to do is we're going to take we're going to take this and then we're going to mount onto it those two pucks of course we have to mount the first one first and then we'll mount the second one second so those pucks will come out like this and those pucks have four photo leds on them and so they'll add to the reds that are here they'll add an additional outside lining and they've built brought up the par almost about 80 to 100 on the other side with the two that i've added on the edges here where the the plants would be down here so the top then how we do it is we're gonna basically it's the same principle well and i can slide them underneath the dimmer box and the power supply and we'll just mount them there and there and we'll have the wires come from the sides because that way we can get close enough and then we'll plug it into the plug that i have pretty simple we'll use wire ties these wire ties is what i'll use to attach them and uh that seems to be working pretty good in fact i'm real pleased i'll be looking at some of the other rapid led stuff for temporary measures until i build my own which i've already started looking into doing i've got some good ideas about building an led light i'm thinking about doing stuff a little differently than what you ever everyone else has been doing in the past and maybe it'll be useful and maybe it won't i don't know if y'all have any ideas or recommendations on something you would like to have in a do-it-yourself led light that i could potentially end up selling of course if you give me some information i'd cut you a deal obviously on the purchase right if you're going to help me with it but uh but if you got any ideas on what is missing in the led light market that we could have if someone would just design it that would be awesome personally for me i think we need more photo red i think we need more uv so if we go down here i think we're going to do some more photo red in my light and i'm going to do more uv a few a few spots of uv on a separate circuit more than likely so i can turn it on and off because it's going to have to be on a different timer because you don't want it running in the entire time they claim it's so but i'm work like i said these are the things that i'm working on and we'll figure out uh of course we'll go with white red and blue uh leds i don't know if i'm gonna go with cree or if i'm gonna go with uh samsung lm301bs or the three lm 302s or um there's some others to osram there's a few others that we can um i'm comparing and looking at so anyway let's get back to this so this is how they come in and i guess i'll do an unboxing if you will i've opened the top only i actually haven't even pulled it out any of them out i don't know if they work or nothing so first is this and then the second piece is that and in that piece you get the power supply pretty obvious and then the other piece is protected is the puck and there also comes with it a uh a lens that you can use if you want and uh i showed you the lens in the previous video i'm not going to go through that on this one but it's a spot lens basically like a flood flood lens and i don't really want to do the flood lens thing i what i want to do is just have it spread out evenly all the way across i don't need to have it focused you know it does give you a higher par at that focus area but that's not what i that's not what i'm trying to accomplish with this light so there we're undone and there is the lens i was talking about now what i don't know is if it works because literally you just see me unbox it so first thing we always do before i even think about using it is plug it in and make sure that it's functional because if it don't work it's got to go back give it a few seconds and boom and it is bright bright bright bright okay so number one is working with a vengeance wow she's bright love it okay so we'll get it number two undone here next get it out we'll cut the screen actually we won't even get number two out yet we'll go ahead and start because we can only do one at a time anyway move this [ __ ] out of the way drop [ __ ] on the floor but i'm going to use this screen right here it's the same screen that i used uh with the other one and we'll mark it and uh cut it basically 18 by 2.5 it shouldn't be too difficult to do i got all you needs a marker and a tape measure and i got both of those so we're pretty good i think what i'll do is come over here and i use this for another project where the uh the edges are folded up and uh so that's probably not gonna work so i may i'll probably trim this down but come over here something like that maybe and we'll go up 18 inches and we'll cut it we'll cut it here uh so i'll mark it first [Music] i'm going to mark it right here so i know that that's the spot i'm going to cut from and then i'll go up 18 inches from there which is pretty good and we'll mark it from there at 18. 16 and 17 and hold on i'm knocking [ __ ] over never enough room to do what you really want to get done all right get this sideways there we go yeah this is awesome can't wait to get these lights working so 18 we come down here to this we line that up we come all the way over here and we mark this side now we do the center once again we'll we'll start here in the middle this corner right here and then we'll go in 2.5 from the edge not the edge of the screen but where i'm going to start it so we're talking we'll cut on the other side of this we'll cut that right there now we get before i get too lost i might as well go ahead and start trimming while i can still see it see it right there so all the way up fairly easy especially with this tool so easy that is i definitely recommend this tool it's a tin snip you can get it any of your hardware stores home depot whatever your flavor is lowe's menards it's totally up to you but they sell them this is a whis the yellow means it's left-handed technically and there's a red handle which means right handed even though i use it in the right hand that's probably too much information for you but that's what it is all right now let's cut this back i will trim this again after i cut it completely down and get all the little burrs off but first i'm just trying to get it to the right size that to me is the number one thing and so over here we're going to cut at this line and then we're going to cut this line and hopefully if everything's done right this will be the right size i didn't [ __ ] up you know sometimes you mess up unintentional but it does happen so yeah just uh right on up right on up i tried these with those other wires and it was definitely much more difficult this is definitely the better way to go now when you cut the wire be careful because the house that will have sharp edges and they can poke your skin because you're cutting the wire so do be careful about that i'm pretty insensitive to being poked see the pokes but you might not be so that's something you may want to be concerned about let's re-measure cut once measure measure measure cut measure that's how i do it two and a half check close enough to two and a half 18 check so it looks good now the real test really though is what's it going to look like with a uh puck and that's easy to find out because i have one right here so boom there we are that's how it's going to look one on each end can't can't mount both of them at the same time the way i have this design that kind of is kind of janky maybe but it's okay because it doesn't take much to get it mounted so now no worries looks good very pleased all right so let's uh trim the rest of these little burrs off and uh we'll go from there let me grab something to catch the burrs ain't nothing like a bucket let's see if this will work now the reason why it's left is because uh if you try to flip it no matter what you do the cuts on the left-hand side so it's more about when i told you left or right-handed it's actually more about the cut i was kind of giving you a little [ __ ] about that it's not as much about the hand it is it is which side it's cutting on and that makes a big difference especially if you're cutting 10 this is this isn't quite such a big deal you still see me trying to stay in it but uh if you're cutting like a 16 gauge still or something you definitely because you got to worry about the roll up when it rolls up where's it gonna go yep just trim off the excess here just to uh so i don't poke myself every time i go in there some of these are flying all over the damn place you don't want to do that so yeah just learned something point down dummy okay i'm pretty happy with that that should work just fine the other side's uh could uh let's do the other side a little bit we only have a little bit here to do i did pretty good on in most of it i got closer than i thought i did yeah it's uh can be tricky you could go you could go with a smaller tent the smaller nipplers for these if you wanted diagonal cutters this works fine for me okay we got her cut actually did catch most of it now we'll start mounting and installing and that's gonna be awesome can't wait i gotta take a break i'm gonna take five if you know what i'm saying i'll come back and we'll continue where we started and that's by installing this beautiful photo puck in the end of this plus i'm going to wipe this off with some paper towel and make sure it's clean before i stick it into the grow box i didn't tell you that i did that on the other side but i'm going to do that on this side because it's been sitting i did it on the other side i didn't tell you i'm telling you now i'm doing it on this one i got some rubbing alcohol and i'll clean it off with rubbing alcohol try to get as keep the environment in the grow box as pure as possible you know anyway be right back this is the cannabis reviewer okay i'm back come back come back so it gets you some ethanol rubbing alcohol whatever you need to use whatever you got that you can use and uh clean the [ __ ] off that's what we're gonna do here today threw a little bit on here get it good and wet and really just go down the whole thing here and make sure it's clean enough every little bit helps sure in the hell ain't hurting it any by cleaning it that's for darn sure i mean i don't care so much about the markers stuff uh you know but i do if there's any i don't know it's been sitting outside not out outside but out in the garage getting dust and crap all over it so we'll clean her off first i don't know if it matters but it mattered to me now we'll wipe it off yep the wires will grab the paper that's for sure this [ __ ] you don't even really have to wipe it off it pretty much evaporates pretty quickly okay so we got that done now now we're going to mount um you know i was thinking actually one of the things that i may change up on this speaking of you know i told you i was going to change [ __ ] up is this may actually come this way and up instead this way that way i can get as close as i need to to the light as possible all right we got the cleaning done and now it's time to do some mounting and i did learn some [ __ ] from last last time it was kind of difficult for me to get this mounted properly because of the way the spacing was here on the bottom so i'm going to go ahead and utilize all three holes that's why they put them there so the first one i'll do is this one and we'll put that probably like right here and that should hold that in place at least keep it sliding from sliding too far sideways if i do a single one uh i don't know i think this will be good let's try this let's turn it so it will work there you go stick it in the slot tighten it down now that makes room for this this one right here how this one's going to be mounted better than the other one oh yeah we start from the bottom get this as close as we can come back up from the top get come through try to get this other one all the way through and then pull that as close as you can there slide that through this is probably really more than it needs definitely but wire ties are cheap cable ties these zip ties whatever you want to call them they're for fairly cheap so perfect and you know how we do what we do is by doing what we do on two okay how do you do looking good is how how it looks to me all right so we got this done now we need to mount this on top and we actually need to mount it on the top side like this that's how we're going to do it that way it doesn't affect my lights at all so first thing we do is we grab one of these pretty simple make sure that this is where it needs to be and go through and back around and then in to tighten i know it's a little clunky the way i'm doing it but hopefully you can see try not to get in my own light but there we go she is mounted and looking good and looking good so we trim that off that's not quite tight enough let's tighten it a little bit more that's why i like to leave a little bit extra because uh you can tighten it up a little bit if you need to that's tight now we're good okay we got that done we have two more for the other side and then i'll grab another big another big big one for that and we'll get these mounted and see how they look can't wait this is the cannabis reviewer i'll be right back hey hey we're back this is cannabis reviewer let's get this thing mounted on this side and see what it looks like so i will put it this way i'm going to put it this way just because we're going to plug into the drop cord in the middle so we'll go ahead and put this in the back first make life so much easier and see how it fits of course that would help too hopefully we can get it in here without too many problems let's see that's one nice thing about using the screen i can bend it slide it around where i want boom okay now we'll go ahead plug it in what the hell i've got really nothing to lose but time and we'll worry about the light here in a minute that part will get figured out i may actually go up and over the light or the fan so let's do that that's why we put them in if i go up over the fan you in number one now let's do number two so we'll go ahead and grab the other puck get the power supply out obviously before i decide to do anything with mounting it i'm going to make sure that it works so we'll plug it in real quick okay here it is let's see what happens so we're getting light out of this sun [ __ ] yep sure do okay let's get her mounted see if we even need both of those wire ties we'll see what we can do once again we got to mount this from the bottom like this and we'll come through from the top so it's going to go like this beautiful we'll put this in first hopefully you can see what i'm up to here so that'll hold that sort of enough at least until we get to the other side grab this one this definitely makes it easier when we do it like this and then in this way and then the hard part is this is pushing it back through this hole or finding the hole sometimes can be a challenge too there we go there we are there we are now we'll plug you in like this tighten you up look how beautiful that looks cut these two off give myself a little bit extra in case i need it now grab the large one the larger wire tie and grab the power cord plug it in here bring it around here and going with the same theme as this from the top back around and get this position where we want it and tighten away there we go grab this baby take her up and over the fan and plug her in let's see what we got now and we'll cut this have you seen this and uh sorry about that it happens though so now i'm going to move these wires around just to kind of get everything where i want them and see if i do need to get moving around too much i'm going to try to bend this if i can get that down that way yeah then we got to grab this wire right here make sure that it's up far enough that it's not going to get caught on anything but also not pulling the light up that's always a challenge too but see these are bendable so i can bend these where i want them and i like that but let's see how bright it really is guys look at that that's what we're talking about there's the amount of brightness we got going on look at that and that's something beautiful but then when you turn on the main lights boom it's awesome make sure they're up full blast good to go okay kicking on some fans get get some air circulating again there we go there's the new light looking good looking beautiful by the way just so you know we're plugged into there all my lights are plugged into that i know it looks like a mess but it's working all right these don't draw that much power so i'm not that worried about it that's the other nice thing about leds you've already seen if you haven't seen my update well you're getting an update now go back and check out my ladies i'm telling you right now they're looking really good they're looking good they're not there yet they're looking good these are looking great so i'm really excited thank you thank you for coming to my channel thank you for watching my videos

little disaster moment [Music] uh one of our blue spanners tragically met its end so we put another one in here another bruce banner and uh one of our gorilla skittles sadly medics in so i didn't have another one so i put gorilla glue and be our other bruce banner hopefully one of these will pop soon some big news these are our granddaddy purple and as you can see [Music] they're rooted so i'll let

see today will be the first day of flower for these girls they'll be going off at six got him lollipop up to a certain point and really all we're doing in this one is just spreading them out as they go we'll probably keep doing that up until the third week of flower um yeah giving them nutrients letting them grow you see nice and healthy super healthy thing in here looks really good oh there you go on a new update we're exhausting these tents out each one's got their own fan pushing it it just flies off to go out of the inlet but so we got that helping us control the temperature in here a

shower that we got for today is our double also known as sour dub and this is by making a concentrate this is all that I have got left said what not for one dad for what I could find out it's our dub is a 60/40 sativa dominant strain I found some sign saying that this is in the codominant and also sometimes I said this is a sativa dominant but I think he misses sativa because I smoked his last night and I didn't fall asleep until like 3 o'clock in the morning so I'm leaving towards that this is the sativa dominant anyhow and what I could find out the team she doesn't listen gameplay 26% so she does kind of mediocre levels as far as the genetics cool this is a cross between East Coast Sour Diesel and sour bubble and sour bubble was a bog bubble that's been that cross bought three times in hell is when I first heard about this train to sour bubble when I saw this on the menu I had to grab it was like I knew I heard that name somewhere I'm pretty sure was from Gorilla Glue and I came home I checked it out it looks like sour bubble is in grew Gorilla Glue also going sour dub Gorilla Glue is a triple cross between sour dub canister and chocolate diesel so I know we found it and I was stoked to finally get it it is a good strain it's tasty it smells wonderful could smelling this thing when I picked it up man wish it uses a car air freshener she's sweet and gassy and a tanky pungent ate house this is our wake-and-bake for today so we're gonna be expecting some kind of coughs other than that bra that's good this party started scooper 15 whoo here we go some sour double anyhow there's the first deck got it wonderful high she's got a strong buzz all throughout the body even the mine I've got a really wonderful cerebral buzz it's pretty strong but I love it I wouldn't say you're stoned well you're definitely pretty hazed up I want to see you soon kind of story but it's not like how she stoned where your body is all down kind of wonderful body height to it you can

morning I just sleep it's like it was 3 o'clock in the morning it's a good waking big strange right now because it is a sociable smoke it does kind of open you up it does kind of motivate you I will see you're serious but you're definitely well for me not really the worries the fears they're not really there you're just kind of in your zone doing your thing you've got this wonderful butters that kind of puts a little bounce in your spend a little bounce in your attitude your perception it's a good daytime straining something I'll probably medicate way before start yeah this is a good Saturday straight useful for me man cuz Saturdays are filled with like I got stuff to do I have to go to my grocery stores I gotta run out to me come get me tear all these get my coconuts so that stuff I gotta

into this one i am a new jersey medical marijuana patient this video is for 21 plus 18 plus and all that good stuff man so you know there is cannabis use in this video so everybody knows you know what i'm saying but yeah uh yo y'all see the title man there's some [ __ ] i want to talk about man i've been seeing a lot of videos going around about this recently bro like actually a lot of videos bro i seen a video from vice about this about this topic i seen a video from a youtuber named distributor michael i seen uh another video for some spanish dude on youtube i forget his name but you know he made a video about this too you know so i'm gonna talk about this man but real quick before we even get into this i'm gonna roll this blunt and get back at you with the top man all right we're back we got the blood rolled but yeah man you know we got some crazy [ __ ] to talk about man you know and really it makes sense bro what i'm about to talk about to me it does it makes sense but then it doesn't make sense at the same time but you know before i give you guys a topic i'm gonna go ahead and [ __ ] light this one up man cheers don't forget to like and subscribe too if you you know if you're a new person you haven't subbed yet you know go ahead and drop us up actually youtube is saying you know apparently like [ __ ] eighty percent of the people who watch my videos unsubscribe so if you could definitely hit that sub button that would definitely help man i said definitely twice right there on accident but we light this [ __ ] up man a little bit of a floppy blunt man remember man this entourage was all [ __ ] up we had all types of stems and it had a hole in it i had to fix this [ __ ] but yeah topic of the video man is the east coast getting hit with sprayed cbd you know or getting hit with him you know meaning all these packs and stuff that's coming through the mail to the east coast is it getting hit with cbd or hempman you know sprayed cbd sprayed everybody basically what i'm saying is a lot of videos is going around you know or a couple videos i've seen a video on vice about this i seen a video from distributor michael is it somebody who posted a video on youtube with like 10k views on it and another video i saw from spanish dude right and basically they was talking about how and these are people on the west coast man and they're telling you how basically there's a lot of good looking hemp out there that's just cbd products you know and it's not even thc and you can get it for like four or five hundred a pound or less 300 a pound man you know and uh they said that the west coast they've been really just taking that cbd product [ __ ] like that put thing like 40 pounds of it spraying all of it with uh with with you know distillate just spraying it with distillate so it's you know so it's really you can't really see it but i don't understand it i mean or not even like just the distillate spray i guess not even spraying it with distillate you know but spraying it with like some spray some distillate spray so you still get high but it's like you're not really getting a natural tree high or some [ __ ] and you can't complain basically you know how all these [ __ ] be having [ __ ] plugs on snapchat and [ __ ] bro from cali and [ __ ] and a lot of people get shipped to them and it's like bro basically them [ __ ] in cali is just cutting corners getting these pounds for 400 spraying it with some distillate and some terpenes which don't cost nothing bro and making like a thousand dollars on a pound charging 1400 2 600 off a pound whatever a straight cbd flower like with with spray with distillate so it still gets you high you can't complain but that's some crazy [ __ ] man imagine right now smoking cbd flour sprayed with distillate i'm saying that'd be crazy i mean i know i'm not because this is some dispensary blood from breakwater but man like imagine i was though like you know i was in that shit's crazy and everybody by the way it makes sense man because like on the streets when it comes to weed there's times where there's these dry spells and [ __ ] like october time around there and around that time bro the indoor harvesting is like you know it's like daddy bro there's not really much indoor going around you know because it's all sold by them you know at least that's what i'm hearing and it makes sense because there'd be droughts out here in jersey or not even in jersey just in any illegal state there'd be droughts in like you know like random times like october or some [ __ ] like that and it makes sense man that it aligns with cali's with their little their little droughts that they be having and then it'd be a drop for a little bit but then after a little bit there's a whole bunch of weed getting shipped out and it looks like garbage bro like think about it man these exotics bro right right most of the time exotics be 60.8 50. bro i was getting good ass weed four years ago three years ago two years ago even forty dollars or less thirty five dollars a [ __ ] eighth thirty hours an eight twenty five any of some good weed i mean twenty five and eighth was kind of low you probably not getting no fire for 25 but 30 35 40. i never went over 40 of some good ass weed that really was like the same [ __ ] that [ __ ] is getting this exotic for 60 man and i feel like the only reason why this exotics for sixty and eighth or seventy and eighth is really lasting is because of this little [ __ ] sprayed hep situation that that's going on you know i mean i feel like it's a real thing it might not be man educate me if somebody's from cali and they know what's going on educate me man this [ __ ] stem is like sitting on fire if y'all see that but it man it makes sense bro don't you know because why else would these 60 [ __ ] apes really be selling like this bro it's because all the [ __ ] is the spray the hemp you know i mean this is just a theory i don't know if it's [ __ ] facts or not but maybe all the [ __ ] that [ __ ] is just selling right now and it's going around it's just spraying him you feel me that could be possible and that's why [ __ ] just feeding for that exotics even though it's going for crazy prices it raised the demand if only because all this [ __ ] is going around that makes sense man and it creates it's crazy because like if you think about it about two three four years ago the weed just to me the weed that was going around like getting sold by everybody every weed dealer just had it was fire you know or majority of [ __ ] had fire you know good weed that you could always buy and now if you look at the areas who had fireweed they be having [ __ ] now bro like straight [ __ ] and it really makes you think who the [ __ ] the plugs is not even the plugs but the big plugs you know like the [ __ ] and cali who be shipping it because bro this is a known fact that 90 of the weed around be coming from cali and it gets shipped to the mail bro that's just facts or either that or it's homegrown that's the two things you know at least in the u.s like if you growing it yourself all right you got that but majority of the weed that [ __ ] are selling just comes through the mail straight up and it's from cali and it'd be you know i really do be do be thinking they'd be selling [ __ ] you know cbd packs and hitting it with the uh distilling bro that makes it makes a lot of sense at first when i heard this i was like nah that's [ __ ] especially a [ __ ] like me who i take pride in weed so it's like bro i i like you tell a [ __ ] like me that and you're like i'm looking at you like you're [ __ ] crazy like [ __ ] i'd be able to tell if my weed was cbd or [ __ ] weed yeah i'm saying but then i saw on youtube on instagram and [ __ ] like bro in california there's some indoor grown [ __ ] cbd hemp weed that would not get you high that bro literally looks like some fire as we from the dyspo like that'll get you smacked so it's like bro that [ __ ] is tricky bro like [ __ ] really could be getting hit with that [ __ ] man i i didn't want to admit it at first but bro [ __ ] could be getting hit with that it's crazy to think about man like if you just look at the quality of some [ __ ] weed and it it really like it looks like decent weed but then like if you look at it bro it's like there's not really much trichome action on that [ __ ] bro like you gotta really pay attention to that and even if it is bro it's not like i don't know bro i just it's crazy because even going into a cbd store in jersey oh that's gonna start fire i'm gonna put that out my hair actually went right on this almost started a fire but he was going into a cbd store in jersey bro i went to a cbd store and smelled some of the buds that they had and this is in jersey smell some of the buzz that they had i'm like damn this should smell like it's really like a pack you know i mean it didn't look like no zaza you know or whatever his eyes are you know it didn't look like no exotics obviously there's nothing like that for no but it looked like some fire but that [ __ ] would just get off the street and it got me thinking like damn bro [ __ ] can really just spray this [ __ ] with distillate and sell it you know it's the same [ __ ] thing i mean you're getting smacked the same way it's just not the natural weed you know that's crazy to think about man that's why man i graduated dabbing majority i mean i bought a quarter weed today from the dyspo today i've smoked three blunts out of it probably nah i wouldn't say that i'd say four blunts out of it probably this is like an entourage you know and that shit's almost gone bro i'd probably say it's like five grams left maybe maybe more maybe less i don't know probably less than that man to be honest with you so and bro and our dispose be a hundred ten dollars a quarter at breakwater hundred dollars a quarter so like you know that's [ __ ] crazy man i know a lot of y'all listening to it like i'm never in my life paying that much what the [ __ ] hey bro you can on the street you can get quarters of gas for 50 bro you really can you can get quarters of gas for 50 60 but it's like at the end of the day man ever since seeing that video it's like you really don't know if you're getting sprayed bro like you really don't i've seen like i literally watched the video of a [ __ ] showing some good ass [ __ ] good looking weed and the [ __ ] was hip doesn't get you high and it's like damn you know and if you just like you just at least around my area bro if you look at the quality of the weed to me besides the zaza and the raja exotics all that [ __ ] besides that the quality of weed in general just normal weed enemies blind has went down bro for unless it's some platinum i'd say because platinum is really growing in like new york new jersey philly around here like that platinum that should be official you know that's not a spray that that should be grown around here but other than sour too sour be official too that [ __ ] growing right in new york but other than that [ __ ] bro like all these other shits that [ __ ] be saying they having sfv and [ __ ] like that bro you never know man this [ __ ] because it's just you know i don't know man it's just too normal looking man you know not even normal looking but too dull looking man you know i don't even know but then again then you got this is a whole another story you got pgr's with weed man you know so then if you're not getting that sprayed hemp [ __ ] if it look like it's you know just too dull and it might be some sprayed hair then you got you could have some [ __ ] [ __ ] that looks like some zaza and it could be some pgr weed man so like wait is tricky man 20 20. weed is tricky it really is and it's the same [ __ ] you know why like why wouldn't these cali plugs cut corners and make this money man you know these [ __ ] in cali shipping this [ __ ] bro because at the end of the day you're never gonna find them in person like the [ __ ] the [ __ ] who buying it off them you're never gonna link in person for real like you know you're just doing business through the ship and [ __ ] and then also it's like bro you're not gonna know for real bro like if you smoke that [ __ ] you get high you're just gonna assume my word i'm hiding it's just you know it's weird it might look like some [ __ ] but it's meat or it might look like some fire and get you high you might think oh where there's some fire whole time [ __ ] hit you with that four hundred dollar five hundred dollar ounce nine ounce i mean pound of hemp you know that's crazy to think about that [ __ ] crazy to think about at least when you gotta make carter [ __ ] you know for a fact that you're not getting hit with that because the dispensary is not getting this [ __ ] [ __ ] girl that [ __ ] right there you know but then again bro it's like i don't even at my point i don't even smoke much bud like to be honest i just dab delta eight now man a lot i got 60 grams coming in today this is switching the topic a little bit but hopefully today later on i have 60 grams of delta 8 here then i got to order some terpenes i want to order some empty cartridges i just don't know where to go to get that so now i can make my own carts and [ __ ] have a couple cards chilling but i plan on and i want to do a video for this i'm going to use 20 grams of delta eight distillate and make eight [ __ ] brownies bro that's two thousand four hundred and fifty milligrams a piece of delta eight you know so bro and i'm gonna eat a whole thing whole thing i might [ __ ] around to eat half of it you know but i plan on eating the whole thing and jeez man but yeah bro i wanted to talk about this sprayed him situation man that was you know me talking about it you know and my bad if i was talking a lot before i even got to really smoke but i just wanted to get that out of here i had all the [ __ ] [ __ ] in my head none of this [ __ ] is written down none of that i had everything i wanted to talk about in my head off rip so i was like we get that [ __ ] out now we can kind of just smoke and talk man you know but yeah that that [ __ ] is crazy man and my bad if i repeated myself a lot too i just wanted to get everything out but yeah man that shit's crazy bro when i heard about that [ __ ] at first i was kind of angry i was like bro no way i'm getting hit with no [ __ ] like and i don't barely buy wheat off the street now you know i don't barely but when i do there's no [ __ ] way that i'm getting hit with no hemp and not knowing it you feel me but it's like you think about it you think back it's like damn it was sometimes when i bought off the street where it just wasn't smacking like i wanted it to and it was cheap of course but it's like if i'm getting it for the low how much is these [ __ ] getting for and where are they getting it from man they could be getting this ship to them or they could be growing it themselves you never know man something to think about i said it's crazy man i don't know how many of y'all buy weed off of street vendors and [ __ ] i really don't but i saw that video i saw that video months ago actually and i just thought of it today because i saw it again and i'm like yeah i'm about to make a video on that [ __ ] people need to know about that man that's something that has to be talked about is the east coast getting hit with him are we you know like that would be insane bro that would be insane and especially how many real smokers is on the east coast [ __ ] you smoke weed every day bro that would just be an l for us man if we didn't if [ __ ] didn't know you feel me but like i'm a real [ __ ] bro i'm gonna go back and think like damn and i've always said it too bro i've really always said like bro it's crazy how the weed i used to get is like smacks harder than the weed that needs to be having now and the prices is just ridiculous now like if you look at it bro i posted some a picture of some weed i was getting it looked like some [ __ ] that [ __ ] would charge 64.84 nowadays i got that [ __ ] for 35. i said the price i bought it for in the video and this is two three years ago man it's like wow prices have changed the times have changed that [ __ ] is crazy [ __ ] blood flavored up and [ __ ] so what happens when you got these [ __ ] stems you got extra paper on there trying to cover the [ __ ] holes and [ __ ] that blunt came my other blunt cave all moldy so i'm not even gonna roll this [ __ ] up or nothing man [ __ ] that [ __ ] [ __ ] paid what two dollars for that [ __ ] too man you know what i'm saying but these edibles up i plan on i don't know what i want to do man i don't know if i want to do a video of me making them i'm gonna definitely do a video on me making them the 20 grams going in and everything i have a whole video of that 20 grams going in man 20 grams on the scale everything but you know i don't know if i want to do a video of me off the edibles like a quick update video type [ __ ] like you know me i'd say like two minutes to me and like let's say 30 minutes in you know and then i pause it come back come back another 30 minutes after that give a little two minutes of me see how i am and then pause it come back another 30 and keep doing that [ __ ] that's the video i want to upload but the only thing that sucks about it bro it's like i feel like it would be bad quality because i don't got no pc or nothing to really edit my [ __ ] bro once i get a pc which i plan on getting i was gonna get the ps5 but i've been trying to get that forever bro i have the money i've had the money to get it literally for like [ __ ] three months an hour since it came out basically and i just broke you can't find it i there's no stores with it it's i can't get it online it's i can't get it so i'm gonna just get a pc man but i don't know if i want to get a i can't build it myself bro and i'm not about to pay i'm not about to [ __ ] get all the parts and pay for somebody to build it for me that's just going to be so much [ __ ] money i think so probably gonna have to buy a pre-built my range is like 800 is the most i'm trying to spend i don't need nothing crazy something i can run for tonight you know damn high as hell i just started talking about the pc but yeah man definitely plan on getting that so i can get better quality videos for you all man you know keep uploading i'm really [ __ ] sick that they uh deleted me at like 700 subs last time man i would have been and that was three four years ago bro i would have been up there right now with the channel bro this is like the fourth channel i had sadly bro youtube don't [ __ ] with me man youtube does not [ __ ] me well they don't [ __ ] with weed bro really because they deleted me because of weed that's why i got deleted we and i had one copyright from uh some music and i was just getting flagged oh just because of my weed i was just getting flagged for the weed every video man they [ __ ] me over bro i don't even know what time it is it's probably like one o'clock in the morning i don't know if i can check that on fire first thing what time is it the time is 12 56 a.m that's it there you go boom 12 56 a.m man one o'clock i was right there pretty [ __ ] fake though like a lot of y'all but yeah man how do y'all feel about this situation i just broke down to y'all do you think we're getting hit with it especially if you're on the east coast do you think the plugs out here is really getting hit with that [ __ ] bro or do you think that [ __ ] is just all a bunch of baloney you hear me i mean to be honest with you though it makes sense bro it really does make sense just at least from around where i'm at the quality has went down in certain areas i used to have fire and fire the qualities really just went down overall unless you're buying this expensive ass weed you know which is ridiculous and that's this is just an illegal states man if you're in a legal state like where you have recreational weed by all means bro y'all are fine but if you're somewhere where it's completely illegal and [ __ ] aren't getting it shipped to him and [ __ ] like that y'all [ __ ] could be getting hit with the hemp you know especially these plugs who'd be shipping wax and [ __ ] like black spell they'd be shipping like crc down [ __ ] packs and [ __ ] or even pine resin i've been saying or seeing already if you go to reddit fake dabs on reddit bro i don't know what the [ __ ] that little hand motion i just did was but if you go on reddit type your fake dabs bro that them [ __ ] be getting shipped their [ __ ] most of them they post like yeah i got this [ __ ] to me or plug got this shipped to them and and it'd be like pine rising and [ __ ] like that i'm like bro if they wanted to send that [ __ ] then i'd [ __ ] 100 believe the uh the hemp situation with the weed man that shit's crazy actually the first time hit breakwater [ __ ] forever man let me know if you guys want to see some of the weed uh maybe next video if i remember i think the next video i'm gonna do is gonna be the brownie video though to be honest so it might have to be the next next video after this video i'm probably gonna go in i don't know i might play some fortnite or i might just watch some tv you go to sleep i'm kind of tired man it's one o'clock in the morning i might take a look dad and go to bed matter of fact i think i'm gonna take a dab right now for y'all the last dab i took i was coughing like a [ __ ] too i don't even have any delta eight left really to smoke i don't think i got a little bit in here i don't know if i can even get it out this is the 98 percent really [ __ ] to be honest with you yeah it's really not nothing left i really shouldn't have took i took like a grammy and [ __ ] and put it in some [ __ ] call uh some hot chocolate and i was [ __ ] smack boys let me go ahead and uh i guess i'll dab i don't know what i'm gonna die like i said i'll dab some nothing nine i haven't done that in a while unless there's something left in this in this rolled over labs i don't think so but we can try oh there is there's a little dab left why is this just so runny like that bro that shit's annoying uh there was a little dab left it's kind of hard to scoop it out though man we're gonna get this dab out of there bro come on [ __ ] it's right there i'm literally [ __ ] touching it it's just so hard to get out bro [ __ ] that i'm about to die from d9 man oh that looks like a fat ass blob right there damn i just can't [ __ ] get it it's too runny man tried to get the d8 out man tried there's a whole bunch of d9 or d8 let me see if i can get this off i can't really get that all right i'm back i actually got some of that delta eight barry white a little tiny bit left that was in here now my hands [ __ ] sticky as hell but got that someone dab that real quick put some of that in there this is actually another the third banger i think i bought now in the past couple months i got a this carb cap always gets stuck in there so i gotta like heat it up real quick that's probably not even going to do anything but boom that [ __ ] always gets stuck in there man leave a pretty nice dab in there [ __ ] take this dab hi [ __ ] y'all all right i already know how this is gonna go so i'm gonna [ __ ] around and turn the fan on right now man cause i already know i'm gonna be called for like a [ __ ] actually only my third dab of the day too cheers so i'm gonna clean this [ __ ] bro this [ __ ] is like clogged at the bottom all right that should taste good as hell that barry white from [ __ ] highest elevation south florida i slept on this this [ __ ] right here bro i haven't been smoking like i smoked it all but i didn't smoke it too much man like it wasn't my favorite but wow this [ __ ] tastes good the high is nice really tastes fire", "d9OxzFQUsgQ": "so i'm going to be using this uh portable co2 meter to measure the amount of carbon dioxide coming off the oil that i'm decarbing in this rotovap right now you see i'm at 100 degrees so our oil should be de-carving i'm under vacuum i prefer to do things that way right now we're standard atmospheric level just like outside 422 dbm you can see we got a lot of bubbling action there i'm going to go over to our vacuum pump and see what our meter says so i'm going to put it on the exhaust see what we got yeah let's open this real quick as you can see we're definitely breaking down thca and other exciting camera noise to their counterparts thc cbd so it is uh bioavailable edible form so i like to do this during the carb anytime i see a change in the way the bubbles are popping the size of the bubbles the amount of bubbles i like to come over here and check my exhaust just when you're deep into a d card sometimes it's hard to tell um what is turbulence in your oil you know bubbling up is what's ethanol coming out with water coming out is it still de-carving so when we're done de-carving this level breaks barely above atmospheric levels it's usually around uh when it finishes out it's around 470 to 500 you can sit there all day and get it down to 430 but i i don't trust this probe that much 99 decarb is pretty damn good [Music] we're still going up oh going back down just demonstrated the reaction that happens when you keep your food uh ethanol extract cannabis oil and rotomap right now we're heavy in the d car probably right in the middle pumping so talk about breaking bonds that's what we do if i remember i'll try to get the video uh try to get this out near the end so i can show you through the concept the carbon dioxide is not pumping out the pump but the d-carb is finished well that's your theory in action", "PD-DsYzU_bM": "oh gee [ __ ] that you get a fake one we'll need to fill it out with her why he'll know there's a chest as well

"9IsSK_j4Je4": "alright here's here's a quick video we put together showing you how I make the co2 dry ice hash no solvents it's not as clean as the bubble but a lot less time and easier on me also each time we shake the bag it's for three to five minutes tops I cut it and made it quicker so you don't have to watch all the shakin enjoy 190 micron bag you can go finer you'll get less product but it'll be better quality about 200 grams of good starting material five pounds of dry ice I'll probably only use half of it something to break the dry ice some scrape up your end product something to put it on to to help deliver it into your favorite jar mix it around this is gonna start to cool down everything inside the bucket including the trichomes check every few minutes give it a nice shake until frost starts to form yep see the take light green tint to the top everything will stick to it honey night and something to help us along music you can see the slight color differentiation this is a little green on the top so if I would stop 30 seconds earlier he would have been less green but this is only step one of tea and we get the joiner your favorite stash jar of course look one took one of the corners without gloves on this is a little bit easier but it's so cold here emotionally physically for me it's easier and a lot less invested time like I said there you go off-camera and they shake the bag once or twice more for a few minutes just to see if anything comes out but probably not you see it's a lot greener than the first product here's the first room here's the second one you see it's a lot greener you know but it's still pretty good smoke tastes a little green did you messed up on the strain that I'm using today it's called little moon shot it's just a tea that I believe or at least sativa dominant Oh anything left you now so here you go this one's for the weed nerds", "VB9SFLpbHhA": "nah yes we multiply and then one press will hear the fat lady sang I can

lamp draws out that flavor in some of this oil that I've just found to be Wow like I can't get that flavor by doing it out of a kind of a break unless it's like super low tap and I've got like a hot

hopefully it is focused on the camera but instead of using my other glass for the video instead of using like the actual rig i'm just going to be using the puffco peek pro just because these different videos even though the rig is fun to use it just takes a lot of time for videos and this is just more convenient for videos if you're just going to be tasting the flavor anyways because it keeps the same temperature so i'm going to be hitting this um off the peak pro at 490 for i believe it is a minute and 10 seconds so i'm gonna go ahead load this up and we're gonna go ahead and take a nice dab so let's go so here's what i'm going to be loading up if i didn't say before i don't think i did this is the recon flavor or strain if you want to call it but let's go ahead load it up and take a hit so it's all loaded up now and we're just going to wait for it to reach temp and once it vibrates we're going to be ready to go i have a turbo in here so hopefully you know i do get a better taste so all of the chirps will be splashing around so just vibrated and here we go uh do so i'm getting a lot of freaking smoke out of this at this low temp it should be over any second now so the batter tastes really good on this low temp and the reason i have it for a minute a minute and 20 seconds and so all of the batter um is used and i don't have any left so i don't need to keep reheating it so that's a good temperature to put it at so i'm only going to hit that one time because i really don't think i really need to go over it that much so it does taste really good i'm gonna have their instagram down below so here's like the little logo that they have and then here's what i just hit so really good flavor puffco peak probably can't go wrong with it really good device just expensive but if you do have the money to spend on it i wouldn't pass out on it's better than some of the other devices that are cheaper but if you want the best device this is it it's just kind of expensive but that's gonna be it for the video thank you guys so much for watching and this ethan signing out peace", "aGdAB4nl0nw": "here we have some Buddhists sister I love frosty to picked away spot at this
