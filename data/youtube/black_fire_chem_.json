{"Kn2OyQh6o7U": "you may have seen this demonstration before if you spray a solution of sodium salts with ethanol through a flame you get a characteristic orange a yellow color this is because when we heat up sodium it emits a very specific wavelength of light there our eyes see is orange yellow but look what happens when we do the same experiment in the light of a sodium street lamp it looks really amazing even to the naked eye the edge of the flame really looks like it is actually black what are you doing this is witchcraft this isn't science I feel like I'm watching a special effect so how does this work let's have a look at the flame in ordinary light here we have a solution of ethanol with some sodium salts as you can see it's glowing the characteristic orange yellow color the usual explanation for this is when you heat up the sodium the electrons in the orbitals around the nucleus get excited and they jump up to higher energy levels as they drop back down they release their energy as a photon of light quantum theory tells us that electrons in atoms can only exist at very specific discrete energy levels so this photon can only have certain energies as a photons energy determines its wavelength if that wavelength is in the visible spectrum our eyes will pick up as a specific color sodium atoms have two very strong electron transitions at five eight nine and five eight nine point six nanometers which are I see as a deep yellowy color to all intents and purposes these two wavelengths are so close together that they're indistinguishable so you can think of this yellow light as monochromatic and made up of just one color so how do we see the black flame effect first we need our yellow light this is a sodium street light or a low pressure sodium lamp I actually bought this one off eBay it originally came from an Army Depot if you send electric discharge through this inner tube which is filled with gas it glows to create the monochromatic yellow light that we've been talking about when street lights first come on in the evening you might notice that there this pink color that's because there's neon and a little bit of argon gas inside the tube which when we send electricity along it gets excited and blows pinkish red that's actually only there to heat up and vaporize the sodium that you can see in little dots along the tube when the sodium vaporizes those atoms get excited and give out the lovely monochromatic yellow color you can see here we don't just get this yellow light out of sodium lamps these pickles are soaked in brine or salt water so they are jam-packed with sodium when we put a huge voltage across them they heat up the sodium gets excited and they give off that lovely yellow light but I digress let's get back to the black things the reason for this effect is because in the same way that sodium atoms tend to emit light of a certain wavelength around 589 nanometers they also tend to absorb light of that specific wavelength and this makes the flame look dark it's strange to think of a flame as dark because as we know flames give out light but the sodium is absorbing the light from the lamp that light isn't reaching the camera and so the flame looks duck [Music] thanks for watching if you like this video don't forget to subscribe and the RI is now on Patriot's if you want to support us click the link above", "5ZNNDA2WUSU": "okay today I'm going to be teaching you how to make dark fire so in order to understand how to make a dark flame first we have to understand what fire actually is so fire is what's known as a partial plasma and what that means is that most of it is just really hot gas but a small percentage of it is actually ionized gas because it's gained so much energy that it's lost some of its electrons and the light from fire comes from when those ions gain their electrons back they release a photon of life and so fire in and of itself is a light source even when you shine a brighter source of light on it you still don't get a shadow behind it let me show you so you can clearly see the shadow of my hand here but you can see that the fire doesn't make a shadow at all and if you look really close though you can see slightly something behind the fire and you can add a little bit tell that the fires there but that's just due to the fire heating up the air around it and it changes how light passes through the air it bends the light a little bit basically the same reason you see a mirage on a hot day so that's basically what's happening here so it's not a shadow but it's changing the refractive index due to heating up the air and not only does it not have a shadow but if you put a light source behind it the light from behind it can easily pass through it and get to the camera so you don't see that this is dimming the light behind it in fact it's adding light to it and that makes perfect sense because like I said fire is a light source and so you see the light behind it and in addition you see the fire but it doesn't get dimmer it doesn't make the light behind it dimmer but is there a way to make fire dark meaning is there a way to make it actually absorb light instead of lit it off so in order to make dark fire or fire that absorbs light I need help from a special kind of lamp and it's called a low pressure sodium lamp and this lamp lets off only one specific wavelength of light so it's a monochromatic light source as opposed to this white light that just lets off the full spectrum of colors okay so this is a low pressure sodium vapour lamp here so inside here is a tube and in that tube there's some neon and you can see every few inches or so there's some dots here and those dots are actually sodium metal and what happens when you apply a very high voltage to the ends here the sodium metal heats up due to the neon gas inside heating up and it heats up enough that it starts to vaporize the sodium metal then the sodium atoms begin to ionize and they ionize and recombine with electrons and in so doing they lit off light but they only lit off light in one specific wavelength range around 589 nanometers it's actually two very close spectral lines of 589 and 589 point 6 but it's considered a monochromatic light source because those two wavelengths are so close together so basically it lits off light of only one wavelength in a yellowish orange range the weirdest effect of a sodium vapour lamp has to be that it basically turns everything into a black and white movie so I have here a tomato and my orange extension cord watch what happens when I turn on the sodium vapour light and turn off my regular light and everything's black and white so it's just crazy looking at my own hands here they basically just look black and white everything becomes a total shade of gray and the reason this happens turning everything black and white like this is because this is a monochromatic light source basically the only thing you can see is either this yellow light or a lesser shade of it and so everything in the room is either reflecting a little bit of this yellowish light or absorbing it so it looks a little bit darker so the only way we're going to get a shadow is if this fire can actually absorb this specific wavelength of light okay let's lay our alcohol on fire you can see that there's no shadow to this flame here like the alcohol and fire also no shadow behind it but now let's see what happens when I stick this tissue that's soaked in salt water in it watch this look at that you get Blackfyre so when I stick this in it suddenly you see a shadow behind the flame and the flame also turns black so I can assure you that what you're seeing now isn't camera trickery or anything it actually looks like what you're seeing it actually even looks cooler in person because it actually looks like black fire when I stick this in it so what's happening here is that this has sodium atoms in it and those vaporized sodium atoms can now absorb the wavelength of light coming off the sodium vapour lamp because it's the same wavelength the same atoms and so basically we create a fire that can absorb light so cool okay I've discovered something even cooler than just sticking the tissue in it if you drop a stream of the sodium chloride water in it then you get this black flame coming out of it so awesome look at that black fire it's totally black okay so I have to say I've done a lot of experiments on my channel and out of all of them this has to be one of my favorites this is so cool to see in person it's so cool to see the flame actually turned black it looks like I'm watching a movie or something and there's a special effect happening in front of me this is so awesome it's this is not smoke there's no smoke coming off of it whatsoever but this is black fire that is so cool okay look at this black fire so it's definitely hot this is not smoke but it is fire hey everybody thanks for watching another episode of the action lab I hope you enjoyed it if you did hit the subscribe button and hit the bell to be notified with my latest videos out and head over to the action lab comm if you haven't yet to check out my subscription box where you can do experiments similar to the ones that you see me do on my channel thanks for watching and I'll see you next time", "oRohAx0AGiY": "whoa what's up science team not too long ago I was on YouTube and I was watching a video about a black fire from the YouTube channel the action lab and I thought it was so cool that I decided to watch another video about the same subject from the YouTube channel the Royal Institute and I kept thinking myself this is amazing immediately after watching these videos I started thinking how can we do this experiment but make it way cooler then I thought about the time that we shot neon green and pink flames across my entire driveway with a build that we got from the king of random it was this little mini fire extinguisher that was converted into a flamethrower then boom a light bulb goes off in my head but in our case a low pressure sodium bulb because today we're gonna be making a black fire flamethrower now in order to make this work we had to order a few specialty items we got this on Amazon and a bunch of different pieces and had to rig it all together to make it work there was actually a photo of his exact same setup online by user 6 3400 who then got roasted by this other guy Harper telling him not to buy random things online so I guess in a way this video is kind of for you user 6 3400 these items actually do work they do make the light bulb turn on but you gotta kind of finagle everything this is the ball but which has this funny bottom called a bayonet base which needs this thing called a bayonet base lamp holder then we need this thing to make sure the bulb doesn't burn out superfast this is called a ballast and it regulates the electric current to make sure the bulb has enough electricity to fire up and then minimize the electrical current to sustain light without the bulb overheating truthfully we didn't know how to set this up either but the nikah pedia team just joined a makerspace called hex labs and one of the members makes these super awesome custom lamps his name is Shannon and he has this company called fifty-first and he's really awesome cool like hipster lamp sets there's actually a link in the description below to his Etsy I really want you guys to check it out he took one look at all of our parts and he wired it all together and literally the first try he got the ball up and running okay when you turn on a low pressure studying light the neon gas inside the ball begins to glow first it's just like pinkish reddish color then as the temperature increases in the ball these little tiny bits of sodium begin to vaporize this is actually the same sodium that we used for exploding our play button so once it begins vaporizing it gives off this glove light that's close to monochromatic yellow really it's two wavelengths of light it's 589 and 589 point 6 nanometers but our eyes really can't tell the difference so when you turn this light on it kind of makes everything look like this you know weird horror film glow you know gray black monochromatic look so what we're gonna do is we're going to take some regular old table salt I just blended this is just regular table salt which is a sodium chloride and we're gonna mix that with methanol and it should give us a really cool interesting that color flame so let's see what it does [Applause] [Music] all right now the reason that we're seeing this really cool orange fire is that when sodium is heated up the electrons jump up in an energy level and when they come back down that release a wavelength of light or their release of photon and that is seen as a wavelength of light a very specific wavelength of light and that is 589 and 589 point six okay so this flame which is heating up sodium is kind of like the really basic version of the low pressure sodium bulb and if we flood this flame with the same wavelength of light from a low pressure sodium bulb something really cool should happen [Music] [Music] you know the reason that we're getting this totally wacky witchcraft looking flame is that sodium atoms not only give off a specific wavelength of light but they also absorb it too so while we're flooding the fire with light at five hundred and eighty nine and five hundred eighty nine point six nanometers from the lamp the fire is actually absorbing that light making it look black [Music] [Music] I guess orange is the new black okay let's make a flamethrower now with all these different black fire demos I started thinking with the same principles apply but on a grander scale so here's what we're gonna do we're gonna take this this is just table salt sodium chloride and we're gonna mix it with this right here methanol we're gonna take that solution and we're gonna put it inside of this mini flamethrower this is the king of random at mini flamethrower we're gonna add some pressurized air with a bike pump and then what should happen is when I pull them this little lever right here they should sure solution out this way across this and this will be lit this will be a little flame and that should light our solution up and we should see that really nice orangish glow from the sodium that is getting heated up and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna line the driveway with three of these low pressure sodium bulbs which we'll also be giving off the wavelength of light five eighty nine and five eighty nine point six and then what should happen is our flame should then absorb that light and turn black and you should leave us with a giant streak of a black flame all across the driveway now in order to see the flame better we're gonna line the driveway with white paper and for safety we're going to shoot the flamethrower at a wall that we build at the end of the driveway but I have no idea this is gonna work at all so let's give it a shot danger so there's at least one set up now we need to do the wiring all right you don't need to be pretty bulbs in forget [Music] definitely very minute sciency skip your shot what we're trying to do here is we're trying to conserve all of that light as possible so we have these bounces this wall is white and we're seeing some good results so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to take this methanol or I'm just gonna draw a line from the wall cross even better oh yeah it's so much better this is our table salt [Music] turn that bad boy up [Music] [Music] [Music] the power [Music] all right so here's what we're noticing the flamethrower works really well you can see black right around the edges and also towards the end of the cycle of the flamethrower when there's a little more air we're starting to see a little bit more of that black flame so what we're gonna do is we're going to cut actually some of our methanol with salty water [Music] okay okay good let's go [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] okay there we go it was so crazy to see this like black flame kind of crawling up the driveway and up this wall and it sort of just kind of like you know spiraling all over the place it honestly it doesn't look real but it is real we have not edited the video at all we also saw this really dark flame around the stream of fire that was shooting out of the mini flamethrower now we suspect that the entire flame wasn't black because the wattage of our low pressure sodium bulbs wasn't high enough to deliver that very specific wavelength of light that 589 and 589 point 6 we learned one that there is black fire 2 how to make black fire and 3 all about these low pressure sodium bulbs which are just super cool if you haven't yet hit that subscribe button yeah I'll see you really soon [Music] you [Music]",

grind up a little bit sweeter now not as much pine as it was before his earthy notes go ahead and uh clean this bowl cleaner than it usually is let me go ahead and uh throw that in there and give it a taste give it a nice rip see what blackfire is all about and like i said never tried this before it's coming in at uh 16 or 17 it was like five something 525 535 something like that there's the numbers on it and if you guys don't know already moves flowers a little weird you take the big number that they give you whatever the 100 number something it's always a three digit number whatever it is divide it by 3.5 and then move the digit to uh the decimal point to the left one digit and that'll give you your percentage so like i said this is like 15 or 16 or 16 or 17 percent i'm sorry i'm gonna go ahead and uh give it up you know percentage doesn't always matter especially indicus this is the first indica flower straight indica i think i've had from uh move over there but i'm quite uh talking my ass off this uh mob boss from the pen over here got me talking cheers guys like i said i hope you're smoking along with me getting right have a good day more spicy than i would say more spicy earthy notes i'm not getting very much sweet on this there's more sweet on the smell than there was on the taste i'll tell you that but i do enjoy it it's nice there's some peppery notes in there like something like i said some tiny smarty notes go ahead and give it one more and uh we'll get back into what i think you guys want to enter that giveaway i was talking about before completely

out your flower and take a couple hits throw it away don't gotta worry about it it also works if you got the cops coming whatever you want to do you know what i mean um i'm going to put the uh number and everything down in the description you just have to text um the word bud bud all lower case to uh the number i'm gonna put it down in the description and then i'm gonna give my uh just put my referral code whenever they give you prompted ask if you have a referral code and it'll go ahead and tell them that i sent you and you'll get three free you'll get three of those one hitters for free sent right in your mailbox you just gotta give them the shipping address that's it and you don't have to be a cannabis patient or anything all they do is ask your address and uh maybe i don't think they ask your birthday or any that [ __ ] just your name your address i believe i'll send it right to your door you help me out here on the channel i hope you guys out you i get uh they send me uh every time you guys get one of those i get some of them and of course i'm not going to sit here and i keep a bunch of them i get a bunch of them collected i'm gonna start giving away you guys have more giveaways like i said help me out help you guys out and like i said uh that's the company's name is bogart i'm gonna go ahead and leave it down there in the description i'll let you know and uh as soon as i get mine in the mail they're gonna say they're supposed to be sending me some here uh soon the next couple days i'm gonna go ahead and get a review video out of them like i said i'll announce it again on the video but i'll get a nice function of me trying out the product letting you guys know what i do but of course i've seen other people review this product before and i wouldn't push a product that i don't trust that's what it is uh my shout out my girl me269 uh me269 over there she's already tried it out she's the one that i referred me to to work with the com to work with a company bogart and uh since i started working that i'm loving it as soon as they send me some more of them out here like i said i'll go ahead and review them and get a video up for you guys and hope you enjoy it i'm gonna go ahead and take another rip off of this and damn i'm pretty lit right now i'll tell you what nice and medicated that black fire is very fire got me feeling lit it's a little bit longer of a video i'm going to take one more rip of this guys cheers and then uh go ahead get out of your hair this video is getting a little long it's already in 12 minutes i tried to do a blinker there at the beginning but i couldn't do it my lungs were dying on me [ __ ] burns too hot they i think move over here just pumps up the wattage as hot as i can just so the battery doesn't die before the oil runs out i got this yesterday and it's already starting to slow down on me if you rip it hard it doesn't matter i said cheers guys um look out for the giveaway down there um 100 subscribers like i said give you guys a couple weeks go ahead and hit me in the email and uh hit me on that uh check out that company bogart get uh three free of those uh one hitters cheers guys smoke one for me smoker uh smoked one for your mama have a great day", "yns4tbpW9uw": "i see you haven't changed a bit when we were little i was always rescuing starfire [Music] sister nearly got sucked

invincible besides you'll always be my little sister i am not so little anymore earth has changed that's right bow down before your grand ruler you may be the ruler of this planet but you are not the ruler of me [Music] [Music] oh you wish i won't forget this sister dear", "YoOD54Dxkk0": "hey Jeff have you seen this these videos like they're like on Facebook and YouTube these people are taking snowballs and then like trying to melt them but they're claiming they're catching on fire because there's all sorts of pollution and stuff inside oh I don't know I'm skeptical it's got to be something else yeah I don't believe in even at the end here they say Oh smell it smell it it smells like plastic there's so much plastic inside the snow really there must be a lot of plastic to do that we should try this we should let's grab some snow and see if we can see what's happening here what's that girl get some clean snow yeah yeah deep in there some fresh snow rush right well don't pack it down man we're gonna make snowballs with it get some fluffy stuff this is good enough for him Alice okay so the claim is you make that little snowball here and we got a lighter I wonder if it matters how tightly you pack them yeah because this is real this is a nice nice fluffy stuff yeah you can make some good snowballs with us all right so we got one there reserved okay so well when I see them doing is that they seem to be lighting the con towards the top okay like so and I would get any of that black material Karl can you see they're claiming this plastic I'm not seeing a lot of it's very slight very slight very slight little black stuff I don't know let me get the get the candle in the deeper it doesn't appear to me though that there's any water dripping yeah kind of their other claim to that the snow doesn't melt I'm not buying I think the snow the water is just going back into left fluffy snow it's got to be just running off into the snow and then I mean my hand is freezing enough to show that it looks like there's a little bit there's a little bit of a divot there maybe a little bit of Darkness but that's dry if the flame right underneath right maybe maybe that makes watch your fingers alright so that would be bad smell - I trust my fingers are so cold right now I don't think they're gonna come on the beginning burn okay I'm seeing lots of black stuff showing up right now and I can definitely see wet moisture ice I'm not seeing it dripping though no but look at that oh wow okay so definitely you've seen the suit I've seen the sight not seeing so much water dripping but I saw wetness on the bottom mhm so so what I'm thinking is there's real three claims to this right well what does it smell like yeah yeah it smells it smell it smells bad that's for sure so it smells like a butane lighter yeah I think you might be right so this we claims one is that this dark stuff is somehow plastic right that there's a plastic smell to it plastic in the atmosphere and it's gotten itself into the snow and the water as well and that's somehow stopping it from freezing because or melting from melting cuz I mean plastic doesn't you know melt with just a boot ain't lighter apparently apparently see I don't know to me it feels like it's just if we tried this with a piece of glass that glass we've got never chemistry right complete combustion being complete combustion yeah yeah so we got some hydrocarbons and butane in that lighter rice you're gonna you're gonna like that and we should still see that soot that builds up that's just from it being incomplete combustion reaction that's incomplete combustion right instead of getting just co2 and water and heat we're getting a little bit of some extra carbon left over that makes sense I feel like that's definitely busting about the plastic runaway well you know what let's try it with this guy here this little torch which will allow us to adjust the amount of oxygen going into the flame all right so we're probably the one - yeah we're not gonna okay okay so you two grab a piece slide here okay get it dry now this flame is pretty hot so we're weren't protection in case something happens to our glass I might hold it up high like a penny salute this this blue flame we have here actually allows more oxygen into the combustion reaction which means that it's more of a complete combustion reaction we're fine I'm not gonna get an ideal complete reaction but you'll notice maybe it's complete I think they call it complete but imperfect combustion you have excess oxygen you even have oxygen and the flames coming up yeah so I'm getting some ones once we have more option the system which we can do with this blue flame and you can see if that's getting rather ha and we are getting no hardly any so no certain no carbon all that nice no there's no let's choke off the oxygen so this is choked off oxygen which means there's gonna be excess carbon now correct this is your really imperfect combustion incomplete combustion and this is a much more resembling the BIC flame you'd see the lighter of that maybe then the flame is cooler too as you can see from the temperature the color change it's not that hot blue it's a cooler yeah yeah and that's that's just the stuff building up so I think you know on the snowball what you seeing there is soot from the incomplete combustion of the flame from the butane you're not seeing burnt plastic no no no no there's no plastic in my glass slide no and I still see in that Sun that smell his suit and butane okay but what about no snow appearing anywhere no moisture rather than the water I think it's just melting batter it's melting into the snowball and then refreezing immediately that's what I'm thinking wait so what if we would make a really nice glass no ball this makes any sense so nice flat surface okay so they're kind of like the claim is that it's not melting well if it's melting and we have a flat surface we're gonna see a change there we should see a divot or something and why don't I hold it you you light up there Carl so we're gonna put the flame right underneath and see if we can melt a divot into the snow so I'm seeing this slip building up I am not seeing any water dripping from the snowball but my contention is that the swatters wicking its way up into the lightly packed snow yeah and this snows gonna be really porous right so it's gonna be a lot of space for that water to slip in between absolutely okay so now check out the bottom we have a divot yeah that's not flattering no no definitely not right and you can even see the moisture right there and once again it seems so building up it would make some ice actually some ice the water has melted and refrozen right in the bottom of the snowball yeah that's so that's definitely a lot smoother so the water is definitely melting and we're even watching it refreeze it's melting so it's just like we thought yeah I'm so I'm not buying that there's plastic in the snow or that it's not melting or those or that trails or that it's catching on fire or anything like that yeah that was interesting but it's all over Facebook and YouTube yeah craziness first well I mean still it's kind of fun to try at home but maybe it's not plastic it's not plastic yeah it's not plastic all right cool", "OYZT3opLedc": "[Music] [Applause] when I was a young lad when I was the young lad I used to belong to the Boy Scouts and every summer one of the highlights of my holidays was to go on a scout camp one of the greatest challenges for the young Scouts was to see how few matches they could use to light a campfire or a bonfire if you could use two or three matches to light a bonfire you're considered to be an expert if you could use just one match you were considered to be a grandmaster I used to use no matches now the campfire the bonfire which we have burning here this evening of course is part of an ancient human tradition the indeed our ability to make fire at our own will etc we're using our own techniques is one of the greatest achievements of early human civilization ten thousand fifty thousand years ago certainly a very very long time ago and today of course I wanted to talk about the primarily the chemistry of how the fires wood fires burn but also about the physics and the sociology so I'm going to start off by telling you that when wood burns it's actually when you're lighting fire and burning wood you are actually not burning the wood that is going to be the whole point of my demonstration this evening and I wanted to start off by showing you how it is possible to ignite I have here a propane burner and how we ignite a propane burner oh by the way before we go on I do have something I wanted to do and that's just to and ignite one of my I have a little spirit burner here and I'll tell you about why I'm igniting this because it's very very relevant to our topic so I'm just going to put that flame there and that I wanted to tell you that when we going back to a modern gas burner like this you see it's very easy to set the gas on fire and the reason is you press a little figure you can all see a little tiny little piezoelectric spark so if you want to set this on fire you simply turn on your your flow of gas here press this fart and bingo we have a wonderful flame and it's a light straightaway you see and we know that the propane is burning directly because it has come there however if I wanted to show you now I'm going to set fire to this piece of wood and if I hold this wood in out let's say flame here you can see the wood is not catching fire and furthermore you can probably understand that if I wanted this wood to catch fire it would take a very very long time indeed and the reason why this is the case it hasn't even just started to char the reason why it takes so very long indeed because actually the wood chemically changes into a whole range of different substances when it's actually burns and this is what I'm going to demonstrate for you today I'm going to start off by showing you I have here some sawdust sawdust is basically small pieces of tiny tiny pieces of wood they have a large surface area you can see they're smouldering a little bit as I drop them onto our fire which is burning so this is wood which has been pounded to a very very high level and I've placed it in his retort flask here now our retort flask is one of the most ancient pieces of apparatus chemical apparatus that the human being has invented and I'm going to in it is used primarily for heating a substance and then collecting any vapors that might come off from that substance and so what I'm going to do now is to heat this up this wood in here and let's see it's as if it catches fire inside the flask I'm going to heat it with a very very strong flavour indeed so allow me to turn the gas on turn on our thing here and I will now commence this process now this experiment which I'm going to demonstrate this process which I am demonstrating for you now is going to take a proxy ten minutes it's quite a long process and we're going to observe the gradual changes that take place to the ward as it is being roasted by my very very hot flame now I hope you can already see that there is a little bit of steam condensate collecting on the in inside on the top of the flask and indeed you can all now see that there is some smoke coming out of the bottom of the flask furthermore you can now see more slope and then those of you who can see there is some charring of the of the wood etc but and you can also probably see that the floss is glowing red-hot and yet the wood inside is not catching fire there children let's see now we'll carry on this heating process and we'll explain to you a little bit about what what would actually is made of I'm sure you will all agree that this very I'm going to put a light here to see Oh can you see that it's burning now that's not the wood it's burning it is actually a product of this chemical reaction which I'm doing here which I'm undertaking here and also you see that not only is that gas burning there but there is also a liquid dripping out of the bottom of the flask now if you don't mind I'm going to come round and with my back to you just to warm this up a little bit from the front please excuse me and I'm sure you'll all agree that we are now burning with the wood is not burning directly but it has been chemically changed into different substances and those different substances are now in the form of two different states of matter there is a gas which is being produced here in the form of a smoke and furthermore there is a liquid an orange and orange gooey smelly liquid which is coming out of the bottom furthermore you may observe that there is on the side of the flask a dark brown dark brown oily liquid which is going down the side of the flask so what I'm demonstrating for you is a type of a chemical reaction in which we take the wood which is made off I'll tell you very shortly what it's made of and we are breaking it down into smaller particles I'll just see we could get that to light again it burns sometimes sometimes it doesn't burn but the point is the wood is being chemically changed and I wanted to tell you in this very crude type of experiment and can I also tell you this type of experiment has been done for thousands of years not because people wanted to see what happens because it had a utilitarian purpose and that was to make charcoal you will notice already at the bottom of this flask that we have essentially a black solid which is in fact charcoal I am now going to try and set fire to it once again excuse me while I do wander around a little bit and many of you will be able to see the tar the sort of whoops-a-daisy these splints are not very good I tried to get one out I'm multitasking as you can see a reasonably successfully if I may say so now let's just put this this and let's put this myth I do love these fires out you must excuse me I'm a little bit I remain a cart I'm just trying to get enough of the products to be able to explain to you what is actually taking what is actually going on now you see there it is and I think that basically that's enough to show you that would when strongly heated it can change I'm going to turn off my flame now whoops-a-daisy let's get it turning in the right direction I think I've got it in the right direction yes that's turned it off now please look at this splendid the wood is producing a dense smoke and it is producing a liquid there so wood here is a solid we're talking about the states of matter here it is like this and we have heated it very strongly now that heating process is the same heating process of course when we put a splint into a flame and it catches fire instantaneously well not quite instantaneously because before it catches fire it always must char it must have a little bit of blackness on it a little bit of black charcoal and once it's got a bit of black charcoal we're then in the position what we're actually doing we're producing this smoky stuff here which is in the gas phase and we're producing this very very very smelly liquid here which can you see it's an oily car it's got some dark oily droplets in it and this is and it's suspended in a sort of a light orange type of watery layer and we have furthermore left behind here some charcoal so what we have done by applying the process of heat we have converted wood which is a solid into three completely different substances one of them is at three different states of matter should I say three states of matter one of them is a gas one of them is a liquid and one of them is a solid and each of those three states of matter is no longer the same as the wood which it started off as as I told you this process has been practiced for many many thousands of years primarily to make charcoal which I'll be talking about later but also to make this liquid here which is called a pyro ligneous distillates distillate because this retort flask here has collected the vapors and condensed them pyro meaning fire and ligneous derived from wood so we have a pyro ligneous distillate here and we have the gaseous mixture there and the charcoal over there now what I wanted to tell you next is in this very simple cruel experiment since this very crude experiment has been done and people have found use not only for the charcoal but for the gases and for the liquids as well chemists have made great advances and have been able to do this type of experiment and actually analyze the products in much much greater detail and what they have set up here is that their paratus for doing precisely this in this apparatus here I have in here in this round bottom flask here I have exactly the same material I have a pile of sawdust but this time rather than crudely allowing the gas mixture because it is actually a mixture of substances coming out there in terms of such States this is a solid this was a gas and this is a liquid in terms of chemistry though this is a mixture this is a mixture and that too is a mixture and I'll be explaining that because here using this apparatus we are actually going to separate some of the components of that mixture and I'm going to invite I have two assistants with me in order to carry out this experiment because this will take about 15 to 20 minutes and I will ask undressed to come on hundredths with Yakov is the senior laboratory technician and chemical demonstrators from Paul's School in West London and my son Oscar who is going to assist in the experiment today now I'm going to ask Andres and Oscar to commence this experiment here and I will explain the chemistry and the science of wood as they do so now for this purpose we're going to use a quite a strong propane a torture a propane torch with a significantly bigger flame and it should generate a reasonable result now on this occasion rather than just allowing the vapors here to be separated into a liquid and a gas we're going to pass the vapors first of all through a threshold bottle here which I have this is a type of bottle for collecting distilled vapors and condensing them and it's sitting in a beaker full of ice well that will enable to happen is that the vapors will start cooling down condensing much more efficiently than here this is a threshold bottle which contains sodium hydroxide solution now the sodium hydroxide solution here will chemically absorb one of the gases which is being produced in this process and the gas which is being produced in this throat it's a mixture of gases and carbon dioxide is one of them I think we can start collecting Oskar probably okay now the reason why I'm going to be giving a little bit of Direction is because this is not at all an easy experiment and the mixture of gases I am telling you straight away it's not one gas which comes off but it's a mixture of gases not too strongly out there just a little bit gently don't collect all the gases Oscar I'm giving a commentary there about 30 gas jars will be collected Oscar will only collect 5 of them and the reason is we want to show you how the composition of the gas changes as the process of pyrolysis continues now their children are one word I wanted you to learn today is what's happening here this experiment or what we're doing here breaking down a substance by the action of heat is called pyrolysis and it is a word which used to describe this process of breaking down wood into simpler substances now the one of the gases coming off is carbon dioxide some steam is produced as well but in those jars will be collected a mixture of three main gases which are produced which were all burning here and I'll tell you what those three main gases are they are carbon monoxide hydrogen and methane I will put this up on a screen for you later on and I will demonstrate each of these gases individually now while this reaction is taking place I will tell you a little bit about what would actually is made of and we can consider wood from two directions one from the points of chemistry what chemicals is it made of and I'm sure you'll agree that this is not one substance it's a mixture of lots of substances which have been produced by nature it's a mixture of substances and they are essentially natural polymers very very large molecules one of them is called cellulose it's the same molecule that you find in cotton wool in paper and wood and indeed it is one of the main molecules that is found in all plants another group of molecules are called hemicelluloses and the third type of molecule in water are called lignans now I will very briefly explain three types of molecule cellulose is our hydrocarbon carbohydrates which are polysaccharides they're made up of lots of sugar molecules which are produced in the plant and they join together to form the structure of the cells in the wood hemi cellulose and they're very organized cellulose is has is very strong in tension and they're long and they are they are arranged quite regularly in the structure of the wood Hemi semi loza's as the name suggests a much shorter molecules they are composed of different types of sugars and they're slightly more haphazardly arranged but they are necessary and they contribute to the structure of the wood and the lignin is the main type of material which is only found in wood and not in other plants which don't contain the wood the lignin is the wood enos of the plant now lignin is a most fascinating mixture of substances and the difference between lignin and the cart the cellulose and the Hemi semi roses is that lignin has lots of aromatic groups in it it's a different type of chemistry lignin is strong in compression and it gives wood that very very hard that the relative hardness with which we associate wood and I will be coming back to these terms because understanding what we have at the start will help us to understand to identify and discuss the products which are made at the end now how are we getting on MIDI on this it's how many how many jars will be got so far it's okay thank you very much indeed so we are going to explain to you also what the substances are a little bit about them before we continue further oh I know while that's actually going on I wanted just to tell you a little bit because this will take another couple of minutes a little bit about my own favorite Ward's I have two words which are my favorites one of them is balsa wood which is the wood out of which these models are made of and the reason why I like it so much is because it is the lightest it has the lowest density of all the woods in the whole world the density of balsa wood is naught point three grams per centimeter cubed now because it has such a very very low density it is fantastic for making models with etc and I wanted to show you by the way I bought a question which someone might come and tell me the answer to did you know their children that there is a metal which exists which has the same very low density as a balsa wood this is supremely light you will not meet this metal on an everyday basis but if anyone can come and tell me at the end of the lecture which metal has the same density as balsa wood he will receive or she will receive a prize from me the person preferably someone of the younger age group please now may I return that may I return although I suspect it might be a challenging question for non-specialists as well now what I wanted to show you is just simply how my own interest is I've got two models as you can see here made out of balsa wood this you see is is a boat made out of balls I made this when I was 8 years old in 1958 and I used to sell it I used to sort of I haven't an outboard motor and a little celluloid window and I used to sort of sail it in the paddling pool in Hammersmith Park close to where I used to live I regretted sometimes hit the bottom and in there hole so I put patches on it but because I spent so much time making it I could never bear the thought of throwing it away and that's why I brought it here now I used to make lots of model aeroplanes lots of model airplanes regrettably they all crashed on their first or second flight so it was a lot of time etc but one has survived and I brought this to show you here it's not in very good condition but it is made of balsa well it's an it's a control line you sort of put it all you have a motor you come here now like this and it flies around a long long things with a motor on it now the only reason why I've still got this is of course because it's the only one which didn't crash but the reason why I didn't crash because it never flew so that's why I said I actually couldn't get the engine to work I was a disaster now uhm Oscar would you be able have you almost finished the jars yeah Oscar's actually just just wanted to show you dear children it's such fun making these little balls they're very cheap you can buy them Oscar could you just demonstrate that you demonstrate this I'll collect the last year just give it a few throws that we must entertain ourselves children even so this is a little bit of error error error dynamics a little bit of aeronautical a baby fly has it flown Oscar thank you very much thank you Andres this is brilliant I have now collected the last jar now another another one of my favorite towards another one of my favorite towards please excuse me do we have some tissue oh yes we do have by the way I have to tell you secretly under here we have many useful things so I've got tissue we've got rubbish bins all sorts of things this really looks very very beautiful on this I think we have a fantastic result here and as you see 1d whence the heating has stopped the the products will start to cool down and very shortly we'll be able to analyse but I just wanted to tell you about another one of my favourite woods and I'll tell you why it's his maple I'll tell you why the maple is and one of my favorite wood well because first of all is because you can actually drink it it's one of the few trees one of the few trees where you can get a product from the woody substance of the tree and this is here maple syrup and I'm sure you all enjoy maple syrup but not sorry can you eat maple but you can also make splendid musical instruments from them and I would like to this demonstrate for you I have a musical instrument because I love music and I want to just to show you such an example of of playing a tune thank you very much Oskar on this is a viola and it's made of maple so we have wood we don't necessarily have them to burn wood all the time back in melody [Music] now you see that's a very straight that's a very straightforward melody see but the honest truth is so a little sociology my dear children is that of course when people used to meet at campfires and bonfires and things to play they used to meet in large groups you see and they used to talk and make food etc and they music was not only made by just one person necessarily but groups of people used to gather and I just invited a few of my friends with maple instruments to come and play you a Rumanian folk melody so if we can just come on where are their will [Music] so there we are just a little music thank you very much to my friends my Romanian friends as you see wood doesn't always have to be burnt as you know there are thousands of uses and now let's wrap it they return back to chemistry thank you very much Oscar let's return to the chemistry thank you so much there Andres is absolutely wonderful now what's happened unless we in the meantime we've had a sock back not to worry we shall that we show that that's unfortunately some water got sucked by we got carried away with the music and in fact it's gone right back into the flask now this by the way does show some very interesting principles of physics dear children we continue to learn when you heat gases they expand but will you allow them to cool they contract and what we've have happened here is as we went took our through the eyes of the of the equipment VM the water as the flask cool down water got sucked back from here into here into there and into there and I'm going to show you in other experiments at the end which shows you this exact phenomenon with some very very nice color changes but so what we've done is we fill the flask but not to worry we have collected our gases here we have also kept just in case this happened today I have a sample of what is known as the pyro ligneous distillate here and what I wanted to do is to explain to you a little bit about these substance which is we have here and I'm going to start off by telling you that the charcoal which I have here which we have a small Oscar could you sprinkle some charcoal this is the sprinkled some charcoal into the flame this is from a previous experiment I said we'd have kept supplies because we are ready for all sorts of circumstances and the most important thing is not to have an accident of course and just sprinkle a little bit just to show can you see that is just charcoal some more some more Jenna generous supply there Oscar we don't want to be mean without they shows many spark it's much more likely so this is just charcoal burning in air you see so women now say saying is it when wood is pyrolyzed broken down into simpler substances those long molecules of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin are broken down into longer more it's shorter molecules they fought a wide variety of substances now deer Oscar could we try and ignite these jars one at a time because we'll do the gas no actually I tell you what let's first of all do one thing here before we do the gasses and then just look at this pyro ligneous wood distillate which we have here and I wanted to show you that the pyro ligneous will distillate consists of two layers I very much hope you can all see them there's a sort of orange layer and at the bottom there is this thick oily liquid which is sitting at the bottom there now the oily layer comes the oily layer is from the lignin part which is the aromatic hydrocarbons which don't mix with the aqueous layer which contains obviously water but three very important organic chemicals and one of them is methanol see these two flames burning here they're children these flames here these are little spirit burners but they have methyl alcohol methanol ch3oh which was for many years called wood alcohol and you know why because it was obtained from the pyrolysis of wood so that's one of the things here and the another product which I will demonstrate in a minute is ethanoic acid acetic acid the acid found in vinegar amazingly enough and another one is acetone propanone which I have here and I will show that I want you to start off though by showing you first of all that this fluid this liquid here is acidic that it turns certain natural products to certain colors and with their team in mind I'm going to use an indicator which I have prepared here now they're children this is um this here ah it is extracts of red cabbage solution and this you see there's reason why I smelt it because it smells rather nice like cabbage soup you know when I was cooking this yesterday I thought to myself what a shame it would be so nice to eat this cabbage soup but I thought no we shall show it to the children because they can demonstrate something very useful so I'm going to pour some of my my cabbage extract soup into there and what I wanted to show there it is it's gone in and I'm now going to add a tiny bit of my pyro ligneous fluid to it here there children and please notice any color change and you see it's gone bright red now no bright but it's gonna sort of red now the reason why it's done that is because inside here is in fact is acetic acid the acid which is found in vinegar ethanoic acid but I also wanted to draw your attention to a most interesting fact this cabbage indicator here was not is not my invention it's not teachers it is it is something that has been around for thousands of years and one of the greatest scientists of all time who worked in here in this laboratory here and who made the world's most fundamental inventions and gave talks here was Michael Faraday and I wanted to tell you I am very very very lucky that I have got Michael's Faraday's book called chemical manipulation now this is a book especially written for students of chemistry and this was published in 1842 and it's in beautiful condition in here you see in this book here Faraday described how to make a red cabbage indicate and that's what I wanted to tell you about it and I actually have the red I wanted you to see a little fragment I'm sure will be able to see this fragment very shortly but while we're waiting for that fragment to arrive I'm going to move on to the next sticks oh let's see these gas jars burn that's right so we've I've told you about free liquids which are found in here we've examined one property of this this is a mixture a mixture containing as you saw an oily layer and etc and I'm going to now show you ask Oscar to ignite the jars one at a time and allow me to tell you why because as the process of pyrolysis continues so start which one was first Oscar that one okay now we're not sure whether we'll be able to pull this off exactly but what I wanted to tell you was that the first gas which is produced because they come off in various sequences is carbon monoxide which burns with a blue flame we may be able to get that result depending on it may not burn at all now you see there that's fine Oscar not a problem that shows you that when you heat substances and carry on with annex one oscar whether or not Hank that's not did you see that very good Oscar now the next one please this should Bernie they're more beautiful there and you see now the flame is burning differently now that's all those pure carbon monoxide however as the pyrolysis proceeds we start to give off a different type of gas and the hydrocarbon which may burn with a slightly yellow and smoky flame please watch carefully you can see little bit of smoke now the last one should burn with a smokiest flame of all and that will be almost pure methane and there it is take that's it can you see that now that graduation there shows you that the composition of the gas mixture changes as the process thank you very much Oscar now what I thank you very much we've got some extra mats coming and very much appreciate for the for the burners are for the acetone thank you very much Oscar that's wonderful thank you so much indeed now what I wanted to show they're children you know I like to do things in slightly larger numbers and I wanted to show you a little bit about I'd like to make more carbon monoxide basically and the reason is for me just what she knows fleeting blue flames isn't quite enough so I wanted to show you a far far bigger blue frame with carbon monoxide which I'm going to produce here just allow me to put that on there Oscar could I kindly ask you to remove the gas jars and just take them off thank you so much indeed we are going to be continuously moving things around in order that you can thank you so much indeed in order that you can all see slightly better yeah if you take that and take these away at your leisure dear sir take them away at your leisure thank you so much indeed and what I wanted to show you next is how we can make whoops-a-daisy I just dropped a gas jar lid it has not broken so we're still very fortunate multitasking is the essence of today's lecture as you can see now what I'm just trying to find a nice position to put this in and I'd you know what I think I'll do it over here I'll tell you why because I want to exploit the splendid facilities that we have here and show you this experiment over here now I am going to make pure carbon monoxide for you now carbon monoxide is a colorless odorless gas the chemical formula is co and it is intensely poisonous it is the fact that it's poisonous is not the issue because many poisonous gases you can smell around and run away from them but not so with carbon monoxide carbon monoxide kills by stealth you can't see it and you can't smell it and before you know it you've lost everything so I'm going to make some carbon monoxide now by pouring concentrated sulfuric acid onto sodium formate you will notice a considerable amount of frothing and then I will do my favorite thing which is to set fire to it and I want you to observe the beautiful flame and I can reassure you that this flame is completely harmless and you'll see very shortly some frothing there it is it's beginning to froth as I add concentrated sulfuric acid we replay and there it is now that's deadly carbon monoxide coming off and here it is burning with the beautiful flame you see now that's incandescent blue flame as carbon monoxide burns it's of course makes carbon dioxide which is of course completely harmless and as long as the frothing is continuing there but you may like to know so carbon monoxide a deadly poison but in this case it's of course entirely contained in a we're burning it off to make carbon dioxide and Andrus will show you a very clever trick for making us completely harmless in just a few seconds in just a few seconds and what I wanted to tell you is that carbon monoxide although it's a way it's a colorless odorless gas and this is an it is commonly given off when things don't turn completely tiny amounts are produced when fuels burn etc but obviously they're controlled to us - let me just add a bit more sulfuric I'm sorry I I just do like this o it and it should froth up a little more you it all depends let's give it a little stir around there there we are a nice blue beautiful flame you see etc now carbon monoxide does undergo some very very interesting chemical reactions for instance when I was at school we used to learn to test for carbon monoxide you use pallidus chloride paper pallidus chloride paper was white and when you put it into carbon monoxide it went black it was essentially reduced to the metal palladium which is a hugely interesting metal about which a great deal of research is being done at the moment but another interesting thing about this gas carbon monoxide it can actually combine with certain metals so combined with directly with metals to make what are called as carbon aisles and there are two particularly well known iron and nickel carbon aisle will Rio are metals which if you so if you pass carbon monoxide over iron powder or nickel powder at a high temperature you'll get an oily liquid coming off which is intensely toxic but nevertheless it has interest these carbonyls have very interesting applications in purification of substances etc and I don't want to go into the detail but the honest truth is they give some very interesting examples of how chemical bonds exist between substances metals normally form ionic compounds with charges on their ions but in the case of the carbonyls the metal is bonded in a completely different way we don't normally see liquids which contain metals as part of them but carbon monoxide is a substance now my dear sir if I can ask you to extinguish that what he's going to do essentially is to pour water into it and as he pours water in the flame will get bigger because it displaces the water displaces the carbon monoxide and at the same time it stops the reaction from happening so by doing this we have not only stopped the reaction but we have also reduced there is no danger of any carbon monoxide being and at the same time we had a little bit of extra flame produced which was the most important now the next thing I wanted to show you see it is to turn to our liquid product I wanted to start off by telling you that this pyro ligneous distillates which we have a small quantity of here is not something which is useless people have been talking using charcoal for a very very long period of time and I'll tell you about the charcoal in just a few seconds but we're going to focus on these liquids and the people don't actually have to know the chemistry of it these charcoal making charcoal is thousands of years old making this pyro igneous this tillage is thousands of years old and you don't have to know how it works in order to use it but I am going to just tell you that one of the uses of the oily layer of this or some of the uses have been for instance in the past and still today as an antiseptic the oily layer has been used to make to make leather waterproof it is used also has been used and this is now these them Egyptians in when they used to embalm mummies they used to use this finally Guinea as tar as it's called it has amazing preserving qualities are not only that today I have here a bottle of shampoo I have a bottle of shampoo and believe it or not this is wood tar shampoo and it reeks of this stuff here and it's still used and it's still made today so this ancient technologies still have some uses today in in the modern world but back to fires and you know of course it's not surprising that the most of the experiments I'm going to show you they involve fires why well because when wood burns bonfires is the topic well obviously everything associated that comes off from the world will burn as well and this is there for now I'm moving on to the methanol is burning here that's one of the three main products then we have the acetic acid which is here which turns this the cabbage indicator red and now I'm going to show you acetone today it's called propanol it's a universally used solvent it used to be used as nail varnish remover has a smell which I like but you mustn't smell these things children I'm a now I am looking for a 50 centimeter cube measuring Celinda there ah thank you very much Andres is my friend always on now I wanted to show you how propylene burns but you know just to burn a few drops would be a completely pointless exercise I'm going to I have made a little steel trough for you here and now when it's the ether is the ether good good good Oscar you're going to get ready with some splints to show us the flashover effect which I hope we'll be able to show I'm not sure it made you know what for this experiment it may be useful to dim the lights once the flame is a light though once the frame is alight Oscar there we are and then I will pour the ether in and Oscar will then show you but let's first of all Joshua this is 50 centimeters cube of acetone otherwise known as propanone and I'm pouring it into my steel trough now I very much hope it's horizontal take your time Oscar nog we're not in a hurry at all no hurry at all I'm just checking to see that we have yes it is level now please watch carefully a flame will spread there yes take the lights down thank you this is brilliant yes now how do you see the propanone is burning but children this is nothing we're just beginning there's quite a bit of it there now this is the interesting thing also could you stand back to let some people see thank you very much now as this propanone is burning you see and it's in a metal trough that metal will get very very hot indeed obviously from the flame notice the yellow color of the flame this is what we call incomplete combustion tiny bits of sorts of produce but as the as the as the trough gets hotter and hotter so the propanone starts to boil it gets very hot indeed and therefore the flame gets bigger and bigger and that's the only reason why I do this experiment cuz I love flames so as you see the flame gets bigger and bigger and then it would eventually obviously go out now while while that is getting bigger and bigger allow me just to click on to where's my ah thank you very much it's been repaired now I'm sure you've all seen it so this is Michael Faraday's description of how to make red cabbage indicator and of what I wanted to tell you the greatest chemists in the world use this it says it is very simple and I've got some more experiments with the indicator to show you now the next slide uh you did you did see Michael Faraday by the way I wanted to tell you he photography was invented in 1822 by Nisei for hips he was a Frenchman but and it took the whole of Europe the whole world by storm photography and Faraday loved photographed it was it was state of the art side and he loved being photographed and that's a portrait of him which I particularly liked and that that's why I wanted to show it you so now that we move on video children this is a little bit of theory for you this is a little bit of theory for you and visit domain fractious this is taken from a modern textbook on the chemistry of world and it shows you the main fractions obtained from wood pyrolysis now pyrolysis is this new work which I wanted you to learn but we'll come back this is almost burnt itself out we'll come back to that in a second and you can practice and learn that all off by heart children it's not too much and I'll explain to you once you've learnt you what it is that you've actually learnt there's some fairly tricky words and there and pronunciation wise now what I wanted to show you next is a very interesting effect I'm not sure whether it will work here because there's a little bit of a draft here obvious for obvious reasons we need good ventilation here but what I wanted to show it's gonna I'm now going to pour in 10 centimeters cube of ether now ether is a stunningly volatile liquid and that is it simulates what is very similar to the product and that will vaporize little Roskilde you got your flame ready hang around let me pour it in can you see to turn to a vapor it's old now although and that's what I wanted to show you wasn't that amazing he got there before I did Oscar that was very well done so that was a flashover so now the purpose the purpose of showing you this the purpose of showing you this dear children the purpose of showing you this is really a bit of health and safety the honest truth is when you handle flammable liquids and this is present in industry everywhere you have to be phenomenally aware of the way in which they can catch fire and I'm sure you'll agree and in this controlled experiment it's perfectly OK it's like the out-of-control but nevertheless it was it was a it was they it was perfectly okay but it's very easy to have industrial accidents etc and the substance that we use on an everyday basis which which will conform with this type of behavior of course is petrol which we use in motor cars everyday unbelievably dangerous and when you handle the golden rule is whenever you handle flammable liquids make sure that all flammables are out of the way you notice here I'd removed all the bottles there is no flammable anywhere and all the flammables are illuminated and I also used a small amount so I knew I was covered and in this particular experiment now let's just return back to what you've learnt in the meantime so we have wood and the important thing is wood makes gases and there they are they don't worry about the formally too much I think water is h2o carbon dioxide is the one that we collected in here you see then that doesn't burn that's why we can isolated it methane is the Hydra car and carbon monoxide is the blue one and hydrogen which I'm going to show you at the end now that's that now that distillates and the tars they've passed put up a bunch of compounds there and I wanted to tell you that the top three are the ones I've demonstrated for you today ch3 Co H is ethanoic acid ch3 OHS methyl alcohol otherwise known as wood alcohol and the third one is acetone ch3 2 Co all the others are present in the in the oily substance now the last thing I wanted to come on is to charcoal and if can we have the next slide please can we have all sorry thank you very much silly and just in case you found that rather easy to learn here is a complete list so just in case children you think you're getting on top of the subject learn this off by heart for Monday mornings test on the products of the pyrolysis of wood and there I I tell you what I didn't I haven't memorized them I just counted them there are 60 of them quite a large list now I have actually I have actually because this is a stunning list I'm sure you all agree that is all produced and when you burn wood you're burning all of that lot at once and what I wanted to say is that I put circles around so the orange those are what we call carboxylic acids the ones in yellow are alcohols the ones in light blue are are the aldehydes dark lower the ketones and the dark blue and the light blue are the carbonyl compounds the mixed ones are phenols and the purple ones are our phenols basically derivatives from from benzene and there are their aromatics and then we have nitrogen containing compounds based on ammonia and then we have some aromatic ethers and finally some aromatic hydrocarbons so by gum what a complex mixture is it e so when you're burning wood dear children you're burning all of that look I just wanted to tell you another thing about about these aromatic compounds these are romantic combat they called aromatic white normally carbon atoms when they join together they make long chains that's a sort of simple compounds that we have that we're primarily made of it cellulose and and Hemi cellulose and all of all the other ones apart from the aromatics however carbon is also able to form a most unusual group of compounds which perplexed scientists for many many years which are based on the chemistry of benzene and they form hexagons like beehives have bees make their hexagonal wax cells they live in they this in this particular case the carbon atom forms the carbon atoms form rings of six carbon atoms and the basis for those is benzene now believe it or not another thing Michael Faraday precisely in this building in 1825 discovered benzene and that is another one of the great achievements of this remarkable man of profound humility and there and he made so many discoveries in the branches of organic chemistry in organic chemistry not to mention electromagnetism and all the rest of it and to bear in mind that he left school at the age of 13 to train as a bookbinder but more on that on another and you should also know dear children that this year we are celebrating or we are commemorating the 150th anniversary of Michael Faraday's death he died in 1867 he was born in 1891 that makes him 76 I think and etc the fact is he he was he's buried at Highgate Cemetery which is North London here and and he was so humble that on his grave it simply says Michael Faraday 1791 to 1867 quite remarkable indeed but this year is indeed the hundred and fiftieth anniversary and please remember one of the greatest scientists of all time now are we ready for the next slide yes this is a comment you say when when chemists were analyzing only substance is because the 19th century was a time when analytical techniques developed and separation techniques the separation technique of fractional distillation developed and the analytical techniques of chemical analysis gravimetric analysis developed ideas axioms atomic weights friedrich vola who was one of the great chemists working with uselessly big in the early post sort of 1st 3rd and 19th century when he discovered all these chemicals and started analyzing and making these lists he said he said to me that organic chemistry appears to me like a primeval forest of the tropics full of the most mark there are most remarkable things and those most remarkable things dear children are all these compounds that huge lists over there now let's see what the next slide says ah and there it is there children I have especially for you prepared this little thing on the left we have the chemical the chemicals the types of chemical that you find in wood and cellulose as I've said made up of long chains of sugars and hemi cellulose are sure to change with a variety of sugars and lignin is the one which is gives rise to the oily the aromatic compounds now how do those chemicals arise where does this happen in the wood what is would from a biological point of view well would is basically dead xylem the bulk of the wood itself is dead inside this wood is dead in the thing the only part of the wood when a tree is growing the only part of a tree that's alive is the outside part of the tree which is the bark and the layers under it and below the bark you have the phloem which is part of the wood which carries liquids which are made of which are basically water containing sugars and things which come from the leaves you see the water dear children a tree when it grows and exchanges or takes in and throws out chemicals through the top and through the bottom through the bottom it has the roots which take up water and nutrients from the soil and those flow up the tree through what is called the exilim whereas the leaves where they are green etc and they by the process of photosynthesis they convert water and carbon dioxide which are in the atmosphere very simple substances indeed and by complex processes they convert them into sugars and then into larger molecules such as starches cellulose --is and so for but cellulose specifically is the main thing in would you say what is that thing and the the bit the there is a thin layer in between the phloem and the xylem and that's called the cambium the cambium is the part where these types of to temperate types of transporters or liquid are actually generated and where they grow and this is all just under the bar inside the bulk of the tree is dead by the way the word xylem is actually derived from a Greek word meaning obviously wood and that the word phloem is derived from the Greek word meaning bark so do we have these words for various languages now that you see I just wanted to tell you I had a very interesting experience this summer specifically on July the 26th there was a very very heavy rainstorm in our back garden and a plum tree which I had which was beginning to have lots of plums unfortunately split in half the stem split in half you see and it is and I was very very disappointed I floated up and I said to myself is it possible to repair it because we're going to lose all our plums that this year etc so what I did was I tied the two halves in the next strip here I tied the two halves together and this is the reason I wanted to show you is because when the true halves they won't grow together by the way they won't grow together but by tying them together you're giving it mechanical strength so that the two halves continue to absorb from fro through the phloem and xylem all the nutrients which they produce within all and they can grow independently even though they're joined together and would you have losing out in between this is the important bit it's that SAP which is coming out now it's from that SAP on the maple tree that we can make maple syrup now that SAP is what's from it comes from the phloem and it contains the sugars which have been formed ultimately from the leaves at the top and the that SAP and I have the next slide to show you and please watch carefully on that south prob drop we had an amazing plum crop thanks to the fact that I got the tree but on the right hand side can you see that little snail it's having its lunch it's eating the sap from the plum tree you see and that's a very very remarkable thing because you see that sugary SAP is food for others not only human beings but I was very very lucky to be able to capture that image now the next word please is pyrolysis and this I'm going to leave up because this is if there's one if you're not very clever children don't worry if you're not and if you haven't learned all those lists off by heart one word pyrolysis pyrolysis these derive from two ancient Greek words meaning fire and breaking down so that's one word please remember and now I'm going to come on to the final product of the combustion of wood which is of course charcoal which is left at the end and oscar has already shown you how charcoal burns and is an almost pure form of the element carbon it is the short which is produced when salty flames burn and furthermore it is if this carbon is the source of an a remarkable number of uses throughout their history of the human race and I just wanted to show thank you very much and also we can get rid of the aeroplanes dear sir that would be much appreciated and I just wanted to show you a few things about charcoal now charcoal is an impure we finish with that thank you very much for turning up gentlemen charcoal is an impure form of the element carbon charcoals they vary the proportion of carbon in charcoal can be anything from 90 to 99 percent but no matter how long you roast that wood for pyrolyze it for you will never make 100% pure charcoal the thing about charcoal it has a very very porous structure and that gives it a large number of uses but before I talk about charcoal in different forms of carbon I wanted to say that there are two crisps there are two allotropes or forms of charcoal the element carbon the element carbon which are not called charcoal but which are here and one of them is here and that is a piece of graphite that's a crystalline form here and I have here a two other one other form and you see here these are pure diamonds it was a source of great of great challenge for scientists to understand and I'm going to see if you can make and integers I hope you can see these are real diamonds made out of pure carbon they are very very valuable they're rather small I'm afraid but I very much hope you can see them glittering because it's that property of carbon of diamonds which makes them so very very special they have a remarkable refractive index that makes them useful as precious stones now do you know what for many many years scientists could not believe that this and this are made of exactly the same atoms carbon atoms which are found in charcoal now would you believe would you believe that it experiments were conducted by scientists initially in Florence in Italy but even Michael Faraday when he went on a tour of Europe with Humphrey Davy between 1830 and 1850 in Florence and because they were still down T they said how can this be the same as this the most precious stone in the universe and they did it by burning by burning and if you burn some graphite and if you burn diamond a very expensive experiment indeed then equal masses of graphite and diamond burn to give the same mass of carbon dioxide is the only product now Faraday actually destroyed that burning process because they showed it to him in Florence and he described the brilliant crimson flame that diamond made now charcoal of course is also useful for drawing as a drawing thing so I'm just going to use a piece of charcoal just to draw my experiment number one and it and it has been this is not art this is science and I'm just going to show how we can represent the flask which I did the distillation in the retort flask like this you see and using a piece of charcoal the teacher you see can then illustrate this to the students and we have a ground glass stopper like this and then we can put the stopper in like that and then we have our drops of distillate coming off here you see and the week this is our pyro ligneous distillate my word it's been a lesson in many new words today and I hope very much hope there it is and here we have for instance the flame which is roasting it here we have the bits of wood and the charcoal like that here and then we put a nice label on it like this retort flask here and we have a nice arrow pointing to it a Wella and then we can even color it in you see I do love colors and then we can just shade in with a little bit of blue to show the blue cone of unburned gas here then a little bit of purple there you see and then we can shade in the earth the smoke which was coming off which was a head of sort of a dark thank you very much dear undress and then we have a colored the dark color here that was the color of the thing and so forth and you see I am very quickly making for you a very simple sketch of an experiment which I have done but using one of the products of one of the experiments and that is something you see there while we can have our pyro igneous liquid there with the oily droplets of the of the the Atari residue that thank you very much I'm not going to sign it that would be very silly but please take it away dear sir sir so there we are another use of charcoal now of course do you know what charcoal is also available in shops is activated charcoal you can buy the chemist buys it an activated charcoal this is used for a tooth whitening powder you see and you brush your teeth with it and it apparently makes them white but I thought they were white in any case but it doesn't matter people buy all sorts of things with the hope of improving themselves and I just wanted to show you that we have here some activator at charcoal is used in water purification has a huge internal surface area and it has the remarkable property of being able to adhere to molecules and inform loose ponds now as I pour my this is activated charcoal which is heat has been each of a very high temperature to Al's gases I'm pouring my cabbage solution and hopefully it will come through with no color at all so this is now using activated charcoal to decolorize cabbage leaf now it may take a little while to come through it may take a little while to come through because it has to absorb itself onto the thing and my dear and this I'm going to ask you to bring on the Gunpowder box now you see I'm wanted to show you my personal favorite application of char char core which is of course to make gunpowder and I hope you're not too surprised by that gunpowder of course was invented was discovered or we know the Chinese were the first people to use gunpowder and I'm going to show you today a little bit a very quick experiment now under s if you put that that's brilliant on the floor I am going to very quickly instruct you now you see it's coming through absolutely colorless this is a wonderful demonstration this is a wonderful demonstration a gain of charcoal in action it has taken out and the reason is that all the dyes in the cabbage in a natural cabbage and also the smells have been absorbed by the way the chemical world weaves is adsorption that means that the molecules in here the tiny particles of cabbage and a smell they are they have been completely absorbed onto the carbon by forming loose molecular links you see inter molecular forces are strong and they have remained on the charcoal which is a remarkable indeed now here Andres I'm going to start off now that we start off by showing the free please now please excuse me for turning my back we have had a not very much time but here we are the gunpowder was discovered by Chinese over a thousand years ago thousand some people debate how did they discover it that is a remarkable remarkable story in itself which I don't want to go into these but the honest truth is by intuition at the end of the day we humans are terribly intelligent doesn't matter when we live or what we did but we can work out lots of things for ourselves and intuition is one of the way in which science has proceeded over the ages I am slowly moving this stuff out simply because I want my dear under this would it be possible at you to take this away I've decided to change my policy on this thank you so much indeed and simply because there we can have more space Oscar could you kindly take this this bowl away that will be most kind indeed thank you very much we're creating more space and I still have plenty to show actually we're not that ready but enough now the three ingredients of gunpowder are charcoal which is in here which are potassium nitrate or lighter here and sulfur which is there and what I wanted to tell you is that and what I wanted to tell you is that you can use charcoal the how did the Chinese discover it what is it sulfur that I wanted to tell you is a naturally occurring mineral occurs in many parts of the world and especially volcanic regions but deep underground as well huge amounts of sulfur extracted by mining by some we call it the fresh process but there are other techniques as well we get out of the gun it comes out as the pure element sulfur quite remarkable you cannot break self into simpler substances it is simply an element charcoal mainly mainly carbon as I told you and produced when bonfires burn as we've just seen earlier today but potassium nitrates the clever one and what happens is its form naturally in certain soils the Chinese would undoubtedly have observed this the fact that they're things all and here we have this is thank you so much I have especially prepared for you dear children this is a collection these are potassium nitrate crystals and I have grown them for you in this speaker they are very beautiful indeed and you are most welcome to come and look at them and the honest truth is in many hot countries such as in India and in Southeast Asia these crystals grow naturally out of farmyard soils and where they grew and where there were embers of fires burning those fires burns much more brightly and those are now what I'm going to show you is what the Chinese learn they learn some examples of these gunpowder in action now as we going for it I wanted to tell you first of all that the gunpowder mixture which the Chinese invented and we're looking at let's say a thousand years ago contains 75% by mass of potassium nitrate fifteen percent by mass of carbon charcoal and ten percent by mass of sulphur and that was those ratios which sound like beautifully elegant numbers were established purely by empirical means there was no chemistry you can't write a chemical equation today chemists have not bettered the composition of that the ancient Chinese had learnt and as I repeat this is pure through sheer intelligent and intuition now here I have a mixture of those three which is just to show you how it burns if you do this as an experiment at home or at schools and it is not particularly dangerous you'll be very disappointed with the outcome because this is how a mixture of these three powders burns on its own and I have to warn you this is not spectacular it will happen don't worry there he goes how are the Gunpowder going bank isn't it's not going to make you it's not going to make you jump out of your seats is it now please observe carefully please observe carefully can you see these little blotches here that was very slow burning these little blotches that's basically unused potassium nitrate the bits of black onions child they're simply the mixture isn't good enough to end to enable a rapid combustion however what the Chinese then understood they they then using the technology of a flower flower Mills etc they thought wouldn't it be good if we made them powder them into a much much finer powder and then when they made a much much finer powder they ended up with something like this now this is by the way they called it serpentine powder this is coarse serpentine powder and this here is milled serpentine powder this has been ground this has been milled in a ball mill with red balls crushing it up make it into a very very fine powder indeed for several hours for eight hours now watch how this burns it's quite a bit different it's faster and secondly can you see that there are no residues of yellow now not only that they venues bread making technology in other words dough mixing with water etc and are and baking it but not in the case of this they took the milk powder they then added to its small amounts of water and alcohol and then they and they put it through a sieve and they allowed it to dry and they ended up with something like this now this is what we called corned powder now this burns quite a bit more dramatically still so please watch carefully because this will hopefully be quite a bit faster I'm just going to wait it takes a little while sometimes I may have to be daring and shove it ah ha oh just look at that now that wood no no no you know please I know look at that beautiful smoke ring that we've got wonderful one now that you see now that you say can that make something go bang oh yes it could because this is this is definitely gunpowder and that you see the result of human ingenuity that doesn't require a great deal of theory and we not have improved now when the Chinese made this they said brilliant let's now let's now use this for some purposes thank you very much and I'm going to show you very quickly how to make a simple pyrotechnic device using that Nadia Andrea I just wanted to undress I'm going to very quickly wipe down the bench so please excuse me I'll just quickly wipe it down we must have dry circumstances thank you very much indeed thank you very much indeed this is wonderful and I'm just going to quickly make for you a Chinese firecracker a chai now we have two sheets of a4 paper for this now I need my tape and the scissors brilliant thank you very much indeed and the way we do this is well we roll up first of all we have to make and you know the Chinese they always interpret it or lots of things they set up in terms of dragons and things and they call this gunpowder the fire dragon horses you know so things along they're very imaginative and that in the course of human culture we people are very we like having a picturesque ideas or analogies thank you that's men now excuse me if we cut this off if we cut this off here under this okay we cut this off I will now operate up there and I will now wrap this taper up now what we're going to do now we're going to now wrap this up like this and intimated that you I'll tell you forgive me the roll just give me the roll let me wrap it up from the roll because it's easy cut you just cut that off there just cut that off there thank you so much and the way we do it is this it gives you a and what we're doing we're strengthening it you see we're now making a prison for the fire dragon that's you know sort of way you can look at it in a picturesque manner and we're making it stronger simply by wrapping this around here and there we are like that and now we trim it off with a pair of scissors thank you so much take care not to let the tape go there thank you so much indeed now what are we doing now we now have a tube no one will deny that we have a tube and now what I'm going to do is to seal the tube off again because we are going to put some gunpowder in obviously awesome black power the way we do that we touch off the end like that and then we Bend the end like this and then we put more tape on so now thank you very much indeed we wrapped more tape around it like this and basically the more tape your wrap the most the stronger it is now there will be the noise when the fire dragon escapes so we have this again thank you very much the androids now what I'm going to do I'm now going to put in some of my powder some of my powder which I have here and for this purpose I have I've got a small jar which is probably labeled black powder and a small spatula at the end Ernest a small spatula and a small jar they labeled would be probably be labeled black powder fast or something along those lines is that the one yes sorry I have these I have smaller containers at beer children and have you got a small spatula with a small end on you may not have a that's the one a whole handful every tool that mine thank you so much Andy now we put approximately five or six spatula measures in here I'll do it carefully so you can all see what time day one then two three four five I say and one for lap seven there we are it will have more than air yes yes so there we are so here we go now then down there and now what we now do we use our ramrod here to test to see whether it's all gone and to ram it down so we can now test to see it's now to approximately there what we now do is we cut the end off here we cut the end off here and then we put a fuse in we put a fuse in with which we are going to set free our fire dragon inside thank you this in here and thank you very much under this we now put it like that so that's now going inside there and then we bend it over we bend it over like this to make a solid to make an absolutely closed okay enclosed cage so if you excuse me I'm bending it over and now going to put lots of tape on it to give it to make it very very strong to bind it and inside like this so there we are I'm just binding it up now can I have my Bangor cage please my dear boy thank you very much now at this stage at this stage we are now ready to go and I wanted to tell you what this you see I'm going to set this on fire now if I were to put it on my hand you see like that you will all agree that wouldn't be a very bright man okay because the reason is it might make a loud bang it might rip a hole in my hand so what we do is we're going to it's called a firecracker I like to call it a fire dragon which there to be released we put it in a cage this is this is what I call a Bangor cage or a firecracker cage and it's to protect to protect me obviously from the effects of this and this is steel so there's no way now there is a shelf in there which you can see and there are two ends which have got holes in them and that is to allow the any product to come off now do we have some safety goggles and I'll ask Oscar to do the ignition and thank you very much and eat and rest Oscar safety thank you very much easy there is there is no real now the firing range are we have another pair of safety goggles down under this we have another pair let's all wear safety god now the firing range is here too there okay because the only way can escape is from there to this Oscar I will ask you to light a fuse and I will then put the end on okay so there's the fuse if you can light a fuse I'll put the arrow and I'll hold this this doesn't always work when you make make a little bit of bang a little bit of a spark okay so that's please let's have the fuse on now move away I'll step and out of range services shortly hopefully our fire dragon will be released on this stage blast wave through the thing I'm sorry about that now Oscar some rubbish here that's rubbish right now we have now come to the end of the topic which is concerned with the products of the pyrolysis of wood and so when you're burning wood you burn all these products but I now want to say what happens when you burn the wood burning is one thing pyrolysis is that pyrolysis gives you all these products here but what actually are the final products when wood is burnt when you burnt the charcoal when you've burnt all your pyro ligneous food when you've burnt your hydrogen your methane and your carbon monoxide the answer is this there are two main products and they escape into the air they are called carbon dioxide and water vapor from all that huge mixture carbon dioxide and water vapor are produced when wood burns and what is most interesting those are the two ingredients from which wood was made in the first place which is quite remarkable this is the cycle of nature now I wanted to focus on the one product solid product which let's left behind I've told you that carbon dioxide and water vapor are the two main products which go into there but left behind we have a product which I have here which no one ever draws any attention to but here it is it is simply wood ash it is the ash which is produced from the burning of the wood and believe it or not this too has had a huge role in the history of mankind no we humans we don't waste anything at all in any process dear Andres could I ask you to do me a favor and take away our beautiful flask here which has become full thank you so much just with of tripod with everything thank you watch out it that's it I will just mop down I will just mop down the tiny spillage and then I wanted to show you something about the properties of wood ash and I'm going to start off by pouring my cabbage juice through the wood ash so I'm going to put two tips um I'm going to if you don't mind move this into the center phase now into the center thank you very much Oscar that's much appreciated now I'm going to now move these three flasks on the beautiful sheets of white paper into center stage the reason is I wanted to show you now what is in here you see the cabbage water has been totally depolarized by our activated charcoal I'm now going to take this is ash from a wood fire in my back garden and I have I put it through a sieve just the kitchen you know a kitchen strainer a tea strainer big tea strainer or a metal sieve just to get rid of some of the larger bits there is my wood ash going on and let's see what wood ash is actually made of this is a very interesting thing because there are many very useful substances this is what we call the in combustible part of what the part of the wood that doesn't burn it's the bit that gets left behind at the end now if I now pour through this my cabbage juice please watch what happens I'm going to very very gently pour the cabbage on and you'll notice there's a lick a bit of dust going up etc and very shortly the cabbage will start coming through and as the cabbage starts coming through you will notice hopefully a very very significant change in color it takes a little while to come through what I wanted to tell you is it's going to come through let's just wait it's almost there because this has played a most important role in the history and I'll tell you what this ash has been used in soap making thousands of years ago even in ancient Egypt people were already in ancient he we're already aware of the most important ingredients that can be used in this in this wood ash to make soap and for that reason the liquid which you can see coming through now dear children has a different color it is coming through yellow and the reason why it comes through yellow is because in this ash which I have there are two very important compounds containing two different metals and one of them is called potassium carbonate and the potassium carbonate and causes the water to be alkaline by process called alkali hydrolysis please don't worry if you don't understand but seeing is believing and you will all agree that this is not red and it's not colorless it's coming through yellow and the reason why it's coming through yellow is because the wood ash is reacting with the water to release potassium carbonate into solution which is soluble in water and to make that potassium carbonate into a solution and when potassium carbonate dissolves it undergoes the process of alkaline hydrolysis making an alkaline result which is the yellow color that you see there and this was used as ly ly E for soap making boiling up a concentrated solution of potassium carbonate with natural oils with plant oils vegetable oils etc used to use beautiful soaps and perfumes soaps were available have been available by humans for thousands upon thousands of years now let's do another experiments now let's do another experiment to see what else is present and what I'm going to do I have some I have got some wood ash I'm putting ash inside here and I'm going to add to it a few drops of hydrochloric acid now please watch carefully I'm going to put some lime water which is a saturated solution of calcium hydroxide now for your information children this is very commonly used for testing for carbon dioxide it's a standard chemical test but I very much hope I can show you this working because it does show what it does show is that thank you very much now I'm gonna see if you can if you can put the acid in give it a generous squirt I will show that you little froth mmm nice and easy there's no hurry now can you see it frothing dear children can you see it frothing now it's frothing because it's giving off the gas which we call carbon dioxide please watch carefully as my lime water as it bubbles it starts to turn milky and the reason why it's turning milky because wood ash is in fact primarily a mixture of calcium carbonate and potassium carbonate and why is that well because wood requires the two minerals metals potassium and calcium for its well-being it enables the gases it enables the wood to function the its sensitivity to light and heat is increased etc now dig those two metals which are present in wood I wanted actually to tell you a little bit about them the reason is they were both discovered yet again in this building but not by Michael Faraday by Michael Faraday's mentor who was Humphrey Davy Humphrey Davy was an extraordinarily flamboyant character he was he used to give amazing lectures in fact the reason why Albemarle Street became the first one-way street in London because because Humphrey Davy was so amazingly popular people used to fly he was an amazing character this by the way is just to show that topic that we're on I hope you've seen it's not too difficult to understand carbon dioxide as a gas water as a liquid and ash as a solid there that's a Humphrey Davy he was one of the first directors of the Royal Institution here and he made remarkable discoveries precisely in these rooms he was first who discovered the potassium in 1807 by electrolysis and calcium in 1808 by electrolysis and we are going to demonstrate each of these metals to you reacting with water whoops-a-daisy I'm not sure that's so that's a that's Humphrey Davy there that's him that's a caricature he was such a character he used to do experiments with gases and gases were that time very fashionable andthat's Humphrey Davy holding a bellows there etc that's this is a very well-known cartoon published in 1801 that's for our next topic now we are now going to therefore to a demonstrate show them now for this demonstration I'm going to ask for the lights to be turned off please the or not off or reduce um Andrus is now going to add some piece a few pieces of potassium to the few pieces of potassium to the to the water there's water in there a few prett now this reaction only lasts about five seconds so it's a very short reaction indeed and if we could turn off the lights please this will be very useful because you will see a beautiful lilac flame in there for a short while this precise experiment used to be demonstrated by Michael Faraday here in the 1840s with potassium which was then a newly discovered metal please sir and that's potassium reacting with water there you saw a little bit of a lilac flame it catches fire by gum it's dangerous and it's flatus now if we if we come back to that in a second I will now show you calcium reacting with water and let's do that over here we can do that actually let's do it over there so you that may that I will now show you calcium now can't you reacts with water but it is much less dangerous and what we're going to do here we're going to pour in some pieces of calcium and I'm going to show you what's going to happen here goes out this is water and this is calcium pour in a few lumps and it starts to fizz very short they will start to fizz and it gives off the gas which is called hydrogen in very very large amounts and there it is and we can sit fire and as you see if we can have the lights down you see a beautiful brick red flame and that brick red flame is being caused by hydrogen which is generated from calcium as it reacts with the water and you can have no doubt about that was a very large amount of hydrogen coming off now the next thing I wanted to tell you this will continue to fizz is that in each of these cases can you see the product of the reaction here is a clear liquid it's simply water and it's got no it's a it's colorless it has no color whereas here the calcium has made a milky liquid now that milkiness is caused by calcium hydroxide which is not soluble in water potassium is an alkali metal fully soluble but calcium calcium hydroxide is an alkaline earth element and count'em is an outline of and on each occasion we have a solution which is strongly alkaline so as I pour this in here the cabbage juice should go a yellow color and we swirl it around hopefully it'll go yes it's going it's not fully yellow not enough potassium this one should go much more yellow and we just pull the whole lot in and you can see there so once again the alkalinity now our mixed experiment is with the that this is your speciality this is the yellow pal day it doesn't matter yellow powder yellow powder yellow powder now this by the way this is a very unusual experiment this is which I call the flying spoon expect now I do have to warn you the banging this is very very substantial and what we have in here is not gun powder is not gun powder which contains a mixture of potassium nitrate charcoal and sulfur but is in fact potassium carbonate potassium carbonate etc and and and what wiII happen is we have two spoons here what we have is one spoon here and one spoon there now while that is happening we're going to lead us on to the next topic because this makes a very loud bang and this is not gunpowder buts yellow pal the Gunpowder is called black ties here this is going to make a very loud bang and a spoons will go shooting up into the air and that leads us into the next topic which is bangs I'm continuing because I'm rushing on to finish now we now have Theophrastus bombast the celery ollas bombast as von Hohenheim was the first person who had a theory about allow this bangs that we ever heard which were gun power which were thunder thunder and lightning used to terrify people now this is going to be very very loud bangs indeed and the spoons will go fly so please be careful now the fact is that he put forward the theory that thunder was caused by aerial gunpowder and we have gunpowder before but in the air that turned out now this please continue because when they melt the bang is very loud indeed it's going to be in ear rendering deafening and it's an unbelievable react when they melt that'll be ready to go I'll carry on talking that his theory of aerial his theory of an aerial gunpowder because he thought it was gunpowder exploding in the skies gave rise to the Polish alchemists theory of an aerial miter he thought it was nighter that had something about it in the air which made things burn better and breathe better he published his theory in 1604 it was the most widely read Theory alchemical theory for over two hundred for two hundred years nearly fifty six editions in six languages was published and centavo uses work and that's a sort of stuff he wrote just a couple of quotes xavier has created by the earth and we're ready to go are we police cover your ears this will be a very very loud bang I'm continuing to talk as I'm too terrified to do anything less now father is in the air a secret food of life which in the night we called you and by the day real fire was an ism could you feels better than the whole of it is the water around you out of which nothing's the saltpeter of the philosophers by which all things are grow that's one and there's our flying spoon and the second one about to go now and second one about to go now it's a saltpeter which is making these explosions now they're children although Paracelsus incentive Ogas eventually led to the discovery of oxygen we now know that thunder and lightning are actually caused by electric by discharge of static electricity I have here a Wimshurst machine which I show so there it is and I'm sure you'll agree now I'm going to quickly twiddle the knobs here took the them now as you see can you watch this is what makes thunder it is an electric spark going off like this an electric spark going off like this and that electric spark is the spark which causes a huge expansion of the air and which causes of a very loud bang which with here it's a tiny crack in lightning huge 20,000 degrees centigrade 43,000 and thunderstorms daily on this planet a huge huge number I am now going to show you very quickly we'll just cut things off to the end so that's what causes the thumb and during this the during this we have these chemical reactions taking place which give rise to nitrogen dying around we're going to do just this that's sorry that's the next one there that's that we're going backwards so wrong way sorry silly Sheila I'm pointing ah those are the two chemical reactions that occur when lightning strikes now nitrogen dioxide gas and ozone are produced in the atmosphere now I have an experiment here which doesn't take very long but it's extremely beautiful in this experiment we generate nitrogen dioxide in tiny quantities and it's in large amount sorry huger I've got copper in here I've got water containing sodium hydroxide and phenolphthalein and ammonia in the last I'm going to pour now watch dear children because when there are thunderstorms this gas is produced you don't see it as a dark-brown gas you see it you never see because it's very dilute but this gas is acidic and this gas will make this purple so this so this is produced during on this nitrogen dioxide this is acidic turns phenolphthalein cow this in turn is reacting with ammonia which makes that color now while we're doing that will now set up the last experiment so we're coming on to the all I wanted to do hydrogen hydrogen is that the this is the last expect carrier watching is there a remarkable sequence of reactions in copper makes copper nitrate there's nitrogen dioxide here this is acidic and NASCAR ammonia very shortly that will start cooling down and these two waters will get sucked back into there and you'll be see a spectacular range of colors develop in this copper nitrate there which Alex which I won't bother explaining but it's great fun now what I'm going to do and I invite you because the colors are really very very beautiful dear children hydrogen is present hydrogen the lightest gas in the universe is present in one of them one of the products of when wood burns and so it's appropriate to show you how hydrogen burns and in air where nitrogen burns in air it simply makes an orange it's nothing it is nothing that loud this is not at all a cover you're in sales that's it it's a beautiful orange flame this is pure hydrogen burning it's not worth talking about that that's it now this here by contrast by contrast their children this year by the way we're watching is children watch carefully we're now sucking back we're cooling down this is now sucking ammonia through tea which is outlined phenolphthalein goes pink again this now gets up watch carefully this nitrogen dioxide dissolves with great rapidity in the water and so this is sucked from there to there this one gets sucked from there to there and watch the beautiful sequence of colors which you'll see that now well that sequence this going there I'm now going to set fire to the balloon I'm now going to set fire now chosen this is what pil\u00e2tre de rozier the French scientists used to call re opponent their thunder air this makes were very loud by it's a mixture so close your ear we go so that's image now final experiment now is the trough we now have the final experiment here children watch these colors develop during this final experiment during this final experiment we shall be creating real thunder and lightning in here and I'm going to ask you couldn't we have the truck Oscar leave that watch these colors they're very beautiful we'll have a butcher's at them afterwards I'm now going to create for you real thunder and lightning here and at the end of this thunder and lightning experiment children I'm going to ask you to be completely silent and I'll tell you why this is not that terrifying by the way actually it is but who do we pretend here you're all scientists here by now I've won you over so you're not afraid of anything now what we're going to do can we take the distillation away there Oscar and get me the if you can now get me the the the the the guncotton here we are I'm going to I have two balloons here I'm going to wear this by the way this is my special safety mask I told you why this is in case we have a flasher not a flash over but a flash powder now what we're going to do here can you see how beautiful these colors are you're going to have three layers there now that needs to be much lower the blue needs to be sitting right on there we'll do that in a second we'll just do that in a second now what we're going to do here children and this is the very last experiment of the day you just keep taking away Oscar could you please keep tidying things away very last and I'm going to put this slide the last slide is here now this is today summary this is what you've learnt today is that when wood burns there are two separate processes pyrolysis and combustion combustion is oxidation pyrolysis as thermal degradation please remember that the only thing you have to remember now we're going to have to put these balloons down in a minute and we need to China I tell you what under this if you can that's it just make them lower that's fine that'll do these are balloons filled with a mixture of hydrogen they're going to be the thunder I'm lying here a rapidly burning fuse which is known what's up at the diversity ah too bad we'll just have one it does happened to the new you see even in the hurry even the best scientists don't worry children will have one it'll be perfectly good the one is better than none now listen carefully now listen carefully listen carefully children one is fine that will make a little bang that will make a pretty loud bang it's not that loud but it's not the end of the world now what I'm going to do here what I'm going to do here can we take away the the guncotton now can we take away the box with the gun cotton I'm going to quickly make up too few spell to flash powders here and what's going to happen I'm going to set off my we're back to our campfire that we had at the beginning the campfire at that begins you remember I poured some liquid onto a powder I'm going to do the same here today that liquid which should be the powder which uses potassium permanganate and that's what my secret with my Scout success was and the liquid we use is going to be glycerine and that's what you put on that starts burning and once this has gone off there will be a loud bang and two flashes I would ask you all to be completely silent and I'll tell you why because we're now going to return to the sociology of our campfire we're going to return and we are going to hear the traditional melody the traditional melody that is played at the end of all campfires where many people gather together and you I'll ask you to listen carefully and after that I will be very very happy to take any questions so this is the final experiment after this please remain completely silent it's not going to be that dramatic because one of our balloons has now floated up to the ceiling I'm making up here by the way and I'm having to have them to take great care here I'm making a flash powder which basically enables the makes it look as if there is a real light thing it's like a real lightning it's a high intensity it's magnesia mixed with potassium chlorate it's a high intensity ultraviolet light of the same type that's given out by real lightning the obviously the amounts this will make a flash go up into the sky there will be one flash here and there will be another flash so this is going to be Thunder this is a lightning flash and this Hill here will be another lightning flash oh let's hope it works you know this is all a bit of a thing I think we'll just sprinkle this liberally everywhere damn it I can't waste chemical now then this goes into the bin there now so dear children please what listen carefully the flashes are really very bright indeed so you shouldn't be looking at them directly the bang you've already heard once so this is not going to be any louder but it will be about so that we are both um please look at this beautifully please look at this beautifully I'm sorry Android can I just interrupt a second the bang will be a lot louder this is a hydrogen option blue so it is essential that you have your ears covered with your hands not your fingers where Andrew does it okay thank you very much children I hope you're all ready thank you very much now listen carefully I'm going to pour on I'm going to actually take me goggles off because this isn't dangerous actually the earlier one was dangerous this isn't I'm going to pour this on and it will take approximately a minute now the important thing is please remember complete silence once this has finished that's the important it will burn there will be a couple of flashes hopefully a bang and I've got my fingers as well because I want you all to feel that we're safe there like this like me like this so here we are hopefully it'll and then complete silence when you'll hear the final tune of the day the fire is burning and going and we're waiting for the final tune of the day [Music] thank you very much for your attention I wish you all a very very good evening thank you very very much indeed can I call Andres Andres to the floor thank you very much under this light lifting off static musicians musicians we'll have the musicians please thank you very very much indeed thank you very very much indeed musicians people thank you in a very very good evening to all thank you so much", "LfuJz_uG3O4": "so hi everybody Anissa here again with mobile clean or still on that job site that I showed you the wood cream that I was doing yesterday with him here I want to show you something this fire was so bad I know I've actually never seen such go into areas this deeply this house was so closed up and tight that the pressure inside from the fire must have been incredible it actually only burned one very small wall of sheetrock we have very little structural damage but it is black as you can see on the top of this microwave the microwave was adjacent to the source room but I mean it got really really black right I want to show you something I've never ever seen before I wanted to see if the microwave inside was alright I open it up look at that can you see that on the camera sit black inside the microwave look at that I've never seen that and this microwave was shut when the fire went on I mean just come inside I actually want to show you it's really sad the person who was running this home had no renters in so I have just thrown away an entire kitchen full of food I'll bet I had to destroy five hundred dollars with a food look at the look at the top of the canned goods can you get a good picture of that I mean they're just it's awful and I didn't feel safe with any of this food and she had no insurance so she's just gonna lose all of this burger young son live here and it's really sad so any of you who are renters possibly watching this or know something we have renter's insurance it's very inexpensive they can get a twenty thirty thousand dollar policy for ten fifteen bucks a month and at least gives you something to start over again there I mean even the silverware but look at the drawers this is the inside of the kitchen drawers and they were all shut I mean it's just crazy where this smoke went it was very very powerful fire all of the plastic items in the house were destroyed I just just am not safe with it being being this storm of fire so anyway I just wanted to show you that this is definitely on a scale of one to ten for worst fires that I've seen this has got to be at nine men in the house the good part is is that you know there is going to be an ice cream bottle on the inside of the house pretty much be gutted out on the inside little structure playing all the cabinetry is ruined because the smoke and soot got pushed all the way back behind it so anyway yeah I just said though guys make sure you about good insurance coverage for your contents as well as the structure it basics can be very devastating so I need to hear a recording field and I'll do some more videos before we do that we here hope you guys know what your policy say sure you're covering these things like this happen to everybody", "ag_sV7wLSgY": "hey guys what's up I know that everybody out there has the video of the snow turning black when you put a lighter to it I'm going to tell you why that is and how it works as you can see this snow is not turning black it's just melting now watch this same snow compacted into a bit of a little snowball now watch the snow turn black see it's turning black and it's not melting what's happening here is simple common sense the black is from the impurities of the fuel that is being used the butane in the lighter the reason it's not melting is because it's hardening and turning into ices it freezes because it's so cold black ice same snow from here just melts thank you", "NERwRanxWXQ": "Hey, guys. Welcome back to the King of Random. Today, we're going to be trying an experiment I've seen some people do before, but haven't seen very well explained. We're going to try to be making what's called \"fire snakes\", a combination of burning sugar and baking soda in a base of sand. We're gonna try a few different combinations of regular sugar, powdered sugar, baking soda, and two different types of accelerant to see what gives us the very best results. We've got a giant bag of sand and some metal trays to burn our sugar in, so let's get started. Now, all of my research Indicates that it should be four parts of sugar to one part baking soda by weight. So, that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna try three things. We're gonna have our regular sugar mixed with our baking soda. We're going to have our powdered sugar mixed with our baking soda. And then we're also going to try mixing some of our regular sugar with the baking soda and then blending it up so we have an even finer powder. We'll see how that does in comparison. We'll take all three of those mixtures and try burning each of them with alcohol and lighter fluid and see which of our six combinations gives us the best results. White powders everywhere... 20 grams of regular sugar. Add 5 grams of baking soda. And except another one of the same thing which I'll blend in just a minute One thing that might cause a different result with the powdered sugar is most powdered sugar Actually, also has some cornstarch in it to help keep it from taking together too much Grams or bacon Now let's get a little blender and blend up one of the mixtures of regular sugar and baking soda Yes unsurprisingly that now kind of looks like powdered sugar All right, we've got our three different trays for our three different mixtures. Let's build these up with sand My first fuel is 91% concentration of isopropyl alcohol also known as rubbing alcohol My other one is a common barbecue lighter fluid I'm going to pour some of each fluid on one side of the sand and then we'll put little piles of each kind of sugar on that so overall we'll have 6 different combinations of sugar and fuel going at once So here we've got Granulated sugar and alcohol is the fuel here? We've got granulated sugar and lighter fluid as a fuel blend and sugar with alcohol when it's your lighter fluid powdered sugar alcohol powdered sugar lightest A little harder time getting the lighter fluid delight than the alcohol, so that's one point for alcohol That when it lit well Here we go So let's take a little bit of a look at what is happening here as the sugar burns it bubbles and boils and turns black and turns into just basically carbon some of the gas is being led off by the Baking soda are actually filling the molten sugar as its creative It doesn't just turn into a puddle of black sugar it turns into a sort of expanded foam of black sugar Well here we go here's the results of our test the powdered sugar definitely started making the fire snakes the fastest they took off pretty quickly the powdered sugar with the lighter fluid never got very far We only got this one little weird stumpy thing which still looks pretty cool But it's not very big you can see most of the sugar is still just kind of there clumps together another interesting point something I want to talk about is that if you've seen videos of this before it doesn't occur to you How unbelievably lightweight this stuff is because you have a pile of sugar that's all of the mass and then it's just expanded out to this large snake, so this thing weighs almost nothing is like styrofoam because It's also incredibly fragile look at this it just Comes right apart you can see how light and fluffy it is inside then if I crush it Basically just turns into dust I'm solid you just watch dust fly up off of it Powdered sugar with alcohol that one worked great it started off very quickly it kept going for quite a while There is still a lump of unburned sugar down at the bottom But it's pretty small it really got most of it That grew and twist it around and we got like a secondary growth coming off of it at one point. I'm pretty good That's a lot of big black snake curls wonderfully There's I don't know if you can get to some cameras even a little bits of Iridescent sort of colored going through parts of this so it's pretty neat So powdered sugar with alcohol is a fuel that works really well our blended sugar well our blended sugar with the lighter fluid Got basically nowhere Almost all the sugar Mixed with the baking soda is still here didn't burn We got a little bit of result, but not a lot blended sugar with the alcohol It took a while, and then it did start growing, but it didn't get very far It's not bad that does kind of look like a cool demon horn some sort of cancerous sand growth or something Not bad granulated sugar with lighter fluid again, not very impressive I took this piece off to try and let some of the sugar inside get a little more access to the heat Didn't really seem to do much This still looks cool, but it's very small. It didn't go very far I'm actually gonna try eating a tiny bit of this and it's gonna taste terrible I'm hoping this inner part will just taste like burnt sugar, and it won't all taste just like carbon There's also baking soda in it so it's like salty burn sugar no Yeah It's terrible granulated sugar and alcohol this took a good while to Start doing anything like it it took a long time for it to get beyond just this first little bit But eventually it started growing really well, and it just kept going until even though it is very lightweight Eventually I had enough weight to just break a piece off and then it started making another piece and the mountain broke off and then Another piece for it came and that broke off And it's just kept on going so I think we definitely got the most volume out of the granulated sugar Eventually the the powdered sugar definitely took off faster But in the end, I think the granulated sugar was the most firesnake you at all Oh, it's pretty close tie between those two I actually liked both of them pretty well But I'm gonna say the granulated sugar with my favorite. Just because it kept going and diminishing and getting smaller and smaller I think it's pretty clear that the 91% isopropyl alcohol that we were using is a much better fuel than the lighter fluid so Isopropyl alcohol very good granulated sugar or powdered sugar both quite good Blended sugar not really so good, so we're not going to use that anymore well I'm gonna clean this up, and then I have a couple ideas of how to scale this up to something a little bit larger It just disappears I'm gonna use our powdered sugar mix for this one because it started going Fastest and use the alcohol of course because that works way better And I'm just gonna set up like a whole bunch of different spots on one tray of sand I'm gonna Hope they kind of grow together into one giant Fire flame smoke log. We'll see what happens All right, oh, it's good. Let's light it up Lit and it's good That was pretty cool It wasn't exactly what I was hoping for I was hoping for we just kind of get like a large Column of this stuff rising up and that didn't really work out, but it did get some good volume We got quite a bit of the black snake material, which looked a little bit cooler well It's still on the tray make a couple of times. I cleared it off So we could like let the new stuff go in without all the weight of what was on there crushing it down overall pretty neat I've got one more thing that I want to try And it's gonna take up a little more space for All these ins I am using the powdered sugar rather than the granulated sugar just because it starts going Faster still think the granulated sugar might be better for a total result in getting the biggest longest snakes I just didn't want to wait for it this time Now we've got 13 fire snakes going at once I've spread them out a little bit more so that they hopefully won't bond together like they were in the last one this way I'm hoping we just get 13 different snakes rising a foot or two off of the tray Well there we go 13 different black snakes all in one tray all together making this sort of weird twisted field of gnarled growing things I don't even know what to call them, but that looks pretty cool It was fun to do and guys this experiment is so easy powdered sugar baking soda and rubbing alcohol You just put that in a little bit of sand and light it And you get this it's like the cheapest experiment you could ever do and it looks so cool I found that I had really good results using both granulated sugar and powdered sugar the powdered sugar started working a little bit faster the Granulated sugar kept going longer, so you kind of have to choose, which one you prefer I definitely found that the 91% rubbing alcohol worked better as a fuel than the lighter fluid. I think it started better I think it burned more consistently and Just gave us better results in the end if you're trying this at home make sure you're doing it in place with good ventilation Make sure you're not gonna light anything on fire around you and you have proper safety equipment to put anything out But this is absolutely something you can do at home Thanks for joining us for this project today, and we'll see you in the next one talk to you then And now I'm gonna see how quickly I can vacuum all of this up, so it's just go on Probably the most satisfying thing to vacuum that I've ever vacuumed Hey guys I know there are so many great videos and great youtubers out there that you could be watching Instead of the king of random, I just want to say how grateful. I am that you choose to watch us", "tdZaL1kXIPs": "hi guys Travis with here with firehouse education I just wanted to touch base with you guys we're working on a job small puff back and a furnace in the crawl space no it didn't actually go to flames but it did fill the house full of soot and smoke and so what we've got here is what we call a clean in place minor structural damage the probably may need to paint over this particular area as you can see that's where the smoke was the main sources of smoke in the house was in the dining room here so we may potentially have to paint that wall however the rest of the of the structure is just going to be a structure clean and then a wiping place on the contents a very easy job a very awesome job because we're going to finish this in two days and it's very good news for the homeowner she is a very sweet old lady with COPD and so she is very excited to have us here and cleaning everything up and we're going to be able to have her back in her house inside of a week and so she's very ecstatic about that and we're not going to disturb her too much and yeah so just want to touch base with you guys give me the update of what we're up to at the moment and talk to you soon", "tPtWHGgZ-8o": "hi everyone I need to hear from firehouse education and mobile cleaning systems and I just wanted to do this video for you and talked a little bit today about what we call clean in-place fires now what that is is sometimes there's a fire that affects a home because of smoke soot and odor and there's very little if any structural damage so it doesn't warrant necessarily having to pack up all the contents of a house and moving them out however it all does need to be cleaned to decontaminate the home and get rid of odor so we call that a clean in place where we come in and we will take room by room and systematically and very thoroughly clean each room using a ball to clean the ceiling walls all the contents and removing them cleaning the floor I'm putting them back light fixtures all that sort of thing windows and so it's kind of a process and it's a it's definitely something that you need to be very systematic with and very organized to be able to do because our big concern is we're cleaning in an area that is contaminated and we're trying to decontaminate as we move through so one of the important things that we always want to do if if at all if possible sometimes it's not possible but we want to try to start in the source room so in this particular job that we're on I was in the kitchen the lady of the home had was boiling turkey carcass from Thanksgiving and gonna make homemade turkey soup with that well she forgot about it left home for three and a half hours and came back to a boil dry turkey carcass that had filled her house completely with smoke in a very putrid odor and fortunately she got back in time that had not went to flame did destroy her her soup pot but did not go to flame so we don't have any structural damage besides smoke and order so her home is a very tricky plate situation when it comes to this Clinton place because I want to kind of have you span the room a little bit as you can see every inch of this home is covered in decorations maybe panning over there to your right you're going to see the kitchen where the culprit actually started and the fire happened and as you can see there is a lot of contents in this home now this is a small home about 900 square feet but there are more things in this home that I usually see in an average 1500 square foot house so it kind of brought out some challenges so that's why I wanted to do this video and in talk to you he's a little bit about it and and I'm gonna actually focus for sake of time on this area here this is actually a custom-built cabinet that she had put into her home 31 years ago when she moved here and she has all of these keepsakes from her family years of growing up her grandmother's crystal was over there on the bottom and she has brought out she has a lot of Christmas decor so she's brought out all of her Christmas decor so as you can see with all of these delicate from multitude of items this was quite a challenge to clean this area so what we did was we we took one they if you will grow a shelf at a time and we take a photograph to see exactly how everything was set remove the items clean the Shelf clean the item and put it back now we used an item that I call its score it's like a janitorial supply cleaning chemical it's a mild degreaser and with 99 in the solution to clean and deodorize at the same time now these items it was a very mild smoke situation so I we didn't have we did some q-tipping but I did did not have to ultrasonically dip these items had this been a bad fire or a medium smoke damage fire we would have definitely been dipping most of these items in the ultrasonic machine that we have unit so we would take row by row and remove the items once they're clean we pulled up our picture on our camera and then we would put all of the items back exactly as they were when we got here now to some that might seem you know a little overboard and evil OCD which I have been accused of being in the in the past and I just think yesterday one of my workers accused me of that but anyway um but but it's actually all joking aside it's actually very very huge that she is going to come back into her home she's gonna be here in about half an hour to walk through with me because we're done we're actually leaving the job today now for her to come back into her home and to not only see all of her things bright and shiny and her house smells like brand new thanks to our hydroxyl machine and the cleaning not only does it smell brand-new look shiny and clean but everything looks in place so it's like we were here but were they really here you know her home everything is laid out exactly as she had it when she left three days ago and yet it's better when she gets back so I think that it's very key that our homeowners like they can tell we've been here obviously are the effects of us being here and our presence is seen and yet it's almost like we're they actually even here it just really helps the homeowner to be less interrupted and affected and life can get back to normal a lot quicker for them so I hope this video doesn't freak some of you out who are considering getting into or newly getting into the fire restoration or cleaning because I know that some of these things can kind of be scary but that's why I'm doing the video because they're not scary and I want to help take the fear out of that for you and realize that if you have a system and you're very methodical and how you do things and you're very thorough can you always do them in the same way every time with your system then you're gonna have great amazing results you're gonna have very happy clients and you're have a job that's a breeze so anyway I hope you enjoyed the video I hope you found this valuable if so if you leave me a comment below and tell me what you maybe learn from it or let give me ideas of more videos that you'd like me to do for you I would really appreciate it and of course share with your friends about firehouse education and you have a great day", "lfSsFsF62r0": "[Music] what is going on youtube welcome back everybody this is gonna be a good one we are finally weighing in some of the bud inside of that two by four tent now this is all the crowns that were taken off of the doce dose the godfather and then the other smaller godfather plant now i did something really stupid i just kind of mixed all the godfather together so i won't actually know how much that big plant is get away in the end all it's gonna be way more than the other one the other little godfather og plant legitimately only had four little stems on it four not little necessarily but probably gonna get like an ounce and a half at the most out of that little small godfather plant so unfortunately won't be able to isolate each one but you know where all the buds coming from and that would be the one that had about 20 donkey dicks hanging off of it anyway the big jar that's the godfather og the smaller jars right off to the left that is the dosy dose all right let's get down to business finally let's throw some butt on the scale let's give you a quick little look at some godfather og before that it is nice and sparkly just take a look at this bud not too bad looking pretty decent you got to do a little bit of fine brushing off of a few little leaf particles that are left but besides that looking pretty damn good down to the most important question of the second what should i weigh in first i think i'm gonna go with my favorite strain the dosey dose let's do this i'm guessing bare minimum over 50 grams if it's any less than 50 grams i'll probably be a little bit disappointed not gonna lie but that is some insanely killer looking bud i really wish everyone could try this and everyone could smoke this exact strain because it is next level amazing see what we got here 37 oh broke 50 67 67.04 sorry about the light and the angling on that scale i'll zoom in for you yeah sixty seven point zero four slash zero five it just moved to well i'm not disappointed that's a pretty decent amount just for some crowns it's gonna make for some really good smoke just a little bit of a heads up i have pollinated the strain in the last 14 days and i crossed it with black fire once again just like my other strain was crossed black fire with chem cookies now this one's going to be dosy dose with black fire and of course if i was pollinating some plants i couldn't go and not pollinate myself the godfather og plant that is also currently sitting right beside the pollinated dosey dose so both of those strains the dosey dose and the godfather og are now going to be crossed with black fire what should make for some really interesting smoke all right let's do this godfather og weigh-in right here that one bud three grams it's a decent sized bud i must say and i'm gonna have to say my prediction for this is gonna be above a quarter pound no matter what if it's less than a quarter pound i question my own ability to judge anything anymore let's see what we got here quarter pound by the way is about 112 to 114 grams i'm positive we're going to be passing that with this big jar 52 63. just keep throwing it in 91. oh yeah quarter pound is gonna be broken easily boom that was a pretty easy goal to break let's see if we can bust 150 i'm pretty sure it's coming oh yeah here we go 162 that's what i'm talking about 162.8 grams for the godfather og plants mainly the one big plant i'm gonna have to add in there didn't get too much off that smaller plant but 162 what is that like five and a bit ounces i'll put the actual number up for you on the screen right now pretty sure it's around five and a bit so 162 plus 67 what do we got there that's like 129 plus the 0.8 i forget what other point we had so was that 229 230 that's over half a pound right there that's right just in crowns and not even the tropicana cookies plant included that's a pretty good haul i'll take a half pound in crowns all day long anyway i'm out of here take her easy everybody see you next time", "fA6w5mlGZrI": "so you're thinking about using quick Detailers on your car maybe you've used them in the past chances are you're not using them the right way stay tuned because we're going to go over the details of how to properly use quick Detailers next okay quick Detailers they've been around for a long time there's a lot of different formulations out there from a lot of different companies the problem is most people make the mistake of reading the label on the back of the quick detailer that typically says can be used in between washes to do a light cleaning on a car does that work yes but the downfall to that is you are swirling up your car in the process there's no two ways about it I don't care what kind of product you're using if you're using it in lieu of a proper 2 bucket method wash you are going to scratch the surface of it how do you want to use a quick detailer then well the way to use it is after you wash wash the car you can do it part of the drying process or after you're finished drying put a little bit on the surface wipe it off it just adds a little bit of gloss a little bit of protection most quick Detailers don't offer a lot of protection but it's better than nothing on the car at all also it can help if there's any spotting left over from the washing process it will help wipe that stuff off now the thing that gets us we've done videos about it before but going to an event and you see people they've driven their cars there and they break out the quick detailer they break out the same towel that's been in the back of their car all summer long and they proceed to wiping the car down all they're doing is grinding the dirt in and typically you up and see those cars and as you expect they are dust free but they have swirls all over the finish I would much rather have a great looking finish with some dust on it for an event I go to now the next question is well how do I keep the car clean between washes you don't you'll wait till the next wash it's just one of those things if you want your car to look really nice or you've done paint correction or maybe you've paid to have paint correction done on it if you go and use quick Detailers in-between you're scratching it up so what if you have a car that hasn't gone through paint correction you know it's got some swirls and some defects and stuff in it in that case you're probably okay because you already have a lot of issues with the paint you're adding light marring to it but it's not going to make a noticeable difference but the best way to treat it is stay away from the quick Detailers when the car is dirty use them after they have been cleaned and another rule of thumb on quick Detailers is less is more I see people just spraying down a panel with it and then going to wipe it off then you're going to get streaking and smearing typically speaking you want to spray the quick detailer into your towel then wipe onto the surface flip it over to a clean side and wipe it off and that's all you should need so if you want to learn more about some quick Detailers and how to get the most out of them and what to expect out of it check out the next video we're gonna link you to here on the Heron fart ultra gloss fantastic product as are all these on the table here I do believe we've done videos on all of them check it out don't forget to hit that subscribe button hit the bell to be notified of future

about and had just black streaks on it so I'm doing that right now so I wanted to show you what I did I took the frame and I ran the HEPA vacuum over it real quick and I'm sorry I was gonna film the whole thing for you and I just got excited I started doing it and I went on I told him I film it so I kept it vacuumed all over the frame hope you see my lighting good and then I took a damp cloth and with a little bit of degreaser on it and I wiped all of this off now I'm gonna go ahead would cream this but I want to get the bulk of the matter off of it next I'm working on the painting now I thought this was a canvas painting see how the back has acid-free paper on the back of it I thought it was a canvas painting it's not this is actually a ray print and it's on a board so that's actually quite lucky for the homeowner because I'm not gonna have a problem saving this so can you see can you get up really close here with the camera see that black line okay that I took my chem sponge and I wiped across there and that's what I came up with off that so now what I'm gonna do is I met Travis fan back a little bit and I'm gonna show you I'm gonna do this and I started with a fresh clean chem sponge on this painting and I'm gonna do every inch of it in those long even strokes right that we've talked about I'm gonna go all the way down it see now I've already did this area so I'm getting a little bit more off but not really bad flipping it over to some clean side can you see that really starting to come off okay so now I'm gonna take this long clean side and I'm actually gonna just swipe and get all that off there once and for all look at that yeah that was really bad this was in the source room so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna run my chem sponge along the edge okay and now I'm actually going to start I'm gonna use a different camp sponge at the moment cuz I'm gonna start with a really clean edge and I'm gonna do this again all right long even strokes okay see you got a little bit more off again that time I'm gonna do it again law even stroke okay so not really getting anything else off now this I'm gonna have to take and I'm gonna run the Kemp's budge along this a few times remember it's long strokes that we do see what I got off of there see this this right here is covered with stuff so what I may have to do here is actually take a q-tip with a mild degreaser and clean this but now look that that beaded wear area is actually coming quite clean but they don't there we go again and see what the chemists Bunge so that's what I'm gonna do here alright and but the good news is she's gonna have look at this painting there's none of those staining on it it's gonna come out good and it already smells amazing already smells amazing now we have to have hydroxyl running on it for a while and I'm gonna hydroxyl it again of course I do that to almost all my contents and then the back of this this acid-free paper I'm not gonna take this off and reapply have new acid-free paper put on this just because it's so absorbent for a boater I don't want any order to come back so this is awesome she's gonna be able to keep this she's gonna be so excited and I'll do more pieces like this for you guys I've got some other painting she has several of them that she's really concerned about and I'll show you how we do on those so I hope you enjoyed the video", "6LwQn0VPxhA": "[Music] today will we be talking about the different uses and purposes of common wash bottles and a standard chem lab wash bottles are squeeze bottles with the nozzle that are used to rinse various pieces of laboratory glassware such as test tubes and round bottom flasks they can also be used as a solvent for solutions in a lab the most common types of wash bottles are acetone ethyl alcohol distilled water and tap water each bottles cap is color-coordinated according to the type of substance contained within it right is used for acetone white for ethyl alcohol blufor distilled water and clear for tap water not only is acetone used as a solvent but also as a means to clean out your glassware in a non water soluble solution first rinse your beaker or whatever chemistry lab equipment that once contained a water soluble solution such as the speaker here with acetone to rinse it three times as so push me away that's it when you say you love me then make me crazy then follow up with deionized water three to four more times [Music] [Music] then once you're finished carefully take the glassware dump out the solution dry it off with a paper towel or an air jet if you have one and then put it carefully put the glassware away however always be careful when using acetone in lab because it is highly flammable I can set fire to your lab in an instant as shown here distilled water often has a blue cap on it distilled water is the Pierce form of water because it it typically has the minimum amount of contaminants and minerals possible distilled water is made by boiling water usually from municipal sources and collecting the steam as it condenses distilled water is most commonly used in chemistry labs as a solvent for molecules and solutes that are soluble in water it is much more effective to use distilled water distilled water rather than tap because distilled water has little to no contaminants that can affect the results of the lab and the distillation process also removes the electrical charge from the atoms it is important to rinse your lab equipment with distilled water before every experiment to ensure that the results are accurate why use tap water we already have the perfect solvent distilled water tap water is good for cleaning at the beginning it is the initial rinse to get rid of most of the particles from the glassware we then follow up with distilled water to finish the cleanser make the glassware as pristine as possible last but not least we have I thought alcohol I thought alcohol is often used as a final rinse before we put the glassware away it is used after we have washed it off with tap distilled and DN eyes and deionized water we then finish it off with this ethyl alcohol", "gdgQbBmxnQM": "hi everyone i am rebecca from chemnitz and we have some leftover dye after the july 2020 chemist dialogue live stream these are some liquid half percent stock solutions that i made during the stream and even this water and there's even a little bit of dye there on the side you can see this water is left over from the stream as well i just added 100 grams of nitpick stroll fingering weight yarn to the pot and we're going to come and we've got about 100 milliliters of our red and maybe uh 175 milliliters of black that will add to this yarn so we've got i would say that will probably be about one and a half grams of dye total so not too much for one skin let's start with our red and i'm getting the red out of our sponge and then just adding that i'll add a little bit of liquid to this container we'll add more vinegar as is needed but i'm curious if that's gonna strike super super quickly or what uh well i don't mind much about like color spread this is a fairly random kind of colorway that we're going for uh adding our reds then using my gloved hands this color looks it looks a little a little scary um but we've got acid but not heat yet so that should help with our color then we absorption a lot more of our black as i'm trying to remove some and then bring it in for shimmy this yarn around i don't want to lift it because i don't want to mix all the colors completely but i don't mind there being some amount of color mixing going on here cool and now i'm just going to turn on the heat i'm going to keep this on medium heat [Music] until the pan heats up and then i will reduce things too low this colorway we're creating right here is a lot softer than the kinds of things i was aiming for during the livestream and by softer i mean that the transition is sort of subtle there's gonna be some blending going on and i mean it's very very beautiful but those things exist it's a little it still fits the inspiration of the clock a bit but it's uh the the feelings that the photo evokes are a little bit different from the feeling the yarn gives but nevertheless this would count for that as very much but it's i mean this is a separate video so it's being kept separate but i don't know i like red and black together anyway i am going to heat this up and we'll come back in about 20 minutes and check in on it all right we still have a fair amount of red down by the end a little bit of black down at this end so i think what i want to do now well we've just moved things um because i was like tempted to add more liquid but maybe i'll wait let's wait 10 more minutes and then we'll add more liquid another 10 minutes later we still have some of the red but i think almost all the black has exhausted just giving it a little bit of help oh that's not very much red again let's help you red let's help you let's all help each other here in the pan um all right i am going to add a little splash of vinegar and we're gonna shake things up there's not enough color left that i feel like um we can't mix things around a bit and honestly that did help almost everything clear i'm gonna turn off the heat but i'll leave the yarn here in the pan so it can cool completely and once it's cool then we will go and wash it let's wash our yarn i think to me cherry bomb today is feeling very raspberry um versus more of a true red it's not technically a primary but i think i want to grab some other reds for my collection because fire was a firewriter car engine red isn't my favorite but i'm not really seeing any bleeding here which is good because from the batch the cherry bomb i had seen a bit of bleeding from today's dye okay let's see and there's maybe a hint of something i've just added a little bit of dish soap and i am going to keep washing this until the water runs clear but what i'm seeing with the soap was not bright pink so i am encouraged and once i'm done rinsing i'll put the yarn through my spin dryer then hang it up to dry and we'll come back to some conclusions it started bleeding um it's not bad right now but it got bad at one point oh man i'll just keep rinsing it uh and if i don't pop back in then that means that it rinsed out and it's good and then it's now drying this on camera actually doesn't look pretty bad um i didn't grab the camera when it was really bad but this is definitely a lot more than there was at the beginning of the washing so i'm confused but we'll go with it a little bit of some vinegar in the soap made the bleeding go away so if you're worried about bleeding uh and you're gonna be blocking something i recommend just throwing a bit of vinegar into your rinse the finished yarn is gorgeous we've got the saturated berry red on one side and more it's not quite black i say a deep charcoal gray close to black almost matte black um and then some blending some pinks and some more grays in the middle here the colorway is not perfectly repeating by which i mean we have a larger pastel section here shorter over there and so there will be some variety and if you knit say two socks at a time from either end they could end up looking different which isn't a problem but you know you're not gonna this isn't a great skein to use for planned pooling or something like that when i'm saying socks might not be the same they wouldn't the yarn isn't necessarily asymmetric it not wouldn't necessarily feel like a gradient but it might not be like the perfect match i hope that makes sense as for color bleeding we touched on some strategies earlier but add vinegar to the pre-soak vinegar in the cool water stopped any bleeding colors are much more likely to bleed in hot water i'll admit i was frustrated when the bleeding happened but i'm glad that acid made it stop and when dealing with a pigmented red of hand dyed or commercial dyed it's always worth checking to see if it'll bleed before you decide to pair it with say a pastel color especially color work or stripes or something do just like a little swatch test to see if the colors might run together before you go and finish your project i am rebecca from ken bits and i really hope you all enjoyed this video if you did please

had forgotten how much i like red and black or red and gray or just dealing with contrast like this black is a color i really really like to die with but i feel like i use navy a bit more than black of the black acid dyes i've tried dharma true black is beyond without a shadow of a doubt it is my favorite it doesn't break it's great for speckles and i have always been happy with the color intensity but yeah i mean this just feels so new and different from a lot of the things i've done recently and so i'm really really excited don't forget to go and check out the leave no die behind

will need powder sugar baking soda send some kind of container measurement spoons mixing bowl a lighter and some kind of feel you can do i've been alcohol i using the lighter fluid let's get to our experiment first thing we're going to do is go up order sugar one spoon and then one spoon of baking soda and then we going to mix it then we will need some kind of container and then we're gonna pull a mountain of sand then i'm gonna go up my lighter fluid or i've been alcohol and just sprinkle it on top over sand to suck it in so then i'm going to go up a spoon and push it down like that and then put this stuff right on top of it the sugar and baking soda and now we're going to go outside put some more lighter fluid on the sand and then we're going to light it up okay now we're going to light it up so the lady on work we've also put four teaspoons of sugar and one teaspoon of baking soda and mix it up and then we're going to do same thing here I'm going to be using the same scent I got a mountain here then I'm going to sprinkle it on top of it now I'm going to put the mixture on top you see now it's bubbling up a lot faster I think this is gonna work a lot better check it out you see how snake producing over the epicly a lot more now so this is much better to pull it up like one teaspoon of baking soda and four teaspoons of powdered sugar this is epic look at this snake it's like coming out from all of the sides look and if you take it off this part this a action will happen again alright guys check it out look how much ash from four teaspoons of sugar and baking soda put in same go k so let me know what they think what does it look like in comments just go crazy in comments okay alright guys this pretty much it I want you to thumbs up this video and let me know what do

As you know noodles is probably one of my favorite things in the world Well noodles and dumplings and hotpot. Okay, there's a lot of stuff I love. I think I'm at a good first stop right here in Jeju. We're gonna go have a local specialty called meat noodles Love the name. Let's go. So with this meal I got two different types of noodles one is a soup and one is more sauce. And the soup noodle has a creamy looking broth strands of eggs sesame, scallions, carrots- oh and black pork meat inside as well and all the noodles here are handmade These look like they have a lot of chew. Good texture This is the famous meat noodles here in Jeju and they call this dome Bay Which is the process of cooking a massive amount of black pig in a pot? Wow so clean So much porky flavor. This is the perfect noodles for your stomach. It's not it's not very acidic It's it's such a soothing calming broth I just took out a little just to experiment but a little bit of chili bit of salt some pepper All right, I might have added just a tad more salt than I should have But really nothing wrong with how it was before. Dip my pork in the shrimp sauce a tiny bit Jalapeno for spice a little bit of onions for some crunch This looks like a one biter Wow so much Difference in texture from the crunch of the onions to the jalapenos to the crunchy cartilage and don't sleep on this awesome pork Also, let's not forget the second noodles here. These noodles are stir-fried and it looks like chili sauce and little bits of Mussels and this is what they call stone octopus here And I've never seen this before but it's a side of rice with bean sprouts. And of course, some seaweed. Just look at this. Oh This is - did they like capture the kraken and bring it to my plate? I was told you mix the rice with this spicy sauce Rice is all nicely mixed Really nice fragrance from the sesame oil so chili is not not as spicy as it looks mmm boom God, I love that texture a little more aldente, a little more chewy than the ones in the broth It's clinging to that sauce. So so well, how do I even start to eat this? Okay, they give me these. Wanna try a piece of the octopus. I was afraid this thing was gonna be a little too tough This is love me tender gentle. I was just informed by my local friends here that what I was actually supposed to do is Cut everything, cut the noodles, cut the octopus and just mix this whole dish together and then eat it like that. That's a greatest thing. Don't get me wrong I love the noodles in a broth but this is on a whole different level Oh and the octopus and all the seafood in this plate. All caught locally, that's why you're not gonna get anything fresher than this All right, I'm gonna finish up but I said this noodle adventure. It's just getting started next up Next up, I'm going back to Seoul for some more noodle fun. See you in a bit. Hi back in Seoul and the noodle tour continues My first of bowl noodles back in Seoul is one of my all-time Favorites both in Chinese and Korean cuisine. jajangmyeon. and this dish of course is a Chinese inspired dish That's why we're at a Korean Chinese restaurant Now besides having supposedly amazing Korean jajangmyeon this place also has another popular dish called sweet and sour pork I could smell that as soon as I walked in the restaurant. So we're gonna plate of that too. Now. This is a typical northeastern Chinese dish. chunks of pork fried on the outside a sweet and sour sauce poured all over, it's supposed to be crispy and Sweet and vinegary all at the same time A little preview before the noodles Oh my god. That was so good I Momentarily forgot why I was here. Not only sweet definitely vinegary perfect contrast of crispy on the outside tender meaty on the inside that Was one of the best versions of that dish I think I've ever had so regardless of the noodles come here for this. My jajangmyeon is finally here fresh cucumbers on top Usually the noodles are homemade, of course tons of onions. This is actually a lot different than the typical korean jajangmyeon. That I see a lot which comes in very very black fermented bean sauce Get those two dishes eat them together when you come here. and actually what you see here with this type of sauce that's less dark then I think the More common type of jajangmyeon you typically see at least in the US. This is actually the more typical traditional Korean jajangmyeon, you will find in Korea. And the other type, you know with tons of onions with a black soybean sauce That's actually a more modified version. I mean, they're both traditional, but this is the more typical version This was just pure comfort food for me my foodie soul feels warm right now Anyway, like I said, this is a noodle adventure. So let's keep going. Sorry I had to interrupt this noodle adventure for a very important bingsu break. because in between noodle dishes, you gotta have some bingsu. I love fluffy, snowy bingsu. Oh yeah. It's like catching soft fluffy flavorful snow on your tongue on Christmas Day Top three maybe the best bingsu i've ever had. Alright, sorry, not sorry for this deliciously sweet interruption. Back to more noodles Hey guys, I'm at the next noodle location. This is a noodle I've never had before-  soybean noodles. Let's go check it out And this is kimchi rice, there's zucchini, kimchi of course onions, what looks like looks like small chunks of beef and they're just stirfrying this entire thing right in front of me And this is something I'm getting in addition to my noodles So kimchi noodles are a really popular noodle dish here in Korea But only in the summer, you're not gonna be able to find this in the winter because this is a cold noodle and what's really interesting about this noodle is that the noodles themselves are not obviously made from soybeans this broth is essentially just Freshly ground soybeans and some salt, that's it. And this restaurant is the number one place for soybean noodles in all of Korea This is so exciting because I never try anything like this before my life. This is really thick broth. This is almost like this is almost like a smoothie type consistency Ok, this noodle dish, it's really fairly simple. There's really nothing to here besides the noodles and the soy bean soup Oh That's interesting. This is an extremely clean refreshing bowl of noodles. I feel like if you do not likes soybeans You're not gonna love this. It's smooth But you can definitely taste the soybean in  this. A strong soybean flavor and every single bite you definitely feel the remnants like the little micro soybean particles on your tongue, but If you've never really had tofu or soymilk or are not really familiar with soy products before this might catch you by surprise because the flavor profile is really strong Oh, Oh my Wow paired with the noodles that's where it's at. The noodles extremely springy, al dente I'm thinking this gonna be awesome Mm-hmm. Even better than I thought. Alright, I'm gonna finish this up because it's hot outside and uh I'll see you at the next noodle place Oh, by the way I should really apologize to the kimchi rice because this is a noodle video and I really kind of failed to mention it But I'm sorry. This is a noodle video, you understand right? I know I hurt you. I'm gonna make this right by eating you up So for this next noodle stop we're gonna heat things up This dish is called bibim noodles bibim means to mix and when you get this - when I get this noodle dish I'm supposed to mix it all up and eat it. So here it is bibim noodles And the first time I think I've ever seen kale on top of any noodles kimchi inside, some cucumbers And I love that every thin strand of noodles is just bombarded by flakes of chili. First bite of spicy noodles today Inside this lava looking pool of spice in which my thin delicious noodles are soaking in. This is home for me This is everything I hope for, everything I desire, everything I love in a bowl of cold noodles. The noodles themselves incredibly chewy This both heats me up and cools me down at the same time. Also, Got some dumplings. This should fit so well with this Very typical Korean soup dumplings The filling is huge But it's also very soft. Way less chewy filling doing what a Chinese dumpling would offer. Dipping sauce is very simple could use some hot oil Just some soy sauce. But really, come on. You know where we should be dipping this right? Yeah Cause it tastes a whole lot better. That was definitely my favorite noodle of the day This restaurant is called  gogili buckwheat noodles This place is about a 30 minute drive from Seoul, it's 11:30, they basically just opened And we have to wait in line. It's completely packed This restaurant really just specializes in buckwheat noodles. In their menu, there's only a couple of options You can either have the spicy buckwheat noodle or the perilla oil buckwheat noodles. That's it. There's only two types of noodles here. And then they also serve some pork meat that I of course had to get, This is the mixed buckwheat noodle actually this is the only noodle that you'll see on the menu. On top is a slice of Korean pear sitting sitting on this little mound of Chilies and then right underneath, some strips of eggs Some cucumbers and all that is just sitting on top of a delicious glorious looking at the tower of noodles. And this you just got to mix it around They came over and actually help me mixed the noodles, so now the sauce is nice and integrated. I love noodles for breakfast. Oh My god, oh Wow, I need to get more bowls of this If you guys never had buckwheat's noodles, you're really missing out. It's one of my favorite types of noodles. I've been eating this since I was a kid in China. Every single bite just takes me back to my childhood. The texture So smooth and chewy. The chilies not overly strong, flavor is really balanced. That is a refreshingly delicious bowl of noodles I could eat every single morning for the rest of my life. Before I talk more about that I have to get to my second Bowl. This is actually not listed on the official menu here. Essentially a Korean secret menu item It's buckwheat noodles with perilla oil with sesame seeds and seaweed covering the top. And they told me I can't mix it I'm not supposed to mix it, I'm supposed to just eat it Until I'm about halfway done or two thirds of the way done. And then I'm gonna add the broth. It's so incredibly fragrant Hang on, I just need to say something to these noodles really quickly. I know we just met like 10 minutes ago, but I love you I really do. These noodles are some of the most unique Tastiest most fragrant noodles I have ever had. Holy moly, this is amazing Its flavored in all the right ways. It's like my head and all my senses are just swirling in the sesame Fragrant cloud. Yeah, that's definitely going on my noodle must-try list for sure I mean those noodles are not gonna be the most well seasoned So if you like something really salty that might not be your cup of tea But for me that sesame seed and the perilla oil and all the fragrance from all the ingredients in there I'd love that. Also, I got some pork. I mean, they're not known for pork But most of my noodles for last couple days had no meat in them. So. I mean it's not jeju black pig, but still pretty good Also, I'm so glad this place you can order extra noodles for 4,000 won - so about 3.50, $4, I think that's pretty much needed Oh, this is so awesome, check this out So I ordered two extra helping of noodles and I thought for the four thousand won which is the half price of my first order it would just be like half the noodle size No You get a full on Another order of noodles. and she - the auntie told me like you got to eat this really quick because buckwheat noodles get soggy really really quickly There's the soup version This is really simple broth. I think this is pork broth, With just a bit of salt? Halfway done with these noodles and I got to pour - they told me to pour does broth in I don't know. I don't know how it just got better. Mmm oh my gosh. All that fragrance is now in the soup itself. Oh man. This is a noodle lovers dream right here I'm gonna ask someone to have broth in the spicy noodles as well. I just had a radical thought. Broth with the perilla oil and the sesame and the seaweed, I want some of that flavor in this spicy noodle and see what happens here I like it. Spicy, sesame-y, seafoody, Yummy. And this is a true local place. I mean it takes some effort to get here But if you guys like buckwheat noodles, and not everyone does, and you want a really unique noodle experience here in South Korea This is where you go, because what a gem of a place. All right, we only got one more place left on the noodle tour so. I'm still hungry. Let's do it. I heard this is amazing This is their signature cold mixed noodle, and this is their hot soup noodle these are the two noodle dishes that people come to here for so, that's what I'm gonna get. Got my two noodles and this is The broth one and this is the cold spicy one. The soup one looks like arugula, scallions Tofu skin. Oh, look at this noodles on the bottom Just a fantastic shine, it's like a sunken treasure. Cold version, again arugula egg cucumbers cabbage bunch of sesame seeds Tons of chili on what looks like some kind of - looks like little bits of seafood on. topnoodles again on the bottom And what I was told before coming here was that these will be some of the chewiest Spongiest noodles I can find in Seoul This is anchovy broth, very very flavorful. I was promised extremely extremely chewy noodles, and I got extremely extremely chewy noodles. I thought the soupy version of the noodles were chewy and elasticy, nah. Meet the mr. Incredible version of noodles These are by far the chewiest Spongiest, most elasticy noodles I've had in Korea. And the sauce is absolutely marvelous They actually have three degrees of spice I wanted they third one But they they convinced me to get the second one because they said the third level of spice I really won't be able to taste any flavor This is so amazingly good. I love this.I think on the spice level This is a little spicier than like the fire ramen noodles, a little spicier than that. But the biggest difference is eating this, it's not a food challenge. It's a food pleasure Well guys that pretty much wraps up my noodle tour of South Korea I mean, this is my longest noodle tour ever, spanning over two cities and over three days. But I got to try some of the most amazing unique Noodles that this country has to offer and I'm sure I hadn't even begun to scratch the surface But that's why noodle adventures are so much fun, because they never end. I think I had to pick one favorite Flavor-wise I love the jajangmyeon and texture-wise these noodles win hands-down the most unique has to be the soy bean and the one that gave me the feels the most which I have to say is the sesame buckwheat noodles I had this morning which really brought me back to my childhood Do you also want to go on a noodle adventure? I've listed all the places I went to in my description box below. Most of these restaurants don't have English names So I'll put as much information as I can. And guys as always I really appreciate you following along Thank you so much for watching and until we eat again, I'll see you later", "b42bp0WdImk": "hello everyone and welcome back it's creative were dancing back again here with another video as I live stream it to now this video I'm just gonna be basically talking about an open talk about black out or a lie tell kit you know for those times when the grids down you don't have any consistent power lights are out can't get in the garage stuff like your microwave still it's not working and of course these things can happen for various reasons and next time it takes to recover from that it can be hours today's two weeks depending on the extent of the damages so it's time to roll in the opener or my intro here hey everyone welcome back thanks for tuning in and taking the time to check out my content like I said like five seconds ago I'm just gonna be talking about Raquel kids well I tell kids you know for those times when the grids down or whatever the reason is there's several different reasons that the grid or power could be out thrown as major as I seem a coronal mass ejection or EMP or electromagnetic pulse there's something more likely maybe more common storms you know heavy thunder showers this could be ice - ice ice can make power wide say again well they'll break hey Bob thanks for dropping in my and I will load to YouTube so regardless of what causes blackout having a kit like a blackout or Oh a toolkit online pretty much you know if you search one org error you'll find videos on it too but generally those are the two names that you know titles that it would be given so yeah regardless of cause having a kid like like that and some knowledge can help now I know expert at power outages I mean I've had my fair share never anything longer than I think six six or seven hours I've had one once turned the day at night late early in the morning I mean I've seen we're it's a you know a black tile but it rush hour out so it's very busy during that time people are trying to adapt especially your driving you know you're gonna treat every inner every intersection it's a four-way stop so though some people don't do that for some reason looks like that God for you few more people drop in that's cool welcome everyone that's dropping in see that my side chat is trying to fill up a couple more Watchers so that's cool thank you for dropping by Hey Bruce thanks for dropping back into my live stream so I'm like I said I'm on account for when the lights go out can be caused by different reasons but regardless of the reason everyone can help you you know smooth out that hurdle in life you know any place in the modern world any city any town the grid think about in terms of lights the lights or it's a blackout so having some simple items which I'll go through in a little bit you know greatly smoothed out hurt alone so you're not stressing about it so much you get supplies and know it's all ready to go like once it happened start and you know maybe you know where it went it's caused from you know you can take steps to smooth out that hurdle sorry I keep working on the side because I'm trying to check out my side shot here okay so yeah so one of the most common things or a whitetail kid or a blackout kid is candles I mean can't okay channels there's pros and cons to candles fairly inexpensive most people can attain them you can get them at the dollar store front tea light candles to narrow type of stick handles to you know what big wide candles that are like 30 50 80 $100 no candles or an open flame you probably don't need to supplement lighters or matches with it it's you know he just goes hand ahead and generally speaking I prefer those you know 30 50 80 hour candles or Tila candles I prefer them over these stick handles that are like long and narrow for one main reason it's because a center gravity like these the candles are very very likely to tip over like it doesn't take much right if this was a tea like I mean mr. candle it just be balancing you might have it in something or you know maybe you melted some wax and putting it on a plate for example the pinions because it's so tall the center gravity is really really up high so it's very easy to knock it over and for that reason alone I do not like them I mean if it's the only thing you have well you know you're gonna do when you and I do but in terms of being prepared beforehand you know I prefer tea lights or you know wider candles because the warmth the wide base makes it harder for it to get knocked over so for example this was a tea light candle right I can burn this it's gonna be it's not gonna get knocked over as easily as when those call narrow type of candles so when I get those type of stick handles I tend to melt them down use them for fire starters or melt them into making you know wider candle that would most likely burn longer too now another tip which I've shown in a different video and I hopefully will remember to add a link and an end card for it is I've shown this video of when you have to use like tea light candles for example by sticking it into water so let's say so users can for example I would fill it up with just a little bit of water then stick my candle in there so even even for this to be a like a bowl or something like that just enough so it can kind of float for a lack of better word so even if it gets knocked over heads children something like that because you have water with it there's there's a better chance of it when you get to the October that candle will go well because of water I mean the last thing you want when you're using candles especially if it's a windows well it's a blackout grates down for some reason or whatever reason the last thing you want is to have a well start a fire inside because you know some had knocked over your stick candle on the table you know for whatever reason she's now read the side chat real quick earnest yes Bruce I prefer these pillar type of or contained type of candles more they're safer like I said you don't want a fire hazard in a situation like a blackout that's the last thing you need I mean especially since even I mean emergency vehicle first responders not gonna be doing wait different things I mean the response times gonna be slow so I mean trying to make things better not worse hell okay thanks for dropping by and appreciate you dropping by and leaving a quick side chat common what I've been asking storm ones and a little cage or safer I have those need a heat proof math too yeah I'll get into that a little bit okay we're just talking about one well fire right I mean you can't see fire gives you light and heat very true Bruce fire extinguisher it's not me very helpful and if you can't get bad you know at least baking soda salt I waited even I mean right those things will help okay I guess as a side note I mean make sure you know there's nothing nearby these candles drapes anything that can fall onto it like maybe a boss maybe you have some flowers on the table and you got candles as well you make sure those flowers are not too close by so it's just a case something happens you know I don't know I mean couldn't get this blackout could be caused by a freak storm you got your your window right by your table breaks from debris or something flying into the window we blows it over I mean wow most likely it would probably put out the candle but sometimes those candles can you know keep going you know you're trying to blow it out so yeah like fire candles they're cheap but they can be dangerous but they do offer light and heat which could be important especially if it's in the winter or when it's colder out because a Blacko can happen any time of year and virtually in any urban town area no one's I'll everyone's vulnerable yes exactly elk Alex I mean that's the whole kind of kind of thing you would see in like different movies maybe maybe on TV I mean one West guy in print above you know the oil drum plating on fire to stay warm and still high dive we'll all topic play so on the side chat while I'm still talking and I'm talking about the next topic well the next area that I'm gonna go into I'll leave me a comment on side chat if you've ever been in one a blackout or places without power for you know and how long and you know what did you learn from it were you ready enough or you know did you wing it enough to you know make it work um so anyways fire is also you know dangerous but it's also it's not electrical so you don't have to worry about you know powering it up with solar a generator and stuff like that linked flashlights I mean it's no brainer you know why go lights out if you're trying to make a kid in there bad for those situations yeah a flashpoint it's gonna be you know you know also you don't have one or one one in it now they they also have their pros and cons flashlights torches head lamps summer hands-free like a some can be hung up like a lantern I mean new ways to adapt to make it hands-free or to have a diffuser such as shining your if you had a bottle of water you can shine your light into it it'll diffuse the light because water will kind of spread the way more simple bottle can be very useful in a blackout oh wow 90s and hurricane season yeah so you can kind of relate I've never been in a blackout for more than a day luckily but I've had my fair share of them from daytime to nighttime I mean it's pitch-black at night I mean hopefully there's moonlight but you know about the moonlight no no ambient or city or urban or town lights it's pitch black you cannot see anything it's a walking into a cave with no lights I mean I remember this one time in the lat and nothing ice blackout play or when the lights went out like the time before I went outside people were still watching around with the wait for some you know they're just walking in the door walking their dog in the dark or whatever I mean you know luckily it was during summer and not your on the winter goods you can easily if you can't see it from you you can easily you know well twist my ankle for example or you order those times when you think you're stepping on something you don't realize it's down lower then you make city misstep and you always trip something like that it's really grow welcome welcome thanks for dropping by glad you guys connection so you can check out this livestream let me just talking about walk out myself kids kind of how it happened why it happens you know and things that you can put inside to kind of smooth out that her role just keeps it happens yeah alright alright I'll keep an eye on the stream it should be fine i'm using on what the wreck Ethernet connections so it's not even Wi-Fi so I don't have any major link from using wireless and light latency is you know not the best let shouldn't be too bad so yeah coming back to the flash whites points are definitely gonna be safer than any flame source pretty much so it's less dangerous they'll put up the light you know it depends on what kind of flashlight have how long it goes for or how many batteries it takes you know varies for brand brand flashlight the flashlight off years before I go on as a side note if you're having issues with live streams and if you think it's on your hand remember you can tone it down because usually people will scream and as HD well you can downscale it to standard definition or maybe you know freeze 360 EP or 220 p so it'll help especially if people aren't showing you things that they're talking if there's only stuff you know you can change it but as long as you can either relatively and you know kind of see what I'm doing or showing and so let me kind of good good Drake would have all kind of mentioned it so partying a little bit here so yeah flash flash points light sources well pretty much anything that can you know yeah oh it's risky and drive like an LED now like I said there's always pros and cons to all this stuff you know the big pluses it's safe you can move it it doesn't get hot you can put it in pretty much any room anywhere you want you cannot do that with an open flame like a tea light or a little pillar or 3080 our camels it's there's certain places you won't be able to put them like in corner of a room up high you know you're probably not gonna do that with a tea light cuz you're gonna be like yeah it's too dangerous it's not worth it not worth the trouble wear something like a punishment yeah you could put it in the corner Oh angry in the corner lbc but probably the most well the major con is that you need power to run it and they are electronics are vulnerable to a certain degree to electromagnetic interference well for a lack of a better word they can fry so depending on the situation of the blackout you know the electronics might not be working maybe it's from a coronal mass ejection or Inc electromagnetic pulse so those things may not work they're good to have because like I said you don't know you may not know what cause look like oh wait you know you turn under flashlights you'll be like okay I got the flashlight on so it's not you know an EMP or a coronal mass ejection type of event so okay I got the flashlight so you know it's not that maybe it's been raining stormy out so then you're probably like okay maybe this is just you know a temporary for me it's just just up when I go powers just probably knocked out because you know pull went down or you know a transformer got boom so at least you would know that so I read this eyeshadow on what you guys are talking about real quick here well that's cool Bruce that's cool that's cool I'll kind of brush by dad for a little very shortly here oh that's cool okay then right you know you got some stuff that you can use just raise no flashpoints Nora wet truck which work lighting like crotch weights and lanterns and headlamp Pro we should also include wine up lights well that dynamo type of lights we're here well you're turning something or squeezing something to make well electricity where you're using solar you're you pointed out inside I mean those are great options especially some of the solar stuff just because during the day you can just set those out let them charge and it a lack of continues you have something from the nighttime and stuff like wine oil tank rank dynamo solar or good for supplement you're a kind of your kid you're blackout kid your lights out kit just because you know the power is kind of how do you say more renewable might not be as bright or last someone on a charge compared to you know a flashlight that you buy or a headlamp that you buy but you know they're good I have also I mean I got a few of those in my kids I've seen solar lights and I have around here I use all the time just because I use them to just say power and it's easier for me I don't have to you know turn a light just to you know use the washroom at night for example oh yeah I bet Bruce keeping the younger ones entertained you know for them it might be the first time and hopefully it's not the first time but for them it might be the first time they've seen power go out they're not used to not being able to do render device render smartphone's render you know gaming consoles TVs watch do this kind of stuff it interrupts them so you know finding stuff back to work for them like cards you know maybe if you're older your poker there's more games like you know monopoly for example those can be you know can pass by the time of course if you're in deck all night making stuff or whatever I guess you could probably make something while you're waiting for the power to get back on I mean for me I'm in the next power outage or when it happens again who knows what I'd be doing I might be parading maybe berating for the next night couple hours just to kill time or you know reading a book for example which is also another good think there's a read more comment sir and yes I did just time someone else so yes that has nothing to do what I'm talking about I'm talking about what I tell well I tell kid I mean it's not you might or want to put inside the reason why cause then stuff like that so as I read on here oh that's cool okay let's read what she said I have a tin I keep near mileage cupboard just in case one of the items and a wine a radial or torch Oh torches power bank for a mobile device manual ten Immanuel Immanuel Kant yeah okay young first-aid because you don't know what may happen especially in the in the Doric things can happen and when it was that I mean like you could trip slip it's just because you know you tripped over a shoe that's as you're going downstairs or whatever honey it happens it happens when it's yours light so I mean imagine entering the dark fine Alex I got it all under control yes organization important especially when it comes to preparedness cuz you want whenever you're preparing for whatever it is regardless if it's a hurricane from natural natural reasons to a car kid that just case you run hit the ditch in the winter it's minus 30 L or minus 22 Fahrenheit Alfre you American viewers regardless you want your kit to be organized pretty good and in way so it when you deploy it it's fast so you're not messing around with nards for example or messing around with blank Oh for some reason why tools are at the bottom of the bag for example in trying to prioritize things that you would need right away to have easier access to so and coming back around to the black belt or a lights-out kit these type of kits if you do make one you should probably put it into a very common area of your home so let's say kitchen maybe a living room right where you know someone might be too close by cuz obviously you know when the lights go out it's instantaneous everything just shuts off you know everything just turns flat you don't hear anything so you want to be able to kind of feel your way or try to find that kit that you made and then you know something as simple as having a flashlight or a torch or you know later with you on your person can help you in that situation because you Nate the lights that glow you have something on you to use to see so you can go find that light out kit I mean my the one I'm working on right now has like reflectors on and it's clear so I know what it is I have an in common area it's by a telephone sitting you know between the kitchen and the living room everyone knows where it is everyone knows what's inside of it you know and everyone knows that if you gotta use it go ahead and use it just reading what everyone sings on Sinai chant here and again joy Grove Road keeping a couple of torches flashlights torching flashlights it's the same word history in the UK or European keeping a couple torches or flash points and close the wounds in the house you know a punch beside bedside table and next to the front door I mean no it doesn't have to be expensive I mean there's buy quality as much as you can I mean people if the only thing you can get is those not only led type of three Triple A torches or flash ones no you know that's what you can get if you can get something you know that has better battery life maybe it's waterproof for example you know something like that might be more beneficial especially if you live in certain areas they're more vulnerable to power galell because of storms or tropical storms hurricanes stuff like that and as a side note I'm for driven growth here having even having a flashlight in the washroom it's important and then I mean if you've lived an apartment or have it downstairs type of washroom or whatever it's pitch black in there I mean no one knows when a black coat will come that's also a no one knows when it comes to mr. snow you know lead time for that but you would just say you don't want to be in a washroom that has no windows caught in the shower and the lights go out I mean most people you be like kind of panicking or freaking out because be like I got it you know because you can't see what you're doing see it's hard to get change you got a wipe like that water off you know put on your clothes and all that stuff so having a lighter and maybe some sort of torch or flashlight or a lantern in those washrooms are beneficial I think I mean you can have shampoo in your hair and be like oh I can rinse it off for me that torch that's you know just sitting right outside that shower the shower Oh lights window okay at least I can see when I do you know rinse help your hair dry off your stove and you know get changing you know head you know hello you know talk to people in the house and all that stuff oh yeah yeah that's that's good uh Bruce I hate just robot that he picked up a bunch of solar solar lights well solar yard steaks well solar lights aimless and using the way that a solar light can recharge battery to recharge a battery to use in a flash light or a torch for example oh yeah yeah keep one charge or one ready to go now like I said a bike held can happen at any time it's not always caused by severe storm and even if it was caused by severe storm sometimes it could be kind of you know if it was where I go during the night it's still happening at that they you know power has to come back some could be out or you know it's partly cloudy oh so you can get access to solar the harness that's solar power so just case it keeps going on this power outage you got you know some form of lighting or when it becomes dark again I mean I've never had a power outage during the winter so I've never had to light up an area for warmer than those 16 hours of darkness I mean during the day honestly you probably not be able to see inside for the most part I sit downstairs order a room without a window yes you're right Alex because I have a bunch of subscribers and I've known people from the UK so I kind of picked up these terms and I'm kind of been using torch and flash weight Lantern and I kind of more interchangeably but you know for the most part they mean the same thing at what trick light that uses electricity to power blade which is usually no mean LED oh yeah you're totally right about that Druce having a flashlight as an EDC item I mean I'm showing the one that I have on my keychain it's a stream light which I found out a little bit later but uses one battery I mean that's why I have with me all the time it's relatively close to me I don't wear that around my neck all the time but when I melt I do always have it or at least it's close enough by I mean something like a lighter without - so I'll give you two forms light one that's ran chemically by like fire and one that's Oh a trick and it's source or power so depending on what caused the white blackout or the lights to go out you know you might and we see our two options just case one doesn't work for whatever reason at least maybe get you somewhere safer more resources or an area that you know then have something you can use so coming back to the lights now there's another formal I needs thank some people you know no love I mean kids play around with them a wand when you have them glow sticks or chem-lights basically that's another reaction that creates illumination because of it they range from you know couple hours to you know maybe 12 hours a different size and in color as far as I know I think Green is supposed to be the brains for a glue stick or a can way and I think then it comes like Oh white and orange and I'm pretty sure red is not as bright now chem lights or glow sticks also have their pros and cons they can break prematurely which is bad I mean you don't want to be going for a clothes stick and find out that it's not working because it's already been broken and so the Illuminations are even spent and those Camel i'ts Argos 6 making their run time or brightness can vary depending on the ambient temperature I think if it's warmer it glows a bit too warmer like like if you stick them in water for example if you stick one in warm water it would actually start going writer but the duration or the run time would go down so now if you stick it in if it's colder like you stick it in ice water for example it's a bit dimmer and go for a little bit longer so have more iteration so if your house is getting cold you know or your place is gonna call those chem-lights of might not might not be as bright oh yeah exactly truth that's the point - I forgot to mention glowsticks chem-lights herb you know disposable and non-renewable you know there's single-use you can't start the reaction I mean you can't delay it or speed it up but you cannot stop it now like I said the littles I put their pros and cons you know con started its the disposable it's a disposable non-renewable and it's not as bright as flame on a candle or a flashlight but they are safe to use no fire hazard and then as long as we're working you crack them open you know you're gonna have some light you don't have to worry about recharging it but yeah single-use probably the most how do you say um the biggest con of it now as a side note there is some glow in the dark stuff I know I've never tried it I've seen videos on it but as far as I know those that stuff isn't as bright as it goes there but you know they're renewable but you need a know a light source to kind of charge them up you know might be good enough this readable way for example so yes anyone that's watching or watching those after it's been processed leave me and comment on things that you use for turning a black up type of situation you know is it a flashlight solar lights windup hand crank dynamo lights tea light candles tiller 50-hour type of candles or those kind of church candles learning in the glass for example they're right you know 50 80 hours do you use clothes sticks I mean personally I don't use glow sticks just because I just don't like night I don't like using single-use or disposable or non-renewable things I mean if I have to you know I have to just give me one sec here oh it's chicken was a quick message here oh okay apparently someone can't join this live stream live so they said they'll catch it later after right after it's been processed to check it up on that so hello to the person that's watching you later on or anyone else that's watching me later on now journey depending on how long black out or when the lights go out depending how long it goes for in the first I think four hours there are certain steps you probably should be taking such as gathering everyone into the same room especially if you're multiple family members or multiple like children or roommates so if you're you so you can utilize a single light source such as maybe you have a battery-operated lantern that runs on toward Tripoli's rate set that in a common area and everyone kind of revolves around it and one brings their stuff in to that common area such as a living room and besides because depending on the time of day historical well if it's white hoods we would be different by a bit storica security might be an issue and the cover of darkness things happen I mean people might you know try to utilize that time to do miss devious things or criminal activity so I was thing together you know not only keeps you kind of entertained talking maybe playing board games and stuff like that but it's also there's safety in numbers now I think for the first four hours let's say it's going from like four to like 89 hours or something like that you're probably don't have to deal with if it's cold outside I say it's happens during the winter now I've had been had a power outage during the winter so I'm not I haven't gone for that I've had them in summer in the spring in the fall but never during the winter oh my after the first four hours you may want to you know cover the windows maybe put something underneath it to prevent the draft and coming in is you know depending on how cold it is outside the temperature inside can start dropping so to the point where you might start seeing a breath inside now that's probably not cold enough to freeze your pipe to noon but you know give that under you know for eight hours the pipes might start freezing which because water when it freezes it expands you don't want to be popping a pipe in this situation like that you and you know pretty much after birth you know I'd say four hours you know you should be considering the water the heat in the place making sure maybe you know you're checking your taps and stuff like that yeah you're right Bruce glow sticks have trip there's a safe portable the reliability as long as they haven't been broke in pretty much you know they're reliable and because if they're just being disposable you know let's say you you know you gotta see inside something well you can throw a glow stick in something you might not do with like a flashlight or a light source like a lot like a lantern or an open flame like a tea like an oh that's great Alex that's correct I'm sorry to hear that you have some lanterns and some tea light candles and like I said if you're gonna play around with candles or how that make sure you have matches or a lighter like you know so you can get it started you know maybe how to lighters or stuff like that a Landers general because these kids are inside a place they don't move or they're not meant to be portable you know you can add you might as well put a lighter in verses matches for the same from December and that this legarre can fit all right instead of fitting a bunch of matches in this room I could fit later that I can get way more lights in terms of an open flame there we go you'll consider not clear but right color later so you can easily see it check the fluid level with like a light source or whatever so you you can take your weight and go like this and be like oh my my later is almost dead on this one you know so you can kind of be like take steps advanced deal with that yeah Bruce I'm like I said I didn't I've been in a blackout during a winter so I haven't had to try that out at least not in the scale then you know for duration I mean I tried to know but you know small scale maybe for a half an hour right for example but yeah those kind of flower pot years and stuff like that I tried one once before with a friend which is a single tea way yeah it's warm but it also has this because it's fire has the same dangers as fire so you know don't leave it unattended you know make sure there's something to put out the flames just in case like a fire extinguisher salt baking soda those kind of things will work you I have no idea what you mean about that Alex but I want my Qi hopefully your cheek and wait up the room for you ah I see what you mean funny funny funny dude if you can get that the word out so let's see where am I here um so yeah where it's glowsticks chem-lights fire like candles or a type of lighting that's powered by battery well that should probably is powered by batteries but it's you know rechargeable batteries solar hand crank dynamo whine up all those release lights now another thing I weigh dad into kind of a lights outdoor blackout kid is actually those reflective blankets usually known as a space blanket my are blanket there's lots of them around I tend to use your the cheap on the cheap dollars for one or you know the ones that I've shown on the channel was that I wait those those are renew reusable but coming back today because they're so reflective you could in theory I haven't actually done this in scale where I covered the wall with it but you could cover the wall and use it to bounce more light maybe some more heat around especially if you're in one common area with your family or roommates for example you know when you're trying to stretch your resources see you know when the when the lights go out or it's a barcode you might not know how long it's gonna be you know you hope for Oh you hope for it's just an hour order you know ten minute but it could go longer you're not sure especially if you're seeing things like it still stormy out or you know there's Blizzard owed you know considering that it Michael longer so coming back to the mylar or space blanket because it's reflective you can put it on the wall put it on the ceiling time you know kind of reflect more light around especially if you do only using a few or a handful of light sources so maybe you got a flashlight then run so on one trip away it went away or whatever and you decided to use it because the duration or the runtimes like 12 hours so you're like oh I'll use this and I'll conserve my headlamp for when I need it or you're using or and you're using any conjunction with like one TV camera for example having that kind of miler or flicking this around you can kind of make the room a little bit brighter especially if you don't have white balls like I do I play ball let's I know some people have you know gray walls or maybe you're in a room or whatever that has you know darker paint blue paint her brown paint for example you know with a single flash point in my room it's not gonna look as bright in comparison to her being in that same room but with white walls it because it bounces around a lot more oh it's a good couple more people dropping it I'm chicken all a little side Chad right here I sure wonder why I keep looking over is because I'm trying to read it too hey Mark thanks for dropping by bad and home render thank you for dropping by to just reading you guys comments real quick so I can kind of paraphrase and answer and know kind of same but I want to say anything's more thanks mark yeah like a blackout or when the lights go out and spread the moles likely common type of situation that can arise and it can be caused from many different sources like I said it could be caused from you know I'll watch electromagnetic pulse CMA Chrome pass objection to a free Thunder thunderstorm lightning wizard a blizzard or ice storm I mean I storms are well known for causing blackouts because power lines start to sag and with a well that connection well certain areas won't have power and depending on the whole extent of the damage you know recovery time might be from hours to days and if it's serious you know it might be weeks you know hopefully it's not that long hopefully it's just the ease have the balls you know your hope and one's always hoping that things will come back oh okay a home runner I talked about but best candles in my opinion namely I mean everyone has their own opinion but for me personally I generally prefer tea light candles or these pillar round you know there are two inch wide kind of 3050 8100 our candles I tend to go or shy away from these narrow dinner type candles or these kids it's because like I said these because it's so narrow and so tall it's easier to get knocked over and because you're using an open flame inside there's always the me that chance of fire and last thing anyone wants is to be in a blackout and a fire comes out of nowhere guys you know you're smelling the problems then shake flash wait I used to have one but I feel as far as I know they're not as bright as crank like move gears or squeeze light like in terms of those kinds of things I think these ones that they well they're dying about well they're all dying away the ones that crank like this I find are a little bit brighter because they'll squeeze like those squeezing little shake lights if you if you squeezing or shaking yeah you're adding power in right let's I find when you use like I hate are those ones them to have that you spin sure brought one out but it seemed like they grow no way I find with those you can kind of keep cranking them and make them brighter because your keep well you're still cranking you know in their arm position but that's for one I'd seen except you used lost no I thought I used a crank headlamp I mean crank light I think I was L with a couple friends out you know out in the countryside we were walking there was four of us you know I I had a my headlamp but you know I could just conserved it because I didn't know how long we're gonna be out there for and I was just interacting with a dynamo light and I've that's where I found out that if you keep spinning it it actually produces its maximum amount of brightness but as soon as you start cranking it Sun started using the powerful battery and generally speaking it's over those shake lights these solar lights these dynamo type of lights that you spit or the squeeze won't all will take a battery so if anyone tells you that they don't take a battery that's not true they take all of those take a rechargeable battery so if that rechargeable battery fails it's you know pretty much done unless you can you know replace it and as far as I know a lot of them take like a cr2032 or cr2016 type of battery by a rechargeable version of it yeah you're quite welcome home runner I'm problem improper and thanks for the questions guys really appreciate it I'll come back to what you just said about the hobo candles in a sec Bruce what seed mark says yeah yeah natural disasters are also well known for power grid disruption the Hurricanes took out everything from what I can understand power plan is someone the best in terms of realistic survival yeah yeah I mean it's one of the first few areas that I started in it when I started this they just you know for me it was just a natural way and I mean I've already gone through these kind of power outages luckily it wasn't long but you know I kind of be like you know it's not I don't have to you know trying to find something you know I'll plant it ahead in advance so it's in one common area and alt care you know lights out then I can type a kid in a common area like I said my kitchen dining room or living room somewhere where everyone knows where it is easy access you know maybe sense like tell kid or my little kid has reflectors on it is you not sure because when you're trying if you're when you're looking for it you might only have that EDC flashlight with you or you know you're trying to search for this kid with a lighter so any kind of reflection with reflection or something like that stands away bright yellow for example you know it some catcher I'm feeling okay that's what my clean cell kid or black elk it is okay you don't open it up you know wait up cold tea light candles you know and kind of go forever well Bruce um what's the same I've kind of used talking about real quick to the home writer and he generally prefers squeeze lanes over shake or wine or a crank style because they're one-handed operating you know what I then reads away with cordage again to change or to kind of modify like those wine of our krinkle dining will type of lights so you can actually you know use them with one hand that's worth cordage and I've shown something similar on how to get hands-free or when you do when you're a light source isn't hands-free I mean it's great to have a headlamp but not everyone has a headlamp especially when stuff like flashlights and torches are a little bit more common most people have that not everyone has a handle and well OH but yeah thanks Bruce yeah that kind of stuff I got that's the whole time I acquired and reflective tape is to be kind of I should actually I am gonna go get one the kids I have yet oh I told our Black Elk it with like different kind of kid right now right here I have in this plain old case just basically stuff that reflective trail marking team reflective type of tape and stuff like that so something like this and open it up a little you know you can put this kind of stuff on your kit it's still finder and as a side note this kind of stuff I would say a power or this power outage is even longer than you anticipate it you know you're going on the second third day stuff like this trail marking tape like most people know what's in their place they know always right and stuff like that but let's say you're only using a minimal amount white or or something like that you can put stuff like this or this like our corners or against the wall or our ground so you can kind of be like okay I know where I am you know kind of not getting lost in your own home and as an air side note I've shown saw before what the solar lights you can I show dit in that video but everyone knows what magnets are well this is a neodymium magnet this magnet came from a hard drive and for the most part this is where I acquired these neodymium a type of magnets is usually from a hard drive just because well I got access to them and usually they're spent not working the planner is not working or whatever so you know I use grant Mendes oh it's they're very strong for what they are but these depending on replace your home sometimes where some corners meet in certain places like they'll be the drywall but along the corner there'll be a corner of metal like it's steel so in theory use this later for example that corner couldn't have steel like to reinforce reinforce it kind of that corner so you can stick a magnet on today and hang your light source wash white I do this or light from time to time and hang it on a corner so it's hanging using magnetism so something I keep in mind no I don't keep these in in my blackout or white tough kid but I know where these are they're everywhere because I use them a lot I should I do think I have one hanging morena least magnet it's just sitting on the corner in this hallway beside me so I can put in as high as I want or as low as I want is like I said in terms of lighting generally people have lights up high and stuff like that so though the higher you can put a light and try to aim that light source down the more the ground you can see which is an air con for a candle is a candle because if this wasn't open if this was a candle all the white would be hitting up and not a lot would be aiming down where a simple flashlight you could just turn it one way and aim that light source for straight down so it's aiming where you need to see which is probably gonna be the ground anyway just not read what you guys are saying right here real quick yep yeah mark was talking about acquiring less solar panels yeah they can work I think you know for a general type of Monica that's usually you know caused by someone hitting a transformer or from power going out due to a storm thunder showers or ice storm yeah so we're sores that might not be useful and of course they can pack and depending on the extent of the solar or the berry-berry bank or and stuff like that you might be able to power out or recharge a phone for example because sometimes even though the grids person it's blackout or glides are out in your area you might still have mobile coverage on your you know smart phone but that's not always guaranteed oh you know they check up on news and stuff on it and that comes back to having like an emergency radio with it too so I mean you can pick a broadband and stuff like that I mean I brought down a short shortwave so you can hear news reports and stuff like that because clearly you're not unless you got a UPS an interrupted power supply and it's powering both you know a computer and you know your modem and slash router your prying nothing get info from a TV or over there or from internet now I do and of course your if you have a landline at home you know a cordless phones probably not don't work and lasts without some sort of UPS if you have a corded phone those can still work had those times so you can still kind of call out using a landline what cortical but lots of people don't have corded phones I think I keep one in that Inn around here just as a backup backup just in case I mean for the most part and like everyone else who's Corliss fault just because it's more convenient poor more poor well more mobile [Music] all right Kay thanks for dropping by I always appreciate people dropping by my live streams and checking out my content so peace out - Kay oh oh would make Alex the magnets are just so I can I hear two different surfaces around a place so you know for example I can hang with a strong magnet I can hang a flashlight order the fridge for example orbits though you know those vents over a stove and stuff honey you know I can hang a weight off of that oh yeah you guys are kind of talking about power banks for a little bit no everyone's come knows about these power banks that fit in your pocket but there is other things that can work such as your laptop a laptop it's pretty much you know a very expensive very it usually and heavier but and can be used as a power supply or like a very bank because you know generally speaking those laptops all have USB on them so you can have you know at least USB power and USB power as well five volts 5 volts power interpretate so 5 volts of power to you know recharge a cell phone maybe recharge battery especially if you have a USB charger I could be used as a way to actually run lights like directly like so you plug in a USB lighting well and you turn that when i'm tom from something you might not be using there's something that can you know give you light for a little bit of time now if you're gonna use a laptop for as a battery bank now most likely you're not going to be doing work or checking out something online per se during a situation like that so you probably don't be conservative every so another way to conserve battery on a laptop especially if you're using it to power up devices or recharge devices so you can get the maximum amount of recharge recharge cycles or duration of a light that you plug into the USB is to um try not to boot into the operating system I know it's a little kind of more technical but because every time you run into the operating system on a laptop you're you don't be using more power so I'll leave that as a different video and I'll kind of show that off I know some I know some times and these laptops or desktops you can still power a power up power a device or reach her to device even in standby you know if you can't do that you know do it if you can't you know boot into safe mode and that's a more button boot into like like keep it on screen like that lack of a better word a DOS mode or the pre operating system menus and stuff like that as soon as you boot into your operating system for example if you're running Windows or Linux it's not you know use a power to you know keep your applications and your startup thinking so you know you can see power just by not run running getting to that menu or getting to your startup screen where it boots up [Music] transformers as long as I know they overpower and they get overpowered I mean you know short of someone hitting it I mean that's what it's okay that can happen I guess especially during the winter it will ease control you hit a transformer don't sell power to like to like ten square to cobblers phonetics like five hours just because well that transformer is more important than you think or the area I mean depending on how localized the blackout or the power outage is Frank you might be able to go awake you know let's say an hour dry I get to a place that has power I mean that's an option I guess I won't get into that too and just like how I said to Bruce that I will get into this kind of with tens candles whole rocket stoves I'll kind of get into that just a bit here just trying to catch up to the live chat here or hi chat whoo you oh you're quite welcome or I mean it's something for me I just kind of take down by my unite especially nowadays well may mean you know 10 12 what see it's 2018 when st. 10 12 years ago you know that everyone had but nowadays you know how everyone's got something like that if it's not a smartphone its whole app talk it's not a laptop it's gonna be a tablet so yes I mean that stuff helps and for the most part if your if your laptop is 100 percent usually that's enough power to bring over you USB power for quite a bit of time especially if you like try not to boot into the operating system didn't display you know pretty much not do any work okay and pretty much just use it as a battery bank or or something like that home runner I do not have a generator yet mm-hm you know I could see generators being used maybe day later after the first 24 hours we've probably died at that time depending on the season a bit to Maternity you can adapt something but it's summer your food's going like the food in the fridge it's gonna start getting warm the food in the freezer will start following a little I mean you're probably still have good nerve 36 24 36 hours for that especially if you don't open your fridge or you know open up the freezer a lot so you know in terms of if you have to eat you know probably eat the fridge Nance you eat the stuff that's in the fridge first because that's more most likely to go bad first you know in reserve can't frozen and ready to eat stuff for you know maybe a little bit later you know and try to do some things that expire a while next fire but can go bad first because I know when I go a little capping a clerk and keep something cold for quite a bit of time but usually it's because you're not opening it a lot or if you do you know you grab what you need close it right away and usually that's in a shade cupboard and stuff like that thank you can depending on if you feel the need for it and depending on how long the power outage has been going for your fringe it's probably not don't have power unless you know you got some UPS or generator trying to power it up or solar you got some money to acquire that much solar power so no I heard of people covering the fridges and stuff like that I've never had to resort to doing that yet but you know maybe after the first let's say 12 hours 12 24 hours a day of being the dark or without lights or power yeah I'm probably not considered I I try to keep that cold in as much as I can like I love learning in terms of like a fridge is that I keep an order inside my fridge just so even if the power to go out since from the fridge is full there's a lot more cold in there in terms of light milk liquids like water maybe it's orange juice or whatever and liquid will stay cold longer then just the air itself if that makes sense yeah as far as I know brews it's like my twice twice the to twice as much whole teacher leave yeah you need 20 cents much power in the beginning to start it up so it's something that it's like a thousand watts probably means at least two thousand watts as far as I have heard like I don't have a generator I've ever had to run the fridge with external power supply so I'm not familiar with it but one things I've read seen and stuff like that oh yeah yeah Bruce yeah that's good keeping nice that's good Mike for me it's winter obviously too winter here in the northern hemisphere proud you know in North America Europe and stuff I die so you have access to snow you know maybe maybe not per se bring the snow in you might you know leave certain things outside or if you do decide to bring it in you know you put it into the fridge or the freezer right away so just because in situations like that if you bring the snow in Doug oh you know keep your food cold you're gonna do it quick because since the snow comes in it's not draw heat from the inside to start melting it so when you do it or if you decide to do it you're gonna do it quick you know maybe grab a cooler dump a bunch of snow inside cover it bring it inside and ditch that snow into the fridge or freezer ASAP and close the fridge right away and maybe covered fridge to prevent any of that kind of heat that you're generating inside from like candles maybe you know maybe it's colder inside than you think I think you're used to you know you don't want to be melting us know before and you know melting snow and getting it watery and and doing the work that you wanted to do which is to keep your food cool I think that makes sense so I just got some type of moment here I'll come back to what Bruce and Alex kind of set about tins and kind of like mobile stoves like yeah you can use a tin not specifically this but you know you can like you can do with cats to like make a sweat down the middle open it up like a butterfly stick a key went inside so you can have some sort of lantern Lantern for example hope we'll still so rocket stoves to be used for cooking purposes it's generally you're not going to have access to your microwave stove you may have access to natural gas or propane but if you don't you know you might have to heat water boil water melt water especially if you don't have the right or you know your supply of fresh water is going down and you need to boil order no bought ice snow for water to just cooking all right eventually you got to eat you know you've already had that all the produce in your fridge you know you get eaten all the fresh stuff ready you're all your worthless frozen stuff dry stuff canned stuff I mean maybe ready-to-eat stuff no and maybe like I said maybe you gotta already ate that ray the ghost ray to eat stuff or or that fresh kind of produce type of stuff that doesn't need cooking personally to eat so you know you're gonna start heating up a can cooking dry stuff or cooking I'm falling out some frozen stuff so you're not need to heat it up so something like a rocket stove a hobo stove those kind of camping type of stoves that you can get they use like propane stuff like that can be used to cook your food or boil your boil or heat up your water now those kind of things you're gonna remember because they are burning something you need to make sure you do it in ventilated area if you have enough that's a garage you know do it in a garage you know if you have to do that in or do that on a balcony for example so you know especially if you got something like a barbecue you know probably not done bring that inside well you know click on that cook outside it's because it's your burn burning something and creating a flame there's gonna be stuff I just have to worry about like carbon monoxide and stuff like that so you know if you do use it and you're gonna use an inside trying to you know maybe for example you have a window I'd say yeah this is the window and you know you're in the kitchen trying to block out that area with like garbage bags maybe painters drop sheet anything and that can block the wind and kind of make like a cooking area right there in the corner you know maybe it's your kitchen near the sink but the windows slightly open that way when you're cooking something you it's you have ventilation still because the thing is if it's grit grit down why why I like to go out it could be during the winter and you know it's cold outside and you don't so you closed off the windows you you know sealed all the cracks just to keep the heat in so the last thing you want is to kinda fall asleep and kind of hassle to because of carbon monoxide it carbon monoxide poisoning I mean it happens it's that sign silent killer you just kind of get drowsy and full of sleep and you're not getting back up I mean I've seen around my local local area on the news and stuff like that but people perishing because of carbon monoxide poisoning so it's a very serious for it and you know if you have like smoke I should come back to that but do you have smoke detectors or a carbon monoxide detector detectors especially they don't run on grid power you know they run on 9-volt battery or whatever you know I have them nearby so you can have an indicator like for example if you're cooking in the kitchen everyone for family members and clean yourself are all in the living room alright have the smoke detector bye you guys so just case how it happens you have an indicator that oh right aquiline candles burning uncontrollably or if you're cooking yeah back carbon monoxide detector so if levels get too high you get a warning so you'd be like oh I should ventilate this area more into too much smoke or covered monoxide in inside [Music] oh yeah yeah alcohol stoves - I mean hand sanitizer can work it's not as about alcohol contents not as high as some IRA stuff that's like 70 90 % like in a jam it can work as as far as I know it's like 30 mils of hand sanitizer can go through it up to 15 minutes but as far as I know because I've tried it and I tried it in my area and I live up north a little bit more than something you guys don't look down self in the US and stuff like that that's not enough to boil one cup of water for me so 15 30 mils of 15 15 minutes of burn with hand sanitizer is not enough to boil one cup of water it gets it hot enough to me my tea with but it's not close enough to the boil and without any more fueling more heating Alex it depends on how cold like remember it's tell me dark regardless right but cold might want to learn to be instantaneous that it's not me like I would say it's 32 degrees Fahrenheit out or zero degrees Celsius though your place is not gonna drop in temperature that fast now if the temperature outside is like minus 30 Celsius or 122 degrees Fahrenheit because the difference between hot and cold is greater your place is gonna cool down a lot faster than in comparison if it was at 32 fahrenheit or zero degree Celsius out neither day so I mean if you had to know I probably went quite doing away I know drum was a whim I probably if you know try with candles and stuff like that first and coming back to that when your remember remembering that smaller areas mm-hmm in terms of shelter or Eid heat up faster or easier so let's say if it's cold out during this kind of blackout lights out you know temperatures falling inside you know you know you only have tea lights whenever or candles as heat you know you know you don't have any access this space heater or you're in your apartment so you can't kind of laid up something bigger kind of the keep the space small as possible to small areas heat up faster than bigger areas and smaller areas are a little bit easier to light up especially if you use you know my Lars a Mylar type of reflective space blanket now bounce some heating light around because I'll come back to this again a dead drop the drum yes and some BB like printing this is one address it's gonna be big in the living room yes you're not getting on to heat from and if it's you know minus 30 inside your place you know you're gonna do what you got to do but I would say it's warmer or whatever probably not as needed but an earthing is you know from such a big fire for example if you actually did that now I'm not suggesting anyone make a big fire in their place begins to had dangers of a fire itself it's done you know quite serious but you can instead of having one big fire you can maybe like that's the size of let's say 50 gallon barrel for example you can probably tone it down to you know more smaller ones cuz yes I do know that a big drum is pregnant I'd give a lot to eat but you're not run through that fuel you're using inside even faster it's generally bigger bigger the more heat that's liberated in a fire the quicker you're not go through that fuel it applies here on earth and upon eyes out in space with like stars and stuff like that if you go through the fuel faster yeah it's gonna be harder but it's not that lasts as long and you're going to have to resupply that fuel for it eventually and eventually fuel does run out so yes Alex I probably would go awake with like depending let's say if you had a four people make kind of make something in the living room like even if it's gonna be like a tent you set up in the living room now you know that's ready to go kind of shelter well inside and you can set up easily and it you know it's not that hard to do and lots of people aren't gonna have access to it like a tent all right you know maybe you're making kind of like a a couch type of fort or something like there I mean if you're gonna do that well you know do that any you want to keep that he didn't I tried to keep the light inside it was depending on the situation okay especially if it's gone for more than 12 hours maybe it's a you know day to day three of this black out you know you might want to consider blacking out your windows you know after there's 72 hours I mean like if things are just don't haven't come back to normal people may get desperate you know and they see oh hey I see Wayne over there they might have stuff that I can use tea light candles or batteries or whatever right so I can't let the windows kind of makes you myself a target because you know if you see you like if you're desperate be silly you know you might try to do something just because you know there's something there hey it's peeping hey I'm excited because peeping eggs in she always cracks me up and I just had to say that and I think I'll start with the egg jokes for now hi peeping hang so yeah as quick recap we've been talking about black out kids might settle type of kids things you can do things to keep in mind even items that you might have around or useful in situations like that of course no one knows how long these workouts go for so you know use them your own best judgment all right I mean if your place is starting to get cold because it's - Tony Allen you know maybe consider waiting on more candles maybe fire up a rocket stove over some sort of heater now remember these like any flame sources you probably should have kind of mentally very every so often maybe crack a window wait and stuff like that maybe it's you know one maybe one room the doors cracked open slightly alright let's say it's a yeah and once in a no moving room your wife your two kids you know maybe it's two daughters alright and once in the winter room right trying to stay together see safety in numbers and stuff like that one one light might light up the whole area enough for I wanted to do something like read write draw buried in my case and I'm gonna make what's called a spaceman you can draw an arrow from so let's say it's your daughter's room you can crank the window just open just a little light on the door you crack it just a little so air can flow so you're not getting kind of stale air inside or a lack of oxygen in the sound but the cold will kind of stay in that room a little bit longer well the rest of the room or the way room that you're staying in won't get cold just because that windows open if that makes sense I'm peeping I've asked people to kind of me you know your thoughts about it what you you've experienced what works for you you know what kind of stuff do you keep on hand for a situation like that from chem light and chemical type of lighting such as fire or some things that illuminate like glow sticks chem lights like that I know you know it's electric type of lighting usually with batteries which also includes like solar and crank dynamo wind-up type of lights or torches oh wow oh wow beeping me I remember one time we had troubles with the thermostat here and just say that's the cool I've never had it it was a power outage it's actually you know a technical thing but what you say it got really cold inside pretty quick for amount of time I think it was couple hours maybe well but outside temperature wasn't bad cold out but inside temperature did fall below mice well below 50 Fahrenheit or +10 and once around that plus 9 plus 10 range in Celsius for development 4750 preparing you can start seeing your breath and if you start seeing your breath inside you know it's time to get cold you know when you pray you should take steps to kind of stay warm well this black what's going on it's usually what happens it's like I'm where I go starts to introduce earthlings like now you know you've already gotten the lights out lights out kid you have lights and you can see stuff but then there's things to deal with like shelter because your current shelter is not good enough so you gotta enhance and make your shelter even better meet the heap area and of course water and food eventually you're gonna do it use it hmm oh hey it's not a deep ramping I thought you I kind of mentioned you earlier I saw I saw your message real quick I didn't read it all but I kind of find you weren't coming in okay that's cool that's cool so welcome to the art of prepping welcome into my life's true or I'm just talking about kind of black out of light cell type of kids you and I you know I saw your video that you did well last week right at this time last week so I figured you know I kind of talked about it talk about things you know I know extra in it I've gone through you know minor power outages just that last couple hours - I think the longest one was like six or seven hours never had one during the winter I've had once turned summer of course you know and I've had power outages from in the day at night after midnight three o'clock in the morning what stuff I die so I'm just talking from experience I would say where was I oh yes shelter so yeah after yet take care of maybe the heat and lighting for you know four day rain mm-hmm you probably want to consider shelter especially if it's cold out like if it's summertime you know you're probably not have to deal with heat in terms of like humidity I turn the winter your pond I had to eventually deal with the cold somehow some places he can keep heating for longer but some places you know once they the furnace goes down you know it's not a cold in like you know where where your seen your breath and shivering working like you know next two hours for example so shelter is a big thing after that it's keeping kind of everyone in one squad michael abreu keeps all that heat to go especially views make the space smaller like using a tent maybe you're using a I don't know tarp garbage bags contractor bags draw up sheet it stuff like that kind of makes a microclimate the small areas will warm them I'd keep warm for a little bit longer I so you're using maybe you can say using like five candles to heat up area you know one using wine for example and of course st. agur their safety numbers that's also late you know during things like that certain things don't work you know your home security you know by now works on the power outage so you know safety could be an important especially depending on the neighborhood and depending you how on this kind of power outage has something gone for been going for four oh wow two weeks I don't think that's a long time the goal without power but I mean it depends where you live some places have experience in or often or for a longer duration some people they've only experience like ten minutes which is you know dropping a bucket not even worker flake at the time it took Tilly bring out everything [Music] you you mmm garrison yeah coming back to that heater heaters have you gotta use heaters you could have ventilate that area that you're in I mean even if it's opening one window in a different room and cracking door open so it'll kind of arrogant circulate but you're not really you're kind of delaying or trapping that cold air from invading the rest of the house to their rooms or to the room that you're staying in currently wait kitchen maybe a living room I mean a little more autonomy ideal place it's big enough there's a lot of things there and you know most people already know everyone we have like tell CH is still finances like you know you can lay that on the ground for example like the cushions and use it as a kind of insulation to the ground and most people you know have blankets and stuff already so you know you curl up in there maybe stay together with like with your friends or roommates or family you know and try to keep all that heat contained hey it's amber and John homestead and and um hello amber can keep her dropping by I always appreciate you guys dropping by means Olamide comes up no I'm not heard about that hammer can you kind of elaborate on that I mean like right now oh yeah yeah coming back because one of the things about the shelter and our purpose said you know it's had to use a tent before I mean attends just a ready-to-use kind of shelter I mean of course not everyone has a tent let's not find out or maybe it's not big enough you know maybe you have a single tent but you got family member so they can all fit inside so you might have to adapt or improvise or additionally use stuff like contractor type of garbage bags drop sheet stuff like that my my where reflective space blankets it reflect the heat and kind of reflect the light around so you can kind of see a little bit more see the ground better retain more of that heat because you know it's nice 20 oh and your place is starting to cool down and stuff I died [Music] you you on your life onion top flooding I think it's about once a month slicing telephone without right I think I heard about that on the news I think that's kind of one Amber's talking about and well as I'm just thinking also there's a big magnitude eat off the coast of Alaska okay I see so yeah if you can kind of plan make some preparations and prepare for a blackout a kind of kid are with a with a blackout kid or a light so kid this kind of kid can be used and anytime toits or the grid goes down regardless of what causes it I mean this could be just from amber talk about an earthquake I mean like journey during times I'd those grids down because power lines are down right your your place that you're staying in you know might be safe you know it's China reinforced made with more modern materials using concepts that are more useful in earthquake type of situation so it's more stable the roots not that caving or anything like that so you know an earthquake can cause a blackout I want well actually a lot of things can cause Morocco floods hurricanes tornadoes but usually that kind of stuff also has you know structural damage to from two homes buildings car and stuff I know yeah I mean most from what the are prepping said I mean like you're probably not had to sleep on the floor now depending on situation depending the one furniture you have you know you can use some of that furniture to kind of make like oh wait as a kid you might have been oh my god couch fort you know using the cushions to make a fort for example well you can kind of apply that a situation like this if you ran through it you know maybe you're using let's say you know you got you and your wife and your two kids for example use an epic that's I know one more person here has that situation well let's say your wife two daughters right you can use like the mattresses and it's kind of like wall additional walls extra insulation something more comfortable to pressed on you don't try to get off the ground I mean the grounds probably don't get colder than you know then just a foot or two feet above it the grants probably not get cold fat fast quicker you know because it rises and usually cold air sinks down stuff you know get off the ground you know it applies in the woods and probably would apply here too so you don't have that conduction loss so much just to add with the sweeping banks and the wool blankets to the are prepping nerfing you can do is if you have access to way to heat it well like stuff like hot hands hand warmers hot water bottle heaters they can all kind of give you some heat without uh- are the cons of using fire such as carbon monoxide fire hazard and stuff i die i mean those hot water bottle heaters I mean I had to do that before once over at my friend's place dad power but for some reason their furnace wasn't working I need to use a - we are volatile but we had access to still some you know like blows up some water buttons could be a rocket still maybe some propane heater or you know our propane type of stove barbeque you're boiling up that water you bring it inside store that heat from the flames in the water and keep you warm for you know more hours more time it kind of delay the onset of the heat loss you know the heat losses to me are going until the furnace comes right around until you know the Sun comes back out or until you know maybe two days later it's +10 old or 50 Fahrenheit out again in comparison to what it was earlier - 20 0 degrees Fahrenheit so yeah I mean I had to do that before and the friends place a 2-liter bottle I mean it it helped I mean get my few nice more I'd point consoling you know I you could see the breath inside I mean it was cold it was minus 20 oh and that's it Celsius so yeah it was cold and you know you're expecting to be warm inside and yet you're not just give me suck us just reading them on your guys's chance right here Keith I am NOT I'm kidding to the chemtrails not getting into that not on this Lystra mean was the story that you guys are kind of getting ideas considering planes maybe maybe you know making improvements mentally going through it mentally you maybe for the next time I mean it's still winter here in North America so still plan your time to get cold yeah I probably shoulda turned on the slow-mo for this yeah whatever that's kind of read it was just kind of keep going oh that's awesome peeping Hank of course no one likes power-out it is because the Wi-Fi goes out [Music] yeah you're gonna be careful with candles in the tent Oh like I said well in the beginning of the livestream when I was talking about it with candles because the fire hazard is always gonna be there as long as it's burning it's always gonna be dinner so you know I have water nearby have it contained swimmingly off the ground this candle like I said have water nearby I mean I've shown off video I have an ER video where I've shown the store like a tea light candle in like a metal container well a wider one this could be a bowl a wider one for example stick that is well put some water in it and stick your tea light candle inside so even if it gets tipped over if the water might be able to put out the flame and as everyone knows water does not support combustion and usually it tends to you know cool down the heat of the fire let's say [Music] yeah oh I would still start prepping that again yeah what but the thing is some a lot of the times unless you buy a place with one in there it's gonna be expensive to put a new or new one in I mean if you've got have money yeah but not everyone has that option because you also need a chimney and stuff like that you gotta tear down walls open up the ceiling open up the roof I mean you saw yes but it's not cost you some time in a pretty penny for it [Music] but even if you can't get a wood stove inside I'd say you got an a garage you can put that in garage just house I wants the yelling in the garage [Music] and so awesome peeping and then you kind of know what I mean about hot-water heaters I mean I find if I got if I use them I know it's serious enough to use them that the situation justifies me doing it right now but when I do use them I'm always glad after hobby like it's so warm you know I'm not shimmering anymore or you know I'm a food gold of you when I'm on my feed and some stuff on it and trying to keep my core body temperature warm um lotta prepping what do you burn another I'm a big tree expert I mean would you use a pine spruce cedar what else is there poplar yeah I mean I'm just curious I said I've seen a nerve video boats one of my subscribers talking about waiting for burning purposes and some are better than ours some get you a coal faster or coal stay longer some spit some don't some take longer to get going somewhere you know once it's if it's dry it's gonna go like magic I'm just curious yes everyone what wants me to move now itself so you know if you wanna don't need something like a place to stay in a flight ticket you know I'm I'm doing for dad I'm just kidding don't have to do that well yeah darn perfect I mean the candles intended I mean it's not just kids could be patents to cats I mean cats you know how how it is and what anyone done seen parents I mean you you seen the novel or something accidentally or running in something or it could be like something as simple as I was like you know they go up to drip and drip holes and it hits the candle or whatever and be like yeah hard to make things better not worse [Music] welcome back amber you know learn probably kind of brought up something here about he said I've heard of soldiers using MREs MRE mean meal is ready by the way these heaters that they use just keep warm I mean like I can totally see that it's probably no different in terms of in comparison to like hand warmers the reaction might be slightly of a different nature but the result is still seen or Excel format type of reaction which means releasing heat to the outside I mean with those kind of hand warmers blondie warmers you know and stuff like that mostly it's you know pretty much the reaction is iron resting so when it comes in contact with oxygen we kind of liberate well that liberates but it's a reaction that releases heat as part of the reaction xo4 Rick now because of that because it relies on oxygen if you removed on if you put it into a container let's say I want to use this as an example but it's a little small but and it does have yes seal but those containers from the dollar store that have the latches as I've tried it before on windows because these hot hands use oxygen to time that's reaction to you know release the heat if you ruin the reaction stops now you won't get any more time out of it if it's twelve hours into me up to twelve hours but let's say for example you're using this in combination with hot-water heaters you're using one that's twenty up to twenty hours you might not need all that heat all for the next 20 hours so you might space it out more say for like four okay two days for 10 hours if you seal it so it's away from oxygen that reaction will stop until you introduce more oxygen air back into the system again coming back to those from the dollar from Dollar Tree I feel I can get them here in Canada - in airplanes to play those ones that have clapped oh yeah the clasp on them or whatever then that's the word I'm working for well you guys know what I mean so those things but I have one right here when it's this right here I've actually used this the seal hand warmer and used it seven days later so something like this is quite useful and I kind of explained it before in the winter or cold live-streamed and I did I talked about cold in winter so my guys just found out I've seen videos on it I tried it for myself like last year at this time and you know it worked I'm pretty sure we don't get oak up here in Canada always not in this area usually it's still poplar spruce pine it's one we have here you I can you know about the clothes heaters I've but I'm already heaters I could because usually they use in conjunction with the water to boil the water or steam up the water so I mean I've never had an MRE heater but you know I could probably see me using it in conjunction with when we go walk water to make a water heater that our department can usually mean comment on King those heaters can they be submerged in water those Emmer MRE heaters can they be submerged in water so for example can I take one submerge it into a ball over that can you know fit it and you know heat up the water with it and use it as a heater so I don't burn myself but it's still hot enough you you oh okay okay um oh oh I bet I bet you I know that working that wasn't hard we'll be talking about what's it called uh what's it called calcium carbide isn't it listen what what's its called it's Irene they used to use it for lanterns and for in caves before you know the introduction of electronic lighting such as you know bulbs recruiting led why I'm pretty sure it's called Kelson carb I know testing carbide or I'm trying to beret its reaction with water it kind of reminds me of it it might be similar or the same thing so maybe you know in terms of sleep makes I know I recently acquired of 30 Fahrenheit zero Celsius egg before so but you know the works remembering isn't it usually the more expensive it is the lower the temperature you can go down but you know you can still get you know relatively cheap Bank like add insulation it and more later is in which you know might include open I did reflective mylar space pointed stuff like that yeah okay yeah I have figured you might know I just remember innings can sit reacts with water it produces light you used to use it in caves and stuff like that I know it's a chemical reaction I just cannot remember in now without searching for it and I'm done cheat just to look it up I'm win wine getting someone something like that it's that reacts with water to create there's something like that so I'm in mind something like that in the next minute or two here while you guys for watching here I in the school because I'm live-streaming obviously I can't pause so I gotta take care of something real real real right really quicker so I will be back in just like leave my static image on until I return you you you okay I'm back alright I went to go use the washroom in go go wait so black I'll kick on I'm currently working on right now so right here I know luminance is not sponsoring me by whatsoever I I figured I use this luminous type of case which actually contained six LED bulbs inside our friend gave this to me I figure I'm like oh you know some makes a great light it's okay it's clear so I can see everything inside I mean luminous on it I mean I flicked it right here triangle sign of it is peeping angst early in her I'm assuming so so why don't I kind of talk you guys can leave comments now in the side chat on what do you use has caner the store you're the kind of blackout kid or a lights okay I mean generally speaking these are items for kind of plugging in and you would tend to use it when the lights come over so I just don't show off a few things that I have inside or show up kit in different video later on but I'll probably update this again there's a few things I keep inside they're not very expensive quite common you get them at the dollar store said you know I got I can take that 17 tea light candles in here night tea light candles are up to four hours when I usually half that and say two hours slow 17 times two is 54 so that's well 34 hours old single one light over that time and you know since it's not always dark let me dark you know that might stretch out to you know two or three nights and of course like I said about the mylar space but I get emergency work like the boy bit to keep whining sorry so I have this great ability dedicated for this kid I can put that on the wall reflect some light heat around especially if I'm trying to make him Michael climate oh yeah yeah I almost forgot thanks I almost forgot about that she said that too and I forgot about it Dan couple inside keep inside our you know why nope torch useful that's on sometime some you know I once thought we're trying star still working on me he'll still give me light for quite a long period of time without the need to have to recharging it through solar or finding any complaining a battery charger but the only downside is that they don't last that long in terms of reaching all the light I mean it might kind of look right right now but that I'm getting down all the time he's gonna keep hand cranking over squeezing it every you know every so often half-hour of course I keep lighters and have the he light candles or the candles the whole later like there's nobody better in this case than matches because for the same on its face that the lighter tink so you you know when you're gonna get like you know I had four matches so let's do ten matches I have one later thank you well you know you know maybe a hundred candles now when everything they keep in this one is a very type of bank on the dollar store they uses two double e's to generate that five volts of power so I keep this in here so I can run like lights maybe eater a small one but pretty much it's four lights and you know emergency type of recharging of us smartphone I mean I have her battery bank start and yellow 6010 tells me labs but this is just dedicated for this kid and to go along with that if I can get it in I always have a USB light with it so it's paired with it it's kind of break so I got that light source ready to go and of course because I have this as a USB type of light I can take advantage of stuff that outputs USB power such as for example laptops a laptop it's a good kind of thing that while a device one a piece of gear that you might a compiete most people have that you can utilize the USB power to run like a light like this and this was very easy I made it kind of today to myself but you could get it like lights like these that can be used I took one of those and kind of extended it use the USB cable from a different device so now it's a little bit longer or so I get some link so I can hang it up high on the corner of a ceiling on the corner of the room for example and of course I keep a whole bunch of batteries since not that when you can spot that I store batteries have battery stored in different spots and then and a main supply of batteries so if I got a dip into it I can't but this is just so you know it's better and it's with it already so I don't have to hunt for it or at least not yet you know and see pie now another thing I keep is Wendy's kind of you is DC to USB type of adapter usually generally for a car with the cigarette lighter adapter basically this is just so maybe I can in put it in like 12 or 9 volts of power in get 5 volts out that rechargeable device or power of a light and if I still have access to a vehicle or whatever I can use this it's way to you know get power to power up a device recharge battery power up myself a smartphone for example so I keep that in here I also keep a flash wing slash torch in here a wine of color wine of white that's a little bit different it's an action but one that I found for free and it's a little bit of cordage rate to go so if I gotta hang the lights over whatever you know I can depend on these are very kind of generic tip lights should be fairly easy to acquire if you're talking about the USB one bad USB one I hacked and kind of modified it so it's no longer well-liked so the cables longer so like I said so I can hang it up on like the corner of a rumor for example now this kind of blackout or wait till he is not going by any means and of course this is including water you know food is generally if you're in a black old or white cell type of situation you're probably bugging in and staying at the same food and you know defending your own home personally when I wear this one not to kind of ready to use it kind of batteries these are returnable ones and then schools with a flashlight that I have cuz I don't keep batteries inside just you know avoiding unnecessary discharge or corrosion of the batteries just like I said I have a lighter inside right away so you know I can use this like T like an old and get to work yeah I guess it would help if I should put everything back into the kid so I've been actually been thinking of adding me like a glow-in-the-dark star on the outside just so you know maybe I have life EDC flashlights with me and I'm trying to find and you know maybe I'll stick a little bit longer you know and stand out a little bit will endure for a little bit of time no I didn't uh I didn't really see how to post like that uh startup repin and it Rosie had that kind of host unfortunately I don't forget the watch every last video and sometimes I do miss so just because you know I'm away which actually I was the last few days so I was away trying to catch up on everything so yeah this handles like it I mean like it's clear so I can see everything inside not sure what I'm not a dorm not change it but you know probably think I rattle a few things that I could do oh yeah yeah yeah I've been considering that I mean wake up I got a triangle on the other side that's bright yellow and reflective stuff but I think more importantly instant you know everyday carry a flashlight and over here two easy ways to have a light source with you all the time you know for the most part you probably lose that flashlight first but for those times or for that time that you know the flashlights dead broken you know not charged or and you know it's a EMP type of event got that later so I can still see where I'm going and find this kind of light soak it then you know go from there I'm like you know I'm been picking up at glow sticks and maybe larger type of heater one of my hot hot candles and I say here I might add some dedicated type of cordage in that reflective mylar space blanket I can time you know hang it a little bit spring it a little bit and stuff like that maybe make a two tent out of it or like I do just things I've been keeping in mind so yeah probably after dislikes my whole point but some of that reflective tape on I mean I mean stuff like that maybe a lot had i cant't or something like that I mean like I said I keep IRA batteries too I I keep our lights - I usually - all the time especially when I'm biking so I have access to those - this is just kind of like you know I'm not at home someone else is at home this they know you know and you know I've had all the lights with me because I'm liking or whatever this stuff stays at home so I may know where it is so power goes out you know you know go grab this first there's gonna be lights candles well a heater once I put it in tea light candles for lighting a layer to played in a little batteries flashlights wine and wide so you know hopefully they don't want to like get back or until my power comes back on now there's a few additional things that I've been thinking of putting in which includes dedicated USB cables for you know Android Android or iPhones this is your we I got yeah well we use both iPads and then you know smartphones that are being for me you know our Android base they take a different type of power table so I've been thinking you know maybe if I get a couple spare ones at a min so it's dedicated kit I mean we got bunch of USB cables laying around but I don't wanna be hunting for them if I don't need to oh look at that it's the Jewish Red Dead prepper a little Bubba how are you doing thank you for dropping by just on a side note I checked out when you're north the last video that your wife did that was cool in the school hall you know I don't I don't have solar in such a medium scale I've had in a smaller scale I don't have you know these kind of you know solar panels then deliver enough power for us vl5 Volta and clearly I don't have those 20 35 50 watt solar panels still working on that hey it's Val hey Valerie I was going do it okay you know always in creation mode right see how it's always increasing mode and with some live streaming then you just kind of see me talk for a little bit you know I'm talking about blackout kids vital lights how kids I think how you wanna word it yeah people seem to either use one or the air you know it's kind of talking about things that I put inside things to keep in mind and stuff like that oh wow that's cool that's cool dog perfect that's awesome all right it's awesome when do you think you know maybe you'll be able to get like something like a nice cold zero or something like that but it's not the highest priority for me all right yeah to get a solar panel sometimes things some things like water food or you know dummy more important you know something like a water filter biking you know maybe a little bit more useful than buying a solar panel although I mean I sort man would be nice you know in the meantime I guess I'll have to use a battery banks and you know hand crank without raid oh yeah yeah yeah I say Jewish red that pervert but still wants to get some solar - so any issue I have was sold well there's two reasons first unreadable hail and the second thing is I'm worried about Isis no you know those are those wings will you know kind of bug me when I once I do get solar especially you know in a bigger scale I mean those little things that are you know you put in your backpack or on your back you know I'm worried so much about that but on top of large solar panels nor you know that you got a keep outside those are two things I'm worried about you know I know in my Lego I'll install some nice 250 watt solar panels and it hails like six months later and I'll be like yeah it would just take you off hopefully when do you stay so good you know nice decent amount of power and get my hands on some of that stuff it's more people come in and one that's new coming in where I know I've been asking people on the side shy to kind of lead me you know it doesn't have to be a long bar paragraph right you know if you've ever been in a Blacko grid grids down lights are out black out whenever you want called how long did you learn anything from it and did you wish you had something or you wish you made preparations of certain thing beforehand so if you want to answer that leave no inside shot right now and I'll read it okay okay okay I'll keep that in mind our department thank you got my do my own research course Oh hmm okay okay I never even realized that's what you did when that kind of makes sense now so you definitely know about treating water you dude for a living it's kind of you know understanding understand methods procedures probably understand the chemicals and stuff I died that's cool clinical just give me a second sighs checking up on something real cool let's check up on some messages see maybe someone else drop in free no good on messages flat only got one message so yeah what's a cold so hopefully this guy talk it'll you know better a will become better still I still got a little bit of room in here so depending on what I want to try to get in here Oh might I update this a little bit more of course this is you know parts of the preparation the preparedness of it you know I keep batteries solar lights propane gas water food yes I I remember well making water filters back when I was in school it was part of a silent science experiment we couldn't we we had the DIY water filters now we were already we didn't have to drink it after or anything like that but basically it was just mud water and we had to filter it if you got clear water out afterwards you know you got a hundred percent you know if it's very very dirty ten percent so no so uh I've seen lots of the things I mean you know I'm very standard someone just went out bought a bag of coffee filters and put something coffee filters in yeah although I did it slightly different personally I think I used like rice as a filter so I kind of wanted to see if I could do it was without buying anything and now we weren't even allowed to buy even commercial here it had to be DIY let's just say if you ever use rice as a filter for wash kind of wet the water went through it a little bit more cuz there's dust and stuff like that that kind of white milky type of look to it you kind of want to avoid that especially a point get clear water and of course you probably would boil or maybe add some bleach to it after so it's biologically safe you know depending on the source oh that would be cool to see that uh Obama I'm gonna wait to see a video on on on a water filter I mean for the most part in water you don't need water for food anyways don't die digested cook a boil it okay I'm trying to remember to put this might like tell kit I'll be back I haven't decided what to call me I know there's two two phrases blackout kit or a lights out kid although you know I'm being almost faking calling it the great down kid you know great dose down well I'm grabbing this kid kind of deal I think I've heard about and actually that makes sense if you're singing a drop of bleach per gallon Jewish Baba here whatever heard one or two to three drops per liter so and a gentleman is both 3.8 3.7 eight liters yeah I guess that makes sense about to to love two or three drops per liter or about eight drops per gallon do you know the uh uh how long you have to keep it in there for as as far as I know after you let's say you put two to two or three drops in a liter of water you leave I think you're supposed to leave it for like I can't remember the amount of time but after it's that time has elapsed we open it you should you're supposed to have a slight hint of chlorine smell I mean that that amount is probably not I kill you because it's diluted but it's strong enough to you know kill microorganisms I might make it biologically safe to drink started pumping can you if you want to know that for me can you privately message me down please thank you look who it is it's just back from Australia hello thanks for dropping by bagger that's awesome you know if Sammy drops drop smile you'd be more ecstatic what in the meantime so a couple things I'm concerned put in here is some sort of when you can call like a tuna can eater although I just tend to just call it a high cattle something that can give me a fire starter heat light and we notice certain degree boil or cook food I'm doing good back thank you for asking besides when I'm in Krrish Moana I'm always happy I might be frustrated but I'm always happy when I'm in creation mode so yeah those are a couple things I've been considering playing a hot candle in to this kid maybe I might slip one decent you know but I don't use hand warmers not often but it you know if I decide to use more headwaters ad design so I can not extend the time the hand warmers but kind of you use a more effective efficiently or effectively especially integration of the black old or grid man like cell goes longer looks like I said earlier you no one knows when it will come back right could be hours could be days you know and hopefully it comes back hopefully it's not the answer is then you know it's like no shut up a better word a pop apopka elliptic in nature I probably had maybe some more reflectors on her and our department was kind of singing with white and red well I mean I'm waiting red but the silver red reflectors I have my deuce horn hmm but I still think that to carrying a lighter and a flashlight when he was pretty more even more important I mean these kids are know us I got some what OS ho light source is hitting it to reflect the light up the roof these reflectors foil tape or whatever or absorbing light - you know I like glow-in-the-dark stuff without that I'm probably not gonna be able to find this kid I mean yes I know where I put it but you know things could change and then you know quickly so I think having a lighter and a flashlight in my nearby a row on on your person it's an everyday carry you know it's pretty more important then comes you know I can't like you know use this light later to see so I can go find the kid yeah bag I heard about that yeah yeah I heard about that I think I told her to try link wetting a tissue and then freezing and been chewing on it so is you you'll get you would get that numbness cold I'm kind of harsh the gums and stuff like that but well that's cool that's cool then you bought a hand crank a hand crank tip of for charging that aren't appropriate so pretty much I mean and then that jelly probably it delivers 5 volts of power out probably yeah you know one app or less good for that you know for those zero times and you know a hand cranking I mean if it's brilliant because there's gonna be a lot of downtime in me like if it's like are you if you're on the second day of like not having power I would assume you're not to eventually get bored so I mean like me if your kids were bored you could be like hey go crank doesn't lead for the next five minutes you know something like I keep them occupied keep it keep people busy my mind off the situation you know or you know maybe you're actively thinking about it and you know trying to make plans in advance for it you know be like you're on the second day be like oh we should do XYZ you know you know especially we go through this power outage for the next one hour hour too you know for some reason I cannot find paracord I have of I has the reflective tracer in it I've shown that video before or i for some reason i can't find that band right now I've been thinking about it I've putting some sort of cordage with this kid just you know nothing too major but just so I can make a kind of microclimate in MO you know in the living room or in common area it's like I said smaller areas tenting are easier to maintain they warm up faster might be able to get away with just one light source for everyone to use and stuff I die oh yeah yeah yeah yeah well I I've shown a video on solar garden lights before should be under year the Solar Lord knockout playlist when the - I guess I'll be putting this into the blackout playlist - I guess I'm probably summer playlist but yeah so we're going lights are good especially you know maybe trying to something on your power stuff like that I mean you know it's uh neon I mean you Inc try to use that store that kind of a which will kind of power for to use later on in terms of lightening up an area later on I mean those solar lights hmm it depends I think turn the winter not when I tried them sometimes they don't last a whole night and remember during the winter there's up to 16 hours of darkness you know depending on your latitude and stuff like that and you might get you know seven or eight hours a day to eat now in comparison to the summertime you know around summer solstice or it's sixteen hours of daylight in a tail or darkness yeah those solar lights are gonna last the whole eight hours especially if it was Sun yelled passing day and you Church time and as a side note those solar garden lights depending if and use this leg let's say a triple-a or double-a you know even if you can't recharge it those can still be used as you know as an air source of like using a regular type of battery you know or a different you know an alkaline nickel metal hydride or lithium type of battery I thought I had that one in here okay I usually in this room I keep born bright above the light that I have hunches so when I turn off the lights that later will come on but I don't have it in here right now it must be you know hmm now answer as a side note again those wind-up wind-up type of lights remember unless it's a shake like those shake points you're not all the crank lights solar lights squeeze weights they all have a battery you're not getting power for nothing so to speak so and I know those eventually do well I mean you only have so many recharge cycles for a battery eventually you know it's just not to hold a charge for joining so I mean if you if you're putting together a kid you know you know maybe that Hand Crank like that you put in that squeeze what you put in you know maybe it's better that it's new rarely rarely has been used or pretty fresh so that way the battery you know you're still gonna get a lot of those recharge cycles you know and I'm putting in one that you used for the last four years then probably can't maintain that charge as much as well as a newer one can now speak of dynamo tabloids I've been looking for ones that don't use a CR as like a cr2032 type of button battery or ones that have I wouldn't really call it proprietary but for a lack of a better word don't use proprietary type of battery you know that's you know basically it's not delay or Triple E I do have one crank light that uses the blaze I mean releases its source but it's not that great I'm trying to look for more crank our dynamo type of lights then use that because I think that would be a better option because you can always hand crank in power to a battery right you know you got nickel Plato hydrate type of rechargeable batteries or whatever you know with the one I have I can put two delays in to nickel metal hydride type of batteries in it keep busy burning power inside I mean I've done it before I think this is why I keep it in this kit the way downside is it's the one the one I acquired the light source doesn't work but the power source still works so you know that's the reason why I keep it in there because I think it's useful enough I might not have a light source but I definitely have to recharge recharging of a battery capability so you need some of these solar lights whenever that use Triple A or whatever even it wasn't enough enough out that day I can hang chronic power rain you know an hour before sunset and be like ok you know stuff like that all right all right Bella thank you for dropping in Jewish red pepper always appreciate you cry no doctor perfect I'm talking more on the part I took in a squeeze Glade a heart I mean I am took in some of these I think I took a juror soul or hand crank one apart before always had a battery inside the only ones I know then using capacitor are the ones that shake and for from same reason why those shake ones aren't so the light output isn't as strong in comparison to the ones that use a battery because the battery can always output more power than a capacitor okay so yeah I mean I used to have one but the lady outputs not that great on it but on the bright side if he did break one or he'd find one you know the magnet could be useful I've seen someone use it as an improvised compass before those once with the capacitor with the magnet that goes back and forth I've seen that before I haven't tried it personally yeah you know you know more knowledge to put in the pink I didn't realize how long I was going for yeah yeah purple egg I sometimes I just take stuff apart just so you know and see how it works on the inside so you know I'm down assuming anything so just case I got to make a repair or you know I gotta grab stick two parts together I'd be like oh hey I took an Xyz apart before so let's see let's see if I'm seeing you know battery capacitor or whatever ray LED bulb key birthday crank powering and stuff like that so you know stuff I try I'm not sure can I actually have another project in the works on a different kind of dynamo power but I've not been able to kind of get it to go because I'm basically trying to you know something simple like an le LED bulb trying to get that work if I can get it work then you know it looks promising then I can make more an attempt to make it better so until I get somewhere you know it's just another project and if I get somewhere with it also you're not see video on it cuz it's kind of a different form of generating power speak up speak up generating power I know everyone always talks about the solar stuff but when wind and water should be included into the list I mean wind power is more expensive wind turbines are expensive like what four grand for it I mean I know over on Kickstarter right now I've I've seen videos on and stuff like that about those hide hydro electric generator that uses the movement of water to spin blades to generate electricity so if you were close by to a river or there's a stream near your place and you know that could be an option to get power from hydro power yes yes of course in the same reason I talked about a laptop using it as a power source of course your vehicle could be part of it too now of course you don't have to run it right so you know you got to make a judgment call what's more important the power or the seeds of gas just case of emergency I mean if you have plenty of gas you know and you might be like okay I don't have a generator so we can charge out my device with it for example and speak to charging up your device you know I generally say this to all my friends or people that have a dead phone dead home put it into airplane mode dim down to dim down display to next to nothing turn off Wi-Fi turn up bluetooth while you're charging you'll kind of or turn out or turn your phone off and charge it you'll kind of get more of a charge out of it because when you're charging when your device is on well part of the power that you're trying to put in is going towards well powering up powering up the device lining up that you know display stuff like that that's why I'm no turn devices or whatever certain people that live stream on that device or whatever you know they're right you know 7% or whatever in they charge it and they wonder why their powers better battery indicator stanko no it's because there's the live streaming you're running video you're running audio running Wi-Fi all that takes power so if you don't have to use it but you still want to charge up your device you know turn it off or if you have to keep it on for whatever reason you know dip down on this play and stuff like that turn off Bluetooth stuff like that maybe not watch that video right away yes thermal power Jill Jill electric-type power now we do not as far as I know we do not have that here in North America I know over in Iceland Iceland they have that but you know for most people it's not an option just because Jill for what you have to be in rate locations to or any help in infrastructure already to kind of you utilize harness that power I just think so where's probably more common thing per week fairly inexpensive in comparison to the hike hydro or when driven power turbine type of power but core soars you know affected and it's only for half today while winning water well when the wind can die down but we want our usually unless the River dries out or the stream dry so you don't have a continuous supply of power because it's constantly in the move but of course you need access to a water supply that's where any fast now for it I mean for me I wouldn't mind I'm hydropower is we have lakes and rivers and about here so for me but until the price comes down or you know or I wind watering I won't have one yeah cuz after buying the first one I'll already be like oh this is a little cool I couldn't get in Irwin right I could have put one in my buggy like I gotta put one name like it on deck I get an EVC one day ah since the firm makes the way in here how many do you do you keep battery banks with you our I'll never I never won that's okay that's okay I was just I asked how many battery banks you have I was just curious but that's okay I will catch you later doctor perfect thank you for dropping by and remember to leave me in that comment that you said earlier I message me well I'll probably end this live stream in five to eight minutes probably at the bottom of the hour real soon here it's nerd to get away man I take longer than I thought I didn't think I would go for free and half hours talking about wild kids I might sell kids and everything that comes because of it but you know and it's good to talk to you guys over this one ice cream get to know you guys a little bit better they don't understand where you guys are coming from especially what I see it's kid videos for you guys or things for you guys I'll be like oh that makes more sense you know X Y Z lewistown self more or you know they live up north more or you know they're in tornado alley or in hurricane type of on the east cool you know areas on the East Coast and stuff like that it's what I feel like I get to know you guys a little bit bender you guys can hear her a few more things that I might not say in my normal videos just because of time you know I get a chance to share a few stories and stuff like that I really enjoyed the live streaming which guys just as no it's more interactive you know I get to ask questions and you know I say a response with him pipe I mean II always appreciate every single person that drops like the live stream but virtually everyone maybe one or two trolls that I don't care about but you know how it is you know how it is in the virtual world then I take it with stride now hopefully I'll remember to add and that analytic but ed screening and links to the videos I was talking to I should have them up one side once the videos process but it depends how long the video is so what so as a quick kind of overall kind of recap this case we were dropping in random we are ever you know a black girl can happen at any time any urban type of area small town yeah you know a black um can happen you know anywhere that's clinic by the grid even you know even if you're running independently from the grid solar or whatever right well you can have issues with solar and you know you created a blackout to you know just because your solar for whatever reason you know maybe the battery's dead not one that dad but or your charge controller is not working or whatever right and stuff like that so the girl is up why it happens man-made natural you know maybe it's a CMA or an EMP CRO mass ejection or in which I would trick magnetic pulse to something more common like thunder showers thunderstorms ice storms do as simple as you know you just have the worst luck for that day because someone hit the pool or hit the transformer and knocked it out and powers gonna be knocked out for next couple hours for example all right regardless of the cause having hit set such as a blackout or white-tailed kick with you know a handful of the items I was talking about I've shown a couple examples and some knowledge maybe some building skills you know might help to can help kind of smooth out this hurdle and you're having at that time so anyways it's time for my outro so if you enjoyed this video this livestream or if you're watching it now depending how you want to look at it hit me up on the thumbs up you know check out the back library of videos I currently have check out any more the videos that I kind of mentioned in this nice 3 i'll try to have links or in screen cards for now you can check out any of the previous live streams and i've done i mean not any the content that i've shown you know where it be the dollar store things the kids the fire our kids the solar stuff the reusing of containers the scavenging videos the things i make regardless you know go check home go check it out you might find something more interesting or something to learn from where - maybe adapt it to your own situation so as the world changes someone's oneself to reach a new level a skill and knowledge one must practice a single person can't help everyone in this world but one person includes you you guys watching this video and me can help someone in this world i'm remember even a little thing a little help can make a great difference in the world or even locally town city province state etc etc so yeah remember that one person can help someone else for all right guys until the next yes till the next video for me it's peace out from the guy that's always increasing mode clearly it's P self from CR until the next livestream in the next video catch you guys later and take care Peter", "WR6uSXW-8p4": "The record-number of fires burning\nacross Brazil's Amazon rainforest has prompted renewed global outcry over\nclimate change and big spending. Five million dollars from Leonardo DiCaprio,\n10 million pounds from the U.K. Meanwhile, Bill Gates is\nbacking the first high-altitude experiment of one radical climate change solution,\ncreating a massive chemical cloud that could cool the earth. It's\ncalled solar geoengineering, and it's highly controversial. How long will it be that\ncountries keep experiencing these climate impacts before someone gets desperate and says, hey,\nwe need to cool the planet with solar geoengineering? It would look something like this: thousands\nof planes would fly very high and use nozzles to inject millions\nof tons of light-reflecting particles into the stratosphere. It would create\na thin chemical cloud of those particles around the whole planet,\nblocking some sunlight from reaching the surface. It would mimic a giant\nvolcanic eruption, which we know cools the earth. Back in 1991, Mount\nPinatubo erupted in the Philippines. It was the largest eruption to\naffect a densely populated area, creating avalanches and giant mud flows that left\nmore than 700 dead and 30,000 homeless. It also spewed a cloud of\n20 million tons of sulfur dioxide particles into the stratosphere. That chemical cloud was hundreds of miles\nacross and reflected about 2% of sunlight back to space. And in 1992, the earth\nwas cooler than in 1991. That is part of the mechanism. But you do this in a controlled way. Modeling studies have found that it\ncould reduce the intensity of heat waves, for instance. Apparently it could reduce the\nrate of sea level rise. It could reduce the\nintensity of tropical storms. But it also comes with\nsignificant risks and uncertainties. Things like mass famine, mass flooding,\ndrought of kinds that will affect very large populations. It could weaken monsoons in India,\nChina and Africa enough to affect crops. It could eradicate blue sky. You start increasing the amount of diffused\nlight and you have less direct light, which is the same thing as\nsaying it looks hazy and white. And if the global community\ndecides it should stop? So you stop injecting it and after a\nyear, the cloud is gone and you get this rapid warming at a rate much faster\nthan you would get if we had done nothing. If you've taken out the greenhouse\ngases that are adding to the warming, then the temperature won't go\nup and stay what it is. So if we don't stop emitting\ngreenhouse gases into the atmosphere, we don't try as hard as we can to\ndo that, then there's no point in doing solar geoengineering. A 2016 opinion poll conducted by\nthe Harvard group doing solar geoengineering research found that 67 %\nof subjects support its use. One reason this technology\nis appealing it's cheap. One study estimates it would\ncost an average of $2.25 billion globally every year for the\nfirst 15 years of deployment. Compare that to the half\na trillion dollars the U.S. government estimates it will\ncost just the U.S. by 2100 if no action is taken\nagainst climate change, or the $1.6 to $3.8 trillion projected global spending\nby 2050 on low-carbon energy production. You can also compare it\nto direct air carbon capturing, another climate change solution backed by\nBill Gates and by big oil. It involves sucking billions of tons of\ncarbon out of the air and at $100-$200 a ton, it\ncould be big business. Solar geoengineering, on the other hand,\nis so cheap that nobody currently stands to make money\nfrom the process. But just because a solution is cheap doesn't\nmake it make it a good one. It's cheap and dangerous. It doesn't require a\nlot of materials. It doesn't require a big innovation. It basically affects the whole\nplanet with one project. So that is not necessarily a situation\nthat has a lot of profit opportunity, right? Because there's not gonna be a lot of\ndifferent people that can do it and compete in a marketplace. Bill Gates is among a dozen\nindividual donors and 14 foundations backing the first stratospheric solar geoengineering\nexperiment out of Harvard. It's called Stratospheric Controlled\nPerturbation Experiment, or SCoPEx. A high-altitude balloon will lift instruments\nabout 20 kilometers into the stratosphere, where it will release less\nthan two kilograms of different naturally occurring chemicals like calcium\ncarbonate and sulfates, and then measure the change in\natmospheric chemistry and light scattering. The Harvard group that runs SCoPEx\nand other experiments has raised more than 16 million dollars, more than\ndouble any other solar geoengineering effort. And annual global funding has gone\nup from $1 million in 2008 to $8 million in 2018, with the majority\nof that funding coming from the U.S. The first phase of SCoPEx will cost\naround $3 million, with much more needed for wider research\non solar geoengineering. To this point, stratosphere injections have\nonly been tested with climate modeling. In the U.K., a government-funded solar radiation management\ntest called SPICE was cancelled in 2012 because\nof issues with patents. And we're not trying to develop any\ntechnology that is patented or where we want to make money\nwith this later on. A study last year found that\nno existing aircraft can inject the stratosphere at a\nhigh enough altitude. But developing a new high-altitude\ntanker would not be technologically difficult or prohibitively expensive. Nozzles still need to be designed\nthat can continuously blast out trillions of particles. And scientists still\nneed to decide what chemicals those particles should be made of. But unlike cloud brightening, which\nis another solar reflection technique, the tech needed for stratospheric\ninjections is not far off. The technology is not the main\nthing that's holding this back. The main thing that's holding it back\nis the uncertainty about what the exact effects would be and the positives\nand negatives of its effects and the governance and decision making\nprocess for implementing it. Other radical attempts to control climate\nchange have been tested in the past. Like when one California businessman dumped\n100 tons of iron dust in the Pacific to spawn the\ngrowth of carbon-absorbing plankton. But unlike small, sometimes\nrogue experiments, planet-wide solar geoengineering will require buy-in\nfrom the international community. You know, in our simulations, we found\nChina got warmer and drier relative to the past when you stabilize global\ntemperature and India was now cooler and wetter. So you can see\nthere how, you know, international relations around using this technology\ncould become complicated. I mean, we can't even decide on\nwhat to do about emissions of greenhouse gases. And so how are we going\nto decide on setting the planetary thermostat? There's this real concern that we won't\nbe able to reach agreement, we being the entire planet. And so there's the prospect that countries\njust go ahead and do solar geoengineering. And that causes\ndisagreement, conflict, tension, even possibly war. Three years ago, the international community\ndid come together when almost 200 countries signed the Paris Agreement\non climate change, agreeing to limit global temperature rise to\nless than two degrees Celsius. Since then, President Trump has stated\nhis intent to withdraw from the agreement. The Paris Climate accord is simply\nthe latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that\ndisadvantages the United States. And global emissions are not being\nreduced fast enough to reach these goals. We know what we should be doing. What we should be doing\nis reducing carbon emissions. So we're creating a moral hazard. We are providing an out for you where\nyou can say, well, I'm going to fix this technologically instead of doing the\nethically right thing to do. It's way too early to give up\non much more ethical approaches to climate change. If future generations were literally in\nthe room to question us on our dubious arguments, we wouldn't get far\nwith some of the kinds of arguments we're trying to offer\nfor neglecting conventional climate policy and going down this path. For now, the failure to rapidly\nreduce emissions has prompted more exploration of alternative solutions like\ncarbon dioxide removal and solar geoengineering. But scientists warn we\nwill still need to reduce emissions, too. If we're not cutting CO2 emissions at\nthe same time, from my perspective, there is little point in doing this\nbecause you would have to start using ever increasing amounts. No responsible scientist says that\nit's a silver bullet. All the responsible scientists say this is\nsomething that we deploy if we had to, alongside all the other stuff\nthat we already have to do. The U.S. Academies of Sciences is holding\na series of meetings to study solar geoengineering, including one\nat Stanford this month. The committee will issue a report\nnext year with recommendations for how or if solar geoengineering\nresearch should continue. Some scientists say the research is\nnecessary in order to arm future generations with the ability to enact\nthis backup plan, even though it seems nearly impossible now. We ought to start working on\nthis solar climate engineering problem right now with as much urgency as we can so\nthat if we want to deploy it in a decade or so, we understand\nwhat we have to do. This is a real moral horror, especially\nin a situation where we're not doing all the things that we could\nbe doing to minimize the risks of climate catastrophe now. But experts do agree that more\npublic awareness is needed around solar geoengineering, because within a couple decades,\nfor better or worse, it could be part of the solution\nhelping return the planet to pre-industrial temperatures. Modeling evidence gathered over the\nlast decade has pretty consistently found that a moderate amount\nof solar geoengineering could significantly reduce many of the\nimpacts of climate change. But it can't be a solution because\nit doesn't return the climate system back to how it was. It doesn't\ndo anything about things like ocean acidification. So whatever happens, we've got\nto cut our CO2 to zero. So right now, we need more research\nto understand this better and a broader conversation so that all of the\nworld's nations have a seat at the table when this is discussed.", "7xkbXPzBTHE": "[Music]", "iOFMUWtns54": "hey guys it's Mike Jim welcome to another episode of eating random food and telling scary stories you guys like my scary story voice it can't really make anything sound scary like this is a pack of ramen this this is a pack of ramen we don't know where it's been we don't know what's inside that's scarier did I make this already scary pack of ramen scarier because this is some Korean fire ramen that will burn you up a little bit so I do have a ramen collection I did a video on Strictly dumpling about all the different ramen I have in this is my spicy ramen collection so these are some of the crazy fire rama's from Korea so this is the typical one that most people eat the chicken flavor fire ramen then I found this this is also one of these really spicy ramen hot chicken flavor ramen Corrine never tried this before this is not a curry ramen but this is something I found in my collection I never tries like a spicy crayfish ramen and this is the regular fire chicken ramen and then we have another one this is tofu key flavor fire ramen I mean I've had a lot of Korean spicy ramen I've never had that different flavors of this so we're gonna eat some of this with some spam because you got to have some protein and we'll tell some stories but first we have to invite somebody to the table Big Bertha because we got some spam and we grilling this baby and I figured today we stir-fry the ramen as well to make it even better uh move out of the way ramen VIP coming through and today I'm gonna show you guys how to make spam tastes even but it's not really spam is like fortune luncheon meat so it's like imitation spam alright let's get some breakfast going [Music] so this is eight pack of mr. noodles I didn't put then extra curry in that in the topokki because I'm not sure I would like this I just want to give it a try first so it split up into five different territories five different factions it's like the ramen warring periods in here and right in the middle we're gonna do two things first of all if you guys never cooked spam like this before I recommend you try it use sugar to cover the outside of the spam and just grill it and the sugar will caramelize giving the spam just a slight little caramel flavor so this first part this is the regular fire noodle people you do that's a challenge I like it from lunch and by the way this is breakfast right now for me I love Big Bertha because know I got like a little crunchy toasted layer of noodles on the bottom nice perfect telling you spam sugar grill so good this parts with a spicy crayfish seasoning it's a little sweep I can definitely taste a crayfish are actually really sweet I don't know if I like it I much see what this is that's the other spicy chicken that is just pure pain right here that might be spicier than the original fire noodle Wow oh no it's because I started with the original fire noodle we're not but I feel like the one with the chicken in the front I feel like that spicier I definitely burn some of these noodles cooked it a lot longer tonight I wish I did but that's all right no it's more like chow mein oh no going out let's try this part later there's a 100% of curry noodles that's strong curry flavor especially not bad if you like curry and spice wow that's a good option not nearly as bad as I thought I thinking at this point I'm just like losing taste buds I'm not really able to taste too much anymore it's still very much within a tolerable range like this is still where I feel like this is good it tastes good I don't know I'm not like suffering or anything leave it though it may seem like that this sweat that's good sweat nice little bookie may just slightly sweet normally not much to it are they the best flavors are the two regular space you want us when the curries pretty good ah rough spam definitely helps well I definitely need more spam but I can't cook outs grow anymore it's already kind of burning my noodles it's almost eight packs down go get some more spam Kandee spam actually I take it back I don't like the curry noodles anymore think I really just like the spicy ones let's get into the stories you know I got a few different ones for you guys today first couple stories I want to talk about has to do with reincarnation I don't know how many of you guys believe in past lives I a hundred percent like a hundred thousand percent believe in past large-scale ashley took a course on parapsychology and hypnosis and I can actually hypnotize people so I'm not even joking bus I can't actually hypnotize people and I've done it to a few dozen people already and there's the thing called past life regression you can hypnotize someone and kind of take him back to a previous life and so the people are hypnotized one of them saw that she was in ancient Egypt another one actually felt the ground move beneath her stomach because she was crawling around the ground cuz she was a snake now regardless if you believe in reincarnation or not has always been a fascinating a really favorite topic of mine to research and I found a lot of these interesting stories about kids who are able to remember their past lives in one of the most prominent cases is a boy named Sam so Sam was four years old when his grandmother died and after the funeral his parents brought home an old full album from his grandma's house and of course inside the album are pictures of his grandmother his grandfather who he has never met in his life and not only has Sam never met his grandfather he has never even seen a picture of his grandfather before so when the family was shifting through the album's looking through the pictures Sam saw a car pointed at it and said how was my car the car as it turned out was his grandfather's first car Sam's mother was really skeptical because she was a Baptist and of course didn't believe in reincarnation so she tested him even more so she showed Sam a picture of his grandfather as a young boy with a bunch of other young boys standing around him right away Sam pointed to his grandfather and said there I am of course Sam's mother corrected him and said no no that's not you that's your grandfather to which Sam replied no that's me still pretty skeptical Sam's mother testing him even more by saying okay so what else do you remember from your past life to which Sam replied someone turned my sister into a fish and when his mother asked who he just said bad men I just wanna clarify it not Batman bad men it's big difference big difference and what was freaking was that it turns out that Sam's grandfather's sister was murdered her body was dumped into a body of water Sam's father also experienced a Sam recalling his past life and he told a story of when Sam was only 18 years old and he was changing Sam's diaper also the Sam looked up at him and said when I was your age I used to change your diaper hmm the next story it's about a kid named Li in at 2 years old he was already scaring the poo out of his parents by talking about his other mommy in a year later he would often throw these temper tantrums and what he wanted wasn't candy war a toy he wanted to go back to his other house and get back to work li would also argue that his middle name was actually called a he was born on June 26 although his middle name is not call he was born on June 21st he would also talk about his daughter Jennifer in how he used to live in Hollywood and died at the age of 48 so his parents decided to humor him and I asked him what he used to do in Hollywood to which he replied he used to write movies so finally these parents start believing that okay maybe Lee's talking about past life I'm either Dao where the kid has gone completely evil it would eventually go Pet Sematary on them in the middle of the night so then the parents did a test they started naming classic movies to lead to see if you remember which one he actually wrote and when they got to Gone with the Wind he said yeah that was my movie I wrote that movie so when these parents looked into the screenwriter for Gone with the Wind guess what they found the screenwriters name was Sidney Coe Howard he died at the age of 48 he had a sister named Jennifer in his birthday June 26th I feel like the parents are asking the wrong questions I'd be if I had a kid and he's talking about hash live especially as a screenwriter or somebody up crominus my first question would be hey honey how did he money somewhere like did you yeah but like a secret safe you know okay get the combination to that also I wonder if let's say you ventually he can prove reincarnation like actually prove 100% no one's doubting reincarnation at all you just go back to your old house or go back to your significant other who thought they lost huge and just be like honey I'm home also imagine if someone was on the receiving end of that imagine like some little kid comes up to you because their parents kind of found out that that dau was your dead relative Lord that was your like your brothers sisters significant other who passed away just coming up to you and just remembering all this stuff what would you do sure you do one more tease let's do one more and by the way these are all real stories there's a lady named Erica and she had a kid five year old and she was always confused because Luke would always point to objects where people and call them Pam he'd always talk about how he used to be a girl he even put out earrings that Erica was worrying and be like hey I used to wear earrings like that finally Erica asked Luke who cam was so she's like hey look who's Pam and Luke said I was well I used to be but I died and went to heaven and I saw God and eventually God pushed me back down and when I woke up I was a baby you named me Luke so now things were getting really specific so then Erica pressed Luke for more information to tell her more about this Pam so Luke told his mother dad he used to live in Chicago he took the train a lot you know pretty common stuff and then he died in the fire I mean can you imagine that conversation hey Luke can you tell me more about who you were yes sure mommy I still live in Chicago I took the train a lot I really liked deep-dish pizza I loved going out to see shows and oh by the way I died in a fire I got dark real quick if I ever heard that coming from my kid that's a pee myself moment right there it was so creepy about this was when Luke talked about him dying in a fire he made the motion of someone jumping out of the window so Erica did some research and she found an article about the fire at the Paxson Hotel in Chicago Illinois and this was back in March of 1993 19 people died in the fire including a woman named Pam who yeah died because she jumped out of a window it was forgetting WorldCom's gonna keep these two packs up to last story and this has nothing to do with reincarnation but in the last video I asked you guys to send me creepy stories of yours or a creepy experiences that got so many amazing stories I can't get to all of them but I'll do my first fan submitted story today this was coming from the Philippines from Jarek bonito he said this happened about 15 years ago he swears this is a true story that was told to him firsthand he said there was a high school pretty upscale high school in the in Metro Manila it was a pretty high school and since it had people coming from all over the country it had a dormitory for those who wanted to live on campus so one night there was a student studying in the library and kind of lost track of time before he knew it was almost midnight and the dorms curfew was at midnight so he had to get back to the dorms before the curfew so he rushed out and I was way back to the dorms he all of a sudden realized that he forgot the keys to his dormitory on the table that he was studying at at the old library so he rushed back and by that time out lights have shut off he was walking down these dark corridors in the school is super old so he was kind of freaked out but of course he needed his keys so he went all the way back to the library before he could open the door and there were these glass doors leading into the library before he could push the doors open he saw a figure standing all the way on the other side of the room of course he was creeped out just like any one of us would be but he figured mine's just be another student so he opens the door and slowly walked to the table where his key was at the same time he saw the figure slowly started moving towards him at this point he's really creeped out because he can make out that it was a girl and she was worrying sort of like like the school uniform but it was actually a gown and she had hair draped all over her face he was so freaked out he started reciting a prayer out loud our Father who art in heaven as he slowly walked to the table well he got to the table he grabbed his keys I was about to recite the next prayer hail Mary full of grace and throughout this whole process even though he was creeped out the prayers actually helped for him to be able to hear his own voice reciting the prayers it helped give him courage and comfort as he went to grab his keys but when he started to recite Hail Mary for grace he realized something the voice that he was hearing the voice that was reciting the prayers was not his voice anymore it was a female's voice hail Mary full of grace it was coming from right beside him he turned to look and the figure that was still meters away when he got to the table was all of a sudden right next to him staring at him and what he saw behind the curtain of messy black hair was a lady's distorted rotting face her mouth was moving that prayers was coming out of her mouth in a mocking manner no I'm like the Korean virgin girls that that took the guys heart out nothing happened this goes apparently didn't kill the kid it's just terrifying him he ran out of there back to her storms and probably with a loaded pair of pants you know what I always wonder in these situations you know when you see like a creepy creature where a creepy apparition or some disfigured entity or a girl with hair draped over her face I always wonder what will happen instead of running away in terror if you just turn around and roundhouse them in the face I mean what's the worst that can happen if your kick sails through it then just turn around and run away the momentum is already there anyway thanks so much Jared bonito up for cine in that story and of course guys if you have any really terrifying stories let me know since you strictly don't play on gmail.com and let me know the comments below have you ever had any super creepy experiences and as a parent has your can't ever said anything really creepy like I have a best friend named Timmy he lives in my closet something like that or something to indicate that they start remembering their past lives let me know in the comments below and that concludes another food and scary story time thank you guys so much for watching see you later you", "Igfp7aqeSTA": "hi I'm Rachel you to this and I'm going to teach you about soot stain removal this is common you buy a new candle you set it you know on the counter and you end up with soot on your cabinet or even on your ceiling or your walls well my first tip is buy soy candles they're organic they're biodegradable and they do not make such stains anywhere but this is what the soot stain looks like you can see around the edge it's it's kind of a dark smoky stain so you want to always have a magic eraser around the house these things are awesome they are the homeowners best friend because they'll get rid of any saints that are on walls cabinets anything you just want to wet it and squeeze it out and you will be able to wipe the foot right off it'll come right off immediately whoops right before your eyes after you do this if they're still kind of a smell maybe there's a burnt smell vinegar and water is great for removing any type of odor so spray vinegar and water onto the stain or onto the area where the stain was wipe it a little bit just let it sit and dry and that will get rid of any smell be mindful of where you put your candles so this never happens again set them on a table that's you know lower to the ground so that the suit doesn't go straight up to your ceiling straight up to your cabinet or walls and make a spot also consider soy candles they're not going to make a stain at all I'm Rachel you choose this and that is stain removal tips", "w4iW8sbNQ78": "first thing I'd like to mention is we seem to have a lot of new viewers lately and I wanted to thank everybody for checking out my channel I hope you're enjoying yourself today's video is based on comments from one of our viewers Lizzie more that talked about using acid to clean stones so here I have a couple of herkimer's that have calcite and stuff these aren't particularly great crystals but they'll serve their purpose it's this demonstration then I have this little little piece of log that has a couple of nice pieces and then this little crystal over here isn't bad this one up here isn't bad so I'm gonna soak this in acid and see what we can remove from the calcite and other things to start freeing these stones up and see if they drop out or maybe you can very move really easily after the fact so I don't generally like to do it with chemicals but it is definitely a way that it can be done Lizzie said she used I believe it was uh vinegar I'm gonna use something a little stronger on using muriatic acid you can store one thing to note is the stuff does make fumes if you put metal in it makes actually I think if you put most things in an it makes hydrogen gas which is flammable explosive even so um you know put the stuff outside or I'm going to put it out in my garage after I mix it together but I'll mix this up and we'll take a peak on this and what's an acid in there I don't know if you can see it is just laying away in there little ripples on the surface but it's making bubbles right now a lot of its hydrogen gas so I want to move this out to the garage now you can see it's totally actively working on the stove No so I'll put this out the garage don't blow myself up and we'll check it out in a couple of days and see how things are going alright here's my acid and stone concoction a couple of five six days later I didn't write down what day I started this but yeah you can see it definitely dissolved a lot of the material out of here I haven't checked the acidity I don't know how dead the acid is now but I'm gonna suit up with my rubber gloves on and stuff and take these out rinse them and we'll see what we ended up with okay all these stones been soaking in water for a while to dilute the acid that's autumn now if I take these uh these two straddling the label here there's basically no matrix left on them at all clean them all off these two back here I mean there's just a tiny bit of matrix left and this one obviously there's still a considerable amount I know that putting the big rock in this bucket slowed everything down you know it was a lot a lot of rock for the acid to eat on if you put in little pieces like this it would act much faster and you wouldn't deliver your acid so much but uh I'm gonna get these ones set aside and we'll get out the big one and see how that looks alright now here's the big one first thing I want to point out is right here in this frog these couple of pieces just fell off as I picked it up to get it out of the bucket and you can see that the crystals are really starting to stand proud as the material around them gets eaten so it's interesting look midway through I'm gonna plop all these guys back in these little ones down here actually I have almost no matrix on them so those won't need to go back in I'm kind of shards they're not great crystals but still it's an interesting experiment I've never tried it on something that's large you know if this uses a prohibitive amount of muriatic acid or anything like that then it's not something I'm gonna pursue because you know you got to be really careful and disposal in things so I'll put this back in the bucket of acid maybe check the pH it still seems to be working on it so I think I might just put it in not worry about the pH yet but I might need to refresh it with a little bit of fresh acid the next couple days or a week or so it's been another week that's my last video and a lot more the calcite is going on the big piece if it's gone you can see on the sides how much the acids actually really attack the dolomite also a little cap of quartz on the top is left unharmed and it's even the dolomite right out from underneath it so I've had a couple of little stones fall out into the jug I've kept those I'll show them all at the end when I'm done playing around with this but at this point the acids getting a little weak it's not so not really acting on the stone quite so much anymore so I'm gonna put in a little bit more I'm gonna keep you know keep what's in there and just add a little bit more to freshen it up and continue along the way on these just as part of an experiment also I have a little garnet I got a deer hill and it was a stuck in a stuck on a piece of really flaky pegmatite I'm gonna put that in there to clean off any residual stuff on it and then this here is a piece of emerald so just for curiosity's sake I have a big piece I want to cut but I want to try and soak some of this host rock whatever the matrix was there off of this and see if it cleans up the piece of emerald a little bit so those are going in the bucket to this week so I'll probably wait another week or two and make it another video and see how things are coming along and maybe someday all those stones will fall off this big guy right into the bucket we'll see", "41WLxSRlcEk": "hey what's going on guys skinny here welcome to episode 6 of Twitter class only in today's Twitter class is the vector with the freaking slug fired dang it [ __ ]

you sir guy up top there is he's down sucka I'm actually like getting kills huh I honestly did not think I was gonna be getting kills of this class cuz i hate select-fire for one and i hate the freaking uh yeah select fire hey it's like fire that's all I do I do it's don't know what my bullet did he would shoot I heard it click did you guys hear clicking the sound cuz I her to click let's make any sense to me oh I see people Oh shrimp I see people i see you dots everywhere he's gonna chase me watch bouncing betty what are you doing why is it not working what Oh shrimp shot myself fraud

how can I clean the soot and smoke off the face of my fireplace you know I don't think I've ever seen a fireplace around it didn't have at least a little bit of smoke and soot somewhere on the face of the fireplace now basically it's just grease so you need a good degreaser in order to clean this up and one of the best degreasers I've ever found is TSP or trisodium phosphate now to apply this powder onto a vertical surface would be really hard and if you try to spray any kind of cleaner on it it'll run right down so what I'm going to do make a simple paste by adding just a little bit of water to a TSP and using the same sponge we'll just apply this and come back with the more abrasive side of the sponge you can see it does a great job cleaning all of that offf and you'll want a good clean sponge to make sure you're getting rid of all of the residue of course cleaning ceramic tile like this is fairly easy because it has a glaze but if you have brick on your fireplace surround then you'll need to be a little more address if the pace will still work well but you may need one of these", "vmT3wcu8Ed0": "hey folks Phil Plait in bad astronomy calm here in January of 2014 Atlanta Georgia got hit by a bit of a freak snowstorm put down about two inches of snow and ice in the town which basically paralyzed everything now what I wasn't expecting was a conspiracy theory about this storm of course there can be a conspiracy theory about anything if you're imaginative enough and this one's pretty imaginative you see it wasn't actually snow that fell it was geo engineered snow or government made snow and it was deposited by airplanes via chemtrails and and maybe it's made of nano robots and yeah right well this came about because what people were doing somehow and I'm not really sure how this started but they would make a snowball and then they would take a lighter and hold it up to the snowball and they would expect the snow to melt into water of course and then drip off the snowball that's not what happened instead they would hold up the lighter and the snow would sort of collapse in on itself wouldn't drip any water and then the snow would get scorched like it was burning like it wasn't made of water because of course water can't burn but that's not really what's going on and that's what I want to show you it's snowing here in Boulder right now a little bit but we've had six seven inches of snow over the past couple of days this is a freshly laid snow bank right here you can see it's sitting on the on the side here and there is no there are no marks in this I've done anything to this this is just plain old snow that fell from the sky so let me make a snowball here decent-sized one you can see it's you know snow right and I happen to have a lighter this is a normal lighter store-bought name-brand I won't say the name but pretty much what you'd expect so let me bring a snowball up here I'll bring it right up here so you can see it and I'll return the later on there you go and I'm gonna put that right here now watch what happens you expect the snow to drip right the water to drip well a little bit of drip edge but not much and there nothing right the snow is just collapsing like when you put styrofoam under under chemical or something like that in it so what you're seeing here is pretty much what you see in those other videos and if I hold it like this you really expect that to dripping it doesn't and I don't know if you can see that here but there's a little bit of a scorch mark right there and I wonder if I can make it scorch a little bit more ah there we go so what's going on well what I think is going on here it's two things actually one is that the snow is melting it is turning from solid into liquid during from ice into water but where is it going it's not dripping I don't think it's evaporating or sublimating turning directly from a solid into a gas I think where it's going is into the snowball right I think that as it turns into water the snow itself is absorbing that water in becoming slushy this is the same thing that happens when you make a snow cone right you have ice in a cone you pour the syrup on it and that syrup gets absorbed into the cone it doesn't drip out so I think that's what's happening here the water is still in here the snow is still here it's just now in the water and it's been absorbed in but what's going on with the burn works well it turns out that is simply from the butane that is the chemical that fills up a lighter that's an organic compound which means it's made of a simple molecule that's made up of carbon and hydrogen and when you burn it it reacts with oxygen in the air to form carbon dioxide and water however it doesn't burn perfectly efficiently and what happens is the carbon atoms can reform Andry bond with each other and with other stuff and form soot that's what so is it's a very complex carbon molecule it turns black and absorbs light and so what's happening is when you hold the lighter up to the snow it's not that the snow is scorching it's that the incomplete combustion products this this pollution the soot is basically coming out of the flame itself and then plating itself on to the snowball that's what's going on and I can actually prove this I believe that this will melt and turned into water like any normal snow by taking this and doing something that nobody else in those videos thought to do and that is let the snowball melt so I'm going to do is bring the snowball inside into my kitchen I'm gonna put it in a hot pan and through the magic actually these science of time-lapse photography we can see this actually melting and turning into water [Music] well in that time-lapse you could see the snow was melting but what you probably couldn't see very clearly at least is that as the water formed from the melting snow it got absorbed in the snowball itself and you can see the level of the water rising it's pretty cool when the time lapse that may have been tough so what I'm gonna do is film another snowball this one made from the same snow in the pan and you'll be able to see it in real time and that way you'll notice that but water is being absorbed by the snowball so let me zoom in on this pan and we'll go and here we go give it a few seconds is melting and you can see the water line there it is and there's more the snow melts from the bottom up the water gets sucked into the snow itself see it's turning into a slush ball and that is what's happening in those videos that's where the water is going it's going into the snow ball itself not dripping away as you might expect so there you have it folks there's no big conspiracy here this is not some man-made chemical admit to control your brains and have you vote for somebody they want you to or to give all your money to late night TV infomercials or or whatever it is that this huge conspiracy is trying to make you do is this isn't a chemical this wasn't deposited by airplanes this isn't nanobots this is what we call you know snow and snow is made of of water and in places where it gets cold that water falls from the sky in the form of snow", "NY-bnY0yjWw": "please note that this video was made solely for research and demonstration purposes do not attempt to repeat the experiments shown in this video hello everyone today I will show you one interesting experiment which is called the fine rainbow for this experiment we will need different metal salts that will paint flames in different colors the first ingredient one that you can find in our kitchen is cooking salt it will paint the flame in yellow color the next one is lithium chloride which I put in the first cup it will paint the flame in red karmen color then I pour strontium chloride next substance is boric acid after is blue stone then I pour barium chloride next goals lead nitrate and in the end potassium chloride to achieve the best result of transferring the color during combustion I use methanol as a fuel I'm pouring a small amount of methanol into each of the cups next I set fire to a methanol once the flames break out we get a fire rainbow lithium fluoride paints flame in such a rich caramel red color strontium chloride paints the flame in a bright red color sodium chloride Pines flame in yellow next boric acid dyes the flame in a rich green color boost on cones the flame in a dim green barium chloride should also point the flame in green color also with an observes adhere lead nitrate paints flame in a such a yellow blue coal finally potassium chloride colors the flame in a search yellow purple color at the end methanol slowly burns down and the flames are reduced now we can see more clearly how different sauce paints the flames for example potassium chloride which previously was almost eel now became more purple copper sulfate has also become more green after methanol is burned the experiment stops you", "Gi5dOvlMCgE": "at first i didn't believe there was a virus but when they start taking away your rights it doesn't make sense the coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades if you don't follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them you must stay at home conspiracy theories about 5g have been spreading since the beginning of lockdown there is no virus it's 5g radiation poisoning this is all a big part of the eventual goal which is control your body can't handle this new 5g it's not built for it and yet lots more people are going to be ill these false theories have been contagious bbc news at two o'clock this is nikki cardwell police have broken up a group of around 25 people protesting about the lockdown in central london [Music] the demonstration took place near to the a e units of st thomas's hospital fascism fascism fascism major health organizations have said that 5g is safe and that there's absolutely no link between it and coronavirus so where did the idea come from and how far are its believers prepared to go you're gonna you're gonna be poisoned are you gonna are you gonna stand for that well we're not standing for it it isn't coronavirus [Music] hey how's it going i'm good how are you yeah i'm good nice to meet you how much time are you spending online i looked at my screen time on my phone i think it was like 16 hours maybe a day yeah but it's gone it's gone down now but at first it was like 16 maybe 17 hours yeah what did your mom say i wasn't happy at 4. isaac is 17 and he's been stuck at home like the rest of us he's been living through his phone and in early april his friends started sharing something unusual someone sent something into my snapchat group chat you know some guy he was talking about how the 5g thing is that real thing that we should be scared about not coronavirus and coronavirus is a cover-up for a lot of different things that the government is doing i was thinking this guy is definitely bored because it makes no sense what are your friends thinking they're thinking about the 5g stuff the radiation and it making them sick and whatnot some of them actually generally believe it and some of them haven't they don't they basically don't want to leave the houses wow yeah false theories about the virus and 5g spread quickly at the beginning of lockdown do you think it's difficult to tell what's true and what's false in me very very difficult i just don't believe i just don't believe anything to be honest unless i see it come from one of boris's speeches the misinformation that people are spreading is quite dangerous there isn't one coherent 5g conspiracy theory some people say the virus is man-made and lockdown is a cover for installing 5g others say it's actually 5g that's causing coronavirus symptoms and some think it's an excuse for forced global vaccination it all comes back to a fear that 5g is harmful to human health there's no credible evidence to support that but that hasn't stopped wild speculation online and celebrities have been super spreaders us singer kerry hilson was one of the first she shared this now debunked video of an alternative doctor in march and i'll finish with anybody want to make one guess as to where the first completely blanketed 5g city in the world was exactly kerry later tweeted that her management asked her to remove the post what the doctor said wasn't true but the idea was infectious and anti-5g posts went viral on the first day of lockdown mia tweeted then later removed this here's the broadband that they're like digging up to install why are these men here then callum best put a post on instagram so did lee ryan from boy band blue like so many of these posts it's since been deleted then hollywood actor woody harrelson [Music] these messages were coming up on all of our feeds and they weren't stopping amanda holden said she accidentally tweeted a link to this petition but four hours after she shared it the page had over a hundred and twenty thousand signatures bbc news at 8 o'clock there's been another record increase in the number of deaths i think it's a man made thing guys it's been put there for a reason to keep everyone in while they test the 5g amongst his usual posts british musician black the ripper was sharing anti-5g [Music] for allowing videos to come in [Music] then he died rest in peace ripper and respect for speaking the truth before you died it fueled even more conspiracy theories by the end of the first week of april fake news was everywhere and the government decided to step in on the point about the 5g masters the stories i have got about that they play a role in the in the spread of the disease that's just nonsense dangerous nonsense as well [Music] with all the misinformation swirling around it's easy to lose sight of what 5g actually is david robert grimes is a physicist and cancer researcher hello how are you doing hey i'm doing great how are you 5g is essentially a new standard in mobile technology one of the things that people correctly realize is that this is a form of radiation radiation is scary people are frightened of that word there are forms of radiation that are very very dangerous but what people forget is light is also a form of radiation 5g is tens of thousands of times less energetic than even the visible light to which we are exposed every day but i think it's really important to work out that a lot of your conspiracy theories being spread at the moment are actually not even new there was people against 4g there's there's groups against wi-fi and back in the 1910s there was people against radio what has changed now is not that these fringe groups have existed they always have but now they can harness the power of social media to go and spread their beliefs and to evangelize them and because we live in a world where we use technology but we don't always understand what it really means or how it works we are very susceptible to frightening claims when i heard the word 5g i just for holding here we go naveed works for bt open reach a lady approached my van she said i know what you're here for i know what you're doing you've been hired by the council to basically roll out 5g he installs home internet and phone lines not mobile networks like 5g but he's been targeted just like other engineers one day in april a woman approached him quoting false information it made no sense to me as well about microwaves and blood cells and how it affects everyone she walked further further across the shop and probably about 10 meters down there was a group of uh 10 men when she was pointing at me and she said that person he's the the cause of everyone dying because then i could hear foul language i could hear abuse i could hear things like murderer killer uh threats like watch out watch what happens to you you feel uh very very frightened and scared no job is worth risking your life for between april and june 2020 telecoms engineers reported 264 similar incidents so what are you laying fiber what kind of fiber ones you know when they turn this on it's going to kill everyone and that's why they're building the hospitals no idea no idea no it's not only because when i put it on facebook [Music] that's one of them what was he saying uh tell him we don't want 5g in this area why are you guys hustling this man i see him take a lot of crap before they attacked him and they say uh why is he putting in 5g and he says he's not 5g he's a professional guy he's working this thing is bigger than all of us here because i can find myself in a box tomorrow because the government can kill people if you talk too much the birds are getting the biggest hit because they you know they get the radioactive they can't take certain microwaves in their ears you know because they're weaker than us yeah we get we we die slowly naveed is one of many engineers who've been harassed thanks to the spread of theories linking 5g and covet 19 and there's consequences one study found that if you believe in a link you're far more likely to leave the house even if you have coronavirus symptoms the latest figures show that another 346 deaths linked to covet 19 have been confirmed across the uk in 24 hours bringing the total number of victims to 31 587. it's early may a month since the government assured the public that 5g conspiracy theories are false a small group of protesters have gathered in st james's park london their concerns range from vaccines to freedom of speech bill gates is saying that we have to have mandatory vaccinations until we all do take the vaccinations the whole world is unlocked down but 5g fears are what seem to unite them there's an appeal from over 240 scientists and doctors formally appealing to the un asking for the stopping of 5g it's already been stopped in a lot of cities and countries it was there that we met john 5g when that gets turned up that's when they're going to start blaming the second wave all that kids are going to get done with pogba radiation poisoning this ain't no vibrancy there is no coronavirus they're not treating people with coronal fires they ain't they're suppliers [Music] my name's john i'm a carer for my dad i'm a personal qualified personal trainer my spare time i like to do boxing and train my clients so we met you at the protest why why did you decide to go my concerns over 5g there is no virus in my eyes because everywhere they're turning on 5g is where this so-called virus is coming now i've had concerns over 5g for over four or five years now vast majority of scientists think think that it's safe they don't they don't that's what the media are telling everybody the proper scientists have come out and said it's not safe i know my body for 10 years it's been a certain way until they brought a 5g tower to around about literally two minutes from my house and i've got a metal jaw and that's that's that's been in agony i've had headaches i've had eyeballs feel like they're boiling i'm getting rashes i'm getting my psoriasis has come up when it never has and all this has happened within five weeks since they put a 5g tower next to my house i mean have you been to the doctor about that i'm not going nowhere near an nhs the hospitals they're murdering people doctors get into medicine no doctors nothing so what do you think is really going on then i think it's a new world order he's pulling the strings bill gates they're wiping people out with the radiation and then you're gonna come for the children with your vaccines the same man who wants to vaccinate us is the same man who wants to depopulate the world i mean vaccines stop people from getting they don't they don't they don't they don't there is no virus a lot of people have died from this no they haven't we've been we're being played whatever way is we're being played when i deal with people that are anti-5g they're very frequently anti-vaccine they're very frequently anti-medicine in the conventional sense bill gates has put an awful lot of his work into vaccinating people in developing countries and we do that because after clean water and sanitation there is nothing that saves more lives and vaccination that makes him a villain to people that are ideologically opposed to vaccination so to accept that 5g is secretly doing his harm you have to then accept that the who and the center for disease control and all these international health protection bodies are lying to us and as it goes on you have to accept more and more to preserve your initial belief and that drives people deeper and deeper into i'd say the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and conspiracy theorists have turned on people in unexpected ways in april a pair of amateur 5g fans noticed their website had suddenly become a lot more popular today i'm in grimsby a northeast lincolnshire fishing town which also happens to have a 5g site in the town center which you'll be able to see right behind me here and that's the site i'm going to be testing out today i'm jake i'm peter and today we are in oxford city centre to look at networks peter and jake are 5g enthusiasts they run a site that maps out the masts around the country so we're now near jublie gardens and just to the side of jake there is a three samsung small cell three do actually have small cells yes that recently we saw a spike in um traffic to the website at first we were just like oh oh our seo must be really good you know we're at the top of the google search results people must just be interested in 5g it was only when we started to look on the stop 5g pages that we realized it was a bit worse than we'd actually thought 5g tower zero g now yeah remember when lots of celebrities were posting about 5g that week there were 20 arson attacks on masts the website traffic increased by about three thousand percent but some pages were increasing in traffic by over about fourteen thousand percent one group in particular was specifically titled as a mast arson competition and that's when we made the rather sad decision that it was probably best to start to take down some of the pages in another part of the internet one doctor has stepped up in the fight against misinformation did 5g cause coronavirus people suggested that 5g damaged the immune system and boosted the viruses this is not true dr karan rangarajan is a surgeon in the nhs how do you know coronavirus is real well apart from all the you know science and medicine and ct scans and chest x-rays and tests that we've had to prove it exists i've had coronavirus he's become an online medical myth buster 5g mobile data is transmitted over radio waves these radio waves are non-ionizing which means they don't damage the dna inside our cells unlike x-rays gamma rays and uv rays spread knowledge not the virus i did a video on youtube and on tick tock the comments which dominated the comment thread are all about how i'm not a physicist which is obviously accurate but you know you don't need to be a physicist to know that 5g doesn't cause coronavirus you need to be a human with common sense and logic the real worry is young kids and other people who could be for once of a better term brainwashed by these ludicrous theories which doesn't just stop with five gene coronavirus you know it goes to vaccines and then young mothers not vaccinating their kids you know and by not vaccinating we can have outbreaks of these things we don't want that it's been over seven weeks since most people have seen their loved ones around 300 people have taken part in a protest against the lockdown but a week after the last protest there was another and it was much bigger tom simons was there the protesters gathered near speaker's corner making few attempts to keep their distance from one another they opposed the government's measures some saying that the virus was a hoax piers corbin the brother of the former labour leader was among those led away it had been a while since i'd seen john from the last protest so i met up with him on the eve of the final clap for carers how's it going so how have you been since last time absolutely still in pain from the 5g towers that's about it my jaw um we have to keep going don't we instead of clapping he's made a sign i agree strongly with this no clapping for the murderers no to 5g and the radiation that comes with it because all our kids are going to be harmed it's that time again loud and proud let's all clap for our carers while the rest of the uk were clapping john held his cardboard i remembered something he'd said earlier when i spoke to you last time i think you said you were a carer yes i'm a carer myself it's called clap for carers so really they're happy for you yeah well i don't want no one to clap for me because i'm a carer for my dad which i'll do for free i don't want no help from no government i don't want no one to clap for me these are the things that we should be doing anyway the nhs they're doing their job [Music] how is your dad at this moment he's touch and go on what's happening and how long he's got but i've got him comfortable do you think maybe it might be good to spend you know the time and effort that you're putting into this you could be spending it with your dad i get that but again it comes down to humanity i i can't sit back and rest while i know we are being murdered do you worry that you're you're isolating yourself a bit there no i'm not i was isolated away from the world anyway because the world has too many nasty evil greedy people in it so i my life hasn't changed much i don't care what anyone thinks i lose my own family over this i stand by my beliefs i have fire in my soul and i will not back down john is one of a growing minority who believe in the 5g theories and that anger is having a big impact around the country welcome on board this avanti west coast service to liverpool line street there's been nearly a hundred mass fires since the start of lockdown merseyside has been a hot spot i'm not aware of us having any attacks against 5g masts prior to the covid 19 pandemic detective chief superintendent mark comey has had to set up a unit dedicated to investigating the fires the most side police received a call from a member of the public who had seen three figures running away from a telecommunications mast and he could see that the master was on fire we found the partial burnt remains of a rubber glove when we sent that off for dna examination a profile came back for michael witte michael witte was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to arson this is the first time we've had a conviction in the uk it is arson that they're committing it's a very serious offence this is foolish behaviour done by stupid people who don't understand the impact of what their actions are doing to the wider community removing a key means of communication for people who may be vulnerable to get in touch with emergency services or to get in touch with their own loved ones it's an attack on our national infrastructure [Music] today we can say that our long national hibernation is beginning to come to an end and life is returning to our streets the uk is emerging from a lockdown infected by damaging misinformation theories about 5g mutated and multiplied undermining social distancing and potentially stopping people from getting future vaccines meaning this conspiracy theory could have a toxic legacy for all of us",

Today we're going to be\nintroducing a brand new product, the Mister Sprayer Full Function Atomizer. Now, what this is gonna do\nis going to help you guys who are in the waterless wash business, or if you're just\nlooking for an easier way to spread on your quick\ndetailers, glass cleaners, even your fabric protectants, all right here, while reducing fatigue. And, you can see right off the bat, we've got this eye catching design here with this red, overall effect. This is gonna make it easier to spot, so you don't leave it at a job, or potentially run it over\nwhere you can't see it. Also, it's got a really,\ndurable plastic body, which is gonna make it\nsafer if it's dropped. It's gonna reduce the chances\nof it breaking over time. And then, it's also got the\ndilution ratio over here, so you know exactly how much\nproduct to use on every job. Now, again, you can use this\nwith your waterless wash, your quick detail sprays, glass cleaners, and for those of you guys who're offering different kinds of interior protectants, you can also use this\nwith your fabric guard. Simply spray it on there,\nlock the trigger down, and this is gonna reduce\nfatigue, save you time, as well as some product. Now, today we have this Subaru\nOutback in the shop here, and I'm gonna show you just\nhow quickly we can detail it using Mr. Sprayer. All you have to do is adjust\nit to your proper fan here. We have it on the light mist. Give it a few pumps, (pumping sound) and you can simply pull the\ntrigger down and lock it. So, for those of you guys who have a mobile, detailing business, where you're having to\nconstantly add pressure, or hold down the trigger all day, that creates a lot of fatigue, which makes it not so much fun to do your detailing business. But also, this is a great tool for those of you who live in an apartment, or don't have access to running water, where you're kind of confined to working in either a carport, or\nmaybe even on the street. You need something where\nyou can quickly spray it on, and wipe it off. Now, this is a great way to do that, 'cause now you have your\nfavorite, cleaning product right here in one solution. You don't have to grab multiple bottles. Just simply spray it, and wipe it off with a clean, microfiber towel. And, just like we do\nwith any waterless wash, we start at one point,\nworking in linear motions, and we roll the towel so that\nwe're not dragging the dirt, causing scratches or swirls. And then, you can come\nback and buff it off with a clean towel, or the\nother side of the towel, which is why we fold it in fours. But, like I mentioned, you can use this with your waterless\nwash, such as EcoSmart, you can use it with Swift wipe, or if you're just looking\nto touch up your car, use it with your favorite\nquick detail spray. You can also use it with\nyour favorite, glass cleaner, so that you're having your\nglass cleaning solution in one bottle. Also, if you're diluting\nany kind of chemicals, you can keep it in one solution bottle, so you don't have to constantly\nbreak out multiple bottles, or search for where you\nmay have left it last time. But, you can see here,\njust quick and simple, spray it on and wipe it off. You can also use it on your glass, no matter what products you're using. Just add a little 50/50 here. We'll give that a moment\njust to kind of saturate. And, you can also use multiple towels, such as a blue, waffle weave, but for today's demonstration we'll choose the green, Workhorse towel. And, again, working in linear motions. Just pickin' up all\nthe spent product here. Buff off any excess, and pro tip is to lift\nup the windshield wiper. This way you're removing\nanything that's underneath there, 'cause there's always that layer of dirt. You can come back, and\nwipe the blade itself. And, you can see there's just\na light layer of dirt on here, because this is a daily driver. It gets driven a lot, and it's\nalso sitting outside a lot, so it's going to get dirty. So, this is the quick and easy way to just simply clean it up\nto make it look its best. Now, you can check out the\nMr. Sprayer on our website, http://www.chemicalguys.com, or at your local, detail garage. This is gonna make your waterless\nwash, quick detail sprays, glass cleaning, clay lubing, or even your fabric protection, a lot easier and a lot smoother. If you liked today's video, be\nsure to give it a thumbs up, drop your comments down below, and anything you guys\nmay have questions on, or anything you guys wanna see. We'll see you next time, right\nhere, in the detail garage. (energetic, electronic music)", "Uau_eKoRn6c": "Okay Josh do you want to see something cool? Yeah!\nOkay, so I'm gonna light this candle and what should happen is the wick burns... And what happens now? It will melt? See, it melts Oh yeah you're right so once\nit's got a little wax around I'm going to blow it out and I want you to watch\nvery very carefully After 3. 1...2...3 You didn't touch it! That's right I didn't touch it! Candles are made of wax. When you light\nthe wick the heat melts the wax and turns it into a liquid. This liquid is\ndrawn up through the wick. As it travels up the wick the liquid gets hotter and\nevaporates. It turns into a gas The gas mixes with the oxygen in the air and\ncatches fire from the original flame Once this happens the candle flame comes\nfrom the burning wax gas not the burning wick. When you blow out the\ncandle the wick stays hot for a while so the wax continues to evaporate. This means there's still some gas above the wick. So when you bring a flame close to\nthe wick this gas catches fire and relights the candle Okay Josh now I've\ngot a jar here I'm going to put it over the top of the candle what do you think\nwill happen? It'll go out. It will go out Why do you think it would go out? Because the air doesn't come in I wonder how long it will take for it to\ngo out? Immediately! Immediately okay well let's have a go. A candle flame is a\nresult of a chemical reaction between the gas from the wax and the oxygen in\nthe air when you trap a candle under a jar it only has a limited amount of\noxygen. When that runs out the candle can't burn anymore so the flame goes out. Do you think it changes if I change the size of the jar? Yeah. Let's have a go It takes a longer time! That's interesting And it goes out slower Should we have a go with a\nbigger jar? Yeah! Do you think we can time it? Yeah! Science experiments often involve\nchanging one thing and seeing what happens. We can learn about the world\njust by looking at things but scientists usually go beyond just looking and\nmeasure things Measurements help describe things more\nprecisely and make scientific results

and total cost resins and resident pigments Kevin Ted breather bearded joiner will be showing us how it's done we'll be walking you through the steps involved choosing and prepping the wood creating the mold sealing the wood the main resin pour and the finishing process le chem recommends that you always follow good industrial hygiene this includes wearing gloves safety glasses and allowing sufficient ventilation [Music] for our project we're using this lovely piece of elm when selecting your would ensure it is seasoned dry and as flat as possible your local timber merchants can help you with this the wood will need to be cut planed and passed through a thicker sir again your timber merchants or local joinery shop will be able to help you with this next the size of the table and the shape of the river need to be determined for our project we're making a coffee table and the size is approximately 900 by 600 millimeters [Music] now we're going to prep the live-edge make sure there's no dust or dirt and remove any loose bark or burrs now we're ready to move on to the mop for our mold we're using Milla mine MDF however you can use most plastics such as polypropylene or acrylic sheet [Music] we recommend you apply a release agent to the mold this will help to easily remove the table afterwards make sure the mold is clean dust free and watertight prior to setting the wood into the mold tape over any major knots or holes this stops the resin from leaking out from the underside lay the wood into the mold and once level we're ready to seal the edges and fill any knots or holes this helps stop air ingress from the wood during the main pool we're using le chemin total cost for this as it gives us a quicker curing time however if you have more time you can simply use deep cast for both ceiling and the main pool we've left our total cost to dry for 12 hours and we're now ready for the main resin pour we are using le chemin deep cast clear epoxy casting resin for our River this resin is optically clear UV stable non-toxic low odor and mixed in a two-to-one ratio to work out the amount of resin needed we're taking the length of the table and multiplying it by the average width of the river in metres we then multiply that by the depth in millimeters in this case nor point nine meters times nine point two meters times twenty five millimeters gives us 4.5 liters of resin pour the measured quantities of resin and hardener into your mixing container and stir three to five minutes be thorough and scrape around the sides and base to ensure everything is encapsulated into the mix will be adding color with resident turquoise pigment and we have a range of 18 colors to choose from le cam D cast gives you a long working window so there is no need to rush you can pour up to fifty millimeters in depth in a single pour just before the main pour make sure your table is clamped down to the mold using wooden standoffs [Music] now you can see why it's called a river table [Music] you can add more pigment into the resin after the initial call if you want a bolder final color [Music] next pass a blowtorch or heat gun over the resin surface to remove mixing bowls it is a good idea to cover your work to protect from dust or debris we chose to cover with a river table we made earlier however you can use rigid sheeting such as carpet leave your table for seven days or four D molding it is now ready for machining and sanding for the initial machining we used a router and jig to take off approximately two millimeters if you don't have this equipment available you can use a handheld sander then we moved on to sanding starting at 80 grade moving up to 120 160 240 and so on right up to 3000 with wet and dry [Music] we chose to bevel the edges of our table this is optional but gives a nice rounded edge [Music] once you're happy with the finish where the wood and resin meet we recommend applying a wood oil to bring out grain and a polishing compound on the resin for the final wow factor [Music] [Music] le chem dick cast is available in a range of six sizes from 300 mil up to 30 7.5 liter kits and is available to buy online here is a summary of the equipment and materials used to make this beautiful table [Music] [Applause] [Music] elack MD cast is extremely versatile and not limited to only River tables here are some of the other projects we have recently completed these amazing resin wood cubes are perfect for stalls or occasional tables you can also try coasters serving platters and cheese ports [Music]

the older popcorn type ceilings whatever the texture is on the ceiling will melt away as soon as water hits it so you want to prevent this from happening first and foremost by using soy candles beeswax candles things that are not gonna you know leave such things that are non-toxic but if you do have sit on your ceiling hopefully you don't have a textured ceiling and you can just grab a bucket put either a splash of vinegar or a splash of bleach in there I'll let you make that decision I always use vinegar but sometimes when there's bad stains bleach is the only thing that's gonna work really well but you only put a little splash in this whole bucket even with bleach I think with one gallon you use a tablespoon of bleach you don't need much at all next you want to grab a broom and remove any cobwebs you know just go through your wall remove any cobwebs because once you have a wet mop up there cobwebs just make the whole process more difficult so remove all your cobwebs and then get your mop dunk it into your solution and use this just reach up and clean the spot now most likely it's going to make a spot on your ceiling and you're gonna have to go back and repaint it that's just how it is ceilings are a little more sensitive than walls are I don't know what it is on them I think this ceiling is just painted so this one is gonna be easier to clean than a textured ceiling like I said before but just make sure you have some paint that matches just in case you need to go back over it and try to avoid doing that again by using soy candles or beeswax candles they're not gonna leave soot and that's it I'm Rachel you too sis and that is how you remove smoke from ceilings", "Obth7ykXOBQ": "[Music] what retired original you're tired of reading somebody

chemicals, mostly this is because I'm tired of all the\npeople complaining about all the \"chemicals\" that they are exposed to when literally everything\nyou have ever been exposed to, including the most organically grown lettuce\nis composed entirely of chemicals. But when I say everything is chemicals, I\nam in fact wrong. There are quite a lot of things that aren't\nchemicals: sound, heat, laser beams, the existential\nconcept of selfness...rainbows. All of those things are things. And all of the things and also all other things\nare, in fact -- oh god this is weird but it's true --\nthey're all the same thing: energy. Everything is energy. [Theme Music] Let's talk about trebuchets. The trebuchet was a weapon of war, but it is also a feat of ancient engineering so I remember it for that instead of for all the people it killed. Well, I happen to have a very small one that\nI built from a kit, because I'm a nerd. This tiny trebuchet contains quite a lot of\nenergy. In fact, more than you might suspect. And because we are humans and we like to understand\nstuff, we shall put the energy it contains into a\nbunch of different boxes. Let's start with the least obvious one: its mass, since, as Einstein told us, energy and mass are the same thing. Now we're not gonna go into detail there, instead we'll just say that the energy is well and locked up and extremely difficult to access because the nuclear energy of the wood is\nnot easy to release. Which is excellent, because the nuclear energy\nof this trebuchet, if released, could destroy the entire building that I'm\nsitting in. This little war machine also has thermal energy; anything warmer than absolute zero has thermal\nenergy, even very very cold things. This basically means that all of the individual\natoms and molecules are jiggling imperceptibly. Only at absolute zero would they stop jiggling. If I were to touch it then my hand would instantly\nfreeze and then fall off of me. Absolute zero is very cold. It also has chemical energy, which is stored\nin the bonds between the atoms. All of the bonds in the molecules of cellulose\nand lignin that make up the wood contain energy, and some of them could be broken, releasing\nthat energy, which is what would happen if I lit my trebuchet\non fire, which I will not do because it took like four\nhours to put together. Now none of those forms of energy are the forms of energy that the ancient generals were interested in, of course, but I wanted to illustrate how\nmuch energy really is in there. What the ancient generals were interested in was the system's gravitational potential energy, because this heavy thing here which is full\nof pennies -- oh God, that's dangerous -- this thing is heavy, it's full of pennies,\nand it has been lifted up, and the force of gravity is trying to pull it back down. This stored gravitational energy is a form\nof potential energy; that is, energy contained within a system\nbecause of its position. This does not mean that it has the potential\nto become energy. It is energy.\nIt's just stored. If it wasn't there, and then it was, then\nyou would be creating energy. And as we all know, you cannot create energy. Like, we all do know that, right? It's the first law of thermodynamics, also\nknown as the law of conservation of energy, which is a real, hard and fast, not just unbreakable\nbut unbendable law of physics. Energy cannot be created and it cannot be\ndestroyed. The amount of energy in the universe is constant. And since everything is energy, the amount of everything in the universe is constant, which is a little bit trippy. Deep thoughts like that one are what formalized\nthe study of energy into what we call thermodynamics, the branch of science studying heat, energy,\nand the ability of that energy to do work. Okay, now I just said three words that you think you know the definition of but you probably don't. That's okay, you're gonna be wrong many times\nin your life, this is just one of them. So, what were those words? Energy. I know that you don't know what energy\nis, because, like, I don't either. Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman\nsaid: \"it is important to realize that in physics today we have no knowledge of what energy is.\" But let's just give the same cop-out answer\nthat my textbook gives, which is: \"the capacity to do work or produce heat.\" Work. In the common vernacular, that's anything\nthat you have to do but you don't want to. But in physics and chemistry, work is when\na force acts on something, causing it to move. If nothing moves, then no work is done. There are a few different symbols that represent\nwork, we're going to use the lowercase \"w.\" Heat. Which is maybe the most misunderstood\nword in chemistry after the word chemicals. Heat is not something that objects contain. Just like something can't have work, something\ncan't have heat. Instead, heat, just like work, is an energy\ntransfer. But instead of transferring energy by mechanical\nmovement, heat is a transfer of energy by thermal interactions,\nsuch as radiation or thermal conduction. Now crazy as this might seem, those are the\nonly two things that energy can do. It can either be work applying force and moving\nthings or it can be exchanged as heat. Both process result in an energy transfer\nbetween systems. And just in case you weren't confused enough, the most common symbol for heat is lowercase \"q.\" Yup. Lowercase \"q,\" deal with it. Little-known fact: the word \"heat\" used to\nstart with a silent q, but it was dropped in the seventeenth century\nwhen -- I'm just making stuff up. So we're just gonna have to move on, leave\nthat behind us, and think about what happens when the amount\nof energy in a system changes. If you're currently freaking out, thinking, like, \"but Hank, you just said that the amount of energy never changes!\" I will remind you that I said \"in the universe.\" See, when we're doing thermo, we get to divide\nthe universe into two parts, which is actually a pretty cool thing to get\nto do. One part is the system, the thing that we're\nstudying, and everything else is the surroundings. The surroundings allow the amount of energy\nin the system to change. That change just has to come from or go to\nthe surroundings. And we get to decide where that line is. We could say that the system is the rock that\nthe trebuchet propels, or the sling, or the trebuchet itself, or the face of the\npoor guy that the rock runs into. Whether it's the Earth-trebuchet system, or the rock-face system, or the entire observable universe system, we get to decide based on what we're interested\nin studying. Every system has an internal energy, the sum of all that system's kinetic and potential energy. The internal energy of the system is represented\nby a capital \"E\", and usually we're interested in changes in\nthat system. And the way we represent change in chemistry\nand physics is with the Greek letter delta(\u0394), so we stick the delta in front of the \"E\" for \"\u0394E\", the change in the energy of the system. The change in the energy of the system is\nequal to the heat plus the work. The simplest equation you're ever gonna see\non Crash Course Chemistry. There are two basic outcomes when you're looking\nat this internal energy equation. The first is that \u0394E is positive.\nIt's gaining energy from the surroundings. That's the case if work is done on the system\nor heat is transferred to the system. Like if I were to do some work to get the\ntrebuchet ready to fire, \u0394E is positive. The system is gaining energy from its surroundings,\nwhich includes my arms and muscles. If work is done by the system or heat is transferred\nfrom the system to the surroundings, those w and q get negative signs resulting\nin a decrease in \u0394E, or a loss of energy from the system to the\nsurroundings. Like when the trebuchet fires, the trebuchet's \u0394E is negative from the transfer of energy to the ping pong ball. So what in the name of Willard Gibbs does\nany of this have to do with chemistry? Well, the energy stored in molecular bonds,\nchemical energy, is a kind of potential energy. It exists because of the position of the particles\nin the molecule. Just like with the trebuchet, in chemistry\nwe can put energy into molecules, and take it out, and even use it to do work, creating war machines millions of times more powerful than the biggest siege engine ever constructed, but also creating tools to feed and clothe\nthe world. Some reactions release energy, like if I lit my trebuchet on fire -- which again I will not do! Why do I keep bringing that up!? Burning is the rapid oxidation of chemical\ncompounds, and as it results in a heat flow out of the\nsystem we call that an exothermic reaction. But other reactions suck energy out of the\nenvironment and into the system. These endothermic reactions occur when heat\nflows into the system. Like in your car engine, at the high temperatures\nof combusting fuel, Nitrogen and Oxygen will suck some of that energy into chemical bonds forming nitric oxide, a poisonous gas that I once inhaled a dangerous amount of, but I'll save that story for our lab safety episode. Chemistry, it turns out, is largely a study\nof energy. The energy stored in bonds, transferred between atoms and molecules to find stable forms and released to the environment to do work. It's just like the trebuchet: put energy in, store it, and then take it back out to do something interesting, fun or useful. That's basically everything that ever happens summed up in one little siege engine. Not bad. Thanks for watching this episode of Crash\nCourse Chemistry. If you were paying attention, you learned\nthat everything is energy; that there are lots of different forms of\nenergy including potential energy, which is energy contained within a system because of the position or arrangement of its components. And you learned that chemical energy is a kind of potential energy, energy stored up in bonds between atoms. Also you hopefully already knew that energy\ncan neither be created nor destroyed, and that the amount of energy in the universe\nis constant; but when studying thermodynamics we divide\nthe universe into the system and its surroundings, and a system could give energy to or take\nenergy out of those surroundings. You learned that energy can be transferred in two ways: work, which is force applied over a distance, and heat, which is the transfer of energy\nby thermal interaction. And finally, you learned that all of this is just as applicable to chemistry as it is to trebuchets.

It's still pretty cringy. Hope you guys enjoy and hopefully it doesn't get removed So in Attack on Titan they use these really awesome swords to fight giants, known as Titans. The swords kind of resemble giant box cutters, and the blades are actually disposable because sometimes they actually get stuck inside the Titan. Which means we're gonna need a lot of swords And since I'm a Hacksmith and not a blacksmith we decided against trying to build these swords from scratch. Instead, Medieval Depot stepped in and provided us with replica Attack on Titan swords, which we're going to modify. These replica swords feature a fixed blade, so we're gonna have to take them apart. While we'd like to modify these handles it would actually be easier to design and build from scratch to make them work exactly the way we want. All right So we've got the handle complete we used the tormach PCNC 440 milling machine to make the mechanism of aluminum and then the TAZ 5 3D Printer to print the handle. The mechanism itself works great, but now we're going to have to make a sheath to hold all the extra blades. But as you know, a Make It Real project is not complete until we test it to its limits... enjoy. Now before you get too excited, we haven't made Omnidirectional gear yet, just this prop. But we do have a stunt wire system from an old project which we use as an ODM training system. That's impossible It's a titan... I'll Drive every last titan out of the city, and they will all die by my blades Well hope you guys enjoyed that project and hopefully YouTube doesn't remove this video too, but don't worry, we have lots of new projects on the way, so make sure you're subscribed with notifications turned on.

of my table trays a couple weeks ago I did a beach themed one and the glitter tape on so today and both of them were white so today I am gonna do a black one what I've done so far is took some sandpaper and just roughed up this edge I mixed up my paints in here so I guess linked with our pan and just roughed up the surface of this tray so in the last video you seeing you probably saw that I got some resin art pigments so let me get the video before had pretty much a close-up on all of them but I'll run through them real quick this is the teal Magnolia this is her new glitter Diamond Collection and this is what it looks like mixed up and then we have the amaryllis which is her red and this each one of these have like glitter in them you can see the Purple's blues all of them like every color from the rainbow is in there then we have the oops Andromeda this is super pretty I don't know if you guys can even see this do you see all that sparkle in there maybe I can get you closer see that the greens and the blues that's Andromeda I'm using two of the bling it's I'm using the bling it gold yeah it's the bling it gold Sparkle and I'm using the bling it red sparkle I don't know if you can see in there so I wanted to show you guys how easy it is to mix mm so I'm going to mix the tiger eye in front of you now there is a proprietary wetting agent that reduces the mixing time and it really does so here I've just got the you know this is the tiger eye here I just got the dry pigment okay just put the ribbon in and then I could how easy it doesn't melts like it just melts in there it's very cool I'll show you a close-up and get it off the stick so you don't want no chunks but this is the tiger eye it's very bronzy bronzy gold alright so here we go today I am using stone coat countertop resin this will be a table so I want it to be heat resistant and I just put glitter back in my table again guess it don't matter cuz you're not gonna see it alright so first off I am scratched up this the surface and I'm going to lay down some clear I'm gonna keep some clear in case I need other colors or if I want to add clear to add depth into the table later so I'm just going to smear this around just to cover the edge so that my resin when I heat it up it'll move slowly or move better kind of like when you're doing acrylics you want to put a base coat down and let your colors move better same here and it also adds depth too so I don't really have a plan here I'm just gonna put these colors on and we're going to mix them around so I'm gonna change out this club gonna check to make sure you lurk in the maybe get your little closer on the glove don't want to go on all right a little bit closer let me see all right so I'm just going to let me put these colors away I just don't want resin all over them I'm gonna heat it up just a little bit just to get it warm and the bubbles popped so clunky ears for a second [Applause] you gotta get a skewer because I already see dog hair it's so strange because I don't allow my dog in here just because all the chemicals and stuff and I can't really you know protect them I can put a mask on myself but I just don't want to do anything to harm them so they are not allowed in the studio but of course their hair comes in on me so all right I'm gonna go ahead and put my mask on yeah in here that's nice napped my face it left a damn mark okay now this is Stone Koch countertop so it's not going to start curing for probably 45 minutes to an hour so I probably don't need my mask on right now but again I just don't want to take any chances so all right okay so we are going to I don't have a plan like I said I just don't know if I should do puddle pores your stripes mmm it did to new well yeah we'll just wing it we will wing it right it's the first time using these galaxies diamond pigments I probably went overboard by not using like another color besides it but it's gonna be very blingy it's okay this is the teal Magnolia it looks pretty fantastic all these colors are awesome this could be a very very sparkly table oh wow this is the end Andromeda Wow my husband loves blue I bet he's gonna he'd love this color alright seems like they might be home they went to the store so you might be busting in any time so we'll end it with a little bit more of this Tiger eye it did be thinner thinner lines just so that it would kind of just disperse all right so I'm going to put a little bit of clear in the middle here hang on one second what's up yeah just a little bit because then it does clear see how the clear would do and that gold is like it makes like a crater hi so now I'm gonna use this bling it right in the middle this is the bling it red Sparkle just gonna put like get in it areas and so that it would be in like bigger areas instead of just lines for now anyway see you can see that red you see the red in there in the blanket and now I'm going to put a little bit more clear inside the bling it which looks pretty cool I call it Windows when you do that it like opens a window don't know if that's when it's called but once I blow it around you're probably not gonna see any a so I'll be saving some clear for that effect for later but I just wanted to layer it for the bling it gold Sparkle okay so I'm gonna heat it up for a minute so watch your ears [Applause] and move it around a little bit with my heat gun and then I'm going to fill I just want to get it to the edges [Applause] just like the middle part [Applause] cuz I'm hoping my silver like careful cuz if you do get these strays with the heat gun they do get hot some kind of want to just tilt it that way and it'll drag out this circle and then we're gonna bring it back the other way see how the clears under it and then the colors are just going over it all right I kind of don't like it someone do something else let's do something more crazy this is so pretty the colors not the painting it run it through okay now on top of that red I'm gonna put some of that bling at red not that it needs any more Sparkle but I figured it'll really pop next to the amaryllis okay so doing the little lines compared to these thick lines it'll just like put like a kind of like a glittery line in it I'm going to add the a dromeda outside of like not right in the middle because I want it to kind of push see that way it's kind of in the middle but it's like two different all right I don't know how long might come my phone's gonna last here I might have to dump it and come back which sucks because I'm in the middle of uploading for like the third time okay okay so I'm gonna heat it up a bit and I want it real hot because I'm gonna run my hand through it so first of all I think it's crooked it's like it's killing me so all right so I'm gonna get these back over there and I'm just gonna use my fingers and we're going to go through it like that hey guys I'm sorry my phone got full just as I was rubbing my was just taking my fingers my gloved hand and made swirls right then my phone got full I went to go dump it on my computer my computer was full look because I had all the videos on it videos take up a ton of space so my resin was setting up so you didn't get to see me make my swirls so basically I just in the beginning I did some you seen I did the some puddle pores and stuff and I took my hand and I went like this around the outside okay and then I took this it's not a skewer it's kind of like a dowel but it's got a smooth kind of end so I basically just I let it set up for about 30 minutes so that it would hold its swirls and I basically just took took the skewer and did some swirls on it okay swirled them in and then toward the edges I did take a sharp skewer and you can see like it wasn't looking right because some of the edges didn't have like squirrels in it and it looked dumb so let me see if I can find one of them [Music] mmm-hmm the swirl here kind of looks a little oblong shaped so let me see so basically I just take it see how the resin is setting up see how it's more defined it was like losing its shape so so basically that was what I did with the swirls so now I'm just letting this set up and then I'm probably going to need to put a clear coat on it so I probably won't show with a clear coat unless something dramatic happens so once this sets up I will show you what it will look like it goes on on the little stand on the table see excuse my mess I've been oops I've been pouring out um come on having problems wording again flowerpots that one this one's actually alcohol inks and then I threw glitter on it so so anyway so that's gonna be my little stand table and then once I get the clear coat on it depending who knows you know me I'll probably put a clear coat with glitter on it but those colors are so glittery on its own I love that part right there with the teal in the red okay so there you have it guys there's my little tray stand and then like I said this got a little suction cups on them so it's just removable it can be a serving tray or yeah and I will have these tables list it down in the description also so I think that is it if I decide to do something different with this I'll have a follow-up video but I think I'm pretty happy with the way it turned out so yeah alright thanks for watching guys you", "OP-BrU45ayY": "hey what's good guys thanks for stopping by things click on the video as always you know I think we can all agree that one of the most annoying things in PvP when you're fighting other players besides true patriot pestilence that's a different story is status effects so like lead fire right phone blind so with this bill I really wanted to take my time and some of the gameplay footage that you're gonna be seeing here and the video is gonna be an early version of the build but the build is complete so I'm gonna show you guys the final version today but really I was just sick and tired of the bleed and the fire and being set on fire from that exotic holster because it's really annoying because we were set on fire you can't 80s you can't fight you have to shoot from the hip if I'm going face to face with another team and they're just luring lead hives and fire starter chem launchers and riot foams and to the point where I can't even shoot I mean what's really the point you know you want to make sure you have a good counter against that and I've been working on this build for a pretty long time to make sure I had all the right pieces I've experimented with a lot of different things I've taken some things out added some different things and you'll notice here from the gameplay I added a shield which is awesome you guys are gonna love this the best thing about this build everything makes sense all the pieces all the talents all the attributes everything just synergizes so so well guys so on this build we have a hundred percent bleed resistance about 95 percent burn resistance and everything else across the board like disrupt and snare all the other stuff blind is that like eighty five percent which is a really really good spot to be in now I know what you're thinking at this point cold you have all of this resistance bleed fire and snare blind you probably sacrificed all your armor and all your damage well I got some news for you guys you don't really have to sacrifice anything on this build we have the damage we have the armor we have the survivability and we have the immunity to the two most annoying status effects okay bleed and burn this build is gonna allow you to tank a lot of players it's gonna allow you to push through stinger hives if somebody lights you up with the firestarter chem launcher it's really not gonna do anything to you you can run through fire it won't touch you you're not gonna be confused anything like that but I also love the talents on this build the chestpiece talents specifically put your enemies in a vulnerable state and you're over here with bleed resistance and burn resistance and other stuff like that and you're gonna have a huge huge advantage over other people that don't have a setup like yours so without further ado you guys have been asking for it you've been telling me to drop it drop it drop it so what we're gonna do right now is go over the entire build super excited to share this with you guys so let's go ahead and take a look at it so this is what we have right here guys take a look at it real quick this is an awesome awesome setup so first things first we're using technician now you might be wondering cold why are you using technician on a build with only one skill tier and no skills that do damage well I'll tell you in this video stick with me okay so we're using technician we're gonna skip that for a second here our primary weapon is this nasty military AKM that my guy reasonable actually dropped for me my clan shoutout to reasonable it's hitting 486 k damage okay so like I said you guys are probably thinking that we had to sacrifice damage on this build we did not we're still hitting very hard and we have talents on this build that's gonna make us hit even harder this is a god roll military AKM okay 15% AR damage 11% health damage six percent damage to armor and then we got sadist okay deal 20% weapon damage to bleeding enemies after four kills applies bleed to the next enemy that you hit you're also probably wondering told you don't have a bleed hive on this build give me a second here so we have sadist on the primary I'm using an eagle bearers my secondary it's a level 30 Eagle bear remember all of your exotics scale up in PvP so you can go into the dark zone with level 30 exotics and they can compete with the level 40 weapons as well okay it's a good thing to remember let's take a look at the pieces so this is the way I decided to run it there's a couple of different ways you can do this now I went with three piece killer Seska and one piece y'all so let's start with the mask okay this mask is awesome it's the night watcher high-end named masks because we have three pieces of gila on its going to give us five percent of total armor ten percent health and one percent armor regeneration now that armor regeneration is definitely not something to brag about but it's gonna help you out in situations where you don't have a med kit and you cleared out an enemy team you're gonna get your armor back this mask is pretty much God roll 153 kr mer a hundred percent pulse haste is exclusive to this mask now I want this to be very clear to everybody a hundred percent pulse haste does not apply to all the pulses in the game and only applies to the regular pulse that scans enemies alright so right now in this build alright we only have one skill tier and our pulse is only on a nine second cooldown so every nine seconds you can activate the pulse and you're gonna have a lot of awareness as to what's going on around you and it might not seem that important but knowing where players are at every nine seconds is gonna give you an advantage of promise you and then I rolled 10% hazard protection and I put a 10% burn resistance mod on the mask let's move on to the chess piece okay this is my second piece of Gilla 117 KR mur 8.3 percent hazard protection it could be max but it's pretty close to max either way we also have status effects as an attribute and that's only going to help us out because we actually have trauma on the chess piece all right we have bleed resistance as a mod 8.4% the mods are really gonna get you to that ninety five a hundred percent so depending on the mods that you put on all the blue mod slots on your build that's gonna determine which resistance you want to prioritize you know so this chest piece talent right here okay it's synergizes very well with the backpack talent that we have which is wicked so applies blind to an enemy hit in the head cooldown thirty seconds but we also apply bleed to an enemy when we hit them in the chest cooldown is also thirty seconds so every thirty seconds we have the ability to make a player go blind if we shoot them in the head but the most common thing that's probably gonna happen is when you shoot them in the chest we're gonna make them bleed so as you're unloading a clip into another player they're gonna bleed and while they're bleeding while you're shooting them your damage is gonna get buffed from sadist on your a kay so before I get into the last pieces of the build let's get a quick overview of what's going on with this build okay so we have 1.3 mil armor which is a really good spot to be in we have pretty good weapon damage alright that's the second thing so our aka is hitting 486 K and then when we activate sadist we're gonna get another damage buff alright and then the overall resistance survivability when it comes to this build is insane we have 83 percent overall hazard protection we have ninety eight point nine percent lead resistance okay I sacrifice point two percent bleed resistance just so I can use that chess piece with Gila but what a lot of people might not know and what I just found out actually every single one of these has a threshold what I mean by a threshold you don't have to get to 100% to have a hundred percent resistance okay I believe as long as you're at 91 to 93 percent somebody let me know in the comments below you're good you're golden I believe for burn resistance you only need like eighty eight percent to get full immunity so it's really not necessary to get to 100 percent you really don't need to as long as you're over 90 you're gonna be in a really really good spot eighty-three percent blind resistance ninety-three percent burn resistance and the rest are 83 percent because they're related to our overall hazard protection because we didn't put any blue mods to buff up any of these in particular so we only focused on bleed and burn resistance on this build so if you're running into player is that for example are running a jammer pulse you can throw disrupt resistance mods on your gear and get to 100% if you want to you know I mean so it's the choice is really up to you let's go back to the build so the holster right here is the third piece of Gila 170 K armor some armor regeneration and then I rolled 10% hazard protection so for the backpack and gloves were running Seska gear okay having two pieces of this on gives you 10% crit hit chance and 10% has a protection it's almost like this brand set was made for a build like this because that comes with a blue mudslide now I got really lucky with this backpack it came with God roll weapon damage which is awesome it also came with crit hit chance now you might be wondering you know why do you need this crit hit chance why is it on the build well critic chance is gonna help you out honestly a lot I mean the more you can crit the more damage you can do I think currently on this build we are sitting at 32% almost 33% crit hit chance and you'd be surprised how many times you're creating with this build I rolled 8.9% has a protection on here which shouldn't always be improved if I got a god roll and then I put a bleed resistance on here I'm still looking for a better mod but I really don't need it because I don't bleed but the backpack talent right here is what you guys want with a setup like this okay so let's go back to the chest piece we have trauma so when we shoot a player in the head we're gonna make them blind when we shoot a player in the chest we're gonna make them bleed every time trauma is activated we're gonna proc like it okay so applying a status effect lion and bleed increases total weapon damage by 18 percent for 20 seconds now get this the chest piece is on a 30 second cooldown so I can make a player bleed and wicked is gonna be proc for 20 seconds after wicked is over I only have to wait 10 seconds for trauma to come back and I can do it all over again you're with me and then for my gloves this is the second piece like I said you want two pieces of this brand set on for that hazard protection right these gloves are awesome the weapon damage is pretty high I rolled 10 percent has their protection on the gloves and we have 14 percent weapon handling which I'm not gonna complain about and then the last final piece are these y'all gear kneepads now the only way to get this brand set is from the dark zone so if you want this brand set if you want your head as a protection to be even higher you have to find this gear in the dark so it's a DZ exclusive so these knees give me about 120 3k armor 8% explosive resistance and I rolled almost God roll has a protection 9.8% now let's take a look at the skills alright now you're probably wondering cold why the hell do you have a shield on this build I'll show you right here so we have 1.3 mil armor on this build now if you're unaware armor is going to determine what your skill tier is gonna be with a shield so as you can see right here my shield right now is tier 5 because I have four blues the reason I have technician on this build like I said we're going to come back to it is because it gives you an extra skill tier that extra skill tier is putting your shield from skill tier 4 to skill tier 5 so it's buffing your shield up our shield is that a 19 second cooldown 4 million health active regeneration is all there for you like I said it's a tier 5 shield now to be honest with you when I first started this build I had a bleed high bond but then I kind of thought to myself I'm like wait I have one point three million armor I can put technician on and I can make my shield pretty tanky for a build that's not even SPECT into tankyness whatsoever so I decided to put this shield on and man was I not disappointed this shield is gonna allow you to tank a lot of damage through bursting players with glass can and rifle builds for example it's really gonna help you out because you can tank a shot or two and they're pretty easy to kill in most cases there's their square sheet so you can take them out and this is gonna allow you to take a little bit of extra damage before you go down and that extra bit of tankiness could be the difference between a win or a loss when you're going up against somebody and then for the second skill we're using a pulse I mean we have the nine Watcher mask on it only makes sense 9 second cooldown pulse this is amazing to have in the dark showing a lot of awareness like I said well guys that's pretty much to build I was really really excited to share this with you all you all want to see it you've got it I really hope you enjoyed this build is awesome against players that just like the spam bleed hives and fire and riot foam and all that annoying stuff so if you're looking for a counter you found it be sure to leave a thumbs up I would appreciate it a lot if you guys enjoyed the video be sure to subscribe to the channel if you're new we'd love to have you here peace [Music] you", "Bk4XUMWogLs": "Hey, what's up guys?

Oh yeah, that's really popular Yeah, taiwanese ma you guys but don't notice no I I was introduced to this one else in Taiwan is absolutely beautiful mom hug that's hug. Oh, this is actually also by unique Yeah, yeah, what I say about [you] pony Yeah, this is the same grand vision of Kingdoms Destroy the product of China And this is this beside minutes, how long definitely and of course we got [the] American hey, dude I mean, are you did you eat this? I eat this one else every single yeah, I did I already tell you guys you're gonna with money spirit [oh], yeah, of course because bad memory [yeah], let's start with the Japanese Ramen spicy sesame yeah One feels saucy. Yes, [a] very oily. Yeah, and one let's try crunchy stuff That looks legit [gotta] mix it when we cut up That looks good It is miso flavor, right so the soup is kind of thick smells very light. I gotta say it's s no yeah, yeah Hmm Excellent. [there's] a little sweeter. That's I will be it is it is a little sweet. Which is strange. I like this a lot [it's] very it almost feels like if you make this well it almost doesn't feel like instant noodles [I] will be adding how oil into this run a spicy skill one to [ten] is like a tooth alright You guys gonna rate it from what - tim. What [would] you get it give it us [seven] I'm Gonna give it Also a seven and a half and a half so I'm good my seven yeah because I feel like the noodles big [kyla] I would allow to like them more afghan. Take more more del then then just take then don't boil it There's a lot yeah But I feel like [there's] stir Sometimes tomatoes off [of] [that] if you put your if you boil a little longer, it won't it still stays pretty awesome shoe I like that. Yeah, actually I know for a fact that brand the noodles get very stop. Thank you Do you go watch the time you all right? Let's do the Chinese one Don't open it all the way right don't open it all the way So this is very typical of a chinese ramen they have this kind of pasty really looks like fat [yeah], so it's like lard, but that is in the talking this is the dry topping standard and the sept outer darling wow That's why I taste so vision that's really thick really and it comes with a fork. Yeah, wait. It's pork Yeah, there's pork of it. See these Chinese ones always come with it. I like this whole setup. I really do and Here's what we do back in boarding school. I love this trick. I love this trick I love the fact that because the often when I buy ramen noodles. Yeah, because like if you don't have silverware you're done You don't know anything, but I love it. I they give you a fork well here's the thing if you don't have any um if you don't have a spoon And you don't have a fork well here. They give you a fourth [year] and need my hack. That's right Where's your bike stick [her] face in? That's right now mmm mmm. I can smother from here Wow [this] mother yeah, you got it. No, you got it stir this in or I by the way almost all the robins I've had in my life my top two favorites so far has been Chinese Ramen and Korean ramen [so] in the soup There's a scallion. There's this [sub] skies. There's no meat No some spicy flakes, so it's pretty basic in China when they give us my little [fork] and I don't have a spoon I just kind of make a makeshift liquid container out of this What this width is and I'm telling you This is from back [in] boarding school days when we really didn't have anything okay? So it's taking me forever after this at home You can make a cone out of the wrapping the ramen right and you just use this size on any basis so much So you just a soup why don't you just drink it from the thing yeah? I watch your you could you could but here's the thing the noodles get really hot and so sometimes We'll [just] scoop [some] noodles in here. Oh Wow, that's a [trick] guys. Yeah mmm smells [pretty] Yeah, I really like [just] flavor hMM It's got much better bigger bite in the Japanese one pretty choose [a] [spice] um the Ramen low soft good Yeah, because it's actually ready in like one minute these ramen. You don't want to keep them cooking for too long I almost feel like I'm drinking hot pot soup. Yeah, it's really But I like the [beats] in Flavor Oh, yeah So I will give this an 8 I would give it an 8 just cuz it's [so] nostalgic for me. Yeah And also just I like this flavor. I'll give this I give it a 7 [I] mean I think you guys like it a little more than me, but I won't refuse it and these are philippines philippine rules, okay? So apparently you have to make the sauce on the side I Feel like the seasoning tackle is not enough. Yeah. I mean, it's the colors are pale I'm kind of expecting a [little] coating. Maybe it is very flavorful. [I] think so. Yes, it smells good It smells really good, so it's garlicky mmm It's powerful that seasoning was powerfully this really guys awesome a little [google] long-wave. All that flavor is great mmm Is that flavorful enough my oh my god oh, gosh? Oh, God? It's Garlicky spicy I see catchments our [literary] yeah how to pick the perfect noodles to go along with it. [don't] feel like he's noodles They're perfect. They're chewy. They're hearty soldier. Okay, [I] give that a 8.58 Hey, the same as last one. Yeah. Oh my God cuz last one has a special place in my heart [he] bought 8.58. I give it eight eight everyone else really yeah, I'm really good. Let's do this yeah the Thai one Hi, Mama, son London's hung shower That's soup It's very unique. It's slimy It's basically how it's not like tommy all that you get at the Thai restaurant exactly. It's got his own thing going on You know why? What's that? It's not as concentrated [it's] not but [it's] very much watered-down version of that [Mm-hmm], but the emphasized Flavor Here is the line yeah, it's so much lime flavor Which is not bad, but I feel like it's kind of lacking in other flavors. You know what I get this one I'll give this one a [7] [I] think 7 also like Thai moving. Yeah. Oh really. I'll gladly eat this anytime Yeah, I like it a lot, but I also feel like and this applies to almost every tom yum this noodle I had is that when they claim to be this kind of like you [know] Thai flavor, but they don't really taste like that Yeah, let's move on to our next one do it. How about we do this fancy one? Yeah? singapore lock stop being a moodle [and] aromatic coconut soup oh my expectations [for] this because Expensive cooks in seven minutes that's long using premium blah blah steam or dried noodles, okay? So is using premium fema taste paste, okay? Not seasoned powder steamed air dried noodle not fried, holy cow I Mean this is definitely the most cumbersome level to cook yeah Yeah And I don't understand why they asked for seven minutes cuz look how Thick we're cooking this all I smell is coconut and now I don't sell coconut all I smell is shrimp I smell a lot of small shrimp. I fell yeah, don't appetit Okay I'll tell you what you're gonna. Go ahead. It's definitely if you don't know what camera package It is definitely fancy [its] fancy [is] definitely like something you could cook for see getting [it] [at] somewhere Yes, yeah, like if you came to my restaurant at a restaurant And I gave you this you'd be like yeah that definitely came from your kitchen. It doesn't taste It doesn't taste great, [but] [I] definitely came from a kitchen dude. Dude. You're gonna give people ideas man They're gonna go buy this ramen and serve it but ultimately it comes down to taste So how's it? I think is average where did the coconut goat [cuz] that's my favorite part, so I feel like noodles are excellent they are your they're really good they feel like restaurant made yeah, they don't feel like instant noodles like I would give this a 6.5, okay total the noodles are phenomenal [I] gives a noodles like an eight point five nine. Yeah, okay? Let's go to I give it like a six you know why yeah? I feel like this is the type of soup that if you eat a bunch you didn't feel sick Yeah, it is truly much clean we can argue do endo soup or endo. No soup like I mean, we're good at bowl. Yeah you Wow, something smells really beefy hmM, and I think this we cooked everything in [one] bowl [share] it from here, okay? [little] sweet yeah, [too] sweet great. You're sweet. I like the flavor. I like the beef flavor, but it's wait We do people with savory this thing would be like really good It definitely mimics beef flavor very well Yeah, like I would think I have pieces of stewed beef with these you know. Oh definitely. [it's] very spicy hmM I give that as 6.5 Yeah 6.5. I wouldn't hit the seventh bench no 6.5. Yeah. Yeah, well let's try this counter [warrant], okay? This is the key line. It's supposed to be beef and lime flavor Kind of plain. It's kind of taste like curry a little bit But I feel like there's not much going on well this one's not very flavorful Nah, it's just salty it's savory. That's it It doesn't have [a] piece of lime flavor to it that alone not [letting] [it] [often] I'll do for you know what? Because this isn't much better than the American chicken [clinic], and I know I'm gonna give that like a 2 is much better Nothing's worse than that thing now. I mean, [it's] [like] chickens. Yeah, you anticipate I mean basically the wheels turning, but a [hamster] stead [oh] All right next let's do uh, but this was from Malaysia. It's for gotcha. [I'm] good All this in there. Yeah, do it we have to taste it It looks like you just took a poo with a [faggot]. [I] knew you were gonna say that how do I know that? I'm gonna put all of it is me well there's something just mesmerizing about pouring hot water over a cool mountain Oh, I know I know indeed indeed. Oh, [it's] like. It's a cool mountain. Yeah poo mountain whoa [Mmm], whoa, what's going on? It's like sour It's like shudders our gallant like that ginger a spicy really shower. [oh], I don't hate it [I] mean, uh hate it now that I've taken the time of [tasted] soup because the noodles are not the way I like [it] because it's a little undercooked, but I feel like if you cooked this enough pot and put some other stuff [in] it Reason I gave it a 6.5. Mm [six] search yeah Yeah, that was not not that good it tastes a little artificial because there's a flavor that I can't put my finger on I'll come on tasting beef. I'm not even tasting [regret] you know that's fun. Let's move on to Korea so Josh young man right that's like most people don't know it was quit in a China Right and then Chinese it Shahji. Yes. I jung-min, and I feel like the Korean version In the restaurants it usually has onions [a] lot of onions. Yes [I'm] potatoes the a little bit of me in [the] Chinese version that could be nothing, but meat It's usually only meat and onions right no. There's no onion is [not] your version. Oh My family don't put some like [oh] mwah. Yeah, you go girl on that. Yeah laptop. Yeah you That's not me. That's me. That's me yeah, I think that's just that's that's a potato. No. That's me right here [meat] yo not potato that's [ya] inators me what so it's like dehydrated meat. Yeah I'll tell you guys I mean this is this was not a fake video. This was shot in one day, so we chose eaten Oh, no, this is like our no [meat] in probably three [packs]. [oh], we're not done dumb guys, okay, I? Grabbed something questionable looks like a new toy alright. It's good. It's good. I realize this new you like it. I like it I like it. It's actually never had Kareem and Chinaman before and So the first time is a little shocking to me because it tastes very different than the Chinese one But I think that I think it's very flavorful I love the Al dente mess of the noodle like somehow these the Korean noodles when they're dry the dry noodles They all have these amazing noodle textures. I'm not really really spicy one hmM Good those do you know from my favorite noodle of all the things we had. [they're] like perfectly round al Dente hMM They give you a lot of sauce dancing give you a lot of stuff. What I usually do is I Put two [pack] noodles in there one packet Sauce whoa I like these [I] give these a solid 8 Mm. I would give these a 7.5. Yes. How does it say 7.5 here we go God let's let's start with this mask because really putting this off guys. This is so nasty Whereas we've all had this we're down to the worst and the best possible possibly yeah, possibly guys yeah, so we saved These these are literally if you put this like that the March madness where you have a first first seed versus a 15 seed Sixteenths e6ec like literally the worst thing in this planet when it comes [to] [needles] and possibly one of the best possible. Yeah So let's talk about this, okay Mark, Maru jun emerged Mara chang Hey, look if you're eating this you know you're not smiling like [this] [Kim] You're not cuz this is this [noodles] gonna depress you You know what's funny like I we see this thing called hot [Robin], but this is not [top] [ramen] Oh yeah, top ramen yeah. There's also one called cup noodle Yeah, no yeah, but I think you know what's funny Maruchan also almost sounds agen But it's actually it says made in Usa and put entirely a USa company So I know this is so nasty but as you realize that I Thought for probably 15 20 years that that was in that's what instant noodle was yeah Because you you were not asian for that long well cuz no [one] Introduced it to me like you don't eat that much ramen every day. It's really her like she's like I literally eat Ramen [oh] my why [is] that because like a little boy ramen [like] this literally is like 500 calories in there it is no It's insane anita. You're like that does like a one-bite, er, [and] by the way you can never open this properly right? Oh Sure, okay, so the sauce is on there. That's pretty nasty right, right? That's not so we got the dehydrated vegetables I know just floating on top of there like that is just and it's like neon colored look at that. Oh yeah I mean, I don't trust those piece I feel like those piece will kill you if you take it out, the middle is only like this [mo] yeah I know. I know you peel it you see these are empty down here It's if trish you you think that's all you know. [oh], and then you see it melting all of this [no] Why is it behind and don't know cooking like three seconds? Yes, because there's like the murals are such horrible quality Remberido [oh] my God that that signature smell go [oh] signature smell And not only that smell dehydration. No, I got it like the foam on top. It's like It's like it's this weird color. It's not What color is that I know it's neon is neon Chicken is [not] [your] me on that smell is so like It's like McDonald's fries like you know if you smell this you're like somebody's making chicken flavored instant noodle to get the full effect Mike you got to eat it out of the cup so all you did last cuz I don't care about double dip fine You can either first so nasty oh Don't let it. Go your system. He's gonna try to crawl out like still alive their stuff is so gross [sanitation] and let me tell you man the noodle consistency is unlike anything at any a powder Like that thing I literally fall apart if you look at it You [have] to drink some of the soup like I take a sip most of the soup you got it. All yeah, so good [subra] [oh], I can only tolerate it if I'm hungry I Can't talk about eating Strands of hardboard that's so good so mmm. Oh yeah It's [okay]. I will tell you though eating it from the cup tastes better than eating it I'm not a dancer nothing can make that thing - it's good mmM I'll tell you a thousand years now this could potentially be number one. Yeah, this is from the land of Taiwan and This is their most popular one of the most popular ramen noodles wow [now] you guys never had this right No, I never I've had this yahoo, and I love some secrets bottom secret. So any mean well, you'll see okay I'll see in the seasoning packet Whoa look at that packet look at that seasoning peggy. You know why is so thick why cuz there's actually real joseph beef inside Yeah, I know the picture my God And then you got the pace the lard paste which looks good and then the powder Oh, what this this? What is this so they packaged beef in yeah? And by the way the noodles are very interesting. They're flat and you're doing a little oh yeah powder packing or negative You can tell that's pretty neat. Yeah, very beefy that color yeah, it looks like yeah, yeah Cuz this is not just me so no man. It's like too young yeah. Oh look at this. [oh] look at this Get all there. Here's the oil oh, it's like very my gosh. Oh oh Sanity you know when you sign up you get instant noodle. This is not what you know yeah, it's an actual meal Yeah, how much is it actual stuff in good 30 so like [$1] was like a dollar? Oh, my looks like a dollar oh My gosh that looks that looks done right that looks insanely legit. Let's all of the some Ropey. Oh Feel done. It feels it feels. Yeah, it feels like it's coming apart pretty easily Which is a sign that it's done that literally does a real busy me as oroku vidya and getting into the next huge That's got [a] tendon down there. It's not even like this small literally [where] you'll see a taiwanese people soup in the rest Yeah, we should open a restaurant here in America sell this but for like 10 bucks And just use one of these they're not pretty tender to [enjoy] great answer. Oh It tastes like a real [him] yo, you [just] told me this was a [bowl] of noodles, and it was an instant. I believe you I think a noodle can cook it a little longer They'll see more like restaurant users. Yeah right now because the texture is kind of undercooked. Yeah, that's right it gives It gives it away for the soup itself. Oh, it's absolutely just yeah restaurant wanted a beef put some hot [oil] on there I'll be [grab] this beef. It's just like beef [I] didn't know came out of a packet I'm gonna have beef now - no no that's me. Yo let's let's let's let's just sell this here people literally I mean if you show this like say in Arkansas haha Come on. Oh yeah. How about 50 Tony's new look yeah, well about this [soup] It's that it's it's so it's got a lot of complex complexity in the flavor mmM, so it's not just like shin But you know got like beef flavor. Yeah, how long people treat their ramen seriously? They legit like this is like part of [their] thing with your life We're proud of this wrap and we want to make this brain. So what you guys give this nine Definitely almost. I mean I can't give anything at ten just stuff like yeah, ten like no one get a 10 come on no one gets a 10 look so hahaha except for you, but No cheese in this wrong I would give this a nine as well because I think it's the best one out of all the ones of the hat I like This one. I also really like the one we have where we put three tacks together. Yes, does I love that one what the philip II want the philip you want Sounds delicious. That's definitely top. Three. I also like the tiny girls the first time the that limey I love that [Lyonya] about I need a flavor man like that Yeah, you know like these are just like one kind like of each country I only pick one kind right okay eat [you] [all] oh, there's already too much. I mean the Korean one for example We just chose the dumb yet, but like I think that there's a lot of great Korean dramas. That are like really good, too But we yeah, so I'm gonna ramen coma right now. So you guys I'm like disoriented, but it's kind of cool We literally took a trip around the world [into] ramen.

particulate matter that's not particularly good for your lungs it's a kitchen chemistry sort of experiment as you only need bicarbonate of soda normal household sugar so sucrose some sand and some methylated spirits it's not an experiment that you see in many british textbooks the setup is straightforward you need three parts of sodium bicarb or sodium hydrogen carbonate to give it its proper name and you need seven parts of sugar mix the two solids into a beaker add enough ethanol to it to make the mixture sticky fill a suitable container with sand here using some aluminium foil containers and placing that in a non-flammable dish add some ethanol or methylated spirits to the surface of the sand and then form lumps of your sugar bicarbonate mixture to the surface now you can use a piece of tubing and push out some beautifully formed pellets if you wish to get the reaction going you simply like the ethanol at the top of the sand the ethanol provides the energy for the reaction to occur the sodium bicarb the sodium hydrogen carbonate liberates carbon dioxide gas when it's heated the sugar will produce carbon dioxide and water vapor steam on complete combustion but part of the sugar is incompletely combusted here which is of course the source for the carbon and as the reaction proceeds you'll get a large mass of intumescent solid being produced a large mass of carbon at home you'll find intumescent solids in the linings of fire doors which are designed to expand on heating to seal any cracks between the doors and the rooms that they're in provided the door

six sorry polishing off chapter eight starting chapter nine um that is that is uh that is your goal today i don't have any uh pieces of business um so let's uh let's just dive in excuse me so we um we ended we ended uh yesterday's lecture with a discussion of colligative well not a discussion or like an introduction to um colligative properties and uh and we basically said that that category colligative properties um simply means that adding solutes to a solvent changes the property that the properties of the solution will be different than the properties of the pure solvent and we said yesterday that um whoa sorry my marker is way chunkier than um it comes accustomed to there we go dialing it back um i was uh i use my um the photoshop app as like an adult coloring book sometimes and i was doing it last night but i left my cursor super super wide so we said yesterday that adding solutes um did did several things we said that first it uh lowers vapor pressure uh we said that it increases boiling point and it decreases melting point all right and that all three of these phenomena the drop in vapor pressure increasing boiling point and drop in melting point or freezing point um was um because we should say hang on there we go that these uh phenomenon are caused by the intermolecular attraction or intermolecular forces between the solute and the solvent all right so for example if you take boiling point you've got if you have a pure solvent so just we'll say just water the only attraction in pure h2o is the attraction between water molecules right there is just h2o and h2o attraction here in in a pure in a sample of pure water if you compare this to a solution in which sodium chloride is dissolved right so let's add a solute so now we have other particles they're still h2 water water attractive forces but now we also have attractive forces between the solute and the solvent so there's still the attraction between water and water but we also have the attraction between water and sodium chloride and so to get when you think about boiling you're talking about having the water the liquid leave the liquid phase go into the gas phase you have to have enough energy to pull apart not only all the water water attraction but also the water solute attraction that's going on so it takes more energy which is why the boiling point is higher ah okay susan you bring up a really um a really good point so susan said i thought that for some reason i thought that salt added to water made it boil faster so it's the opposite and the answer is yes but keep adding salt to the water that you're boiling here's the deal it doesn't help it boil faster it actually like you said it helps it boil or makes it boil slower because now you have to heat it up to a higher temperature it doesn't make the water boil faster but it makes your pasta cook faster and here's why when you add salt the boiling point gets higher right that means the liquid water can rise to a higher temperature than it normally can and with that water being hotter it cooks your food faster so it doesn't help it boil faster but the higher temperature helps your food cook faster and that is why you add salt to water when you're boiling like pasta for example so not a faster boil time but a faster cook time is the reason that gets that technique it's used and it's very effective and we have colligative properties to thank for that totally cool totally cool all right so and you can look back and you can analyze um vapor pressure melting point from this perspective um i'll let you read it in the textbook um just because we're a little bit a little bit behind and i'm i'm eager to move through the end of uh of chapter eight and and crack into chapter nine today all right so the last topic we have to cover in chapter eight is um that of osmosis totally totally it's super cool to see uh real life applications of this stuff all right now osmosis is a word that we've all heard before um mostly uh it gets kicked around with uh hail mary prayers hoping that our lack of studying can somehow be compensated by absorbing the material in a way that doesn't uh require work we're like oh i just hope i can absorb this by osmosis although we don't most of us don't actually know what osmosis is now osmosis occurs when you have excuse me two solutions with different concentrations um that are separated by some sort of barrier it's often called a membrane that can be crossed by the solvent all right so you've got a barrier between your two solutions of different concentration and that barrier gets um can be permeated by the solvent but not the solute okay when you have that scenario osmosis occurs so so for example if we have uh two solutions of water all right separated by a barrier but we've got a membrane through which the um the solvent or let's see there actually um so here the solvent can pass through all right it keeps the solute separated but here the solvent molecules can pass through this barrier and we have two different concentrations let's say we've got like three moles of solute on this side and on this side we'll have way more all right just a ton very concentrated on this side um what happens through the process of osmosis is the liquid the solvent flows from the less concentrated to the more concentrated side all right so solvent flows from the lower concentration to the higher to the higher concentration until they are equal all right that is the process of osmosis so if they're connected through a barrier that solvent can pass through the solvent is going to flow from the um less concentrated side to the more concentrated side all right i'm putting these little markers in here so that the solvent can pass until the concentrations of both sides are equal all right it's going to flow from the like i said less concentrated side to the more concentrated side that is the process of um osmosis all right so it um it balances so the thing is and this is the important thing to um realize is osmosis balances the concentration of particles i should say the concentration of solute particles all right that's what it does it's there to ensure um that uh the same number of particles are on both sides of the equation all right now um it doesn't necessarily mean that the molarities will be the same but the moles of particles will be the same and and you may be going what what what do you mean josh what do you mean well consider this let's say you had a solution of 1.0 molar sodium chloride all right now we know that sodium chloride according to our solubility rules is totally soluble in water what that means is sodium chloride doesn't when because it's soluble it doesn't just hang out together in a group it hangs out it it actually separates the sodium cations float away from the chloride anions because that's what it means to be dissolved so you'll notice if you have one mole of sodium chloride that means in solution you have one mole of sodium cations and one mole of chloride and ions so together you're one mole of sodium plus your one mole of chloride means that you have a total of two moles of ions in that solution all right um the number of uh ions that an ionic comp the number of particles that a compound in solution splits up to is um called i it's a lowercase i and it's equal to the number of particles a solute oops not a solute a solute forms in solution all right the number of particles a solute forms in solution is uh this little lowercase i and um we're going to use i to calculate a quantity known as the osmolarity all right this will be our last uh unit of the chapter concentration unit um so osmolarity is equal to the molarity times i all right so for example if you had a solution of point one zero moles of nacl this would have the solution would have an osmolarity of you multiply its molarity one point or 0.10 times 2 because i for sodium chloride sodium chloride breaks up into two ions in solution so i equals two so point one zero molar sodium chloride um has an osmolarity of point two say osmol all right um if you were to do this calculation for let's say we had point one zero molar um of calcium chloride all right here calcium chloride breaks up into one calcium cation plus two chloride anions so if since it breaks up into three particles we can calculate its osmolarity by multiplying the molarity times three so we would say the solution has is a point three zero osmolarity all right um now the reason why we're learning this new concentration unit um is because you can compare it the osmolarity of one solution to the osmolarity of another um and predict which way the solution will flow that's not the solution the solvent will flow based on the concentration based on the osmolarity all right now the reason why this is important um the reason why osmolarity and um uh osmolarity and osmosis is important um it's largely to do with our bloodstream so you've heard like that you shouldn't um that you can't drink uh ocean water for example right well the reason why you should not drink salt water is because um salt water salt water ocean water has a higher osmolarity than your blood cells all right um and if you uh if you drink salt water if you drink ocean water because ocean water has a higher osmolarity water will flow out of your blood cells into your bloodstream all right the the solution around it um and it causes your uh your blood cells to shrivel like they shrink because they're losing the the water inside them um they cause them to shrivel and collapse all right that is why we have the uh the rime of the ancient mariner i don't know if you've heard it it's the one that goes uh water water everywhere but not a drop to drink right it's this guy who's a chip has crashed he's on this plank he's out in the middle of the ocean surrounded by water water water everywhere but not a drop to drink if he drinks it his blood cells will shrivel collapse he's going to die from drinking uh a a aqueous solution it's water but it has a dangerously high osmolarity now we have the rhyme of the ancient mariner but what we don't have is the rhyme of the guy who started drinking distilled water because he didn't want uh metal in his water right i don't know if you've ever met one of these people who are like there's metal dissolved in your tap water there's metal dissolved in all these bottled waters i only drink distilled water distilled water has no ions in it nothing dissolved zero solutes all right you may think like oh that sounds like organic water that sounds like the purest healthiest thing i could do for myself well um yeah carrenza that is exactly why you've got to watch your sodium count because if you have too much in your bloodstream it'll shrivel and die there's other reasons too actually um it can affect heart function so that's not the only um health risk for for having a high sodium diet but definitely one of them um totally totally i'm glad i'm not the only one who uh um yes yeah karen says that's totally true um too much salt can and uh and will kill you um now if you look at distilled water distilled water is dangerous for the same uh same reason but opposite effect distilled water um has a lower osmolarity than your blood cells all right it has a lower osmolarity than your blood cells if you drink a ton of distilled water now all of a sudden so so before with salt water the salt water has a higher osmolarity so water flows out of your blood cells but now since it has a since distilled water is a lower osmolarity it has um your blood cells have a higher concentration so solvent starts flowing from your bloodstream into your blood cells if you drink too much distilled water it will cause your blood cells to bloat and burst the opposite thing will happen because all of a sudden you've got solution solvent excuse me flowing from your bloodstream into your blood cells they start bloating bloating bloating and eventually they just start bursting all right so so if you're thinking like if you hear someone talking about how distilled water is the healthiest for you it's actually not um the minerals in our tap water um keep us healthy because they're at an osmolarity that's comparable to the osmolarity inside our blood cells so it keeps them from shriveling or bursting all right those are the two you want to stay away from the extremes you want something right there in the middle so the next time you hear someone saying the government puts metal in our water um just know that they're doing that to keep us all alive um and actually they don't well depends most of the minerals in our water the government's not placing there they're actually it comes there from natural sources and where the the water originates let's see my gosh that's hilarious there's a water sommelier um well i i mean you can get fancy fancy and the and putting different minerals in water will um affect the flavor um like the water that you know is on tap here tastes different than the water the tap water that i grew up with in southern california which tastes different than um we uh we would always go on vacation to um to uh montana and our friends who lived up there who would stay with they they're they had well water and it was um their well was supplied by glacier melt and that water tasted amazing and different um so we're not going to go into um reverse osmosis but it's basically you can alter the conditions to force water to go the other way um but it's not a um it's not a thing that happens naturally and reverse osmosis is used to filter out um salts to filter out uh solutes so it's basically reverse osmosis is a purification method um similar to distillation but it but it just uses uh pressure and filters essentially paratha reverse osmosis is you force water through a filter that stops all the solutes and then the water that moves out the other end is uh is purified ah yes brianna this is exactly where um where we're going it's just to introduce a little bit of um a vocabulary to this mix so we say that um an isotonic solution an isotonic solution is a solution that has the same osmolarity uh as blood so we we all want to be drinking isotonic solutions hypotonic solutions so hypotonic solutions have a lower osmolarity than blood and they cause they cause uh cells to inflate and in severe enough cases burst and then hypertonic solution pepper hyper hypertonics a hypertonic solution is a solution with a higher um osmolarity then blood and this um will cause cells to deflate and shrivel all right so those are the three kind of categories isotonic same as blood hypotonic lower osmolarity than blood which causes inflation and bursting hypertonic higher osmolarity which causes the blood cells themselves to deflate and shrivel totally and with that we can put a pin in chapter eight and dive in uh directly to chapter nine all right so in chapter um chapter nine we are going to um discuss dig into look at um different aspects of chemical reactions now we already know um what reactions are don't worry brianna this this chapter is not scary um we already know what chemical reactions are we balance chemical equations we know reactants products all that stuff um this is going to introduce really uh new types of chemical reactions um i'm going to hit on these first few rather quickly we're not going to dig into them i'm more just want to expose you to the vocabulary so you can kind of be familiar with what uh what they are um so the first let's see four we're going to go through kind of quickly um but then we're going to park on redox reactions for uh for a little bit of time so uh so let's let's get into it so uh the first type of reaction um or actually let me open a new slide there we go first type of reaction uh that i want to introduce you to is something called a combination a combination reaction and this is a reaction where you take um two things which i'm just going to call x and y and they react together to make a thing that i'm going to call z they combine to make z so um an example of a combination reaction that we've already seen would be the reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen to form ammonia right these two gases h2 and n2 combine together to form a new molecule nh3 all right on both nitrogen and hydrogen are in their elemental forms um but for combination reactions you're not restricted to reactants in their elemental forms for example nitrogen dioxide reacts with hydrogen peroxide to produce two molecules of nitric acid all right and this is also a combination reaction um it's a uh a um we're taking two molecules we're combining no2 and h2o2 together to make a new molecule so they could be elements like nitrogen and hydrogen that could be molecules but a combination reactions two things react together to make a new thing all right so that's common combination kind of the um a very similar reaction but just moving in the opposite direction would be decomposition right a decomposition reaction um any decomposition reaction you start with something x and it falls apart it breaks apart into two smaller pieces which i'm just going to call y and z so an example of a decomposition would be your friendly bottle of hydrogen peroxide that you have stored under your bathroom sink don't ask how i know it's there i definitely don't break into your houses when you're unconscious and locate your bottles of hydrogen peroxide that's just where ricky bars so hydrogen peroxide actually decomposes into oxygen gas and uh h2o liquid liquid water um and uh and this decomposition reaction is fairly slow but it's the reason why i don't know if you've ever opened like an old bottle of hydrogen peroxide but when you twist the cap it'll go like like you're like you're opening a soda can or something that sound it makes that real briefly is the oxygen that's being produced that all of a sudden gets to escape when you open that cap um so so it's literally pure o2 coming off of there it's also a reason why if you have an ancient bottle of hydrogen peroxide you should probably just throw it away because it's decomposing into oxygen gas which will leave the site you open and then what's all that's left is liquid water and pouring liquid water on a wound to clean it isn't going to do much of anything so throw away those super old bottles of hydrogen peroxide it's just water um at this point in time so there's an example of a decomposition reaction um decomposition reactions uh the molecule doesn't have to break apart into two things it could be multiple things like for example um there's a reaction where you can heat nitric acid and it decomposes into nitrogen dioxide water and oxygen gas so you can break apart into multiple things it doesn't have to be just two decomposition is just start with one thing and then it breaks apart into into multiple things two uh three etcetera um one another type of reaction that we've brushed up against in lab actually is a displacement all right the displacement reaction which looks like this so in a displacement reaction you have some compound x reacting with y and z and it produces y plus x and z the reason why this is called a displacement is because you'll notice that on the reactant side x is by itself and on the product side it ends with z whereas if you compare this to y y starts with z on the reactant side and ends alone so the displacement reaction is the one in which um x steals the romantic partner from y right x ends up with z and y is left all alone and this could be a happy or a sad thing depending upon the nature of y and z's relationship contrasted with x and z's relationship one such relationship that you have some experience with is the reaction between magnesium and hydrochloric acid we spent a ton of time talking about this reaction yesterday uh the products of this reaction are hydrogen gas and magnesium chloride and if you look at it magnesium starts this reaction alone but ends with chloride whereas hydrogen starts as chloride's partner and ends as h2 gas so there's the displacement one for the other um we've also we've talked about um displacement reactions in another lab um but in the uh the double right you can have a double displacement reaction um which we saw with the precipitation reactions um yep okay totally we are just we're switching the anion or in this double in this displacement reaction the uh the cation switches we trade one nine to the other um in a double displacement it's the same thing um except it happens twice it's a plus b gets together with x plus y and they both switch so x ends with b and a ends with y double displacements are a little happier um because everybody still ends up with somebody right you just have a a swap of cation and anion pairs a grabs y x grabs b and those are the products you get um you saw these uh in the precipitation lab right so for example aqueous silver nitrate reacts yup there yep the double displacement reaction totally swingers that is literally how that goes the people show up with someone and show up to a party with a date and leave the party with someone else so silver nitrate and sodium chloride react to make silver chloride which is a solid precipitate and sodium oops nitrate which is still aqueous but again you can see that silver grabs chloride sodium grass nitrate and that is how whoa that is how we get our products all right um so that is the uh the displacement and the double displacement um reactions we've seen some of these some of them are brand new um one very common um equation that you'll see that you have seen this semester that you'll continue to see this or i guess i should say this summer session and you'll see if you have any chemistry in your future you will continue to see this and even if you don't have chemistry classes you're still going to see uh oh it's fun um oh and right right totally okay good to know um hopefully hopefully uh we're all just thinking about swings at a park all right um one reaction though even if you do not um take any further chemistry classes uh you will most likely still have experience with combustion reactions um all right combustion reactions are a staple of our everyday life uh unless you're driving a tesla um this is how our cars move around um and a combust a combustion reaction is a very simple concept you you take something some substance x react it with oxygen elemental oxygen to produce an oxide right you start with an element or a compound react with oxygen and the product will always be an oxide so for example one combustion reaction that um we've used uh for a couple examples this semester um is a reaction between h2 gas and o2 gas the product here is water h2o um and uh and so this reaction you can see that we again you start with some substance and you make an oxide now we're not used to thinking of water as being an oxide but if you were to name this thing it would be dihydrogen monoxide right it's it's the hydrogen oxide product um another combustion reaction this is a lab that we actually do or we do this reaction in a lab in uh chem 400 is magnesium metal reacting with oxygen gas to produce magnesium oxide um typically when we think of combustion reactions though we're not thinking about metals or even hydrogen it's usually hydrocarbons right so for example um ch4 reacts with o2 to produce now this one's interesting because you'll notice that we have carbon and hydrogen and when a hydrocarbon is burned is combusted with oxygen you make two oxides you make the carbon-based oxide and the hydrogen-based oxide all right so ch4 combusts with oxygen gas to make carbon dioxide and water um this is the reaction um that you uh you did if any of you cooked on a stove that used gas um ch4 is is natural gas this is what you use to make your eggs this morning um also if any of you have ever lit your flatulence on fire this is also the combustion reaction you're doing so um we all may have experience with that combustion reaction in some context or another all right so that's those are that was a quick kind of like lightning round um four new reaction types combination decomposition displacement combustion but this fifth type of reaction i want to park on um for a little bit because this will take a little more uh effort and um and and it's it's it's a very important reaction class um known as redox reactions all right redox reactions so um why are they called redox reactions well redox is uh shorthand for um actually let's do this uh redox is shorthand um uh it stands for reduction and oxidation all right reduction in oxidation and um these uh these processes so so reduction is a process oxidation is a process we've heard these words probably but what they mean is reduction is a process where a compound loses electrons and oxidation is a process where um a substance gains no it's not okay this is this is where dyslexia makes lecturing exciting reduction is a process where a substance gains electrons and oxidation is a process where substance loses electrons all right now how i know that and how i cut myself is with a uh a little acronym a little acronym um that that i used to help me remember is leo says ger leo is an acronym that means lose electrons oxidation and ger stands for gain electrons reduction all right um this is not the only acronym there are others out there like uh oil rig and and whatnot you can use whichever mnemonic helps you remember what it means but this is the one that um that i rolled with because it includes um my astrological sign not that i believe in astrology but that's the one that stuck in my brain all right so reduction electrons are gained oxidation electrons are lost now if you're looking at redox reactions in the light of these definitions you may be thinking it sounds like a redox reaction is a reaction where electrons exchange hands and if you're thinking that you're absolutely correct um they uh in a redox reaction one substance loses electrons oh hey there we go dude dude there's a lot of leo love going on in the uh in the comments right now um so um dude oh man carolyn you are uh you're one day off from my birthday i'm uh i'm i am the eighth um so uh so yeah we will we'll be partying uh well in about a month or so um what was i saying oh right so so in a redox reaction something is oxidized it loses electrons something else is reduced it gains the electrons from that thing that's oxidized so a redox reaction is a reaction where electrons are are changing hands right um and so uh so let's so electrons are exchanged in a redox reaction let's um let's take a look at an example of a a redox reaction all right let's let's see this electron exchange in person all right the reaction of h2 and o2 to produce h2o all right do do you see the electrons you wait wait you you d you don't i'm pretending i'm having a phone conversation but you're only hearing half of it you don't see the electrons here's the thing that's because redox reactions are just like selling contraband right they're just like meeting up with your dealer um everything's hidden you don't actually see the electrons changing hands all right in every redox reaction one compound shows up and is buying the other one shows up and they're selling but it just looks like everyone's normal it just looks like people are eating chicken all right it just looks like you're chilling at polios hermanos now here's the thing if a redox reaction is an illicit exchange right of electrons if redux reactions are selling contraband then you are the dea all right it is your job to narc the situation you have to figure out who's selling who's buying by analyzing the chemical equation and to do that you need to know how to assign oxidation states so this is going to be these next few slides will be your years in the police academy we'll come out the other end analyze this reaction figure out who's being reduced who's being oxidized all right so i'm going to show you a four-step method for assigning oxidation states these are also called oxidation numbers they're the exact same thing one thing i want to point out is the method that i'm about to teach you is slightly different than the one presented in your book if you look in your book your book will give you seven rules for assigning oxidation states i'm going to give you a different system that only has four all right so it's about like half have as many things to remember here's the thing they both work if you know the other way of doing it you can totally roll with it i don't force you to memorize this way i just think this is a more concise method and it it's just simpler it makes more sense um but anyways there's if you read the book you're like this isn't what he taught us it's because i taught you an alternate way a different way of looking at it but they both lead to the same answer so so roll with whatever is most comfortable for you um so the first rule when assigning oxidation states so so i i guess first off before we talk about assigning oxidation states um i should tell you what these are oxidation states all right oxidation states uh which i will abbreviate from here on that is just this um oxidation states tell you the amount of charge an atom has in a compound all right they tell you the amount of charge an atom has up in a compound and this is where it becomes important for us changes in oxidation state reflect electrons being gained or lost all right the whole reason why we're doing this is when you can assign oxidation states you can look to see which elements have changing oxidation states and those changes will reflect electrons being gained or lost all right so this is how you're going to knock out who is selling electrons who's buying electrons it's with this method now these are the rules for assigning oxidation states um and you want to do the uh use these rules you want to apply these rules as kind of a flowchart always do rule number one first if that fails move to number two then three then four in that order they're ordered in terms of priority so if you can solve it with just one rule one stop there if you can solve one and two stop there etc all right so rule number one um and this is the most important one the oxidation states of all atoms in a species must add to the total charge all right the oxidation states of all atoms in a species must add to the total charge so for example if i um if i asked you what is the oxidation state of sodium metal all right here for sodium our total charge is zero right that means that the oxidation state of sodium is also zero if i asked you what the total charge for aluminum three cations are well the total charge here is positive three so the oxidation state is positive three and likewise if i asked you what is the oxidation state of h2 well since the total charge is zero that means the individual oxidation states for each hydrogen atom in this molecule must also be zero all right that is rule number one rule number two rule number two hydrogen so if rule number one fails you um you come back and you see if rule number two helps you solve the mystery so hydrogen is always plus one unless unless it's the only non-metal then it's minus one all right so in a compound hydrogen will always be plus one unless it's the only non-metal then it'll be negative one so for example if i asked you to assign the oxidation states for h2o hydrogen will have an oxidation state of positive one all right because oxygen is not a nonmetal that that's rule number two then rule number one tells us that the sum of all the oxidation states so our two h's plus our oxidation state for oxygen has to equal our total charge which is zero so that means positive two plus oxygen's oxidation state equals zero so that means that oxygen has an oxidation state of negative two so h2o would be negative positive one negative two all right what about um in sodium hydride well here in sodium hydride hydrogen is the only non-metal so its oxidation state must be negative one that means for the oxidation states to add to zero which is our total charge sodium's oxidation state would be plus one all right so here's a couple examples of using rule number one and rule number two to uh find the oxidation state of every element in a compound let's take a look at rule number three all right so rule number three uh metals metals in the first two columns on the periodic table um have oxidation states equal to their normal ionic charge alright so if rule number one and rule number two aren't quite enough to get the job done move to uh rule number three so for example um let's assign the oxidation states for calcium chloride all right rule number one doesn't help us immediately two doesn't apply because there's no hydrogens rule number three comes into play calcium's in that second column it's normal ionic charge is a plus two and now that we know calcium we can use rule number one to determine the oxidation state of chloride because we know that the oxidation state of calcium plus two times the oxidation state of chlorine will equal our total charge which is zero right we subtract two from both sides of this equation and we get two times the oxidation state of chloride is equal to negative two when we divide both sides by two we get that the oxidation state of chloride here is negative one all right so um so there's one example let's um let's do another one i just need a little more room um let's assign the oxidation states for lithium aluminum hydride all right now lithium aluminum hydride um rule number two helps us out here we have hydrogens and hydrogen is the only non-metal so it picks up an ox and oxidation state of negative one rule number three helps us out as well lithium's in that first column so it picks up its regular ionic charge a positive one and now we know enough to find the oxidation state for aluminum we know enough because we know that the oxidation state of lithium plus the oxidation state of aluminum plus the oxidation state of our four hydrogens equals our total charge which is zero lithium's oxidation state is plus one hydrogen's oxidation states in this compound is negative one and this equals zero so we're going to get aluminum minus three equals zero which we now solve and find that aluminum's oxidation state is positive three all right so there's using rules one two and three in tandem let's add our fourth and final all right rule number whoa rule number four all right the that's the the last stop all right so um if you don't have enough information based on rules one two and three then you move to four which states that the most the most electronegative the most electronegative atom will have an oxidation state equal to its normal ionic charge all right and we can now use um all of these rules in tandem to solve to assign oxidation states for compounds like um like the following yes oh i'm so sorry my intention is not to scare the study group um let's assign oxidation states for sulfuric acid and and and uh um the only the only cure for terror in the study group and uh frontal cortex oxidation um is uh is practice um just hitting a bunch of these um can we just can we just do the step first if we want um so actually ah so so so so and this is um this is actually important um um uh so currency's question oops uh cranston said can we just step in and do rule number four first do we have to wait through the rest and you can't you must use it as a last resort only um and i'll show you why not in this example but in the one following you'll see why you have to save it till the end so first going through these uh we don't have enough information to apply rule one um rule number two helps us out hydrogen's always plus one when hydra when there are other nonmetals present there totally are sulfur and oxygen both nonmetals but now we don't have any metals and we're stuck we don't know we have to use rule number four now oxygen is more electronegative and so we're going to give oxygen it's regular ionic charge of negative two and now we can apply rule number one to determine the oxidation state for sulfur because we know that two times the oxidation state of hydrogen plus sulfur plus four times the oxidation states for oxygen will equal our total charge for this molecule which is zero now we have two times plus one for hydrogen plus sulfur plus four times negative two for oxygen equals zero alright so we have a positive two oops positive two plus sulfur minus eight equals zero so we have sulfur minus six is zero which means that sulfur must have an oxidation state of positive six all right this is using well not actually all four this uses rules one two and four we didn't actually need number three for this one um corenza let me do an example of if you apply rule four first you'll get this one wrong let's do hydrogen peroxide all right first we know that hydrogen will be a positive one and this is enough to solve all right this is enough to determine the oxidation state for o2 sorry not for o2 for oxygen we know that two times the oxidation state of hydrogen plus two times the oxidation state of oxygen equals our total charge which is zero ah um um so we've written out this equation we know the oxidation state for hydrogen is positive one and this gives us enough information to solve for the oxidation state of oxygen so we have a plus two plus two times the oxidation state of oxygen equals zero we subtract two from both sides of this equation um and we get two times oxygen equals negative two and then we divide both sides by two and we find that in hydrogen peroxide oxygen has a oxidation state of negative one all right um so those are um you know okay so here's okay here's the deal so this is where we're gonna pause the lecture we now know well you've now seen the rules for how to assign um oxidation states all right the thing to do now is to just practice this a ton practice at a time get refs assigning oxidation states applying these rules it's a lot all at once but as you start doing it you'll become more and more familiar and here's the thing the goal is not to determine what an oxidation state is the goal is to use the information an oxidation state tells you to analyze a reaction to determine is it a redox reaction and to determine uh reducing agents and oxidizing agents we'll be doing that tomorrow for now take a break we've all been in lecture for you know an hour uh 20-ish minutes take a break walk away refresh come back to it a little bit later practice this tonight because we're going to be doing this tomorrow but then applying this information so let's get some reps in tonight get more familiar with the process then we'll start applying it tomorrow and if we're still struggling with it tomorrow we've got a glorious three hours of office hours together right so we have enough time to let this solidify cool okay thanks everybody for uh for coming out and i will uh i'll catch you all tomorrow

discovered where they shouldn't be near a supermassive black hole rosetta provides a recipe for making a comet and the multi-million dollar Russian rocket failure after someone punched in the wrong coordinates all that and more coming up on space time welcome to space time with Stuart Gary [Music] [Music] astronomers have discovered 11 newly formed infant protostars where they shouldn't exist right next to the monster a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy the findings reported in the Astrophysical Journal Letters have shot scientists as regions around black holes erect with powerful gravitational tidal forces and bathed in intense ultraviolet and x-ray radiation generating extremely harsh conditions that shouldn't favor star formation amazingly the proto stars will discovered within three light-years of the supermassive black hole pret o stars of the embryonic formative stage between a dense molecular cloud of gas and dust and the young main sequence star astronomers believe that most if not all galaxies play host to a central supermassive black hole the one at the center of our galaxy the Milky Way is known as Sagittarius a star it's located about 26,000 light-years away and contains over 4.3 million times the mass of the Sun the new stellar discoveries were made by the European Southern Observatory's Atacama Large millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope Alma Alma revealed the telltale signs of the 11 low mass stars all for me incredibly close within three light-years of the monstrous black hole now at this distance the gravitational tidal forces driven by Sagittarius a star should be energetic enough to rip clouds of gas and dust apart long before they can collapse down to form new stars the presence of these newly discovered protostars suggests that the conditions necessary to birth lower mass stars may exist in even the most turbulent of regions within our galaxy and for that matter probably in similar locations throughout the universe the strongest described the discovery is genuinely surprising one that demonstrates just how robust star formation can be even the most unlikely of places the Alma data also suggested these proto stars are only about 6,000 years old it's the earliest stage of star formation ever found in such a highly hostile environment astronomers identified the protostars after seeing the classic double lobes of material that prakit etre each of the stars these cosmic hourglass like shapes are signatures of the early stages of star formation molecules like the carbon monoxide in these lobes glow brightly in the millimeter wave length flight that Alma observes proto stars form in interstellar molecular clouds of gas and dust dense cold pockets of material in these clouds collapse under their own gravity and grow by accumulating more and more star forming gas until the temperatures and pressures at the centres of these clouds grow high enough to begin fusing hydrogen and then voila a star is born however a portion of this infalling material never makes it into the star instead it's ejected as a pair of high velocity jet and the protostars North and South Poles extremely turbulent environments such as those thought to exist around a black hole can disrupt the normal procession of material into a protostar while intense radiation from massive nearby stars and black holes can heat up and even blast away the parent cloud supporting the formation of all but the most massive of stars vast stores of interstellar dust obscure the heart of the Milky Way where it's supermassive black hole resides hiding it from optical telescopes however radio waves including the millimetre and submillimetre light seen by Alma are able to penetrate this shroud of dust giving radio astronomers a clearer picture of the dynamics and contents of this hostile environment prior observations the region surrounding Sagittarius a star had provided some tantalizing hints of several infant stars but the findings weren't conclusive these objects known as pro plaits are common features in more placid star forming regions but it was the new measurements by Alma which provided the more conclusive evidence for young star formation activity though the galactic center is often considered a challenging environment for star formation it may well be possible for especially dense course of hydrogen gas to venture into this region and forge new stars astronomers also used Alma to confirm that the masses and the momentum transfer rates that is the ability the proto Jets the plow through the surrounding interstellar material are consistent with young protostars found throughout the disk of our galaxy the study's authors say there are several pathways in which stars may be out of form in this inhospitable region of the galaxy for this to occur outside forces would have to compress the gas clouds near the center of the galaxy sufficiently to overcome the violent nature of the region thereby allowing gravity to take over from form stars astronomers speculate the high-velocity gas clouds traveling through the galaxy could aid star formation as they're forced their way through the interstellar medium it's also possible that Jets from the black hole itself could be plowing through the surrounding gas clouds compressing material and triggering this burst of star formation whatever the cause the next steps to take a closer look to confirm that these newly formed stars are being orbited by disks of dusty gas if so it's likely that planets will eventually form from this material as is the case for young stars further out in the Galactic disk such as the planets which formed around the Sun in our own solar system this is space-time I'm Stewart Gary [Music] scientists have discovered the recipe for making a comet the findings reported in the Monthly Notices the Royal Astronomical Society provide the first quantitative analysis of the chemical elements that make up the cometary dust of the comet 67p churyumov-gerasimenko the studies based on a detailed analysis of data collected by the Casa mer instrument aboard the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft which studied comet 67p from August 2014 through to September 2016 scientists found that almost half of the dust comet 67p emits into space is composed of organic molecules including the most pristine carbon rich material known in the solar system in fact researchers believe this material has hardly changed since the very birth of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago when a comet traveling along its highly elliptical orbit approaches the Sun it begins to heat up causing frozen gases to become volatile and evaporate as they do so they drag tiny grains of dust from the comet with them forming the Comets distinctive comas surrounding its nucleus and its twin tails capturing examining these grains provides the opportunity to trace the building materials the comet itself so far only a few space missions such as Rosetta have succeeded in this endeavor earlier missions such as the European Space Agency's Giotto spacecraft inducted a flyby of comet Halley and NASA's Stata sample return mission was able to collect cometary dust from the comet 81 P veldt 2 but both missions only provided scientists with an ever so brief snapshot in time in fact in the case of Stardust which raced past its comet in 2004 the dust had changed significantly during capture so that a quantitative analysis was only possible to a very limited extent unlike their predecessors the Rosetta team were able to collect and analyze cometary dust particles of various sizes over a period of around two years as rosetta orbited the comet and even set a probe danowitz surface the Kazemi instrument collected more than 35,000 cometary dust grains ranging in size from around a millimeter data just 0.01 millimeters Cosima made it possible to microscopically study individual dust grains and then bombard them with a high-energy beam of ions the secondary ions emitted by this process could then be weighed and analyzed using Cosima's mass spectrometer for the current study scientists focused on just 30 dust grains grains they thought had the properties they needed to ensure a meaningful analysis their selection included dust grains from all phases of Rosetta's mission and of all sizes the study's lead author dr. Martin Hilton back from the Max Planck Institute says all the grains had a very similar composition with a comet's dust consisting of the same ingredients as the comet's nucleus the authors found that organic molecules accounted for about 45% of the mass of the solid cometary material making it among the most carbon rich bodies in the solar system the rest about 55% is composed of mineral substances mainly silicates interestingly the authors found almost exclusively non hydrated minerals meaning there wasn't much in the way of water compounds helen buck says that like all comets 67p does contain water but because comets spend so much of their time in the out of frozen rim of the solar system away from the warmth of the Sun this water has remained frozen rock-solid leaving it unable to react with cometary minerals the researchers therefore regard the lack of hydrated minerals of the Comets dust as an indication that 67p contains very pristine material they say their conclusion also supports the ratio of certain elements such as carbon to silicon which is very close to the sun's ratio and which is also thought to reflect the ratio found in the very early solar

attained a stable orbit and is operating nominally Buccaneer is a three in a CubeSat built by the University of New South Wales in Canberra in partnership with the Australian Department of Defense's Defense Science and Technology Group the spacecraft will help calibrate Australia's unique genderly over-the-horizon radar Network and provide crucial data on predicting the orbits of objects including space junk Buccaneer was deployed aboard the joint NASA NOAA at JPS s1 weather satellite mission which flew from space launch complex-2 W at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California last month the flight marked the penultimate launch at the Boeing Delta two rocket which has been a workhorse for NASA and the American space launch industry since first entering service back in 1989 back in here together with for NASA Cube sets piggybacked along with a primary payload for the right into orbit Buchan is now undergoing preliminary testing in orbit with scientists engineers communicating with the spacecraft and obtaining telemetry over the next few weeks the spacecraft will undergo operations to checking Commission its onboard systems before undertaking its risk management activities and experiments in early 2018 Buchan is the first of eight spacecraft be constructed by the University of New South Wales which have been developed to gather research data for projects ranging from remote sensing to ultra secure quantum satellite communications networks over 40 space engineers scientists and PhD students are involved in the project which aims to establish a sustainable niche domestic space industry University of New South Wales Canberra space director professor Russell Boyce says small spacecraft like buckety will play an important role in gathering data for research as well as demonstrating space-based capabilities so the Buc new spacecraft is going quite well so far we're still in the early stages of the mission we've been spending time firstly establishing communications with the spacecraft and making sure that basically the system is healthy that's not suddenly decided it's dead on arrival anything like that so that's been successfully done and we're now at the point where we can prepare for certain key steps such as firing up the energy determination and control system to be able to detangle the spacecraft that's at the moment it's doing slow cartwheels you know that is that normal yes yeah so what happens when you launch these things rocket gets into the right orbit and a command is sent to the flapper door on the dispenser for the CubeSat and that opens up and there's a string that shoves the CubeSat out into space and the chances of it shoving out into a straight line and not having any rotation about it effectively zero you get some sort of keeping effect there's a popped out so it goes into this slow terrible motion and we've not yet constructed the spacecraft of the tumbler shot so that's one of the next steps and the process of doing that is there's onboard sensors that detect that horizon NASA the edge of the earth and detect where the Sun is and it works out which ways up and which way down and starts to activate their called reaction wheels onboard the spacecraft these are like gyroscopes that sort of thing here which counter the rotational motion of the spacecraft and bring it to exactly there we want it and we continually use that systems throughout the whole mission contender time changed the way the spacecraft is pointing so that we get optimal solar panel solar panels pointing to some base before we're optimally pointing the antennas down to the ground station that sort of thing is what this attitude control system is for so that's one of the next steps we need to deploy solar panels we need to go through a thorough checkup or all of the onboard subsystems as well as the payload just checking that we're good to go to be able to start the real purpose of the mission which we're not planning to start until the early part of next year these if I'm thinking of orbit the same inclination as JPS f1 but it's a much higher area to mass ratio than that weather satellite which means experiencing the effects of drag in a much stronger way which means it's actually can intuitively way ahead of the weather satellite it slows down files in just a bit and therefore its orbital period is much less so it looks like it's going faster that also means it's suffering more orbital drag it is suffering orbital drag so it will naturally spiral back into the Earth's atmosphere and burn up in about let's say four five six years something like that it's hard to determine which comes back to the need to understand the way these objects interact with their environment up there can you control the re-entry at all or you've only got the Jarrah dimes the the gyroscopes to control its orientation yeah well with the reaction wheels and therefore control the orientation we can deliberately control how much drag that this thing is experiencing so it's an aerodynamic effect so if you pull on into the breeze much higher drag you can rotate the spacecraft 90 degrees and you'll get a minimum drag configuration so you can tweak and tune it to some extent your so again across the app skip across the very refined atmosphere to a degree as well it does provide some lift it's an order of magnitude less than the drag that lifts it's not only vertical if it's of course span-wise lift lift orthogonal or forces orthogonal to the direction of travel and that means you can move around from side to side a little bit in the orbit as well what will Buccaneer be doing well it's up there the main mission is to detect the jawn over horizon radar network from space and what is John what is the Jindal a over-the-horizon radar system if an early warning radar network that was developed by in science technology group and operated by defense it uses a combination of radar and ionospheric physics which means radar signals beamed up into space and they reach a level called the ionosphere where most of the very rarefied particles up there are actually ions and electrons instead of atoms and because they're electrically charged particles the radar beam reflects off that layer and that's how it ends up being able to come back down to the earth over the horizon and then it reflects off objects goes back up to the ionosphere and is detected back down in Australia so it can see thousands of kilometres rather than just line-of-sight defense he's going through a process of upgrading that they want to improve it and to improve it you have to understand how interacting with the ionosphere and the only way you can do that is actually to get up into the ionosphere and make a measurement adding complications of that is the fact of the honestly is constantly changing depending on geomagnetic storm activity it's changing you know very very dynamic way both spatially and in time yeah and so that's the primary function of this mission but there's a secondary function as well as in there you're testing a new structure that's going to be deployed from the spacecraft well that is the antenna it's not so much testing the structure it's it's more just concerned that the structure will perform its duty in space appropriately it will be stable it's a lightweight a large lightweight flexible structure and we need to confirm that it will remain in its deployed position in a stable way to be able to then fly the main mission and use it with a radar receiver back in here also has other things it can do including looking at space junk where the space junk comes in this is part of the effort in Australia to play an international role in what we call space situational awareness currently defense is operating a large radar system the US Air Force out of excellent in Western Australia and there is a very very large space surveillance telescope being relocated from the u.s. to that same place to be able to monitor space junk and satellites in orbit as part of the International Space Surveillance Network Australia wants to provide more than just real estate for ground-based sensors it wants to add value to that by improving the state of the art of orbital predictions predictions of the way that satellite and space junk behave in orbit and UNSW Canberra space one of the main themes of our research is improving the state of the art of orbital prediction which means understanding how the objects interact with their environment in low Earth orbit particularly in the ionosphere and therefore we're going to use Buccaneer both risk mitigation mission and main mission as well as the the missions that we're contracted to fly for the airforce we're going to use those will be in control of the object and we'll instruct the satellite to undertake some prescribed motions will rocket backwards and forwards in a predetermined way and we'll be watching from the ground with our own telescopes the Sun reflects off the object and because we're rocking it backwards and forwards we get a particular behavior of light coming off it just as that happens with space junk that we're not in control and we can start to understand what the object might be doing that we're observing from the ground that were not in control of so we're using Buccaneer as a test object in space to calibrate and affect the ground-based observations yep yep he's not the only Cube set you guys are currently working on you've got what five in the pipeline three more potential so the two Buccaneer satellites are two of the sides the other three that are funded three spacecrafts the Royal Australia so we have a ten million dollar contract from Air Force some of it is for ground-based space deflation awareness research but most of the funding is leading to three spacecraft being flown one which is almost completed and will fly in the first half of next year to be followed about a year later by a pair of larger CubeSat 6u cube set that will fly in formation and the purpose of all of those three cube sets is a maritime surveillance demonstration

from a shiny new Vostochny Cosmodrome in the country's far east as in that in a multi-million dollar disaster losing the missions 19 satellites early indications point to the wrong settings being programmed into the soyuz frigate upper-stage causing the mission to crash and burn the russian federal space agency Roscosmos has confirmed that the Soyuz 2-1 Beast initial ascent into orbit went smoothly with first second and third stages all firing and separating on schedule placing the forget upper stage and its payload into a ballistic arch flying over the Arctic and North Atlantic oceans that forget em upper stage was then expected to undertake an initial 90 second engine burn to insert the stack into a transfer orbit that was to be followed by a series of six additional burns over several hours designed to place the 19 satellites into four separate orbits however mission managers were unable to establish contact with the frigate em upper stage or any of the satellites in the payload believe it or not it's now understood that the forget was programmed with the wrong flight control system settings the data was given was for a mission flying out of the usual Baikonur process cosmodromes and not out of the nearest - new cosmodrome that failure would have hit as soon as the forget in its payload separated from the soyuz launch vehicles third stage see that's because the frigate and soyuz each used different flight control systems for GATS flight control system would have changed the stacks orientation in space trying to compensate for it perceived as a major deviation from the correct attitude and this would have caused the first main engine burned the fire in the wrong direction that in turn would have caused the forget and it's night aid satellite payload to begin flying on the wrong course most likely re-entering the atmosphere and burning up with the debris then falling into the North Atlantic Ocean the missions primary payload was the 2,750 kilogram medial m-21 remote sensing weather satellite which was to be placed into an eight hundred and twenty five point five kilometer high polar orbit the cluster of 18 secondary satellite payload

hours following that report Pyongyang released the first images of the new missile showing its far more than just an improvement in design of the wah song 14 flown back in July the white song 14 itself was based on the earlier Y song 12 first tested in May the newly released images show the white song 15 is an entirely new and significantly larger missile using a two chambered main gimballed engine system for steering that's a significant advance over the Hwa song 14 single r/t 250 or modified r/t 251 rocket motors which used for vernier steering thrusters based on older scud missile technology the wasps on 15 rocket motors to champion configuration is still similar in appearance to the original r/t 251 engine design built for the former Soviet Union in the Ukraine this suggests around 80 tons of thrust force at liftoff giving the white song 15 a launch mass of around 40 to 50 tons experts describe the new first stage booster is being similar in design to the Titan 2 missile the 53 minute test flight of the wasps on 15 ICBM sent it on a higher lofted trajectory reaching an altitude of 4475 kilometers before splashing down nine hundred and fifty kilometres downrange from its launch pad the new missile gives North Korea an effective range of over 13,000 kilometers that's enough to reach most of the continental United States East Coast as well as Europe or Australia the new upper stage is also larger than the 114 indicating more fuel for a longer range or larger payload experts suggest the upper stage is based on Iranian missile technology use 40 rounds rocket program which like North Korea was always designed to provide a delivery system for Iran's own secretive nuclear weapons program North Korea and Iran have a decade's long and deeply intertwined joint Technology Development Program sharing nuclear weapons and missile technology it's also likely that the west on 15 s upper stage still uses the four small rocket motors derived from the Soviet era seven missile NATO codename Alamo both Iran and North Korea already operate the r-27 the latest estimates indicate the worse on 15 could deliver a 1000 kilogram payload just about anywhere in the United States North Korea says the test missile was equipped with a super large heavy warhead and that's believed to indicate a correct weighted dummy version of its thermonuclear warhead analysts say the new missiles nose count appears to be designed for multiple reentry vehicles which would indicate several decoys as well as a moderately sized nuclear warhead meanwhile the Japanese military's confirmed earlier reports for the missiles re-entry vehicle failed to successfully re-enter Earth's atmosphere breaking into at least three pieces before crashing into the sea between 250 and 300 70 kilometres west of the Japanese coastline the newly released images also show a new larger nine axle te l or transporter erector launcher truck compared to the Chinese built eight axle transporters used for the worse on 14 which Beijing claims had sold to Pyongyang purely for uses log transporters in the lumber industry the new launch vision also shows that just like the 114 the new 115 was fired from a fixed launch pad rather than from transporter itself the launch was North Korea's 20th launch of a ballistic missile this year and possibly its third successful test fly of an ICBM following the to earlier launches in July you're listening to space-time I'm Stewart Gary [Music] and time now to take a brief look at some of the other stories making news in science this week with a science report a new study has found a link between the amount of time between pregnancies and the development of autism spectrum disorder in children researchers found that autism spectrum disorder was increased in second and later born children who conceived less than 18 months or 60 or more months after her mother's previous birth other developmental disabilities were not associated with birth spacing the findings reported in the Journal of autism research supports existing guidelines on pregnancy spacing and further highlights the association between autism and pregnancy health scientists at MIT have created a new way of turning carbon dioxide emissions from power plants into potential fuels and other useful chemicals for industry the findings reported in the journal chem sus chem are based on a new membrane compound using lanthanum calcium and iron oxide to filter Kupperman oxide out of carbon dioxide exhaust gases while allowing oxygen to pass through scientists say the filtering process is driven by exhaust gas temperatures up to 990 degrees Celsius the harvested carbon monoxide can then either be used as fuel or combined with other chemicals to produce hydrocarbons methanol syn gas or other substances well you've probably heard this one before but the team of scientists claimed they've developed a new chemical that can prevent hair loss and promote hair growth yes that's right we're talking about a cure for baldness researchers claim their medication called ptd DMB has already been shown to work on mice and he's now undergoing pre human trial toxicity testing male pattern baldness accounts for over 95% of hair loss with an estimated two-thirds of males experiencing some level of baldness by age 35 and a quarter by the time they're 21 some 99% of products marketed in the hair loss treatment industry are totally ineffective despite the promises the scientists in this latest study found that sufferers of hair loss had a significant amount of the cxx c5 protein in their scalp and when that protein combines with damaged protein it prevents the regeneration of hair follow the researchers say ptd DMB retards that binding they claim it will form the basis of a new drug that not only treats hair loss but also regenerates damaged skin tissues no word yet on when human trials begin SpaceX and Tesla boss Elon Musk as one is bet to build the world's biggest battery in 100 days or it's free the South african-born business entrepreneur built the new facility at Jamestown in South Australia with 40 days to spare the 50 million dollar 100 megawatt lithium-ion battery will store energy from the nearby horns Dale wind farm it'll also act as an emergency backup supply to stabilize the electricity network in South Australia whenever there's a shortfall is there often appears to be in that state the battery can store up to 129 megawatt hours of electricity meaning at full power it should last for a little over an hour powering up to 30,000 homes and finally for now some bad news for Bigfoot fans a new study of DNA samples claiming to have come from a yeti from the Himalayan mountains of Nepal and Tibet have instead turned out to have come from a dog from Asian black bears from Himalayan brown bears and from tibetan brown bears the findings reported in the Proceedings of the Royal Society be supports previous evidence that the biological underpinnings of those mysterious legendary bipedal ape-like creatures said to inhabit the high mountains of Asia are actually nothing more than local bears the mythology of a population of eight to nine foot tall human-like creatures is a common myth in many parts of the world it's been sparked in part by fossil evidence of an ancient gigantic ape Gigantopithecus Blackie which lived in Asia up to about a hundred thousand years ago together Pittacus stood about 3 meters or 9.8 feet tall and weighed up to 600 kilograms that makes it 3 to 4 times as heavy as modern gorillas and 7 to 8 times as heavy as together Pittacus is closest living relative the orangutan sightings and footprints of yetis have been reported for centuries with stories passed down from generation to generation similar stories in the United States and Canada have given rise to the legend of the Sasquatch or Bigfoot that's been carried summer by hoaxes such as the famous 1967 patterson-gimlin film claim to be of a female sasquatch later an acquaintance of Patterson Bob Heron Eames claimed to have been the figure depicted in the Patterson film wearing a gorilla suit you're listening to space-time I'm

right here in the front corner looks like it's about ready to jump off it's kind of turning into a cool-looking little art piece here these nice little fins so I apologize I took this out on the weekend and it's now Thursday and so unfortunately I just lost a week of soaking I just didn't tied up with many many other things but this is definitely looking pretty neat so that'll go back in all right then here's another one this one is basically clean now there's in the foreground there's basically nothing left on it on the background as a tiger you tiny little bit still stuck on the bottom so that one will go back in the Emerald I don't really see any difference looks pretty much the same as when I put it into me check though the photos closely but I don't see very much of a difference the garnet was the same I can't seem to see it it used to be around here somewhere but I probably knocked behind some of my crap while I was working on my projects oh here it is so here's the little garnet and it is completely unchanged since I put it in so I'm not gonna bother to put that back in again I was hoping some of this white stuff would come off but no luck so no point in putting it back in so let's get removed from the experiment I'll check back in another week and see how see how our a slit experiment is going the Emerald still looks basically unchanged it's wet so it's hard to tell but it looks basically unchanged these little fragments of Herkimer are basically clean of all of their matrix now so I'm done with those guys and here's the big one now the top doesn't look incredibly different than the last one last time some of these crystals are really standing out pretty well now but the bottom is just so cool not these razor thin fins of this black material that hang out and which aren't fortunately incredibly fragile every time I look at one funny they tend to snap and fall off you've axed a hole federally through the business side over here just really just really neat-looking you can see how thin the top layer is cuz it would need the quartz that's all stuck in there the drusy gets underneath all the crystals probably another little thin over here here's the backside which getting has some more of these little it's hanging out but yeah this came came out really really interesting you know obviously it's not a great rock specimen because it's been altered so much but it is a really interesting conversation piece more like a little art piece than a stone specimen and I might try this do a couple other ones this is kind of fun I'm obviously gonna have to hold back on any samples that I want to keep as a rock sample and obviously not soaking soaking as much but I thought it would be fun to carry it to this level and just kind of see what happens and really came out pretty darn interesting but I hope you enjoyed this it was fun for me and I'm sure we'll come up with something else", "U9DyHthJ6LA": "ah scuse me is there a toilet nearby quickly do you mine I've got it is it nearby there's right into the green room right into the green room [Music] hey what's going on everybody for first we feast I'm Sean Evans and you're watching hot ones it's the show with hack questions and even hotter wings and it's a banner day in internet history as we open up season eight with Gordon Ramsay he's one of the world's most decorated and successful chefs with an empire that includes more than a dozen restaurants countless best-selling cookbooks and seven hit TV shows including MasterChef junior which returns to Fox this February Gordon Ramsay welcome to the show great to see you so we started hot ones about four years ago and shortly after we put up our first episode we're bombarded with requests to get Gordon Ramsay on the show and as the show has grown so too has that albatross around our necks which has followed me from the Internet to the airport to my family get-togethers so this one is very much for the fans I'm nervous in a good way but at the same time I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulder so I just want to say thank you for coming in today you're welcome good to see you Congrats by the way thank you very season eight amazing and I have four kids there pay me to come on this dad I want to see how good your palate is or how strong your palate is you've got a big mouth you shout and scream all day long but can you take a hot wing so finally under immense pressure from the family and a lot of supporters out there I'm here the world has pressured us into this room Gordon that is it if it all goes tits up after this it doesn't matter we may be hot ones okay [Music] okay so how long were these wings cook for oh I knew that this was gonna happen damn yeah yeah cuz a bit [ __ ] overcooked fly eating a mouthful of [ __ ] sand [Music] a good wing look at your arms that's a good wing right there yeah yeah but so it needs a bit meat on them things like a quail so Gordon as we mentioned in your intro MasterChef junior comes back next month one of your many shows that become a global phenomenon when you think back and all the times you've been wowed by the raw talent of a child on that show is there a story that stands out I think of some of the earlier kids now you're back on season one the other into the 18 19 year old Alexander from season 1 and yeah this guy is a prolific chef he's barely 19 years of age and for the last five years he spent weekends and holidays in some of the most amazing restaurants across the world so I say them no mom no dad no school teacher you love me gonna hate me it's gonna be the best football coach you ever met in your life but you'll come out of this a much better cook and they do what's been the most disturbing thing that you've ever seen unnoticed or uncared-for at a restaurant and Kitchen Nightmares that's a really good question so I went into a refrigeration unit once and saw a tartar sauce three and a half years out of date how [ __ ] dumb must you be to use this tartar sauce that's stank to use a source that's festering bubbling like something out of [ __ ] Harry Potter that was off three years ago several Stuart littles spotted in the corner the kitchen yeah big [ __ ] not like cats I didn't know they only have cats they didn't resemble hey it was a [ __ ] rats yeah pretty shocking from rats to mold to recently come across the restaurant with plastic cheese over nachos covered in mold you have any idea how long cheese needs to sit in a fridge that's plastic cheese to get mold [ __ ] years yes hippie-dippie green while they smoke you might come up with these names probably opium okay hmm okay so the restaurant business is notoriously difficult with these thin margins and then of course infinite space for human error and then when you're a chef who's famous and has this large empire that goes across several continents you end up being a target for the type of Yelper or TripAdvisor comment or there's like this place is a total ripoff I could have made it for three dollars can you explain in layman's terms the basic math behind how a twenty five dollar cheeseburger might end up on a menu mmm I've seen chefs with freaking gold leaf on a burger ready to get to a hundred dollar mark which is a bit stupid really because you don't go near a [ __ ] burger with gold leaf and white ain't that flavor so twenty five dollar burger it's all about the patty the thickness the blend it depends on whether it's a Chuck for the short rib a great brioche bun and how you lay that up with here all the trappings of a luxurious burger is there a hidden cost and running a restaurant that most diners are unaware of yeah it's called rent and labor costs two big key factors in running a successful business landlords they win either way so the more successful you are the more rent they ask for the less successful you are the more demanding of the rent so the great way of identifying a classy restaurant is being full on a Monday night Friday Saturday we'll look that'll take care of itself naturally if you can fill it Monday Tuesday Wednesday you'll not depend of the way there [Music] [ __ ] grapefruit in hot sauce few series I know that you spent your early years studying classic French technique you're bouncing around restaurants and London and Paris working alongside some of the most influential chefs in the world so at that in mind I want to bounce some of the people some of the mentors that helped shape Gordon Ramsay into this battle-hardened perfectionist that we see today and just curious what you learned about cooking what you learned about business maybe even what you learned about life from each okay we'll start with Marco Pierre White mhm [ __ ] phenomenon a nut buster a ballbreaker super talented chef if you thought my performance sometimes was shocking in the kitchen that was a [ __ ] Hollywood blockbuster right there Oscar nominated Marc appear wine that guy had finesse he could close his eyes and dress a play beautifully and he could come out looking like a Gucci handbag I mean stunning how about geese of what he said what was amazing it was like this perfect Frenchman that was your hardest [ __ ] on the outside and then you look at him it's the kind of guy that your grandma would take the [ __ ] bingo we had one and a half days off a week that half a day if you took that half day you're [ __ ] so he had to be in there no pay and shown willingness you have to learn and as an English cook enough education I had to bust my ass off twice as hard now yeah one of the best chefs living today and still a prominent figure nada cuisine how about Joel Robuchon Robert Sean was a taskmaster combined Marco Tony Bourdain geesa wah Alvaro all together and you've got durable shop because you know and the outside world it was this incredible successful genius but behind the scenes oh my god you know from raviolis flying over your head to [ __ ] copper pans to I used to see ducks flying from one end of the case of the other thinking that just reborn the [ __ ] wings the only thing was missing with the feathers I remember me telling me that the best thing ever happened to was a [ __ ] that ran down my mother's leg when she gave birth to me how did you get up in the morning concentrate and work the next day on that one then so for all those beautiful Millennials and snowflakes out there trust me the more you get pushed the thicker your skin they're picking your skin trust me the higher you go [Music] cheaver goal from where out of New Jersey rights to a gold and you mind if I sponsor the wings getting forwarded is like pay for some [ __ ] decent meat on those that would be a dream come true for us there's a trade emails we'll trade emails South nippy at the beginning is like nip nip nip immediately so it's not a it's fine no mm-hmm it's not super hot so with your many best-selling cookbooks than your how-to tutorials online you've inspired a generation maybe several how to up their food game but today we want to give a lesson to the spice Lords can you break down the perfect Gordon Ramsay at home burger and describe how to make it as much detail as possible yeah so for me it's about that blend I would go sixty ground beef ten percent fat blend that with Tim sent Chuck and then I would do almost like a luxurious for it in there and then the last parts somewhat lean so a bit of a tri-tip in there in a way that it sort of holds that thing together so it's tight the cedar of great burgers in the seasoning and so to many people make the burger but they don't season it properly so season this thing chili flakes garlic powder salt pepper severe seared strong Kara's Asian on top and then it's the basting and so once you've caramelized that burger on top don't worry about it still being raw inside you baste because as you base that the butter it seeps through and become so much more richer the fat camera Liza's on top of the burgers the flavor layers beautiful brioche bun beauty toasted and then bait so not is it toasted but it holds substantially all those juices the most important thing about a burger let that thing rest before you bite into it and that's what happens sometimes they cook the burger they buying a meal it's our man it's all pissing out yeah let it rest let it sit inside there and then stack of usually [Music] so you made this one and it's out [ __ ] day 2017 can't you afford [ __ ] sourcing dates oh no I just stage battles oh is that good yeah [ __ ] here we go so where's my nice I like that you do yeah that's quite zesty that's that's fruity I like that smug Serrano some more engine there yeah I mean I'm not too sure about apricot but big big that's good image now it's getting hotter you know yeah little bit is sort of starting to move on the armpits I'm sweating that's how we do it here Gordon Gordon we have a recurring segment on our show called explain that Graham where we do a deep dive and I guess Instagram pull interesting pictures that need more context yes I'll bust out the laptop I'll show you the picture so you just tell me the bigger story does that sound good yes sir I do brilliant Judy's diving people talking Instagram what's wrong with you do you go for another okay Gordon first things first do you remember this meeting of the minds courtside at the lakers game you David Beckham and Kobe Bryant yeah I got absolutely [ __ ] there really yeah because five minutes prior to that I threw the first ball out of the Dodger Stadium the game was so [ __ ] boring DB takes place a cleansing basketball so I went to the basket way I got into such trouble because you can't go from throwing the first pitch out then go and watching the [ __ ] basketball ten minutes later can you well you again yeah no not good and so yes at ringside there it was the first time in my life for six for two I felt like a short us it was [ __ ] 7-foot tall it's no longer down there it's like [ __ ] so loved the game and yeah Kobe one athlete Jesus incredible do you remember this lunch service at Downing Street with Tony Blair and Vladimir Putin yeah I mean quite honestly probably the first time as a chef I still between two guys customers actually shat myself thinking this could go off any minute entering down these streets getting pelted by see if their supporters outside they're anti-putin and anti flan ever since that day I've never got involved in politics right based on that lunch you mentioned turning one of those leaders ill based on a funky and bad oyster or a [ __ ] chicken wing we didn't serve tickling his there by the way I did the most amazing paramos to sea bass with a computer martyr and a beautiful shellfish vinaigrette and we finished with a Bakewell tart so I remember the menu you know as if it's last week powerful lunch but couldn't wait to get the [ __ ] out there [Music] yeah okay that's hot now tingling them again yeah in the back half here mm-hmm yeah yeah hmm okay so we've talked a lot about your tangible accomplishment yes Michelin stars TV ratings yeah I'm curious about some of the more unusual highlights and lowlights from your life of the following daredevil moments which was more intense hunting down a Burmese python butchering a wild boar are tracking down puffins in Iceland yeah I have to say tracking down puffins in Iceland let me know via this is how this country lived yeah four four four four decades that level of protein across those winter months is brutal so sort of hanging off a 600 meter high cliff with a rope and a [ __ ] net catching this furry bird to eat and I made this amazing dish puck that's hot that thing by the way [ __ ] it started to come true now what you're laughing at yeah it's a big deep breath so and I made this amazing puffin salad made this bread yeah and improved it in this active volcano in Iceland dug the hole stuck it in amongst these rocks came back the next day and [ __ ] bed was nicked someone stole it so I'm still looking for that Viking that stole that [ __ ] amazing loaf of bread bastards [Music] oh yeah yeah okay yeah nice moving yeah yeah also it's just a little bit it's not time not good that one is it it's a tough one yeah sort of one also it's us mm-hmm so when people have reached their peak in a profession whether it's Kobe Bryant I think that's uh I feel like that burning a new ring on my [ __ ] ass you and I both Gordon III on this one now I know this song means Ring of Fire was that Johnny Cash I won in this [ __ ] seat there's nothing coming through so we're okay all right but everybody in production be ready okay yeah ring a fire holy [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] is somebody with a foot in both worlds who's more insufferable TV critics or restaurant critics the both come from the same cloth to the both standing staring I wish they could be you so [ __ ] you take on the chin chin please you in the same pot well you know it seems like on paper at least that you would enjoy the linguistic flair of a good take down so I'm curious I want to hit you with a few infamously savage restaurant reviews and I'm just curious how about your ear from an insult level before you go there I remember once the unique standard years ago when I first opened and this amazing food critic described one of my dish yeah I scored it you know [ __ ] yeah looking like toxic scum on a stagnant pool I'm like [ __ ] really that's how you describe my [ __ ] dish toxic skull in a stagnant pool [ __ ] did I really hurt you that much let me bounce this one off of lace from Jay Rayner writing for The Guardian in 2013 he said of the muscles at Leon de Brussels in London the meat inside the shells is small and shriveled and dry each shell contains what looks like the retracted scrotum of a hairless cat Wow so that's savage right yeah so we can't talk about quitting's like that but they can talk about us like that I'm a firm believer in keeping it professional but not personal so I had a run-in once with a critic and unfortunately asked him to leave but [ __ ] my heart's beating as well like [ __ ] the drum what is going on with these [ __ ] wings did you make this sauce this next one is from Pete Welles in the New York Times Guy Fieri's restaurant in Times Square why is one of the few things on your menu that can be eaten without fear regret called a roasted pork Bonnie when it resembles that item about as much as you resemble Emily Dickinson jesus christ almighty a good morning glad you've had a [ __ ] great day I know guy but any chef that turns around puts a donkey sauce on his [ __ ] menu gonna get a kick in ok cuz if my wife was sat there thinking sweetheart have the ribs with the donkey sauce it doesn't quite ring well does it you know [ __ ] happens take it ok and shut the [ __ ] up and then one more at the risk of being a bit cheeky yes Owen is from the late Sunday Times writer a a go about your own restaurant aubergine in the 90s the chef is a failed sportsman who acts like an 11 year old [ __ ] him [ __ ] him yeah I didn't realize coming the hot ones I'll leave you [ __ ] free ourselves yeah I mean Jesus Christ nice I have a [ __ ] you can now put a label on that [ __ ] thing Jimmy huh it haunts my dreams yeah I mean the wings are getting [ __ ] smaller and smaller now they look like my [ __ ] granddad's no [ __ ] these [ __ ] big toe how'd you get a chicken wheel it looks like my granddad picked oh wait till you buy into it it tastes like your grandfather's big toe [ __ ] yeah that's like [ __ ] sticking your tongue in a [ __ ] plate of acid mm-hmm Jesus Christ yes what's the [ __ ] gonna happen tomorrow we're back behind the line tasting and perfecting right the [ __ ] you gonna be tomorrow I mean not to coinage [ __ ] I'll be in town I'll be in town Gordon and you're never one to mince words when it comes to items that don't reach your culinary standards whether it's your hub food that's laced in truffle oil our tasting menus overrun with foams but how does Gordon Ramsay feel about some of the 2018 food trends that have been bubbling up across social media we'll find out today Steven laptop please Gordon how are you doing my man now feel like I just swallowed a [ __ ] mouthful of bandages do you have any thoughts on this black foods trend known as goth foods everything from jet black ice cream to all black burger buns made with activated charcoal Oh [ __ ] out really [ __ ] I'm now [ __ ] crying over [ __ ] wing and man that's [ __ ] hot yeah so charcoal

seasoning yet we put in a key now a small knob at a time now we come off the heat back on there now see you got to get down around all those therefore it's better yeah I know it's not only that I've just gone for a piss and now I just touch my finger oh why my legs are bending over like that now why do you tell me just with some gloves just give me some marigolds damn that's on you is that the chives what the [ __ ] it's not the [ __ ] you smoked here in California you sure their choice maybe oh my lord okay oh [ __ ] oh Jesus Christ okay from there back off the heat again good look at this chunking together kip now it's coming together now that's the texture we won right yes okay back on and now we start seasoning okay [ __ ] in does this thing come out of where'd you get these things from there we go go yes back off the heat what good now to slow it down and stop the cooking process a touch of creme fraiche in there mix that in yep soak up the spoons please my groins [ __ ] piping hot now as well jesus christ almighty and then from there finally in all that in now don't beat them thing with a taste first we're going to take it out until you're happy with it what does that need some hot sauce no [ __ ] soul okay now we don't the wolf [ __ ] hot sauce in there Jesus Christ I'd be [ __ ] pissing it in a minute okay there text your booty done all right don't you dare pour hot sauce on that it is too perfect the way it is and thank you very much Gordon Ramsay all the way through the hot ones gauntlet and looking like a million bucks [ __ ] you and now there's nothing left to do but roll out the red carpet for you my friend this camera this camera this camera let the people know what you have going on in your life I'll [ __ ] off right now I need to see a [ __ ] doctor [ __ ] yourself I've eaten some [ __ ] in my time [ __ ] breast milk macaroni and cheese this has to be the worst I've ever [ __ ] eaten shame on you big boy hey what's going on spice Lawrence this is Sean Evans checking in to say thank you for watching today's episode I pledge that I will put up a new hot ones next Thursday at 11 a.m. and all I ask in return is that you smash that subscribe button it's been a childhood dream of mine long before YouTube was invented to one day have a five million subscriber channel and we're pushing it we're getting close help make this fully grown adult man's dream come true who appreciates you spice Lords I do", "6gbf56LRinM": "what's up guys I appreciate everybody stopping by clicking on the video as usual we are so so so so close to 20k subs let's make it happen so today's topic of discussion is a particular build setup that I think is definitely top tier and definitely essential to having your loadouts you know me guys I always want to inform you on what works what doesn't and when there's something that really stands out and when there's something that's really important to have I definitely want to share it today we are going to talk about status effect builds and honestly just how amazing they are to add now a couple days ago I posted a video that focuses on status effects and the primary skills that I was using in that video where the blinder Firefly and the jammer pulse really amazing build to have I used it in legendary missions and it's seriously a really good asset for the team gives you CC crowd control you're gonna be a really beneficial part of your team because it's gonna put you in situations where every time an enemy is trying to push you you can kind of stop what they're doing and really get your DPS player so just focus all of their fire on a particular enemy on a particular group also those drones robot dogs are extremely extremely annoying on invaded missions and especially annoying and legendary mission so if you're interested in a build that gives you a lot of crowd control and just gives you a lot of control over all of what's going on I would highly suggest checking out that build I will put a link at the top of the screen for you guys right now so what do I mean by status effects I mean bleed fire damage disrupting enemies blinding enemies basically just putting your enemy in a vulnerable state status effect builds and PvP especially are definitely top tier now I tweaked my PvE status effect bill just a little bit to cater to the fire starter chem launcher and just make it an overall fire starter build and that focuses on burn damage and I put it to the test and Conflict the other day and I can honestly say that it was performing amazing the most annoying players to fight against are definitely rifles you know glad canon snipers stuff like that this bill that I created here although it's not done it's not completed it's not fully optimized whatsoever it's in a really good spot and I will show it to you guys here in just a second but the main to status effects that I'm focusing on in this build in the gameplay that I'm showing you today is the fire starter chem launcher and the jammer pulse now the main reason I went with the jammer pulse is because I wanted to destroy other players skills shields seekers bleed hives turrets whatever it may be my fire starter chem launcher is on our very small cooldown and the way I built my setup with all my gear my burn damage is very high my radius and my chem launcher is very high it honestly just lights players up I mean you're gonna be burning everything and it's gonna make other players panic and it's just really good to have especially and some of the gameplay footage that I'm showing you here when I was versing people with snipers or other players with rifles that were just camping in a certain spot it's really really easy to shoot a fire starter chem launcher right at them you know fire a couple bullets in their direction it can Knight the fire and a majority of the time when somebody's running a rifle or if they're running a sniper they're really squishy and if you're optimized towards burn damage you're gonna melt their armor and they're gonna die very very fast the fire starter Chemlawn sure is a very good counter to rifles the reason I like pairing the fire starter chem launcher with the jammer pulse is in situations where let's see I'm being pushed by another player that has a shield I can activate my jammer Paul's take out their shield shoot my fire starter chem launcher fire a couple bullets dodge out of the way and a majority of the damage is gonna be dealt to that player is gonna be from my fire and I do have ignited on my assault rifle so I'm gonna be doing extra damage to burning enemies I have spark wicked and it's just the overall good setup and it's honestly probably my favorite build to run at the moment because in title update 8 nobody has a hundred percent hazard protection let me show you guys what I'm talking about real quick so I have the build on right now I'm experimenting with a lot of things to be honest with you the build is not done it's not complete so I understand that there's certain things I can add to this to make it better I get it understand but I'm using the firewall specialization just for that extra burn duration and you also light enemies on fire when they break your armor which is really really good the grenade as well it's probably one of the best grenades in the game if not the best grenade in the game the area of effect is absolutely insane and this is good to happen now my primary weapon I went with the police m4 I wanted an AR with ignited now ideally I would want a pyromaniac I haven't got one yet but that's the gun that's gonna replace this one I'll give you guys a quick overview of pieces that are really good for status effect builds now if you agree with me let me know if you think there's better gear pieces to use also let me know let everybody know you know we're here to help each other out but I went with three-piece China light mainly because explosive damage 10% skill haze and 10% status effects now my mask in particular has really really good rules so I have one skill tier god rule 10% status effects which is what you want for status effect build 12% skill haste and 11.2% skill haze for my mod now my chess piece I experimented with a couple different talents now I used to have spotter which I don't think is very great for PvP it's decent and PvE the reason it's not that great in PvP is because the extra damage you get from spotter is reduced in PvP and also every player a majority of the players have 50% pulse resistance so you're not really getting the full potential of that talent I went with spark it's been working out pretty well this is my second piece of China light gives me one skill tier it's got some weapon handling which I wish was something else almost God roll status effects 9.7% another 11.5% skill hates mod and I'm telling you guys spark is pretty good so since we're using the fire starter damaging an enemy with a skill increases weapon damage by 15% for 15 seconds so as soon as you light somebody on fire you're gonna get a damage bonus increase I do have two pieces of library to pieces gives you skill damage and 10% status effects that's the reason I wanted two pieces of wyvern this holster gives me a skill tier almost got all skill damage and I have God role status effects on my holster if you guys are looking for attributes like this I highly encourage farming on heroic for some reason I don't know if it's just me but as soon as I switch from challenging to heroic difficulty the roles have been amazing and also if you get the chance to hop in some legendary missions whether you beat it or not usually 85% of the time you get pretty decent gear from legendary mission I get a lot of God roles on I'm running Legendary's my backpack is my third piece of China light one skill tier six percent skill damage 10% status effects 10% skill haze and wicked so wicked is also really good and it's very easy to proc with the jammer pulse so all you have to do is pulse your surroundings and you'll get an extra 18 percent damage boosts for 20 seconds and then you'll also get the damage boost if you light somebody on fire so applying a status effect increases total weapon damage by 18 percent for 20 seconds my gloves are my second piece of library one skill tier six point two percent skill damage and ten percent status effects last piece of the kneepads HANA you one skill tier god roll ten percent skill damage and god roll twelve percent skill haze so this is the type of setup you would want obviously doesn't have to be identical to mine it could be different types of brand sets whatever fits your playstyle but ideally what you would want is high status effects rolls and high skill damage rolls so going to the firestarter chem launcher which is obviously the topic of discussion today I have seven ammo 16 second cooldown my radius is about 4 meters cloud duration is about 20 seconds which is definitely good 561 cake damage 278 cave burn damage and the burn duration is 12 seconds which is a pretty long time second skill guys jammer pulse this is the skill you want to have for PvP because it's gonna shut down enemy skills anything seekers shields turrets whatever it may be hives this is definitely something you want to have at least one person on your team should have a jammer pulse if you guys are really serious about synergizing and pvp overall I highly recommend somebody run a status effect build on your team cooldown is 16 seconds the EMP effect duration is 14 seconds and the radius is 30 two meters and it's only a two second charge time which is pretty quick this is good I'm PvP this is good in PvE you can turn off dogs you can destroy drones and it staggers enemies when you use the paws so definitely definitely recommend this alright guys so this next portion of the video is for all my PC people out there anybody that plays on a monitor honestly I had the opportunity and I want to give a special thanks to Ben Q for sending me a brand new monitor now this monitor is the Ben Q ex2 780 Q if you want more information on the monitor I put some links in the description below as well as the specs if you're interested you guys let me tell you something you really don't realize how bad your monitor is until you get a monitor that's 4 K 144 Hertz freesync I mean the picture and the performance of this monitor is absolutely stunning I've never experienced anything like this before to be honest with you so it's great about 144 Hertz it allows for the utmost and smoothest images possible I mean like I mentioned the picture when I was playing the vision - and the overall performance of the monitor was unbelievable this monitor is free sync and gsync compatible this monitor also has built-in HD RI and built-in 2.1 speakers for immersive gameplay now one thing I look for when I'm looking for monitors and one thing I didn't have on my previous monitor with speakers and man I can really say guys the speakers on these monitors are fantastic I got to say one of the coolest things about this monitor is the addition of a remote control that actually arrived with the monitor now with this remote control you have a lot of different things that you can access you can change all of your HDR settings - game cinema whatever type of picture fits your preference you can access all of your settings you can change the volume on your speakers and there's just so many different options to tweak this to a particular way that you find most enjoyable it might seem obvious but I've never experienced a PC game at its full potential and this monitor is definitely something that you should put on your list especially if you're into monitors or if you're a PC gamer looking for a brand new monitor to replace your current one I play division 2 and all settings in 4k 144 Hertz made the experience amazing my old monitor only had 72 Hertz and it may seem crazy but you can definitely notice the difference when you upgrade from 72 to 144 I was playing at 120 frames per second and it was smooth like butter so like I said if you want more info on the monitor there's gonna be a bunch of links bunch of information in the description below thanks again to Bend to you for the gift you guys are awesome I appreciate it I love this monitor if you found the video helpful today found it enjoyable be sure to leave a thumbs up subscribe to the channel if you're new I appreciate you guys so much peace out [Music] you", "BMTCeTzV9Zc": "Arun check if I have fever Hey why are you crying like this? God! you are having high fever Exam fever It is ok to study for 50 marks. Study only the important questions Hey prashanth, what to do if those questions don\u2019t come in the exam Buddy! We will steal the question Yes da! We will steal Hey be silent Tell me only the important questions Hey take it soon Buddy! We will steal the question Yes da! We will steal Hey. Be silent. Why are you breaking my confidence? Will study Hey it is 4 o clock What? So soon it is 4 o clock? Hey Prashant, it is 12:20. See properly the minute and hour hand What? Is it 12:20. My fever increased. I got viral fever. Convey to our teacher tomorrow that I am not coming Hey  be quiet Its already time. We will not be able to steal the question paper now. Isn\u2019t it? Buddy tell me if to steal or not Now how it is possible. Its already time Tell me if to steal or not We will steal it. But how? Super buddy. Super buddy I will tell note down That algebra Hey where does algebra come in physics If you do not know accept it. Here it is there Give it. Hey what is this? They have asked completely irrelevant questions I know. When they told it will be tough I thought definitely it will be inside the book Let it be from wherever. We will write a bit Do you have the 7th standard math book? Hey why 7th standard? We are 12th Then why did you steal 7th standard question paper Hey question papers are here No. This is our question paper No. There are two lines drawn after the letter \u201cV\u201d.

We have fear until we write the exam after that teacher should have the fear. Leave it What buddy Cheers buddy", "dHXw2NdRcnc": "[Applause] [Music] this is my most favorite chapter of all of the chemistry chapters nuclear chemistry so get those black notebooks out this is going to take about two weeks to do and the stories are phenomenal in this chapter absolutely phenomenal so it says nuclear chemistry so it must have something to do with the nucleus so this is just review for right now don't forget the nucleus has two subatomic particles in it the protons and the neutrons now reference table Oh in your reference table that says symbols used in nuclear chemistry it has these right on there so for protons it's this P 1 1 or H 1 1 plus either one of those you can use for a proton and remember protons only found in the nucleus they have a positive charge they're found in the atomic mass and they're also found in the atomic number in fact protons make up the atomic number of an element and remember at the beginning of the year I said you could change the neutrons you can change the electrons but you can never ever ever change the number of protons or else the element would change well that was true all the way up until this chapter now on this chapter something weird is going to happen to the protons all right so that's protons neutrons neutrons n 1 0 which means the neutrons are found in the atomic mass but they are not found in the atomic number okay so neutrons found the atomic mass protons found in both atomic mass an atomic number and electrons they're not in the nucleus so we're not really going to talk about them right now now next thing we're going to talk about we have to talk about this before we get into the good stuff is this isotopes we did this like the first month in September isotopes here's what it means so in other words an isotope has to have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons so another definition of isotope so you have two definitions of isotope got the same number of protons different number of neutrons or the same atomic number in the lower-left but a different atomic mass those are the two definitions of isotopes also if you remember me telling you that every element has at least three isotopes every element has at least three isotopes so let's do the first one the first element is hydrogen and let's just do the three isotopes of those so don't forget H 1 1 H 2 and H 3 1 do they abide by the isotope rules yes they all have the same atomic number which means the same proton number but they have different atomic masses so let's look this has 1 proton 0 neutrons this has 1 proton atomic masses 2 got one Neutron this one 2 neutrons now here's the deal every single element I told you has at least 3 isotopes and of those 3 isotopes one is considered to be radio active now you don't know what radioactive means yet but it's got to mean something strange so for these H 1 1 H 2 and H 3 1 this one H 3 1 that's the radioactive element so radioactive elements and I'll tell you a little bit something is going on with the nucleus and if something changes in the nucleus chances are the element may change if the proton number is messed around so every element has at least one radioactive isotope it's sometimes called radioactive isotope but mostly it's called radio isotopes so we will be discussing Radio isotopes next one remember I said I don't like the elements written that way but that all 15 or 16 or 17 that's the atomic mass okay so the way I like it written is you put the 15 here to 16 there and the 17 there and since it's oxygen oxygen has the same number of protons so it's eight eight eight eight and then if you want to find the number of neutrons again subtract subtract subtract so we have eight there seven there and nine neutrons there now of these three isotopes of oxygen the radioactive isotope or the radioisotope of oxygen is this one Oh 15 is radioactive so that must mean like I said before something is going on in the nucleus okay all right now this is what you're going to put in your black notebooks that was just revealed so we're gonna put down Roman numeral one natural transmutation now you've never heard of the word transmutation before but trans means change and mutate means there's a change so transmutation just means something is changing into something else okay natural means it does it by itself natural transmute a natural transmutation so here's the definition we'll write it down when one radioisotope so natural transmutation when one radioisotope changes into another radioisotope well how does one isotope change it to a different isotope well if it changes into a different element that must mean something happened with the proton number and that's the whole deal about transmutation and radioactivity it's all about protons what happens they change and if the proton number changes the element changes okay so when one radioisotope changes into another radioisotope that's the first thing for number two there are three types of natural transmutation that's what I want you to write down three there are three types three types of natural transportation okay now before we do those three types of natural transmutation we have to talk about the periodic table and I'm gonna just shoot the video over to the periodic table don't forget the periodic table is arranged in order of increasing atomic number which means it goes by the number of protons now remember protons positive and the deal is this as we get like manganese is 25 protons and we keep on going protons are positive and they're packed in a small area and remember likes repel so they don't really want to stick together and by the time we get down to atomic number 82 which is led of the three isotopes of lead two of them are radioactive and one is stable all right so that has to radioisotopes and one stable one because remember that means there's 82 protons but they don't want to be there so they start shooting out of the nucleus okay the very next element bismuth that all three isotopes of bismuth are radioactive so what I'm telling you is this the last non radioactive element is led after atomic number 82 all the elements after atomic number 82 are radioactive which means all of their isotopes are unstable and they spit out protons so they're all radioactive after atomic number 82 which is led okay all right now one more thing atomic number 92 is uranium notice that's the last element that's totally dark totally colored in that's because it's the last naturally occurring element on the periodic table after uranium all these elements are man-made okay so uranium is the last naturally occurring element on the periodic table all right now knowing that now we'll get back to the three types of natural transmutation now like I said there's three types of natural transmutation and the first type has to do with these things alpha particles you heard of alpha particles before yeah you did Rutherford's gold foil experiment he shot alpha particles and gold foil so here is a short video on the gold foil experiment by Rutherford put in by atomic school on YouTube and extraverted New Zealand ah with a booming voice and a big laugh he knew they were positively charged because they bent in the opposite direction to the electrons of a cathode ray when passed through charge of parallel plates they bent more slowly than electrons so he knew they were heavier than electrons to Rutherford used these alpha particles as atomic bullets and fired them at a very thin sheet of gold it was only about a thousand atoms thick on the opposite side to the uranium sauce he placed a scintillation screen that lit up when particles hit it so he could then measure where the alpha particle landed if the gold atoms were like billiard balls then the alpha particles would be blocked and none would arrive at the screen instead almost all the alpha particles pass straight through the gold foil wasn't there Rutherford realized that the gold atoms were mostly empty space JJ Thompson thought that the mass of atoms was pretty evenly smeared out within the substance and he also thought that most of the alpha particles would pass through but something very surprising happened some of the particles were bent a few degrees off course and about one alpha particle in twenty thousand bounced right back in the direction from where it came Rutherford said at the time that it was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you what this meant was that the mass of the gold was not evenly spread out at all but concentrated in very small lumps that were positively charged he had discovered the atom's nucleus because the nucleus was so small most alpha particles didn't even come close and completely miss them they went straight through if some went close to the nucleus its positive charge would cause repulsion and bend them of course if an alpha particle made an occasional direct hit it would bounce right back from where it came because the nucleus was much much heavier than the alpha particle itself the nucleus is incredibly heavy over 99% of the atoms weight is concentrated there and incredibly small if we magnified an atom to be the size of a football stadium the nucleus would be the size of a pea Rutherford later discovered a particle inside the nucleus that was responsible for its positive charge and he called it the proton an atom's overall nuclear charge was equal to the number of protons at hand in its nucleus and this also turned out to be the same as the atoms atomic number each element had its own number of protons in its nucleus how's that sort of coincidence number one under alpha particles here's what an alpha particle is 84 two plus two that means an alpha particle has two protons four minus two is two two neutrons but it says a plus two up there so an alpha particles got two protons two neutrons but no electrons so an alpha particle is this it's simply the nucleus of a helium atom without the electrons that's what an alpha particle is okay all right now what that means is some radial isotopes spit out alpha particles and if you spit out something that's got two protons in it it's got to change what the element is so there is a handy dandy chart and the chart is reference table N and this chart tells you what Radio isotopes spin out alpha particles so an alpha particle another way of showing an alpha particle is looks like that I always say it's like a fat fish swimming to the left so that's the symbol for an alpha particle and on reference table end it shows some of these alpha emitters they're called now so what's the big deal about an alpha particle well first of all it's got a positive charge alpha particles got a positive charge they've got a mass of four am use so the way I look at an alpha particle is this compared to all the other particles that are shot out of the nucleus this one's the biggest so when you think of an alpha particle I want you to think of a bulldozer and you know bulldozers are really big but they go very slow okay so watch if I had a radioactive element on the tip of this and it was an alpha emitter I could hold it just like this and I wouldn't get hit by any alpha particles because alpha particles only travels several inches before they dissipate so for number four why don't we go metric they only travel several centimeters okay number five number five is they can be stopped by skin or clothes stop by Skinner's clothes so they don't have very much penetrating power so if I held an alpha emitter like this chances are it wouldn't do very much to the person but I have a story coming up later on about alpha particles and my sister okay so stop by Skinner clothes I put down number six we're gonna leave that blank right now because the next thing we're going to do is called alpha decay alright and that is going to be an asterisk now remember what I said is if I had an alpha emitter radioisotope right here and I held it like this it wouldn't even hit me and if I brought it here chances are it would be stopped by Skinner clubs okay so are they harmful to people well let's talk about that on this sheet on reference table N one of the alpha emitters is this our n that's radon-222 so let's see what the atomic number of radon is it's 86 so now listen an alpha emitting radioisotopes means it spits out an alpha particle so watch our and 222 that radon is an alpha emitter so it throws out an alpha particle so what's left the mass is on the Left have to equal two masses on the right the atomic numbers on the left have to equal the atomic numbers on the right so look that 222 lost four so now we're down to this to 18 and that 86 lost two protons so that goes to 84 and the new radioisotope is called polonium okay so watch hmm what do we know about this an alpha emitter means that it emits an alpha particle and what happens is the atomic mass of the alpha emitter goes down for the atomic number of the alpha emitter goes down to so down forward down - but why did I give you this particular alpha emission because of that radon radon is in group eighteen all the elements in group eighteen are gases so radon is an alpha emitter and in our area in the southern tier of New York we don't have very many hurricanes or tornados or earthquakes or fires or anything like that but we do have radon in the ground below our houses and radon is dangerous but I just said alphas they can be stopped by skin and clothes but radon is a gas so if you breathe it in the radon gas would go into your lungs and start firing out these alpha particles there's no skin or clothing down in your alveoli sacs the sex that exchange gases and so what could happen is if an alpha particle slammed into one of the cells in your lung that were starting to reproduced by mitosis it may that mechanism of reproduction and the cell may reproduce and reproduce and reproduce and reproduce that's a tumor and that's cancer so radon is very dangerous if you breathe it in because it could give you lung cancer okay all right now before we go on I told you I had a story about my sister and alpha particles so let's do another one of these alpha decays okay so this is the next alpha decay we're going to go and if you look on this reference table and it says that radium is an alpha emitter so any alpha better pump coughs up an alpha particle and remember if it's an alpha emitter mass goes down for Tomic number goes down two so this mass is 222 and that goes to 86 and eighty-six happens to be radon so radium is an alpha emitter it spits out an alpha particles and it turns into radon now a story about radium my sister was born with very pale skin blue eyes blonde hair and a big red birthmark right on her cheek and my parents were totally freaked out about that and this is about 1955 and you know nuclear chemistry it's pretty young so a guy in New York City said I can get rid of that without having surgery and my parents said great and in 1955 it took about six hours to get to New York City my car and so they went down there and what this doctor did is he had a cube of radium and he taped it to my sister's cheek where the birthmark was for about 15 minutes then took it off we drove home we did that three times back and forth and eventually after three times the birthmark was gone and everybody was happy well you have to remember this radiation causes cancer and it also cures cancer two weird things it does both and how does it cure cancer it kills rapidly multiplying cells like the tumor cells well my sister was only about five or six years old when they strapped the cube to her cheek and radiation kills rapidly multiplying cells that's why girls if you ever go in for x-rays the first question they ask you is are you pregnant because if you're pregnant you can't get x-rays because x-rays kill rapidly multiplying cells and there's nothing more rapidly multiplying than an embryo so about a year or two later after my sister had that birthmark dissipated by the radium she was getting her adult teeth well guess what none of her adult teeth wear that Cuba radium was taped on came in she's missing two molars on top and two molars on the bottom why because that radium killed rapidly multiplying cells and her teeth were rapidly multiplying cells the adult teeth were and they never came in so she's got to fake teeth on top to fake teeth on the bottom but she's two years younger than I am and she's still doing fine so those are the two stories so remember alpha particles if you breed them in could be dangerous and if you have some crazy material like radium stuck to your cheek it could cause damage and we're going to talk about who discovered radium a little while later okay so we're going to do one more alpha decay to remember if it's an alpha emitter mash down for number down to so this one this one is francium 220 and the top number is 87 and once again if it's an alpha emitter it spits out an alpha particle so the new radioisotope that's formed down for and mash down to an atomic number so we go down for mass that's to 16 down to a number that's 85 and that is a T okay so those are three examples I'm going to give you two examples to do and to email the in so we're probably going to be doing you're probably going to have ten of these to do and email me in okay so here are two that I want you to finish and these are pretty easy so number one to email me in the first alpha decay is uranium 238 92 that undergoes alpha decay the second alpha decay so the second alpha decay I want you to do is thorium-232 90 don't forget alpha decay means the radioisotope spits out an alpha particle atomic mass down by four atomic number down by two so those are the first two that you should send me next so that's alpha decay so you know what an alpha particle is is huge like a bulldozer it moves very slow the penetrating power isn't very much stopped by skin and clothes but if you breathe it in it could be deadly and that's got a positive charge and it has a mass of four amu okay the next thing this is capital B these are beta particles and on here on reference table and again a beta particle is this B with the tail on it and a negative sign that's what a beta particle symbol is remember an alpha particle is like that fat fish swimming to the left of beta particle is a B with a negative on there now this is very interesting because the beta particle is nothing other than this a beta particle is a high-speed electron so what's the symbol this e0 so that's the symbol of an electron the 0 up there means there's no electrons in the atomic mass the negative 1 means whatever the atomic number is you just put a little negative there and that's how many electrons so beta particles are high speed electrons number 2 obviously they have a negative charge and they have hardly any mass so remember I told you you got to think about an alpha particle as a bulldozer really big but very slow well the way to think about a beta particle is it's a cannonball so cannonballs are only about this big much much smaller than a bulldozer but they're much faster so you have alpha particles of bulldozer and beta particles a cannonball now you know cannonballs go very quick and so they're penetrating power is much greater than alpha particles so beta particles can be stopped by a book you know about that thick or table a piece of wood anything like that now these will penetrate skin okay so we're going to be talking about all this later but we might as well talk about it now when the nuclear reactor blew up in Chernobyl in Russia firemen were called to the scene to put out the fires the problem is nobody told the firemen that there was radioactive material on fire and the radioactive material was giving off beta particles now these beta particles penetrated their firemen's clothing and they don't feel anything it's not like getting hit by a bullet or getting knife or anything like that if you're hit by radiation you don't feel it until later so after they put out some of the fires not all of them they went back to the firehouse they took their heavy-duty clothes off and they looked and they found that their skin had turned brown and they're going looks like I have a suntan and a little bit later on after their skin turned brown their lips and tongue started turning brown and then their skin turned black along with their lips and tongue and their skin died and if your skin dies you die so those firemen all died that put out the fires because of these beta beta particles and it's called this number five a nuclear suntan oops so nuclear Sun 10 is due to getting hit by tons and tons and tons of beta particles and it is lethal it will kill you alright so now we have this we got the bulldozer alpha particle don't penetrate too much we have the Cannonball beta particle very quick penetrates more but they're much smaller than the alpha particles all right now we had alpha decay as the first type of natural transmutation this is the second type of natural transmutation this is called beta decay so we're going to put an asterisk we're gonna write down beta decay now all we have to do is look on reference table and to see what Radio isotopes decay by spitting out beta and let's do cobalt-60 so we're looking for Cobalt that's 27 now watch what happens remember alpha decay spit out a helium nucleus and I went down for down to beta decay spits out a beta particle a member of beta particle is simply a high-speed electron so the atomic mass on the Left got equal the atomic mass on the right atomic number on the Left got equal time I've known were on the right so zero atomic mass so sixty over here the new radioisotope is going to have a mass of 60 that's 27 but that says minus one and if there's 27 on this side there's got to be a total of 27 on that side so we got to put 28 because 28 minus 1 is 20 seven so here the atomic mass stayed the same for beta decay but the atomic number went up by one so 28 happens to be nickel so in beta decay the atomic mass stays the same and the atomic number goes up by one I remember that nickel isn't a stable element that's a radioisotope that's radioactive nickel okay so that's one of the beta into case we're going to do two more and then I'm going to give you two to do remember at the beginning of this lecture I gave you three isotopes of hydrogen and I said that one H 3 is radioactive so that spits out a beta particle so let's see what's left we're going to have to have three there that's zero so three mass and then if that's one and that's a minus one this has to be two two minus one is one and what has the atomic number of two helium but don't forget that helium is going to be a radioisotope it's going to be radioactive all right one more that I'm going to give you two to do this is tech tinium 99 so let's look for TC and it's 43 all right tech tinium 99 is a beta emitter so it spits out a high-speed electron so the atomic mass stays the same at 99 and the atomic number has to go up one so it's 44 44 minus 1 is 43 so what's 44 are you so those are three examples of beta decay now I'm going to give you two to do so I have question one and question two this is going to be question three in question four cesium-137 and let's look for the atomic number for cesium it's 55 so you're going to do cesium 137 55 you're going to do a beta decay on that and one of the most important ones like ever and we'll talk about it later on is number four and that's I 131 that is radioactive iodine 131 and the atomic number is 53 so you have two alpha decays to do and now you have two beta decays to do alright okay now the third the third natural transmutation we fed alpha decay we've had beta decay this is called positron emission you never heard of the positron so a positron sounds weird has a symbol of this it looks like a beta particle but it is positive so a positron is a positive electron now this is very very weird but I'm going to show you how a positive electron is form so going like this so positron is a positive electron now here is what happened remember P 1 1 is a proton all right one of the top number one in the atomic mass so what happens is this a proton blows up all right it totally explodes and it gives off two products and I'm going to show me the first one now if a proton blows up and gives you one Neutron there's something else but look you got one atomic mass you got one atomic mass so the other thing the other subatomic particle that's blowing out of the proton has no mass so it's going to be like this you know we got zero up here because if we have one on that side we gotta have one on this side we already do there's zero on this side one there so this thing has to have this so when a proton explodes it produces a neutron and a positron that's what happens so now we have positron emission which is like alpha decay or beta decay alright so we look on this chart and we're looking for a beta with a plus sign next to it so we're gonna do two of these so the first thing we're going to do is this and put down number two so potassium 37 throws up a positron so it's going to like this yields positron is a positive electron so what's left what is the new radioisotope on the other side that's 37 that's zero so this has to be 37 this is 19 this is already 1 over here so it has to be 18 18 plus 1 equals 19 and 18 you all know is argon argon all right we're gonna do one more positron then I'm going to give you two to do and that's going to be iron 53 and iron I think it's 26 so all you have to do and there's only one there so now we have five for homework 2 alpha decays 2 beta decays and one positron emission okay so those are the three ways that natural transmutation works natural means we don't have to do anything it does it by itself so we have alpha decay beta decay and positron emission those are the three natural transmutations but we didn't talk about something we talked about alpha particles we talked about beta particles but we didn't talk about the third emission from Radio isotopes and that's gamma rays so capital a was alpha particles capital B was beta particles capital C is gamma rays something weird here alpha beta particles and this is array hmm so the symbol for a gamma ray is this and gamma rays are way different than alpha and beta particles remember I said three things can make one radio isotope change into another alpha decay beta decay and positron emission this doesn't so this does not artificially transmutate one radioactive element into another well what does it do well first let's talk about what is a gamma ray so number one first of all it has no mass and no charge second thing is it travels to speed of light because it's a ray it's like a light ray so if it doesn't transmutate anything then it must not change the proton number and if it doesn't change the proton number it doesn't change the element so we're going to put an asterisk at number four so what does a gamma ray actually do if it doesn't mess with the proton number what does it do well here's what it does if a radioisotope is giving out gamma rays it's lowering the energy content of that radioisotope okay so for number four bigweld asterik that's a big one it lowers the energy content of the radioisotope so it gets less and less and less and less the longer the gamma rays are being emitted now remember alpha particles can be stopped by skin or clothes or anything like that beta particles you need something a little bit thicker like maybe aluminum foil or wood or a book it won't stop what's going to close gamma rays these things are incredible here's what you need to stop a gamma ray you need at least six inches of lead or you have to be underground over thirty feet down or you can have about a six foot thick reinforced concrete and steel structure that would stop it but a school building will go through one wall it would go through all the students go through the other wall remember these are really dangerous because radioactive particles that hit you kill cells that's how it works so lowers the energy content of radioisotope stop by six inches of lead or thirty feet of dirt or like six feet of reinforced concrete and steel but it doesn't change the proton number so it doesn't transmutate so just remember for this lecture three ways to artificially transmutator radioisotope alpha decay beta decay and positron emission okay", "j7_lSP8Vc3o": "[Music] la la la make a change I

this is beta one point two point twenty point one and in this edition you can enable education edition and this unlocks the chemistry lab which brings chemistry into Minecraft now disclaimer alert I was not taught this stuff at school so I know what a periodic table is I have actually built one using these blocks which represent the different elements in the periodic table so when it comes to things being scientifically accurate I'm not your guy unfortunately but I'm gonna walk you for all the things that have been added with this and it is pretty pretty fantastic pretty interesting it comes with a lot of practical uses in survival mode as well there are items gonna change how you play the game in survival minecraft but if we scroll down here now those items are actually accessible as you will see we have all of the different elements of the periodic table right here all of these names so many of them are very interesting and cool and that's all that there appears to be but believe me there is in fact more things to check out for example there are sparklers underwater TNT underwater torches hardened glass blocks and a super fertilizer to make plants grow instantly those are just some of the things that have been added and we're gonna check out every single thing that's been added with this I will open this chest and show you a couple of examples there is some elixir right here which can cure blindness if I remember correctly we'll go over that again later and I'll tell you exactly what it is that it does we've also got these red balloons which are filled up with helium so what I'm going to do is I'm going to spawn a pig and then I'm going to attach the balloon to the pig and the pig is going to go off into the sky you know real practical uses peeps that's a very practical use it's gone it's literally gone I I want to do that a couple more times oh wow don't run away just yet look at that we're making pigs fly oh they go up this so quickly don't they now if you're watching this video and you're part of the beta of the bedrock edition you might be thinking I want to check this out self and I'll show you exactly how you go about doing that you need to create a new weld and then in the options for creating a new world you need to activate cheats and then simply select education edition and this is gonna add the chemistry lab to your game now if you're thinking I want to know how to be a part of the beta that is something I'm not gonna tell you in this video because it was a huge pain in the butt for me to actually get into the beta and to get it working and it's not the sort of thing I can make a tutorial on but you can go look up other guides and if you run into problems you will know the headache that I went through to get this to work but anyway let's go and jump back into our world so we shall start by checking out two of these blocks the first one is the element constructor and look at these textures man I love that it's got a unique texture on each side these blocks are extremely cool we have the material reducer as well we're gonna check that one out second so let's go and open up the element constructor this is gonna require no power no items being put into it it's basically going to give you stuff for free what you have to do is configure the elements and you do that by telling it the amount of protons electrons and neutrons that are going to go into this so let's start by adding a proton and an electron and we've created the very first element which is hydrogen and I can simply just you know drag that over and over again probably can shift drag it for a stack no you can just take one at a time but that's all you have to do it's pretty cool stuff now let's go ahead and make the second one which is helium so if I go and add one extra proton one extra electron and a nutrient we get helium like that it's pretty cool right the third one is lithium which is free of each and there you go we are making the elements now you'll notice the electrons have these rings around outside are going to guess this is all scientifically correct it would make sense that it is because education edition I don't think they're going to half-ass anything here that is extremely peculiar and interesting to me and so is all of this but as we as we drag them around randomly you see it's kind of tricky to land on the correct one so let's go and do one with a different amount you can also click up here for example if I set this to 42 this one here to 42 as well and then that one to 50 we should create moly bdellium oh yeah these these things start to have a crazy names let's go make Ron diem if we put this up to five on each and then it's 58 I believe 58 of those makes Ron diem I'm in and you can make all of the different elements of the periodic table over there using this thing pretty fascinating right now there is another way to obtain these items as well if I just go in here and grab a couple of random items let's grab some sand from down here as well and we go over to this block which is the material reducer we will be able to reduce materials to there the elements so this could be like entirely accurate certain amounts of oxygen and silicon makes sand I know this silicon in sound that sounds like a legit thing okay so brick blocks no stone bricks no I'm guessing that one no as well so maybe we need things that are a little bit more natural for example dirts perhaps grass would make sense as well my friends I have discovered the errors of my ways I have been putting in stacks instead of single blocks if we look at what makes up this carbon oxygen nitrogen not even going to try to say that one right there we can see what makes up dirt block as well but not a lot of blocks actually go into here for example if I try orange stain glass not having much luck maybe regular glass would have been a better try so let's go down here and slap one of those in no doesn't accept it anyway that is the other way that you can get yourself some of these elements let's now check out the next block right here this is the compound create a man that texture is so cool allow this over so much we can use this to take some of those elements and combine them to create other things like Minecraft items like charcoal ink and sugar can all be made in this and then a whole bunch of other crazy items as well which we can use to craft some of the cool stuff I'm going to be showing you at the end of this video so we're gonna start off by do is chucking in one sodium and one chlorine and this is going to create salt as you can see NAC oh it shows you it right there we just we just made some salt I've got no idea if there's any uses for this and apparently I can take as much as I want and then put those back that's very cool now sometimes you're going to need more than just once if I to put in one carbon and one hydrogen we don't get anything but if I put in nine carbon and 20 hydrogen we get ourselves some crude oil and notice again it's the C and the H and then the amounts that we have and I could take as much crude oil as I want ah this is this is insane right here so then we've got some iron and some sulfur to make some iron sulphide ah crazy look at these little items right here they look very interesting and then we've got six carbon and six hydrogen to make benzene I think that's how you say that one now not all of them require just two things and you can sort of put them in I believe anywhere as long as they're in there together right so order and stuff is not too much of a problem I got one down the bottom here that requires four we've got carbon we've got hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen or with different amounts and you can put it together to make luminol don't even know what this stuff is but it but I'm excited by it and now we have the lab table time for some mandatory inspection of all sides of the block well not the bottom side but just like those textures leave me alone in here you can put together some of the things you saw us craft in just a moment ago and and combine those things to make other items of which free of these I think are actually really useful in survival well at least they have a use if we go into here though and just quickly create some a manoa hopefully I'm saying that correctly I'm sorry if I'm not and we mix these two things together we should be able to combine that into something now that just started to animate after I put in that other item right so perhaps that's showing you when you're doing st. corrects and maybe each of these different types animate depending on what type of thing you're creating but if I combine wow I was not expecting that we've got ourselves some super fertilizer now here's what we're gonna do we're gonna put that over to one side in a chest and we'll be checking it out at the end of this video there is more to be made though first of all we've got to make water and this one's a classic h2o and there it is so we've got some water and these things together should make us a heat block of all things so let's just chuck them in there and then see what it says aha look this one on this side now animates oh that is so very cool by the way there are only four things you can make in here as well so hopefully we will see that middle one get animated as well and different particle effects this time that was fantastic and we now have the heat lock we're gonna put it in here for later peeps we're making some more stuff it's sodium Act eight this time and we need four of it to go into here to make an ice bomb of all things there's the animation let's click combined and particle effects now it's time for a little bit of water and the old sodium hypochlorite let's just go tuck that in there and we've got this animation over here so there are four different things you can make and we haven't seen the middle one animates but anyway particle effects time that was really cool and we've made ourselves some bleach so for the next set of items we have to do a whole bunch of crafting so let's start off with some of the easiest stuff first of all TNT mixed with sodium makes underwater TNT and then magnesium and torches makes underwater torches again we're gonna check these out later on so using the compound creator I've made a bunch of different types of chlorides and now what we can do is combine those chlorides with other items first of all torches to make color torches so that gives us a blue torch we can get a red torch a purple torch and last of all a green torch awesome and then the other thing we can do is put sticks magnesium and then each of these chlorides on top of it to create sparklers are different colors so we've got orange and then these are just like the other ones this one's gonna be red isn't it yes so they kind of match purple and last of all it will be green yes awesome okay so we made some sparklers and torches and and you know we're gonna we're gonna check it out later on and now for the last of our crafting we can make hardened glass which simply takes longer to break that's all there is to it you need some aluminium oxide and some boron trioxide and then it makes hardened glass which I gotta say looks seriously cool here's another thing you can make with this polyethylene stuff and don't tell me I didn't actually make enough apparently I didn't make enough overall I did make the right amount I was just missing something so if we do that's look at that an orange glow stick let's make a purple one and a cyan one as well so there are four different types of potion you can brew as well so we've got some awkward potions and with silver you can turn this into antidote which will cure poison the next one has Cobalts in its of all things and that makes the elixir which can be used to cure weakness we then have eyedrops made with calcium and this will cure blindness these are all effects in the game of course we're talking about here and then last of all we have bismuth which makes this tonic right here which can be used to cure nausea so those are the four different types of potion you can make with this stuff as well and now my friends we get to have fun with the contents of this box I'm going to start off by cloning the box and then breaking it if that lets make several clones breaking it so we can get all the items now the torches are probably going to be the least interesting right because they're not going to emit actual colored light because that would require changing the engine so it's literally gonna be a different colored torch each time one of these allows me to access my inventory like survival mode so there's the blue one there's the red one we've got the underwater torch over here so if we go down underwater funny enough down to the bottom of the ocean where it is dark and mysterious and look at that Oh with particle effects as well I like that ever so much that's really really nice it emits lights it's got a nice nice effect as you move away from it as well that's cool and of course it doesn't pop off so that's interesting we're probably going to need to give ourselves that flint and steel for this next one because I would like to let's put the purple torch away I'd like to grab our underwater TNT and place that down here so water usually stops TNT from working right so this time it's just TNT that does work even when there's water going into it let's use more than one block let's put down quite a few and then move away and there you go awesome stuff now we have a glow stick that apparently glows when it's shaken so if I hold down right click we're shaking it and we've used it a little bit is it sort of active now I think it's kind of active maybe we need to go down to where it's darker I've never seen this stuff before peeps okay so we can't shake it anymore let's shake this one ah look at that the stick is glowing that's cool and so's that one actually I didn't really notice did I so give it a little shake oh man and now it's nice and visible so this bleach that we got in our inventory is simply used to remove dyes from stuff is it a one-time use it is so that's probably not worth messing around with but you can convert colored stuff back into normal stuff this next one we're going to go into game mode survival and I've never seen this screen before until today it's really good I like it and now we're gonna break the hardened glass which will take a fair bit longer than usual as you can tell glass is usually pretty quick to break do you know what else we should do we should check and see if it is TNT resistant there we go I reckon it's not going be that resistant oh it is well I spoke too soon there you go interesting stuff ok I need me some some grass or some dirt near some water we're gonna put down some seeds and then we're gonna use our super-duper fertilizer what was it called again super fertilizer I was pretty close there's no duper and look at that basically bone meal that goes all the way to the fullest growth we should we should try that on saplings for trees as well and see if they will instantly grow and under what conditions as well so let's go put like a sapling down just over here and see if we can instantly grow it we can fascinating what if there are other blocks around it or other trees is it gonna grow instantly every time it is no not that time you saw it there X is asking questions and finding flaws with the super fertilizer so it's not that super it's pretty strong but not strong enough alright so the ice bomb is supposed to turn water into ice do we do we throw this oh yes it is a projectile that could be pretty fun for minigames right so we can make ourselves a little ice lake and then what we can do is put down the heat block which should start to melt the ice as well I like the transparency of this and it's animated as well so it says that like a tortured or emit light and melt the ice it could be the ice is created from the ice bomb isn't the same type and therefore it's not melting it Oh No there we go it's it started to melt there in the middle the first one that we placed it's now melting so sometimes they say save the best for last I've got a feeling these sparklers are gonna be the best it's right quick umm that's not quite what I was expecting I was thinking more particle effects although we do get some that sort of follow us as we move around how does that look like in this right here I like the fizzling noise that's cool and is that slowly like burning out okay interesting so our glow sticks well actually now if I'm not holding it and I go back to it it continues fizzling right and we know what the deal is now don't we I should I should be dual wielding this let's go let's go put one in there got me some sparklers feets Wow that is superb I love it awesome awesome stuff right well there it is it's been a very interesting video we've gone through all of the stuff in the chem lab if you have enjoyed the video leave a like as always thank you for the support and in the description box down below you can find the guide to the chemistry lab as well if you'd like to look at that but anyway that's it for me this video thank you for watching I'll see you soon buh-bye", "6AKh6ZpPdHA": "hey what's going on guys it's Kenny here and welcome back to free-for-all with every gun and today as you can see my hands are free I am doing a local theatre recording because I got this game play other day and I was using it and I was gonna record live the next the next game after this one I was playing but this game just went so well I figured I'll just do a live commentary over it anyway so forgive me if I look at the screen a lot for summary I'd just love watching playback I don't know why but like any kind of game in Call of Duty whenever like we were competitive thing I'd sit there and like watch the demos I know it's kind of nerdy and stuff but that's just what I like to do but anyway as you guys can see I'm using the 3rd LMG which is the L set and I have I have quick-draw ins something else on here I'm not sure what it is to be honest with you but uh I am using lightweight and I think I've got most of my points in the perks because I can't LM jeez I think I've already talked about this one my other videos but to when you're using an LMG yet you move like you're not moving it's like you're crawling or whatever and I hate that so I always usually try to slap on a lightweight but at the same time one flak jacket whatever I call it fab jacket but same time I want that on and you know you got you gotta keep them all on you can't just take them off so usually I'll take something off of my gun that way I can have it into my perks or whatever so anyway I don't know what's going on to chat don't mind that people are like raging like crazy at each other at first I thought it was me because when I got in the lobby that everybody just in like snipers and stuff and I was like well I'm not using those sniper and some guys weren't but most of them are using snipers and I think they're all complaining about eachother sniping or something I don't know probably a minute or something I don't know something stupid but anyway this is that oh how many LM G's are there before so I only got one LMG to go thank God because I hate using LM DS this gun though is like the most overpowered gun in the world I mean this with rapid fire and suppressor on it is like game over anything on this gun is game over just shoot so fast and as you can see I actually get on a really good streak and then I up here towards the thinking a couple kills I'd die which which is terrible because like oh man what if I get is nuclear on this all right here there was that's where I'd die because I didn't Amen because I'm hip firing I know everybody says in the comic can you hit far away too much but in my defense I like this Empire maybe I should throw a laser sights on all my guns just no matter what just throw a laser sight on them because I'm a hip firing machine but anyway what guns would you guys like to see next I'm thinking about doing the snipers gonna know a lot of people want to see the snipers and I'll probably save the assault rifles for last just because probably towards the end of doing this series I'll be like enraged with free-for-all but I don't know it it's kind of one of the more fun game types as long as no one's using like c4 and rocket launchers and stuff because like when you're trying to get that kill streak and you got c4 in your face and rocket launcher is blowing you up and you can't really do anything about it even if you have fab deccan on a rocket to you is gonna kill you but what was I saying Oh what do you guys want to see I was like what am i saying but what do you guys want to see coming up in the free-for-all series do you want snipers you want assault rifles or I think last ones shotguns and please if you say shotguns I'm gonna like shoot myself with the real shotgun because shotguns just driving me nuts but what's the score right now I'm already 18 and 2 this game was going so fast and I was just kind of like camped out in this spot because I've learned in free-for-all over playing with the SMDs and stuff that if you kind of sit in the same the same side of the map and just work that side it's a lot easier than trying to run around the whole map and look for people because like I think right here I start to run around okay no maybe not maybe it was early right yeah I might have missed it but the stabber right there gets me and takes me off my other kill streak that's to kill streaks that have been gone that I could add my stealth chopper and everything but like I was saying if you stay in the same side of the map I don't know if you guys know this or maybe you guys got your own ways but as you can see I kind of venture out here and I kind of roam around I'm like okay I'm gonna find anything so I do eventually go back to my my corner I guess or the map that I was at I stay over there that c4 almost got me I think I do have on fab jacket because I probably died there but yeah for me staying on one side of the map is a lot better than trying to run around like a [ __ ] and look for people because I don't know it's just better I spent one side of the map and if you guys say that's camping or whatever then a camper I am there's your camp video someone left a comment saying camp video and I kind of put a question mark maybe that's what they're talking about maybe I just want me to camp on one building but anyway guys holy crap what's the score twenty eight and four about to be 28 and 29 and four but anyway this game was super fun I had a lot of fun with it this guy will not die and finally he goes down but that's gonna be close enough to the game so let me get don't forget guys um let me know what you want to see in the comments the game's over right there I'm gonna go ahead and pause it right there but let me know what you guys want to see what series is next is I only got one LMG and I'll probably do that tomorrow before I go to work because I actually go to work in like 10 minutes right here but yeah don't forget to comment down what you want to see I'll see you guys later thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed the third LMG the LSAT the most overpowered gun in the game and I will see you guys later", "3ovGlVLFIcA": "before you continue with this one you must have made sure that you've already watched the basics of organic reactions which include the termination of whether any reaction is addition elimination or substitution the termination of our agents like free radicals wfs and electrifies we define that in our previous recording as well as definitions of redox now before we continue to alkenes let me clarify one last thing usually when we clarify or when we state or specify a mechanism of reactions for your particular functional group we always combine our reagent and our pattern of reaction okay and by the way this is only applicable to addition in substitution we can only use what I said just now for reactions where we actually add something so let's say I added B which is an electrophile and that means that my reaction is called an electrophilic addition and you should need to symbolize that we put the addition as the big letter and then the reagent in this case what I just said right now is electrophile right as a subscript so we actually read this as electrophilic so you read this first and then this one addition electrophilic addition let's say I have another addition reaction but instead I found out or I analyzed but that my reagent is a nucleophile then I can call my reaction mechanism and ople you're feeling addition or for example if I have a substitution reaction where in the reagent I added is a nucleophile then I can call my complete mechanism nucleophilic substitution and so on and so forth of course since elimination does not need any reagent it doesn't need a noble file or an electrophile or a free ride we always write our elimination mechanism only as big capital letter and you should know that as we go ahead to the next topics we start now with outings introductory points alkanes were known as paraffins paraffin was a an old firm Latin term for little affinity this means little affinity and that was due to the fact that alkenes are unresponsive or unreactive to most other agents that react with other gana compounds so meaning most other organic compounds have their own reactions like alcohols have these reactions are keys and these reactions prime oxalic acids have these reactions all of those which we will discuss in the next discussions but one what do you think thing about our case is that they don't really care about nuclear fast or electrophiles meaning they're just unresponsive and that and that's why you call the embarrassed and slipped affinity and remember that has a lot to do with the fact that since alkane means all my carbon-carbon bonds are single and remember that if I have single bonds you always classify those buns as Sigma overlaps that means that all my art in my art games all the bonds are purely Sigma bonds now when we discuss the distinction between Sigma and PI you must have remembered that Sigma bonds are way stronger than PI bonds and if the question is if I might if I have a compound whose paths are all hard to break then how can I even subject it to any reaction and the answer is well we can't so that's why they don't react to most things all right now another general property or LSC properties of alkanes is that they have particularly the low density low melting point and they are generally nonpolar water insoluble or in other times we can call it a slip of feeling okay and here you notice I'm not discussing them in full detail because for most of you guys you should have discussed already the basics of intermolecular forces that allow us to analyze why alkanes have low density low melting and boiling points and are generally non-polar if you still have little idea about it then I suggest you start first by reviewing your intermolecular forces 101 reaction of alkenes I mean our case is combustion and combustion does not require a nucleophile electrophile literally combustion is the common term that we use for training of alkanes usually when we burn fuel so combustion is technically oxidation with the aid of heat which well if you can imagine it with oxygen and heat we make fire and that's from Bastion right now we have to take note that there are two main types of combustion it depends on how much oxygen is present in the environment if I have sufficient or I have abundance of oxygen around me my combustion reaction can be classified as complete meaning let's say I have a hydrocarbon when I say I need to find one it doesn't necessarily mean again right it can be alkenes or alkynes as long as they only contain carbon hydrogen's so that's why I use the general for a minute ch-ch-ch executed so this can be an alkene this can be an alkane this can be an alkyne any of those will do and if I bring it using oxygen what happens is that all of my carbons are completely oxidized by adding to it two molecules of oxygen giving us the brother C over the world carbon dioxide also take note that as for our hydrogen's here our hydrogens are also oxidized and they actually become more of water so remember if your combustion is complete there are only two products carbon dioxide and water also take note that depending on the situation you may be asked to balance the chemical equation to do follow the same number of atoms before and after the reaction but we won't do that here for a partial combustion the condition for a partial combustion as as it is written here is that imagine that we have a scenario wherein there is limited oxygen access okay so now if I have limited oxygen access things are gonna be a little bit different so as usual our goal in combustion is to oxidize our carbons and sometimes you actually become successful so there are some cases that in partial oxidation you successfully oxidize carbon completely to become carbon dioxide but how about the other carbons let's say some carbons already lack oxygen the moment they are oxidized so we can imagine that for some colored ones that are unfortunate they cannot anymore get two oxygens you can imagine we are already running out of oxygens so some poor carbon atoms will now have to deal with only just a single oxygen atom because of the limited amount of oxygen and some carbons are so unlucky they don't have even a single oxygen they just eliminated as elemental carbon which is a black substance that we often call the suit also take note that just like complete combustion our hydrogen's in partial combustion will later on be converted to water remember that CEO is Redis carbon monoxide and is a poison to humans and that is why partial oxidation is going to give us potential carbon monoxide poisoning also that is the reason why for example some quote unquote 30 vehicles meaning we have unclean engines they give us black smoke okay that's because the combustion is incomplete in the black or the gray smoke you're actually looking or the incomplete combustion products like the suit okay and that's not all for alkanes we have what we call free-radical substitution of alkanes and meaning although a while ago I told you that alkanes the lock reactor nucleophiles or electro files don't forget that elective pass and nucleophiles are not the only agents that are there we also have what we call free radicals and in order to make free radicals I mentioned in the previous discussion that you need the help of sunlight that's why going back here notice once again we have the help of sunlight also note that sometimes we can write it as UV instead of HP but it wouldn't be it would mean the same thing let's say I have a halogen molecule X 2 this can be br-2 cl2 usually it's the two of those and by the help of sunlight we have here this so-called homolytically image giving us two free radicals of the hydrogen okay so that is what you call initiation step because you need sunlight to make your free radicals that this is the this is the first thing that should happen without our sunlight because it way we cannot make our free radicals in the first place now let's say I already have my two hydrogen radicals which came from step one so I'm just putting them back here in the next step propagation means that let's say I have an alkene here what's going to happen is that one of the two x's will go to point 1 and you will take the place of one of those four hydrogens long story short if I'm gonna remove one of those four hydrogen's we will only end up with frame and I just I just told you that one of the just one one of the free radicals will take the place of that so you cannot imagine that out of the four hydrogen's one hydrogen has been kicked out and this has been replaced with one of those free radicals notice that my ish here that has been kicked out can pair with the other X remember there is only one hearing attached there are two of these so the other one if you're asking a where's the other X it actually joined with the hydrogen that was filled out and as it seems it's as if we had two atoms the switch places as if this siege for gave out its age in exchange for one of the two x's in this religion since there was a switch of the reagents the most appropriate of the three types of patterns switch right the magic word is switch or exchange it's best called substitution and since we used free radicals to perform substitution when the complete mechanism is free-radical substitution and take note that this is a chain reaction meaning that once you get things going we have free radicals this will happen again and again and again most likely this will happen as lamia as I have hydrogen's to remove so like hey I have two hydrogens the idea is as long as I have like three hydrogens I can remove one and replace it with another radical then after that I have two more hydrogens left I can add another one another free radical I'm going to replace another inch then lastly if I have one more hydrogen left I can add one more hydrogen and the last time - it will be done now after all of those things I said we can can we can come up with a molecule where they are - without any hydrogen already because all of those hydrogens have been replaced or substituted with my free radical halogens or XS now what if I have two more hydrogen's here normally we know one of the XS will go here it will replace the H but now look at my compound there is no H anymore in that case it's as if we now hit some kind of plateau like hey we don't have anything to bind to anymore and the two exes we decide to just rely together giving us X 2 and because you notice in both my see X 4 and X 2 there is no more free radical remaining the chain reaction stops and this is the process of termination so you know that extermination usually will two radicals like these two X dots reunite and this is the only technical reaction for our kids because otherwise if it's not a free radical I'll guess again let me repeat will really really be reactive to probably everything else okay so after this the next thing we will discuss our alkenes and as you will notice very up really very differently", "5-Tp5BZv8Ds": "hey come back- I'm a lot of your world son hey what's going on guys it's getting here welcome to Twitter class I don't really know the number I'm just gonna say that right now I think I just said this for the last episode but I never checked so right Oh shrimp that's a bad way to start but anyway I'm not really sure that the number on this video is probably like age or something i'm not really sure anyway today's class is brought to us by solar it's like ODST or something I don't really remember I need to probably check on stuff before I make these videos know my I don't really I don't really know but anyway today I'm using the vector only with a scavenger pack in my backpack I got to scavenger pack wait where do I hold that scavenger pack do I have like a fanny pack on the front to the scavenger pack goes in I don't understand maybe I just pick up the em off the ground nothing makes sense anymore I don't understand oh no mr. knife man ho chi minh what were you kind of doing back there soldier Miley holy crap come on get him all yeah go team a goat me my teammate over here cleaning the house oh my God he's for no get the nuclear son you can do it anyway guys I am freaking so ecstatic right now I don't know why but I am in the best mood today i woke up at a what time like ten ten o'clock had to go to the vet at eleven so i woke up at no it's 1030 because i remember did I had to throw on some clothes real fast cuz i woke up late and i had to go check on my pup make sure he's doing alright and i got some really good news and he's doing fine his bone like did fracture and break or whatever and it's kind of sticking a little bit but the doctor said that over time he'll like pretty much make a joint around where his bonus so it should be fine and then like in every school ground we'll just have to we'll probably have to do a hip replacement if we want which we probably will because it's only like two grand I mean I know it might sound a little expensive but if I don't know I see my dogs as my children so if you know if you do something for your kid I would do it for my dog just put it that way but oh my god this scavenger and vector class over here is freakin domination city man if you got this gun it's over I'm sure with a lot more perks I'd be going ham right now but that's fine I'm not really kind of i'm not really concentrating as much as i could but i still am trying to get some some decent kills here not trying to let you guys down too bad i cannot wait for Preston to get frickin better man I am I'm ready to get the nuclear now I'm gonna freakin try concentrating super hard I've been reading the comments i'm going to try using some of your class suggestions I'm gonna put on counter UAV finally as you can see I got out of some court score some score streaks are a little bit different right now but that's fine because i'll just change about the day I wanted to use headway again I missed him I miss my old buddy take him back an ominous I'm gonna light up your world son oh crap oh crap the shoe room okay they're coming for me they know who I am all look at this spa right have you guys ever seen this spot look at this Oh anyone see me I'm like Houdini over up that guy saw me he was back there fixing dinner I popped out what is our army I don't know what that means maybe it's like some some Brazilian thing or something I'm not sure oh god he's got the pokeball out he knows where we're at he's got our location down packets in assists holy crap that guy is amazing alright if any of you guys this my saddle it crazy cuz the freaking ps3 but if any of you guys have a ps3 here not using and this is laying around and you know collecting dust in your basement in a box maybe just kind of chilling you got like three of them or something you're just hanging around the house of for ps3 s send me one for the love of God I don't want to spend the money on it because I know the ps4 is coming out but it's gonna be you guys have an extra one or one you want to get away for like 50 bucks or something let me know man cuz i will buy that i was watching the last of us gameplay oh my god she's got a lowrider kill holy crap got my back you know me like that i was just watching the last of us gameplay by chris smooth who is like one of my new favorite youtubers of all time i love watching this video suit he's so good at what he does and it's just inspiring to watch him in like I don't know he does good with the video said he does i put it that way he's he's pretty good so I subscribe to him actually and I'm not subscribed to a lot of people believe it or not I don't usually subscribe don't usually follow a bunch of people because you know if I don't like it I'm not going to watch it and stuff so but anyway he has some good commentary man and everything so shout-out to Chris Smoove going big with the full screen that's the only reason I found him i was looking up like full screen partners but just to see what's in the with me but his videos are amazing and i want to play that game so bad so if you guys have an extra ps3 let me know man send me a youtube message i'm so excited i'll pay you man i'll give you some money but anyway guys besides that this class setup a i don't know i'm doing alright with it i probably could have lived a lot more than i have been because you know I'm kind of talking not really paid attention and God dang it like that right there I probably have seen know if I was focusing but it's all right now it's all good I'm so excited for my dog come home I'm so excited for Preston to be able to feel better so we can record some videos I'm so excited for tonight I'm going to the drive-in I'm gonna go see now you see me which has like one of my favorite actors my new favorite actors he's from zombie later I don't even know his name because I don't really know the name of any actors but what that guy just teleport all the way around their holy crab be Mike my Katie's going terrible here which I don't really care about but besides that I'm so excited we're going to the drive-in the last they're not the last of us that I like I was getting ready to go watch that movie which it should make that a movie that be a good ass movie but I'm going to watch now you see me I don't know if you guys have seen if you have leave a comment I probably already seen it by the time you seen this video but if you have leave a comment tell me what if you liked it if you didn't I want to know this game is dragging on forever Alaska my plate was literally like 10 seconds long and this was like at least what six minutes now or something is crazy where'd that guy go I don't know whether their team just like they vanished man they're like a bunch of ghosts seriously those did you guys look did you guys not like see those two guys right there help me to you mate how many how many come oh my god are we losing oh my god working our asses kicked no wonder this game singing so long man we were going so good and then all of a sudden our team was like Harper skirt way ain't going in there suckers for cinema where is their team where could they oh there's one oh noes no oh no this sentry guns taking me out oh my god we got freaking demolish their team you are kind of failing wonder 11 steelhead how are you even won an 11-man did you just buy a computer feel like 10 FPS or something I don't understand anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this episode thanks for watching I'll see you guys in future Twitter class episode don't forget to go follow me on twitter if you want to be one of the hosts of these videos not the host but if you want to you know if you want to give me a class i was trying to think of it i'm making hand gestures right now you can't really see but if you guys want to give me a class follow me on twitter and state like pay attention because I when I say Twitter class Go Go Go that means first the first reply gets first class when to use so thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed I'll see you guys in the future episodes goodbye", "jc-GEtwXxbQ": "no [ __ ] you stand hey what's going on guys it's Kenny here and welcome back to free-for-all with every gun and today I'm using the Peacekeeper it's the last SMG on the list of guns to use and I'm sad because I love the SMGs but I'm actually I just can't wait to get this gun out of the way I am just I'm not liking it I'm not liking it at all and I'm not liking this game right now because there's no one freaking spawning who first blued that's so good staying stay in the manly get in the hand-to-hand him oh man this could be a good game if i play my cards right gosh almost stood up that have been Bad News Bears someone's gonna spawn out here oh baby this could be a good game this could be the nuclear oh shoot son well this poor cowboy guys I've killed like 4 times in a row no counter UAV up no UAV for you sucka where'd you go cowboy Dan where'd you go poor cowboy dude this guy is just getting demolished right now Oh baby Oh shrimp I forgot to put on a scavenger I have no ammo Oh shrimp alright I had to pick up the scorpion at least it's an SMG we're keeping the SMG going here Oh under tech no [ __ ] you stand OH why'd I peek come on but let's do something holy shrimp what am i using rubber rubber bullets or something in this freaking game what is this map called I totally forgot this map is called oh my god I'm 11 1 alright well I can still get a pretty good score here I just got to keep up the pace the pace of dying to the MSMC after I tagged him four times point blank what a lovely pace come back here I'm gonna take my kill gosh why are they all there's other people to shoot at I'm not the only one just cuz my name is freaking missus boob fire doesn't mean you have to pick on me mrs. boo fire is wrong with this one Oh oh gee gunner all gone off the LMG please let the LMG oh the LMG is 2stronk Oh God bouncing betty trying to get me killed no come on I know my gun has more presidents will be like an assault slash SMG mixed why am I getting killed from farther range oh hello hello there Stan Stanley the manly what do you think you're doing around here mate oh gosh anyway guys I should get on the topic oh is that my bouncing betty I should get on the topic of what I wanted to kind of talk about he's just shooting the Betty but yeah Oh shrimp Oh God the Seaport anyway I wanted to talk to you guys about something that's kind of cool that might be happening in my life and that is that we are actually me and my girlfriend are looking at houses in town which means faster internet baby I'm so excited I really hope we can like find a house and get a loan or whatever and talk to a bank and get something oh god damn it I should just pick my stab button and took that guy out but if we got if we get this house guys I'm gonna be so happy I'm gonna have a new house tour video coming up I'm gonna have better internet I'm gonna be able to livestream I'm gonna be able to do everything I want I'm gonna live so close to work that it's gonna be ridiculous I'm gonna say freakin but a lot of money just in gas alone not having to drive 20 minutes to work in 20 minutes back it's just gonna be awesome guys so pray for me and hopefully I can get a new house keep it to keep things going oh god I thought they got to the wine everybody should do that one but basically just have a I don't know I've always wanted to move in in town I hate the country I don't like living out here it's peaceful and all but for everything I do the games I play the stuff I want to do now YouTube that I got going I would rather just I'd rather not be out in the country the trees are great and all but I'll stay I'll take a 1 bar of cell phone service any day that way we don't have to pay for a stupid house phone that I don't even want we got to pay for a dumb house phone I don't even want it oh man we're oh my god I need two kills holy crap this game has gone so fast man I've only died Oh God never my six times I thought it was like twice oh there's the game baby picking it up thirty and six is the Peacekeeper gosh I'm so happy to get this guy out of the way thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed assault rifles are next that or Snickers I don't know maybe I'll surprise you guys so anyways here's the final killcam taken out late I don't know who that guy was but anyway taking out the old gamer sitting them down two and 15 outs poor guy I know guys thanks for watching I'll see you guys in the next episode goodbye", "zkTfTcEqsH8": "hi everyone so part way through San fransokyo there guys from big hero 6 get stuck inside these dark cube things so I'm gonna talk you through how to rescue them hopefully it's gonna help you out if it does drop as I like below but you've got to move pretty quickly so use any kind of rails or any kind of shot block movement that you can do to get over to them as quickly as you can so use this to spin around and get a little bit closer to them and then once you find them the first one that I'm going after is gogo and I'm using the shot lock to get a little bit closer and essentially I want to jump on top of this ball and use this ball to smash into it and that will free up Goku who smashes out of it and that's one that's the first one done it's the next up I've got to go after the next one and if you can see the markers in the air then just try out after them and like I said earlier you can use the shot locks to get a little bit closer and just keep moving quickly because you are against the clock now for this one you've got you've got honey-lemon and she's used their chem balls to attack the dark cubes which you can see these kind of like masses here now you can attack them and slowly chip away at them but the best thing to do is to use magic so you want to use fire and electricity to be able to trigger a reaction and that will break out honey-lemon relatively easily now next up I've got Fred's and as soon as you approach you've got like all of these enemies firing at you so it's a good idea just to spin around and take them out but the thing that you're supposed to do with with this one to get spread out is you want to stop the arms from holding on to the post that's like four of them to go now you can use the shot block to spin a couple of them out but because there's still enemies to take on it doesn't massively help what you actually want to do is take all the enemies out or certainly as many of them as you can jump as close to them as possible and then press square and again kind of keep that with each one so you're looking to press dodge around the bars and you'll spin around them and and free its grasp if you can do each of them quickly enough so I think that's three just the last one to do it's tricky and then if you're not quick enough it kind of like reattaches so you've got to do them relatively quickly I think that's the last one and I managed to do all just about quickly enough but that's essentially what you want to do go around and dodge around the bars to free up the arms and that will break thread out and that leaves you we've just wasabi now it's easy not to know where we're savvy is but actually he's up on high you can see his he's kind of like marker up there on the left hand side so unless you decided to look up there's no way you've know he was there now you just want to head up a building and and dodge on over as quickly as you can and then you can just sort of run up the building and what you're looking to do is build up some momentum and then get into this this kind of like air vent and then come down on a ball and press to attack it from above so you want to do a downward strike you should see an x mark if you get enough height from the air and that will let him free so that's it guys hopefully it helps you out and if it does

to be if you're you know on the beach they figure you've got the ocean right there and it's mainly just sand there's very little vegetation it's a pretty safe place to have a campfire and so you go

pretty much all of the salts that we've got here is so the fun thing about having those driftwood type fires is that you get just all kinds of different colors now you would actually sell it sell with its like that oh that is so tight you know they sell they sell those presto logs that they literally have soaked in just a bunch of solace and so that you get all these you know periodic little pockets you'll get green flames coming out that's that's this is copper I mean it's the characteristic really but you know other ones so they give me some people have done that I mean where they've actually like taking a copper wire and wrapped it around to search them wrapped around a log it was home in fire you know you'll get some great instead of coming off of that Tom they got that some of the some of the other ones they have different colors but we don't want to do them you're in the class lead lead salts they give off it's not as easy to see on this because it's flames blue already but they give off a really light blue flame so if you change if you change what your combustion stuff is like if you're using it in a camp fire which appears to have mostly yellow or white flames on it and you do something that had that you would get the blue out of there potassium is a violet that comes out so I'm half I've got of these things have been so worked over if I have a potassium so what are you gonna do the new it well I've been trying to use these things up for years okay what about synthetically what about like made element stuff like that well I think for the most part with our synthetics we just don't we don't I mean I've never done because I've never messed with a I think the most part we don't have that much of them I'm sure to lab so place them to make s'mores the class 18 this is this is I'm serious it's not a joke who makes more sense know what we're gonna make ice cream in class if I could no no no and i say there's no to pass you forgot me ice cream be removing norton that's good why do you say s'mores it's some more just I don't you guys see this one is a little different than the other ones we've had it has alex mores of reach for I would make funny around at the skin fecal you found this obsession purple flame oh yeah one that you didn't even realize he was singing about that digit seen purple rain it's like I couldn't believe it when mr. all right oh my god it's freezing yeah it works up here it goes yeah yeah go yeah it's nice yes ah that's nice I need you here Sigrid the part I don't like being bad whoo tell me someone's videotape that So You King pumpkins oh oh let's just get on the floor we have missed the garbage game oh that's disgusting it's coming out the two oh my god oh he doesn't ask ian is it warm it's like steaming

Ok... and you really didn't know why I mean, everybody was fighting so he... he started riffing about the chem trails and he started to say things that hit home so hard and I would recommend that everybody try to get what he said online whereever try to get a copy of it and just listen to it because I was so moved that I had to write this song", "FndrP5p10xY": "you [Music] so i have a short story you um so that's going to be the the protocol so let me share my screen and tell you a little more about the course and then we'll jump into some material okay okay so you hopefully can see that on your screen and so i did post this uh last week so this is our our syllabus and um so yeah so i do have to go through it so so the objective really of this course is is quite broad it's quite interdisciplinary um we're going to focus on four main areas uh atmosphere chemistry aquatic chemistry tereso chemistry and we'll look at natural chemical cycles the impact of human activities uh distribution degradation of water or a major pollutants in the environment including things like water and then we'll also have uh discuss current topics in environmental chemistry and i'll explain later how we'll do that so the objectives of the course really is to have students like you to educate and understand the natural natural processes of environmental chem develop a deep knowledge in the subject and to think critically and then later on to browse the primary literature for articles pertaining to environmental chem and present these ideas through an oral presentation and a written term paper so this will be done later in the course and i'll touch upon it a little bit today but i'll talk more about it next week okay so i've already introduced myself i am in my office right now um but i think we'll be doing everything electronically so the best way to get in contact with me is uh through this email address here and please note that my email address here doesn't have a hyphen so if you do put the hyphen in it will it will it will bounce back it is a long email address i apologize uh prerequisites so you you need uh organic chemistry and analytical chemistry all right so you know so i before i start talking about materials this is how we will be evaluated we'll have a an exam before thanksgiving um i'll talk more about that later later on there will be an oral presentation again i'll talk a little bit about that later that'll be starting around mid to end of november attendance and participation i'll talk a little bit about that so um you know as i mentioned i'll do a roll call at the beginning of class and i want this to be you know we are in line so but you know so let's you know let's not think of that as a negative thing but let's try to use this as a way to you know ask questions and participate together and it's really you know it's really not hard to get 10 out of 10. you basically uh you know come to class and you know if you you know if you miss you know class or two or something because of you know i understand you know we're all busy and things happen you know no no problem okay and if you ask a question or something or participate and i sort of outline yeah so if you attend the lectures and student seminars ask a few questions over the course of myself for the student presenters you can really expect to receive a grade of 10 out of 10. okay you don't have to ask a question every class you know probably you know and it's not like i really keep tabs or keep count but at the end of the class i i have an idea of who might you know at least make the effort to participate and i know it's a little challenging in an online format but with seminars and with my lecture content uh you know i encourage you to you know to participate as much as possible okay and if uh and you know part way through the course i'll give a little i i can give some feedback in terms of where i think you are with that but really it's uh in my opinion it's uh everyone should get 10 out of 10. um you guys will have a term paper due at the end of the like and or early december december 7th this is related to a topic in environmental chemistry which i'll discuss next week so don't worry about this now but over the course of the next few months there will be a paper that you'll be writing with respect to a topic in environmental chemistry and this will coincide also with your oral presentation so the same topic can be used for both the presentation and term paper again assignments relate to the term paper you might be wondering what that is the term paper will be divided up into several different sections in terms of things like abstract introduction background and significance you know selection topics so on and so forth what i'm doing is i have little deadlines for these assignments that you submit to me and i give feedback on that and there's five little assignments if you do those uh you get five out of five so really there's no reason why anyone everyone shouldn't get five out of five it's really just a way to keep on track and it's a way for me to offer feedback just simple submission all these assignments um lets me give you feedback but you're not graded on the necessarily the quality of it it's just to help keep you on track so make sure you get those in and again i'll be talking more about those in a second uh final examination that will be at the end of the course 30 i don't know exactly how we'll do that um so you know it could be a combination of a like a a longer exam or take-home open book i'm not really sure but that's later on the course and i'll have more details probably next month for that i'm glad everyone found us here on zoom these are the details okay uh okay what else is important office hours so it's yeah so let's see how it goes if you have any questions about content or anything related to the course definitely send me an email and i'm happy to chat with you we can set up an appointment over zoom or phone call no problem if it's a question that i think would be perhaps a benefit to everyone else i'll answer your question but i'll probably bring it up for the next lecture just so that other people have the opportunity to um you know to to hear the answer as well this is of course if it's related to content and so on and so forth of course of course of course if it's uh personal related obviously i would not share that uh the midterm exam is tuesday october 6th uh you will have two hours to write the exam and submit it onto canvas okay so it's hard to talk about an exam when i haven't even start teaching yet so just put that in your back pocket for now and we'll talk more about that later uh textbook so there's a textbook for the course let me see if i have it in my office no i think i have it at home but it's try to remember to bring it next time it's uh environmental chem by colin baird and michael cann i i use some things from it it's not essential that you buy it or you know get it you know the best source of your notes will be from these lectures here it's uh it's nice to have if you want a second explanation but i do not say okay you must read chapter five and chapter five will be on the exam the exam will be from questions and topics that we do in the class all right so the textbook can be a useful resource but i i don't explicitly require students to to get in to read it okay so we're all using canvas now which is a new platform so everything will be communicated through there or email course material will be divided into four major sections um so atmosphere ozone layer which will start today climate change toxic organic compounds and pesticides and then water chemistry and green chemistry okay um all right so miss course component policy all right so if you know if if you can't make it to class or if you know something happens or you get get get ill um you know just just let me know and if you can you know you know you know if it's possible get a doctor's note but this year is going to be a little different and i think the faculty science is still working on finding a policy during this covert 19 pandemic in terms of what the policy will be for this course component policies okay but i i guess for now what i'm saying is if you can't get a note and you miss something great if you can't you know don't ignore it and let me know and tell me what's going on so and and i will you know i will be understanding and have some flexibility there um okay term paper is due december 7th that seems like you know years from now right but that will come pretty fast i'm just telling you now that um 25 will be deducted per day so after four days the grade of zero will be signed so you really have to get it in make sure you get it in on that date or before okay i'll talk a little bit about the oral presentation so there are 19 students and you guys will work independently and will deliver an old presentation to the class there will be a list of topics available on blackboard that shouldn't be black or that should be canvas and you'll pick two primary primary articles of interest from the literature the presentation will be about 12 minutes long and we will be graded based on clarity content and quality and i'll talk more about this later on 15 of the grade actually sorry that's a typo two twenty percent of the grade will be on the oral presentation okay so i will update that twenty percent um but for now don't worry about that i'll have a list of topics next week if there are certain areas environmental chemistry that you do want to discuss that you know about for sure you can always email me and we can have that discussion no problem but there's a ton of topics to pick from uh and then relate to the topic each person each student will write term paper and i will have guidelines for that also next week as i mentioned before there's five percent related to writing assignments of the term paper so various writing assignments are required including selection topic article selection article selection means going to the database and finding a primary literature making sure that you're picking the right type of paper so um you'll send that to me and i'll give you feedback whether it's appropriate or not an abstract and paper outline no rewrite of the paper will be allowed so you're strong encouraged to receive feedback on your writing through these required writing assignments so it's really a free five percent i give feedback back the more information you give me the more feedback i can give final exam that will be at the end of the course we'll talk more about that at some other points so every tuesday we'll meet uh right here on zoom and these are this is the the course outline okay so we're here september 8th um and i'm talking about the course we'll talk about the different areas we'll start with the ozone layer and then we'll talk about the troposphere so really a lot of the first month we'll be covering the atmosphere and the ozone layer and cfcs and then we'll have a midterm exam and then during the thanksgiving break uh thanksgiving is the day before then that we have a fall reading break so there will be no classes that week and then after thanksgiving we'll meet for uh three weeks and we'll talk about energy toxic organic compounds water chemistry and pollution and as you can see on the right what i've done is i've put any potential readings from the chapter that would coincide with what i'm going to be talking about they're not essential readings they're from the textbook but i know some students might like to have a reference just to read just to have uh sort of a different perspective of how that's taught i don't cover everything in the chapters and there'll be some things i teach that are not covered in the chapters but there are some definitely there is some overlap so that's what those uh readings correspond to and what i've also done here as you can see on september 29th uh you have a topic selection that's due that's for the the term paper or a presentation so that's worth one percent of your grade so by the end of the month you got to pick a topic and then a week later you got to pick an article okay and that's again worth uh one percent of your grade at the end of october i want to see an outline of your term paper okay so that's about six seven weeks from now okay and i'll give feedback and again just submitting that to me earns you one percent um and starting november 10th we will start having student presentations okay so we'll have something like you know six or seven presentations from from you guys and i'll also teach a lecture and then moving on to november 7th 17th and 24th it'll be all student presentations and the expectation is that um you know you do it over powerpoint and you do it um you know live uh just like i'm doing now and you'll be able to share your screen and i'll teach you how to do all that um it's it's not very not not very it's not very difficult to share the screen but that that's the expectation um and introduction background significant with hypothesis that's part of your term paper that'll be due november 10th followed by an abstract due november 24th okay so by november 24th you should have a good back bone of your term paper and you will have given your student seminar um on that day at the very least and then you'll be in a very good shape therefore to write your term paper which is due uh december 7th okay so it's a it's a process that i think works pretty well i've reserved december 1st um actually hold on a second yeah december 1st is a tuesday so i've left that open there is a class scheduled that day but i've left it open in case there's any missed seminars or any you know any questions that we need answered um you know perhaps there's there is an issue with an internet for one of you you know so we have that day they're reserved just as um for contingency purposes and later when i ask for the topics i'll ask you to kind of pick um a seminar slot okay so more on that next week so i'll talk about that exactly one week from now so right now don't panic and it's just sort of an fyi okay so that's all online i'll fix those typos does anyone have any questions or any comments about that about that syllabus and if you're if you're more comfortable or if it's easier you can always put in the chat and i i'm sure i'll see it at some point okay all right good stuff all right so what i'll do is i will yeah so you okay so you've all been hopefully got the powerpoint presentation that i've put on a file that i posted and what i'll do is i go through that and i'll you know so i encourage you to take notes so you can print it off if you have a printer or you can write on your computer or right within the powerpoint i do a lot of you'll see later there i do a lot of calculations and drawings so it's helpful if you do write it out as you go i will uh you know i do record these as i mentioned and i will post notes too so if there's something that's missed uh you should have access to those notes um and one other thing is it's a three hour class so it's kind of long right so and it covers goes over lunch so you know what we'll typically do is i'll i'll give a presentation lecture and then we'll take uh you know a 15 20 minute break and then we'll come back so and i can't talk for three hours straight either and you really don't want me to do that either okay so i'm going to switch my share screen and this is a little new to me too so i'll be trying to i might be looking for some feedback in terms of whether this is clear or not and i think in zoom you can also toggle things so you should be able to you know just have the screen there without sort of me and the mix there to make it full screen all right so this is let me just adjust my document camera here so typically i like to write uh on the tablet screen but then i i find that's going to be a little challenging doing that with uh using the screen when i'm teaching and that would just i think get a little annoying so so i got this document camera i've used it just a little bit but it's really neat it's really good because i think you guys can see that full screen pretty clearly it's paper and i can write pen on it so for me it's actually i think will be a better experience instead of writing on the screen and then afterwards what i can do is i can just scan these and send them to you and you should have those as well all right so this will be um like an introductory type lecture and right so we're all coming from different right backgrounds forensic science some chemistry some in biology let me just adjust this all right so the objectives of this course is uh to provide a chemical basis for understanding our surroundings environment which involve which involve many different things okay emphasis will be placed on the natural environment and the processes that take place in it the changes that occur as a result of human activities and then we'll have presentation discussion the solutions involving topics of environmental concern so this is what you know the student seminars will be involving so that's the you know the objectives of this class okay so what exactly is environmental chemistry um so really what it is it's the scientific study of the chemical biochemical phenomena that occur in natural places so we'll be looking at you know the sources of compounds sources of reactions where these different chemicals come from we're looking at uh reactions what type of reactions can occur environmentally naturally and if we have pollutants in there we look at the transport of chemicals where they can go within the environment do they stay in the water do they stay up in the atmosphere [Music] so there are many different things the effects that these have on the environment and then later on the fates that these compounds have on the environment okay so we look at the chemical species into the air water and or the soil environments and the effect that human activity has on these processes so this is a very you know broad but very important topic especially today um you know climate change is not you know it's not on the headlines as much anymore that's because of covent of course but as you all know that's it's still a very pressing issue one that uh surrounds us every day in fact you know i've seen some studies or read some news par articles saying that you know you know the coven 19 pandemic has actually slowed us down a little bit in terms of you know our usage of fossil fuels and so on and so forth so the environment actually has been a lot cleaner especially in places that have high population rates and countries like china and india for example okay okay so environmental chemistry actually really is the effects are really is overlapping disciplines so the study of chemical and biochemical phenomena natural systems as i mentioned before and as you can see here environmental chemistry is not a standalone discipline it really interacts with many other disciplines for example environmental toxicology which studies the toxicological effects and mechanism of actions on chemicals and limiting systems so things like cyanide which is very toxic on humans or fish and then on the other end there's things like green chemistry which really seeks to develop alternative methods and technologies to eliminate pollution so for example using catalytic reagents using clean solvents uh reducing you know the amount of toxic chemical waste right that's green chemistry that's a rapidly growing field as well and so environmental chemistry really overlaps a lot of these different disciplines like green chemistry environmental toxicology atmospheric chemistry would also overlap too right with this so i'm just giving you two examples in this venn diagram but um what i just really what i'm trying to show atmospheric chemistry is that environmental chemistry really is a collection of many different disciplines converging together and it's not a stand-alone discipline all right so let's let's uh answer some questions all right some important questions in environmental chemistry the scientific study of the chemical and biochemical phenomena that occur in natural places okay so here are a few questions that uh environmental chemist asks or we need to know before we start so how does the uncontaminated environment function right so we might have a river or an atmosphere that has you know certain effects or certain problems but we before we start understanding what's happening we first need to look at sort of level level zero and see how the uncontaminated environment functions and the uncontaminated environment goes through cycles and there are you know areas of sort of healing and you know minor destruction it's not you know it's not all just you know rainbows and clouds right um one one example of uncontaminated environment might be something like forest fires so there's a lot more forest fires now every summer in the news you hear about forest fires especially in california which they're going through problems right now but forest fires are actually natural and for you know hundreds and thousands of years it was a way to naturally restore the soil and to rejuvenate new plants and some seeds actually like the jackpine seed actually is in such a hard shell that it only gets released at high temperatures during forest fire so some trees cannot propagate unless there's a forest fire so um so that's an example of something that might seem destructive but is actually what nature uses once in a while to restore and clean so when we hear about all these forest fires now um we have to keep that in mind um number two some important questions what's what chemicals it's related to number one as well what chemicals are naturally not naturally present okay so that's that's really important to know what's what's around before any contaminants are put in there um other important questions is what chemicals are naturally present but in what concentrations are these chemicals present it's really important sometimes we get a little caught up in something in the environment but perhaps the concentration is just negligible right or sometimes it's way too much so it's one thing to say there's something in the environment it's the other one to say well what is the concentration that's really important uh what is the function of these chemicals and these are all related of course uh another important question that we ask ourselves a lot are how does these chemicals perturb the equilibrium of the environmental process so everything is in equilibrium nothing's really sort of black and white so how do these chemicals perturb the equilibrium of a healthy environmental process um and then another question i had was are these compounds or are these things toxic now these are not the only important questions that environmental chemists have um certainly there could be many others as well right these are just some of them does anyone have any question that they think is important with respect to environmental chemistry that maybe is not amongst my six questions but they would like to add and there's really hundreds like hundreds of important questions i've just sort of selected my top six well maybe later you'll think of a question so i would encourage you to on your own just think of what's what's what's important with environmental chem okay all right so let's look at some important definitions anthropogenic effects uh what does anthropogenic mean that means the that's really the effect that humans have that we have on a natural process okay so that there's a direct effect on us okay so anthropogenic effects is the study of environmental chemistry that examines the effect of human anthropogenic activities on natural processes okay and then we have two definitions here we i have a contaminant and i have pollutants so can someone tell me what the difference between a contaminant and a pollutant is or can someone maybe guess would a contaminant be something that doesn't naturally belong in the environment but is non-toxic whereas a pollutant is not natural in the environment but is toxic correct so yeah so so contaminant is something that shouldn't be there but is there because of human activity it's not it doesn't mean it's necessarily toxic or not okay and as you've correctly alluded to a pollutant is something that is is there um but because of human activity but causes harm or instability to the environment so it's actually detrimental yeah and it's going to take me actually some time to learn names and people especially when i can't see you so maybe i'll get to know your voices hopefully but uh who was speaking there just so i can learn i was sam sam okay thanks sam um okay so substance presentation due to activity and that pollutant is a contaminant i'll say it causes harm disorder or and or instability so ideally we would rather have something that is neither of these two definitions okay so let's go through sort of a an example or like a case study example and this kind of talks a little bit about those six important questions i talked about so the element thalium all right so thalium is an element found in crooksite hutchinson nights and lorandite it's evenly distributed in the earth's crust 0.7 milligrams per kilogram and in water at 10 nanograms per liter it's a heavy group 13 element its most common oxidation state is thallium one and thus it has very similar properties to things like sodium and potassium so if you think of you know group 13 you have like sodium you know lithium sodium potassium right those are all important um so why is um so thallium is okay so mining people can get it and it can be toxic um why do you think thallium might be a little bit toxic um if it's similar to things like sodium and potassium and i want you to think about you know maybe some of the biological pathways or some of the things that our cell uses to give you a hint of sodium and potassium uh these you've heard of you know things like sodium potassium pump that's just one example but a lot of enzymes use sodium and potassium and or potassium so what happens is that the thallium replaces potassium especially and what it will do is it will go inside that enzyme and it will actually inhibit the activity of those enzyme and receptors so it poisons it so it actually can be fairly toxic and because potassium is ubiquitous it's such an important element for a body you can get sort of broad poisoning of several different enzymes and receptors water samples from a coal mining operation in nova scotia have thalian levels of 20 micrograms per liter okay so samples from a nearby abandoned gold mine have thalium levels of 3.5 milligrams per kilogram okay so so thalium is toxic um but the real question that i'm just want to bring to your attention is that whenever someone's detecting thallium and you can detect thallium at very very trace levels even around here but what you need to do though is you need to measure the concentration okay that's the most important part because you can find thallium and radon and all these other things you know if you just dig in pelanci commons okay so the first thing environmental con chemists and case studies will do is they need to really understand the concentration so measuring concentration is usually only the beginning of an environmental study okay um the other important thing is what is known as the distribution of species okay so you can have compounds that can exist in different forms and i'll give you an example we have carbon dioxide right which can dissolve actually in water to give something called carbonic acid okay so carbonic acid will survive will be around if you dissolve co2 into water and you have sufficiently low ph okay however if the environment changes meaning that the ph changes and we go from a more acidic to a more basic environment we no longer will have carbonic acid what we're going to do is we're going to start taking carbonic acid and we're going to start deprotonating it to give you carbonate which is not carbonic acid it's a negatively charged anion if you keep increasing the ph you will now have bicarbonate and this is now negative two minus anion okay so these these these three species are connected and the relationship between them is that they're connected via ph through this equation here which you have seen before which is known as the henderson-hasselbach equation so relates ph and pka with the log of the concentration of base over acid so the point i'm making here is that many species can occupy more than one form so carbon dioxide that is immersed in water or a lake can exist actually in three different species so it's important to understand that and understand the relationship and what environmental um you know in this case ph has on that okay any questions so far okay so this relates to carbon dioxide um another one uh looks at mercury distribution and so mercury for example can exist in oxidation state of zero which is mercury zero it's the liquid mercury and you probably never have used these before but mercury thermometers were very common actually when i was uh studying chemistry but those have been all phased out for mercury zero and you can have mercury plus one or mercury plus two okay so um different mercury mercury in these different states have different toxicity an important chemical species found in fish is methylated mercury methylmercury which is very toxic to fish and other animals including us that consume the fish so it can go right up the food chain and i'll show you how mercury actually can get converted to these toxic forms so it's important to be aware of not only how much mercury is present but the distribution form of the element all right so as i mentioned before mercury zero um used to be found in thermometers and i'm sure there's still lots of thermometers out there that have mercury mercury electrodes are certainly around definitely fluorescent lights um burning of coal mercuric sulfide these are just some industrial sources of mercury and so what will happen is that you know you'll get incinerators you'll get fossil fuel burning and you'll get elemental mercury now in the atmosphere so this is hg0 such as elemental mercury and hg0 is actually not super toxic i mean it's not great okay but if you you know if you got a little bit on your hand you know definitely you need to clean that off but uh the real culprit as i mentioned is the charged form of mercury so how does mercury in a oxidation state zero actually get transformed to a plus one or plus two oxidation state so the problem is if you burn fossil fuels or dirty coal which can have mercury and you have waste incinerators and if you have things like old batteries or thermometers this will all enter the atmosphere as elemental mercury vapor and then what happens is that because you're up in the atmosphere you can get something called photochemical oxidation which will take mercury and oxidize that to mercury two plus the problem now is that the mercury two plus is now charged this will now solubilize uh whenever it precipitates and this will now come down into the river stream or the waterways and what happens is that your mercury two plus here will now get converted to organic mercury and this will be something like h3 ch3 hg plus so if you're taking mercury two plus and there are bacteria that will actually try to convert that to methylmercury and the problem is once that happens is that this methyl group here is actually fairly hydrophobic and what happens is that this can easily get deposited into the fatty layers of fish and fish we eat fish so do many other mammals and other things and then this can cause a source of you know mature poisoning if there's too much in there so that's an example of the mercury life cycle i do want to tell you just how toxic mercury is there was a professor at dartmouth college in new hampshire called professor karen wetterhan and she was an expert in studying something called mercury dna interactions so she was really trying to unravel how mercury would actually interact with dna and cause you know toxicity and how it would interact with the double stranded helix and she was using something called nmr or mercury nmr to actually study those interactions so very complex system nmr is really uh it stands for nuclear magnetic resonance uh nuclear magnetic it's really a great way or the best way nuclear magnetic resonance the best way to understand the structure of organic compounds or biomolecules okay um so what happens was that in doing these nmr experiments she had to add something called a standard and she added something called dimethylmercury as shown here you know and this is sort of like tuning uh like doing some fine-tuning measurement so this was her standard so she would first take a measurement of dimethylmercury and then she could look at her mercury dna interaction um so during this experiment she actually had gloves on and she knew it was very toxic of course but she got a drop of the the mercury on her glove and because it was fairly hydrophobic she wasn't using the right claws either it just immediately penetrated and went into her skin so she immediately she absorbed it so she did the you know so she immediately she took off her glove and then rinsed it with soap and water for a long time and then uh you know she kind of just went about her day into the experiments it wasn't until a few weeks later that she started noticing um some symptoms such as stuttering and slurred speech and confusion and so she went to the doctor and they did some blood tests and her mercury concentration her blood was extremely extremely high so they did some aggressive chelation therapy which really is something to try to to circle the mercury ion ion and or the cation and get it out of the system so they try some aggressive chelation therapy however she just got worse and eventually she was unable to talk and she eventually passed away i think about two months or so after that incident so mercury is incredibly toxic and it was a very very unfortunate incident but the reason mercury's so toxic is that it's a soft cation and it interacts widely with um proteins in our body that have sulfurs okay so cysteine is an amino acid that's sulfur based you've heard of disulfide bridges probably in biochemistry so mercury would affect the function of structure of proteins it would also interact and poison the activity of several of these proteins so essentially it was sort of a slow poison where these mercury would just bind so tightly and irreversibly and it wouldn't let go and the body just couldn't find a way of letting go of that so that's just how toxic mercury is so definitely if you are working with mercury do do take care but it is still present in our environment as you can see here and we have to be aware of it distribution diagram for mercury chlorides and water so this is uh showing that if you can have mercury in water and it can complex it gets complicated in water systems because it can complex with cl chlorine some well water for example where you have actually fairly low levels of cl minus chloride anion if the concentration is low you're going to get literally about 100 uh hgcl2 okay so mercury dichloride however well water and lake water fresh water is very different from ocean water in which you have a high concentration of chloride anion sodium chloride salt water so based on this phase diagram that is dependent on the concentration of chloride anion that can dictate the type of mercuric chloride species that you have so in ocean water you can actually have you know three different species sixteen percent hccl2 56 hccl3 28 hcl4 so again take home message again is saying well what kind of form what type of mercury do we have what type of compound do we have and what in what form does it exist right so so we need to understand not only things like ph and concentration but the phase diagram in this case um and distribution within the species and these compounds here will all have different properties as well okay okay any questions so far on the mercury discussion uh okay so the last couple slides before we break uh residence time okay so we've looked at like the the the chemical species what form is it in we've got that concentration so another important consideration is residence time so the environment is a dynamic system assuming the cycle's balanced the concentrations remain constant what this means is that there must be sort of a steady state amount that is the amount going in and going out which corresponds to an overall concentration so the resonance time is equal to concentration and a steady state amount over the average time steady state amount and the resonance time is the amount of time a substance remains in a particular environmental compartment so the t average here will be equal to the concentration over the residence time okay so we just went over that steady state amount over the flux we can call the flux that's either in or out so you can have a compound net amount of compound either going out or coming in so here's a hypothetical example if an average steady state resonance time of a trace atmospheric gas is 50 years and its input rate is 2.0 times 10 to the 6 kilograms pure what is the total amount of it in the atmosphere so you can apply that formula where you have the resonance time equal to the steady state over the t average you know that the average steady take steady state resident residence time is 50 years we're trying to figure out the total amount of it in the atmosphere but we know that's input rate the flux in is 2.0 times 10 to the six kilograms per year okay so therefore you solve for the concentration the steady state amount and if you punch that into your calculator that's going to be a hundred million kilograms of whatever that trace atmospheric gases okay um yeah so this is sort of uh yeah so this is really just getting you thinking of environmental chemistry the different definitions and what's important in terms of species the the type of chemical the state it's in flux in and out so there's many different variables okay so for part one again just coming back to this venn diagram showing again that environmental chemistry is really the union of many different many different disciplines now what we'll do is we'll take a break i'm just going to stop share and yeah okay so when i'm teaching i cannot see the chat but you know basically what i'll do is if there's a question um that you want to just chat in then after then you know i can see it but no one it looks like that was crystal clear so let's uh yeah so let's take a break it's 12 15 right now um what i'll be talking about after break is the earth's atmosphere so why don't we start let's take 20 minutes so so 12 35 let's continue and do part two okay see you in see you in 20 minutes okay welcome back everyone hope everyone had a good lunch i'm just gonna go back to my share screen option and uh i'm assuming you guys can hear me okay so the first yeah the first unit that we're going to talk about is the atmosphere okay atmosphere and here you can see a young girl putting sunscreen on her face as you know the sun's the sun has uv rays which could be toxic so but let's learn a little more about some of the components of of the atmosphere okay so the four main four main regions of the atmosphere um [Music] this is this is our planet earth and as we kind of go up into the atmosphere we have the troposphere stratosphere mesosphere thermosphere so let's discuss each one the troposphere contains the largest percentage of molecules in the atmosphere and this is where you know where we live and where we breathe and it's the most densely populated it's the largest percentage of molecules in the atmosphere and this is roughly from ground zero sea level to around 15 kilometers the next region of the atmosphere is known as the stratosphere and this area contains the ozone layer which as we know protects us from the harmful uv rays and this goes from about 15 kilometers to around 50 kilometers next up is something called the mesosphere this is where you can sometimes see in august these meteorites coming in from the atmosphere and igniting so those are around 50 60 kilometers away so between 50 and 85 kilometers and then really from around 85 kilometers to about 600 or so is what is known as the thermosphere and this is um you know where we have things like space shuttles satellites the like the international space station we can also see northern lights at um at this altitude and those usually occur around 100 kilometers northern lights also known as aurora you can see them sometimes if you go way up north on a hot summer evening and what you see are these dancing lights in the sky that are actually caused by ions in the thermosphere and we'll talk a little bit about that later in today's class and then furthermore some people even call beyond 600 kilometers the exosphere and this is known as a space vacuum all right so those are the main areas as you know pressure will vary greatly depending on where you are in the atmosphere so at ground zero we have standard uh pressure and this is around 101.3 kilopascals okay and we can measure the atmospheric pressure and height from earth as pressure subscript h and that's equal to the pressure superscript zero which is the pressure at sea level times this constant e to the power of minus m which is the average molecular mass of the atmosphere g would be your acceleration due to gravity and height would be where you are so you know the height and this will be in meters and then here are some fun chemical equations that you've learned in first year so r is the ideal gas constant this is 8.314 joules per kelvin per mole and t is your temperature in kelvin okay and this p here is the pressure at sea level so it's sort of a back of the envelope type of calculation where you can get the pressure at a particular height and not surprising as you go up your pressure decreases um so in your thermosphere for example your pressure is actually quite light it's about 0.025 kilopascals right so compare that to around 100 kilopascals that's a significant change in pressure by definition the atmospheric pressure is the measure of force of gravity on the surface of the earth any questions okay so far so good okay so here are the constituents of the dry tropospheric atmosphere and i'm sure you're familiar with most of these so troposphere is like where we live of course so the biggest one of course is nitrogen which actually comprises up to almost eighty percent of what we breathe nitrogen looks like this oxygen which is what our body uses looks like this around one percent is actually inert gas called argon and then finally about 0.05 percent is carbon dioxide so together these these molecules comprise around 99 of the molecule in a dry tropospheric atmosphere now we don't live in a dry tropospheric atmosphere we actually have moisture we have water in the environment so the water levels depending on where you live depending on the season those can range considerably those can range from around half a percent to around 3.5 so something that would be very humid you know maybe something like the rain forest and then you have a number of different uh gases and trace amounts okay so like neon helium methane krypton hydrogen and there's there's definitely some other ones like xenon so where are these chemical constituents located all right well it's not surprisingly that you know we have n2 o2 okay in the troposphere so where we live we have co2 argon and water okay in the stratosphere we also have n2 o2 but as i mentioned before this is our ozone layer so ozone is actually an allotrope of oxygen which you have three atoms of oxygen attached to each other the mesosphere actually doesn't contain ozone so we're back to n2 and o2 and the thermosphere also contains n2 and o2 as we'll see in a little bit we're going to expand the list of these um because as we get further away from earth we're actually going to induce some collisions based on energy from the sun in the troposphere also um you know on hot humid summer nights like we've had the summer for sure you can get actually ozone can actually be made by lightning so high energy impact oxygen ozone can be made and this actually makes it sometimes very difficult to breathe if it's a hot humid night and we don't really have to deal with this so much here anymore in ontario but in other countries that have a lot of poor combustion vehicles this is definitely an issue so um so some countries like india and china they actually still use a lot of these two cycle motors and these can emit pollutants which actually can contribute to ozone and ozone it's good when it's in the stratosphere not so good when we're breathing it in it's actually very harsh on our lungs it's a strong oxidizer and it can cause a lot of wheezing a lot of coughing and it's it's it's it's almost like you know like breathing in acid like it's it's very harsh it doesn't it's not it's really not good for you let's look at the electromagnetic radiation so so here's um if we go from left to right we're going from short wavelength high energy rays so these are like gamma rays x-rays so you've heard of x-rays before then uv light this small little window here is our visible spectrum where we can see all these colors and then ir and then microwave okay so you probably use a microwave oven and then long radial ways like fma and radio waves and then even longer so these are much longer low energy shorter wavelength high energy so the relationship between wavelength and energy inversely proportional the sun emits this type of electromagnetic spectra between the uv colored and ir wavelength so that's around 1000 micrometers to around 100 nanometers and as i mentioned before there's an inversely there there's an inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency so wavelength is inversely proportional to 1 over v which is frequency and you've seen this equation before too c the speed of light is equal to wavelength time frequency so let's think about what happens in the atmosphere at in the thermosphere which is the biggest area away from the earth so that's between around 85 kilometers to 600 kilometers and as i mentioned to you before there's a lot of there's a lot of oxygen and nitrogen however because it's so far from the earth these are actually subject to high energy uv light whereas down here we are fairly protected from the ozone layer so let's take a look exactly what could happen to these molecules at that high altitude so we have dioxygen here and what we can do is this h mu here this uv light that's what that means if we have uv light that's around 240 nanometers so not super high energy but definitely there's there is there's going to be some impact uh you can actually get dissociation where you actually take this pi bond and you actually break it up so you take each of these bonds throw an electron onto each of those oxygens and you dissociate it so if i draw the lewis dot structures of each of these you can see that i'm going to have two molecules of oxygen and the energy required to do that or the delta h of formation is around 498 so about 500 kilojoules per mole the other molecule we have is nitrogen gas which is held together through a triple bond so as you can imagine this is going to require more energy so it's going to require lower wavelength uv light in order to completely dissociate it so the amount of light or the wavelength that's needed is 126 nanometers or less because you have to break three bonds and what that will do is give you these elemental nitrogens that look like this and the heat of formation for this is going to be of course higher because there are three bonds necessary to break that instead of two all right so in the thermosphere you can see already that you'll have oxygen but it can easily break up in addition you think you might be done but if you take the molecular oxygen that you generated from sequence one and you are now at uv light that is actually even lower in energy so now we're looking at less than 191 nanometers what you can actually do is you can actually take that oxygen and strip it off an electron okay it takes a lot of energy to have an oxygen with a plus charge like this plus you'll have an electron here so this e with a little dash here corresponds to a free electron not very favorable you're going to need a lot of energy for that you need around 1300 kilojoules per mole for that same with the the nitrogen so you could take n dot or you could even take n2 by itself i'll just show n2 and if you do that you're going to generate n2 and just strip it of an electron now you have a free electron again around the same amount of energy so these are very high energy events so what you can do is you can generate now these positively charged molecules in this circuit of electrons definitely not something that we have around here in the troposphere so if you look more closely at the chemical constituents of the atmosphere we can actually we can actually modify it and we can actually increase sort of what is around in the thermosphere so as i mentioned you have n2o2 uh you can have n2 plus like i just talked about you can have you can even do this with o2 strip it of an electron you can take nitrogen remove an electron this whole process here is just called ionization you can have just single nitrogen that's neutral single oxygen you can also have n o nitric oxide and how does that form well high collision molecules that you've generated these can come together to generate nitric oxide so you can generate nitric oxide plus also the ionized form of that molecule so the point is on the thermostat you can see you have probably a low proportion of these molecules actually and then a higher proportion of these ionize and atomic forms and the mesosphere everything remains around the same so the thermosphere in some ways kind of con protects the mesosphere stratosphere as i imagine has the ozone and this is what we have here the troposphere at sea level a large proportion you know so these are not the only gases okay we talked about ozone already being artificially present you can actually get an o in the troposphere too can anyone think of where nitric oxide in the troposphere could originate from don't be shy i think of high-energy high-energy events that could happen naturally or unnaturally hello is anyone there is we're talking to a computer screen i just want to make sure i'm still connected yes all right i am all right yeah so high energy events what could happen in the troposphere how could you generate nitric oxide well an explosion or a large storm lightning again yeah very good yeah so lightning again could definitely do that uh forest fires natural forest fires or well they're all or you know forest fires that were not put they're in the right place aircrafts airplanes they burn a lot of um fuel but they also can generate nitric oxide um so this can definitely be coming from anthropogenic sources and also naturally combustion so even like dirty um like now cars are actually pretty clean but like dirty combustion engines from you know the 90s or the 80s like those didn't have good catalytic converters so they would burn the fuel but they would also take nitrogen and oxygen and because it was such high temperature you would also generate nitric oxide we'll learn more about nitric oxide in a different unit uh ions in the uh upper atmosphere so um in high altitude as i we mentioned antonio 2 are subject to higher energy uv light so northern lights are you know these like dancing green colored um you know aurora that you can see certain times of the year at certain latitudes and what they are they're actually produced by collision of charged particles with atoms so these high energy atoms and ions that we've seen generated under certain circumstances if there's a high concentration of them the collision will cause these colors so i um i was fortunate when i was actually in high school i went up north near wawa ontario if you're ever wondering where that is it's it's pretty high up i've only been there once but i was actually able to see northern lights um like one evening at like 2 a.m and that's the only time i've seen it so if you're ever in wawa or way up north or like yukon or alaska those are some good spots radio broadcasting so northern lights okay that's a little extreme those aren't seen all the time but actually we use the ions when we radio broadcast okay so if you have your you know your radio tower here and this could be you know attached to your car or your home and then there's like a radio tower that's emitting the signal that's 100 kilometers away or 200 even what it does is it emits a low energy signal and then the the ions and the generator in the troposphere actually come and then they bounce back okay so they allow for that uh radio tower to pick up the signal so ions are definitely responsible for that for their for the energy this is also called the ionosphere so troposphere is sometimes called the ionosphere because this area contains high concentration of ions okay um so let's look at sort of a basic calculation for now and then we're going to look at some mechanisms of photochemical reactions so calculating the energy of light so uh calculate the energy of a hundred nanomolar light in kilojoules per mole for one photon so you remember this formula e equals two h over v frequency which is equals to h times speed of light over wavelength because recall the speed of light is equal to wavelength times like the velocity therefore velocity is equal to speed of light over wavelength so if you kind of put this in you have h which is planck's constant 6.63 times 10 to the minus 34 joule second times speed of light as you've learned before is 3.0 times 10 to the eighth meters per second and the wavelength is 100 nanometers so we convert that to meters that's 100 times 10 to the minus 9 meters that equals to 2.0 times 10 to the minus 17 joules that's the amount of energy for 100 nanometer light so if you actually change this number to a lower wavelength or higher that will impact the the amount of energy so lower wavelength will have higher energy calculate the energy of 100 nanometer light for one mole of photons so one mole of photons is going to be equal to average number all right so good little refresher which is 6.02 times 10 to the 23 per mole and that equals to around a 1200 kilojoules per mole okay so it kind of makes sense if you think back to some of those bond association energies that we're looking at previously let's go back a couple slides you can see here that wavelength of less than 190 80 roughly 1300 kilojoules per mole 126 close to a thousand 240 around 500 so that makes sense so 100 nanomoles around 1200 kilojoules per mole so pretty high energy yeah you definitely don't want that touching you all right so let's look at some photochemical reactions okay all right so we've talked about ionization and some other things that can happen and way up in the thermosphere now other things that can happen is that i'm just going to draw and give you a very sort of quick a very sort of quick illustration of how we can get molecules from a ground state into something called an excited state okay so you go you know that electrons like to be paired okay so there's two electrons that are paired this is ground state and this is energy okay so what we have here and there's definitely other electrons underneath it so we're focusing on energy the ground state what you have here is the highest occupied molecular orbital i'll also breathe it as homo highest and then higher in energy there's an empty orbital here okay so we call this the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital or lumo so normally everything's fine and dandy and really happy now during an event where you have wavelength like uv light coming in you can actually take your ground state to an excited state so your molecule is still the same it's just what we call an excited state what we've done is we've actually taken one of these electrons from the ground state and for a brief period of time we've moved it up to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital okay the way you can think about this is if you you know if you have a puppy or maybe a younger brother or sister or you know you're familiar with toddlers you have your toddler or your puppy in a ground state but if you give that you know if you give too much treats or sugar or something right it's still the same dog or the same person but you're going to now get that toddler into an excited state and they might just start running and jumping around everywhere and from there different things can happen right if they're in a small space maybe they'll destroy your living room who knows right but that's the analogy i just want to bring up so once x y star is an excise state a number of different processes can occur okay so one is that well eventually we all know that electrons they like to be paired so this is gonna come back down okay but during the process when the electron comes back down what is going to happen so one is that when the electron comes back down x y is going to happen but you can generate heat something called kinetic energy so maybe your puppy will jump around the room the other thing that can happen is that you can get electron coming back down but you can actually get emission of of uv light or a photon and we call this fluorescence so some molecules if they have conjugated double bonds they can actually accept that that they can accept that excited state for a little longer and when it comes back down they can uh those molecules can actually fluoresce the other thing that can happen is that you can get ionization right and we just talked about that we've seen that with nitrogen and oxygen if you have enough energy you can get decomposition fragmentation so x plus y and furthermore if you have an excited state and you have another molecule around like uh you know maybe another puppy or a cat who knows right you can transfer that energy to that molecule make that molecule an excited state okay so we call this inter molecular transfer okay and i just want to indicate and remind you that most excited states are not long lived often just a fraction of a second but that's enough but that is enough time to go through these processes what we're going to be talking a lot about with respect to decomposition fragmentation is the type of bond cleavage that will happen and the one that happens most frequently is free radical formation so that is taking for example a molecule like no2 uv light comes in and then we get something called homolytic bond cleavage okay so what is homolytic bond cleavage well we've seen that already with o2 and n2 you're taking uv light and you're generating two different radicals so radical is a molecule that has an unpaired electron x dot plus y dot so we call those dots so that's homo lytic bond cleavage now how does that differ from heterolytic bond cleavage heterolytic bond cleavage would have cleavage of that bond but it would be it would not be right down the middle of that bond you would put two electrons on one atom and then the other atom would be positive okay so we call this heterolytic bond cleavage where you might get x minus and then x and then y plus so the net effect is you still break that bond but the mechanism by which it's done is different so many reactions in the atmosphere are initiated by free radicals free radicals are an atom or molecule with one or on one or more unpaired electrons and i didn't actually call these radicals back when we're looking at thermosphere reactivity so just going back a few slides if you look at these lewis dot structures you can see that each of these bonds will break and then here you have free electron free electron over here free electron free electron so each of these oxygen has two free electrons these nitrogens you break three bonds you have one two three free electrons on the nitrogen so these are all free radicals free radicals are actually the most common type of chemistry that happens in the upper atmosphere now i understand everyone's coming from different educational backgrounds here and so i just want to make sure we get everyone on the same page in terms of how we're going to show electron movement through the use of arrows and how we can show that using or how we can show that using arrows for heterolytic bond cleavage but also homolytic bond cleavage so how to denote electromagnetic use of error so you've probably seen or hope you've seen a double-headed arrow indicates a movement of two pairs of electrons so here's an arrow right and there's sort of two heads on it right we call this a double-headed arrow so this is equal to two electrons moving whereas official carroll kind of looks like a fishhook like that okay so single-headed arrow this has one this corresponds to one electron so if we're showing the movement of a pair of electrons pair remaining two then in this acid-base chemistry you have o-h minus coming here attacking this proton so it's two electrons coming and that's gonna generate water okay but that's how you would show this from a mechanistic point of view on the other hand if you have two hydroxy radicals coming together to form like hydrogen peroxide the way that we draw these is that we're going to have two electrons coming together and converging so we have to draw two official arrows coming together like that where where they come in the middle represents the new bond that's being made so it's really important that we understand that you understand how to draw the movement of single electrons using radicals we'll go through a few examples here in a second but i'm very happy to spend more time discussing this so make sure that if this isn't unfamiliar to you that you speak up and i can definitely talk more about it okay so four radicals so free radicals can do four main things they can do something like this abstract a hydrogen atom so you can take for example something like methane gas and here's a radical o h radical so it's always radical can actually abstract one of these hydrogen atoms to generate methyl radical plus water so i want you to show me how to do that mechanistically how would you show that using those official arrows that i just went through so why don't you think about that for 20 seconds and then i'll show you what i got okay so it's been it's been about 20 seconds i think so we have this o h dot and it needs to abstract a hydrogen atom so remember one electron can go at a time so there's one we're going to break this carbon hydrogen bond so one of the electrons from this bond will come and form a carbon oxygen bond here okay now however you have to remember once one electron goes here where does the other electron go a bond is made up of two electrons so you need to show official carol from that bond and putting the radical onto the carbon how do we know that because in our products we can see here that we have a ch3 radical ch3 dot and that's h2o okay any questions on that okay um next one fragment so we can go from this molecule here you can see you have an oxygen with a radical and there's going to be some kind of fragmentation to generate this molecule here which is actually acetone don't worry the name's not important and then cl radical so how does that happen so with our acetone you can see we need to form a pi bond so an additional bond so where are we going to where are we going to how we're going to make that bond so the radical here is going to share one electron right to form the carbon oxygen bond that's only one so it needs to grab another one it's going to grab it from this carbon cl bond like that and then we're going to throw the last electron onto that cl dot okay so radicals can do four things we've seen two they can also add to a multiple bond so like a double bond or a triple bond so uh try number three and i'll come i'll come back in uh 20 seconds just seeing if there's any questions add to a multiple bonds um okay any ideas does anyone want to verbally take a stab at that or if not i'll go through it so the pi bond here will bring one electron and then the o-h radical will come together that forms the carbon oxygen bond and then a radical will form on this carbon here to generate that species okay so you can see there's i mean there's a pattern here with with these and the last thing that radicals can do is they can recombine also known as coupling so the two radicals can come together to form a sigma bond so here we have a methyl radical and an always radical so these two come together to form in this case methanol okay so um yeah is there anything that you want to see re-explain on that everyone's okay with radicals and as i mentioned you know speak up right if there's a question um because it's it's it is hard well it's actually impossible for me to to to see your faces to read them so in a classroom i could see and if people are a little confused i could explain it but just in general i think i just don't i'm not just talking about radicals but i just mean in general for not just this course but your other courses you have to help the instructor because we can't read your mind so if there's something that's not clear you have to you have to speak up okay so one of the things that needs to be done with online learning all right any last questions all right i guess it's crystal clear so the hydroxyl radical is a species that's appears repeatedly in the atmospheric chemistry is formed in the troposphere in a four-step process so we have no2 that can form and this can form from high collision molecules like n o and o dot okay but we can also break that again to generate o radical plus no radical so step one is a photochemical reaction now oxygen radical plus o2 in the presence of m which can be another molecule or a surface it just needs something to kind of latch onto can generate o3 which is ozone okay so we can generate ozone and ozone can then in the presence of uv light and this is around 320 nanometers or less can generate o2 plus oda so you can go back but these are now in excited states so number two so this reaction up here is ozone formation and then number three this one here is another photochemical reaction and then finally what can happen is that you can have the six state this excited oxygen radical which is high energy and in the presence of water which is in the troposphere you can now generate two hydroxy radicals so hydroxy radicals and radicals are actually naturally present and they're formed through this natural pathway to generate in terms of how it's generated the formation of ozone as we just talked about is also formed in the atmosphere many reactions in the atmosphere are initiated by free radicals i've already mentioned that free radicals have one or one pair of electrons free radicals are commonly formed by photochemical reactions okay we all know that so o2 in the presence of light can dissociate we've seen that and then these two can come together to form o3 so that's how ozone is actually formed and depending on where it is in the atmosphere that can be a very good thing in the stratosphere so that's between 15 kilometers and 50 kilometers that protects us from uv light now there is a cycle steady state equilibrium of ozone and we talked about steady state concentration and dynamics in the first part so we don't just want to keep making ozone and it just keeps building up forever and ever and ever right even too much of a good thing would be bad so there's a natural steady state of ozone so o2 so i'll just draw what happens when we take o2 i'm just drawing it a little different way but it's the same reactions as up here oxygen present uv light generates o radical in the presence of dioxygen in the presence of a surface generates ozone so that's the same thing i've just drawn it in a little different way now o3 in the presence of an oxygen radical can go back to o2 so you have four atoms of oxygen together and then they will combine to give two molecules of oxygen all right so there's sort of this delicate balance and equilibrium back furthermore o3 ozone when it picks up uv light so when it protects us in the stratosphere um not only does it pick up that uv light but it also dissociates to o dot okay and then if there's another oxygen then ozone can be regenerated the last thing that can also happen is that two molecules of o dot two molecules of oxygen radical can come together to form diatomic oxygen so what you can see here is that in natural systems there is a steady state equilibrium of ozone where it's always maintained in a healthy way now you can see that if we add something to this to this equilibrium that could influence or change equilibrium one way or another then that could that could very much change and alter the steady state equilibrium of the ozone and definitely we'll talk about what compounds and chemicals do this um it's uh still a big issue today but it was a much bigger issue 15 20 years ago the ozone layer this steady-state equilibrium is also known as the chapman cycle okay so in the remaining uh couple slides i want us to think of the temperature of the atmosphere and specifically we're going to be looking at what is known as the kinetic temperature and we're going to look at the atmosphere at these different uh at these different stages so we have four different atmospheres okay so if we are here let's say ground level and then let's just draw like you know some some mountain here's a mountain this is a really large mountain let's call this mount everest mount everest actually goes up to around 20 21 or 22 kilometers i think so that's actually in the stratosphere but uh as you know the air is much thinner up there and people who do who are crazy enough to go up mount everest have to adapt and wear maybe even an oxygen mask but tell me about the temperature as you go from here up to something like mount everest does it get hotter or does it get colder that's an easy question who's gonna oh i see the chat three people colder yeah that's right it gets colder so as you go from earth and go up it gets colder right you know and then you know every you know when you're a kid you're like well wait a minute like you're getting closer to the sun so why isn't it warmer well it's so insignificant that change what's more important is that you're getting further away from the planet but you're actually getting into a thinner atmosphere so as you go from four up into the mountains here temperature decreases okay now as we go from this area and enter the stratosphere so the stratosphere has ozone our temperature actually starts to increase because we have ozone there and the absorption of the ozone actually increases the collision and we absorb that in terms of energy so as soon as we enter the stratosphere we actually start to get like an inversion of temperature and the point at which we go here we see the maximum ozone concentration right it makes sense it absorbs uv light and capture that energy and turn and generate kinetic energy out of that and as soon as you exit the stratosphere your ozone level is going to start to decrease right because the ozone is only in the stratosphere so as soon as you start approaching the mesosphere your ozone levels decrease and therefore you're going to start decreasing your temperature again okay so just to recap we've gone from number four to number three temperature of ground earth colder then actually gets warmer in the stratosphere because of the ozone as you leave the stratosphere hit the mesosphere it's going to get cooler and now once we go from the mesosphere to the thermosphere a couple different things could happen with temperature and again we're looking at kinetic temperature okay this is different from um like the celsius or the kelvin scale what do you think is going to happen as we go from the mesosphere to the thermosphere or is the temperature going to stay the same is it going to increase or is it going to well decrease what are your thoughts decrease more decrease more colder yeah but yeah makes sense right or if it would you know as soon as you exit that area you came further away we seem to get colder now we're measuring kinetic temperature and think of energy when uv light hits things like nitrogen oxygen high energy particles ions are being made you have a ionosphere where you get uh charged collisions happening so there's actually even though there's fewer molecules you get um because the pressure is lower you're actually getting more high energy collisions and as such your kinetic temperature actually increases as you go up into the thermosphere okay more ionization at higher altitudes eventually once you exit the thermosphere then you're going to have you know no kinetic temperature because you're not going to have any of these ions anymore okay but it is interesting so more more ionization at higher altitudes causes this increase in kinetic energy you're able to absorb more of that uv light if you're you know in this area here even compare down to this one so more ionization at higher altitudes causes an increase in kinetic energy right so you have more absorption of uv light by those molecules right and then as soon as you hit number two absorption of longer wavelength radiation leads to an increase in temperature when moving to lower altitudes because as you kind of spin around from number two and head towards number three our ozone concentration layer starts to increase and so you kind of get this like inflection point absorption of longer wavelength radiation leads to an increase in temperature when moving to lower altitude moving to lower altitude because in the stratosphere the ozone concentration is increasing okay so as you go down through the thermosphere fewer collisions happen right but then you get the switch around number two until you hit this uh kind of the sweet spot in the stratosphere which is the max concentration of ozone as soon as you start to move away from that maximum number three the energy range of ozone absorption starts to decrease as we approach the troposphere because there's fewer because there's less ozone so the temperature drops and finally when we hit the tr stratosphere when we start you know if we're at mount everest and come down to earth we know it gets warmer but what is does anyone know why it actually why it gets warmer right because if you think about it there's you know there really shouldn't be that much uh uv light left right there shouldn't be too much energy from the sun but what what causes that increase in temperature as we approach the planet carbon dioxide uh yes yes so yeah so so carbon dioxide what about carboxyl you're right carbon dioxide plays a big role in water too carbon dioxide you've heard of yeah greenhouse gases those they're called greenhouse gases because they absorb ir radiation and they essentially trap that energy in in our case in the troposphere right so the energy that comes down in low ir radiation from the sun actually gets trapped and can't escape and carbon dioxide and water really help make that happen yes and there's reflection of heat back yeah so essentially the you know if you think of radiation coming down it's going to kind of bounce off rocks and things it's going to hit like carbon dioxide molecules and water molecules and then bounce back to the earth so it literally just kind of traps in that heat so it can't escape so kind of acts as like a bouncing pad so yeah so uh yeah great answers so remaining radiation hits earth and it's not uv but it's re it's it's ir radiation it's re-emitted as energy infrared and this is absorbed primarily by things like water and co2 which are greenhouse gases so this causes an increase in kinetic energy and you've heard of course about climate change and carbon dioxide uh everyone knows that increase in carbon dioxide causes an increase in temperature of the planet right so too much of carbon dioxide shifts at equilibrium so now our temperature on our planet steadily is increasing over time and that's of course is a big concern uh today um but keep in mind too that carbon dioxide is naturally present and is actually necessary to keep to keep things warm on earth so without the carbon dioxide or water nothing would be around to absorb that iron radiation and kick it back the energy back so if it weren't for water and carbon dioxide then it would actually be very cold on the surface of the planet okay so those are just some fun facts these here's a question would the kinetic temperature be the highest at ground level or would it be higher when moving beyond the thermosphere yeah that that's a good question um so there's different kinds of kinetic energies so in terms of like molecules colliding and ionizing uh you would have fewer of those collisions but you would actually have probably higher kinetic energy because the energy is much stronger up in the thermosphere however ground zero the kinetic energy is really a combination of lower energy collisions but there's just much much more of its in terms of energy from like ir being absorbed by water and co2 so it's uh you know i mean it's a really good question ultimately this thermosphere will eventually dissipate and you'll have no kinetic energy so there comes a maximum point where the amount of kinetic energy in the thermosphere can't keep increasing because you're running out of gases okay so whereas at close whereas at the surface of the earth um you're going to get always increase amounts of kinetic energy because molecules are abundant in our rounds you're not depleting that if anything you're increasing that concentration so i would say at close to the planet you actually have more opportunities for kinetic temperatures to remain constant and to stay the same also keep in mind too the thermosphere here is dynamic and depending on the season depending on actually where on the planet earth it is uh that kinetic temperature can also change as well so a certain type certain times of the year um certain areas of the planet are not actually exposed to the sun and other times of the year you know like certain areas of the planet are continuously exposed to the sun so that and large can influence the kinetic temperature as well um so this is more of an average but yeah no that's a very good question um we call this temperature on planet earth we call this a temperature inversion or a zigzag effect so you can see here that it starts like this and then zigzags like that so it's called temperature inversion zig also known as the zigzag effect and it's really important to understand the main players here right carbon dioxide and having a big impact ozone really being the main player in terms of that inversion if you didn't have ozone you would actually expect to have something that would increase or decrease in temperature and then would increase in temperature with the thermostat you wouldn't get this inversion sort of in the middle here so you could think of different planets see not all planets have ozone so they're going to have different temperature profiles in their atmosphere depending on their constituents um so on and so forth venus has like 95 carbon dioxide so it's very hot there because of the greenhouse effect too but it's going to have a very different temperature inversion profile temperature profile okay any other questions about about this about the temperature of planet earth at different stages of the atmosphere yeah so let's see remaining radiation hits earth we emit it absorb by h2o and co2 and then i'll just make this clear that this causes an increase in kinetic energy even though temperatures rise in the thermosphere would you still feel cold out there so you actually would okay so the the the temperature on the thermometer would actually be cold um but what we're actually measuring is kinetic temperature but there's such high impact collisions up there that you would you know if you were hypothetically going up there and put on a oxygen mask or something so you could still breathe and uh you would actually you would get damaged from all those high energy collisions so even though you might feel cold it would be much worse than like a sunburn or something to that effect so it'd be you know it'd be a different it's a different kind of different kind of temperature kind of like these like yeah these iono radiations right so you wouldn't feel like that intense heat from the sun right but but you would feel like the ions and they could be quite damaging but yeah you would you would feel you'd probably shiver but you'd probably have other issues if you're all the way up there like 500 kilometers uh yeah great fun question so to summarize uh this lecture here what you've learned today there are four [Music] four main areas of the atmosphere you've learned about this temperature inversion on earth so we often call this the zig zag effect we've also gone over photochemistry so light from the sun is responsible for photochemistry and the main players ions and free radicals are responsible for upper atmosphere chemistry free radicals are responsible for ozone formation as well okay and if you have other points you want to add i always encourage uh you know these are my notes right but i encourage all my students to uh whatever they think is important as well okay uh so with that are there any questions before we before we break up if uv radiation oxygen and an oxygen radical are present within the thermosphere why is ozone not there okay um yeah that's a great question so in fact up in the thermosphere there's uh because we're closer to the sun any ozone that is made is instantly just going to be degraded because ozone does take uv light uv radiation from the sun but it's just so strong and intense up there okay so the uv up there from the sun actually can break apart like oxygen bonds and can break apart nitrogen triple bonds and ozone absorption from uv light is around 320 nanometers so there's definitely light of 320 nanometers it's just that once that o3 is made it's instantly destroyed so there's no steady state equilibrium of it whereas in the stratosphere you have all those molecules in the thermosphere that is shielding that really high energy uv light so the only uv light that gets in is lower energy of around 300 nanometers okay so that's that's why there's no steady state equilibrium of it up there does that answer your question great yeah it seems like this uh chat thing is actually really good too so these gases are constantly traded between difference yes so you know so you can think of you know think of the thermosphere you have nitrogen oxygen n2 o2 now but in reality you probably have very low quantities of n2 and o2 because they're all converted to radicals and ionized forms okay now when you say traded between the different phases it's it's a very deep spectra right so you go from zero kilometers to 600 kilometers so you know in terms of nitrogen going back and forth between them that's a much slower process because you have to reach a different different part and there's always the the constant pressure too from gravity pulling these gases down so it's a constant flux but i would say that ozone from the stratosphere once it's made in the stratosphere it actually never comes down into the troposphere where we live and breathe and ozone from the stratosphere also wouldn't go up into the mesosphere or the thermosphere it's going to stay within its own zones and have its own rule it's just not going to survive or be able to travel tens or dozens of kilometers between the different phases uh yeah good question what happens if the ozone is destroyed from the stratosphere with a temperature continuously decrease yeah so great question so without the ozone you would actually have um a decrease in temperature and maybe i'll just share my screen so this is your earth here and temperature and so remember inversion was because of the ozone you would actually get a continual decrease in temperature until you reach probably around the mesosphere and then hit the thermosphere and then you get temperature going back up so you wouldn't get this zigzag effect you'd still get an inversion okay but that's very different from something that looks like that so this is i'll call that with ozone and this would be without ozone because without ozone you still have these high energy collision events happening in the thermosphere yeah no problem i'll uh leave the floor open for another minute or two for more questions happy to spend time going over this or any other thing we talked about any questions about the syllabus or of course as i mentioned next next tuesday i'll talk about the seminar on term paper and i'll have topics so i'll talk about that do radicals cause certain humans radicals call certain human added gases to create more uh can you rephrase that what exactly do you mean by that binding are you wondering about like artificial radicals would those cause more harmful byproducts in the atmosphere is that is that sort of what you're asking just okay uh yes exactly so we're going to be learning about cfcs and things like the story of the ozone layer these are artificial human-made radicals and yes they actually will they will destroy parts of the atmosphere including the ozone layer by interrupting that equilibrium so what i've shown you today is like the natural equilibrium of what happens without any added radicals or chemicals so you can see that through human activity that can change in the atmospheric chemistry can change quite a bit no problem going off of my question on the thermosphere actually feeling cold would space technically not be cold uh so if you go into like open space like not you know open space would actually it would it would actually be very cold like it's um you'd be close to absolute zero okay and you let's assume you're not close to a sun or a star so you'll be close to absolute zero because there's literally there's not much atomic mass or anything the reason we feel warm here on planet earth is because of all of the collisions of all the molecules around us and the co2 right so even though in the thermosphere there's higher energy collisions there's fewer of them but if you exit that and go into the exosphere um it would i mean you you basically wouldn't feel much you would be close to minus 273 kelvin which is near absolute zero um it'd be pretty hard to pretty hard to survive i think so space would actually be cold they'd be cold in a different way like you know the cold that you've experienced is maybe minus 30 minus 40. right those are fewer kinetic energy events happening because everything is slower but if you go down to that temperature uh you just couldn't survive like you would um like liquid nitrogen or liquid helium that those get down to the minus hundreds minus two hundreds if you were to touch that um you know that that could be quite dangerous looks like we have some future uh space explorers i think from this class which would be great yeah we still have a minute so i'll leave it open for another minute technically this class goes till 2. all right so what i'll do is i um this is my first time like recording and doing all this so i will save it and then i'll figure out how to upload this file to canvas but it might not happen right away just give me a day or two okay well without everyone thanks for a a good first day i'm glad everyone was able to log in uh the zoom session worked well so uh good luck with the start to all your other courses and i look forward to seeing you next tuesday take care everyone", "q9vo0MvBhhg": "we tried a couple of experiments to show you how to remove candle systems from your walls first thing you don't want to do is rub the stain with anything wet or dry because you'll set the stain even more so what you want to do is grab a vacuum with the hose attachment and get as much of the excess soot off the wall as you possibly can then use a dry magic eraser and throughout as hard as you can on the wall to remove as much of that set as you possibly can then we used rubbing alcohol with cotton balls you're just supposed to use a little bit of rubbing alcohol and dab dab dab the wall until you see some of the soot as a cotton ball and some of it removing from the wall it's kind of a tedious process and I got frustrated and started rubbing which is what you won't want to do because we actually remove some of the paint doing it that way then you want to wait for the stain to dry to see what it actually looks like without being wet with rubbing alcohol as you can see a little bit of paint guy take it off the next process we saw was to use a one-to-one soap and water solution same way with the cotton ball dab dab dab seen as we were doing this we noticed no soot was coming up on the cotton ball though and so this method didn't really see it towards that effectively after the wall dries we noticed this really didn't work effectively so if you do need to use a professional cleaner to get this tub stain out call your local service master cleaners we'll be more than happy to come out give you a free quote and possibly just remove that stain right on the spot for you", "IDR1_NtMuo0": "all right cohort b this is your lesson for today well happy friday guys and uh listen we're gonna do uh we've got a number of things to discuss i'm going to write to it try to keep it as short as possible today we're going to talk about physical and chemical change we already talked about what a physical property is physical property just describes the the substance so say for example if uh the color of gold okay so the goldish type of color is a property of gold right um you know iron uh has a certain color to it all metals have luster these are physical properties they typically have high melting points and boiling points these are physical properties of substances right okay now a physical change is what happens when changes take place where you don't change the molecular structure of the substance in question okay we don't change atoms atoms can only be changed basically inside a star so we're not changing atoms what we're doing is we're changing their arrangements so say for example water molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom okay so if i were to draw for you a hydrogen or sorry a water molecule um here i'll use red for oxygen so let's say that's an oxygen molecule or sorry an oxygen atom and these two little guys here are the hydrogen atoms oxygen is actually a lot bigger than hydrogen and so um yeah water molecules look like that okay sorry i think the teacher wanted to ask me something you got the two little h's here and you've got the big o right here so that is a molecule of water well you could boil water you could freeze it okay you could pour it into a glass but the molecules don't change they're still water molecules okay we call these physical changes okay if we make a change to something like boiling it freezing it uh you know pouring into a glass pouring on the floor drinking it whatever the water is still the water okay so the molecules themselves aren't changing so that's what we mean by a physical change okay so the deal is we are not no new molecules i'll write it like this no new molecules are being formed or we're not breaking down existing molecules so the molecules are unchanged maybe it's better to say that molecules are not changed that's what we mean by physical change so there is a change taking place but the molecules aren't changing they're staying the same now physical changes include things like cutting tearing pouring separating temperature changes changes of state and so on okay now we're going to take a little closer look at changes of state so the states of matter as you know them are solid okay maybe use a different color liquid and gas you're familiar with those three the corona of our star is made up of something called plasma okay so here plasma plasma is ionized gas okay so we'll talk about that one last but anyway let's go let's start back at the beginning with solid now a solid object has a molecular structure to it okay now what that means is like has a that the molecules are arranged in a lattice work okay and they're only free to vibrate back and forth they're not free to slosh around each other like they do in a liquid for example okay so here is a an example of what a lattice looks like okay what you see there just highlighted in yellow those molecules each little ball represents a molecule they can vibrate like say back and forth and up and down so they can sort of move this way they can move that way you know maybe but they just vibrate basically staying mostly in the same place okay but they are constantly in motion but just a vibrational motion know what we call translational motion where they're moving from point a to point b sort of sloshing around in the material okay so that's a solid phase now if you heat up the uh the solid to the melting point what will happen is this latticework breaks down and you get a more disorganized sort of collection of particles and these particles here like this guy here could slosh around anywhere right moving around the fluid okay so this is a liquid phase okay liquid phase has no organized structure to it i'll take the shape of the container okay that it's placed in and that's basically that's basically it for the liquid phase now if you boil it if you heat it some more in boil it becomes a gas and gases can move right out of the container okay so in fact they have they're not bound they're bound by a container if it's sealed container but they can completely occupy the space of the container and they're not restricted by gravity to the bottom of the container the way the liquid is okay all right plasma is if we get things really hot like star-like hot okay fire like hot i mean it doesn't have to be that as hot as a star you can get plasma okay now plasma plasma's ionized gas this is where we separate the electrons from the atoms and molecules and we have some electrons freely floating around okay those are negative charges and we also have the residual molecule that is now charged positively because its electrons have been separated from it at least some of the electrons have been separated so we call that plasma plasma usually glows okay so these are energetic it's an energetic state of matter where there's glowing taking place because of electrons transitioning from one shell to another in this energized state okay now uh we talked about the corona of the sun being a type of plasma the flame of a fire is a type of plasma you can have low temperature plasma if you electrify a gas with a you know source of electric current so that's how plasma balls are made but plasma yeah ionized gas now when you go from solid so let's say we go from a solid to a liquid that's called melting and i wrote the word right there if you go from liquid to a solid that's called freezing okay sometimes we call it fusion like but it's not not to be confused with nuclear fusion okay but anyway let's just call it freezing now boiling when you go from a liquid to a gas that's called boiling when you go from a gas to a liquid that's called condensation okay and finally when you go from a gas to a plasma that's called ionization when you go from plasma back to a gas that's called deionization okay um so you should know about these words and what they mean if you go straight from a solid to a gas so let's say we go straight from use a highlight straight from here to there that is called sublimation we saw that with the dry ice okay that's called sublimation all right so that's it now molecules change state but the molecules are still the molecules they haven't had a chemical change in other words they haven't been the atoms in the molecule have not recombined themselves in different ways to form new molecules so changes of state are all examples of physical changes okay all right let's talk about chemical change chemical changes happen are like now the molecules are changing okay so we know that here again let me remind you of what it is we're talking about you know the molecules are made up of atoms okay and when these atoms rearrange themselves to form new molecules or to break down existing molecules it's called the chemical change okay so when the molecules change just to summarize if there's any change in the molecule it has to be a chemical change that's taking place and that's what we mean by chemical changes okay a change in the molecule now when this happens we call it a chemical reaction while the molecules are changing okay and that's what chemical reaction is so you can find evidence okay when you're trying to find evidence of a chemical change you're looking for evidence of new molecules now um sometimes when you think of a chemical reaction you might be thinking of like okay you got to mix two chemicals together and you get some type of reaction that takes place it's not true you don't necessarily have to do that for example when you put a piece of toast in the toaster and it comes out like a white piece of white bread turns brown that's a chemical change okay what's happened is you've changed the molecules in the toast okay you've denatured some of those molecules and they've turned brown as a result okay when you cook an egg the egg white is not white at all before you cook it but then when it when it's heated the protein that's in the egg white will turn it'll change color it'll turn white and that's a chemical change so a color change is an example of a chemical change okay so when things change color when a firework explodes and you see this burst of color that's evidence of a chemical change now production of a gas let's say you mix baking soda and vinegar and you see these bubbling gas like coming off of it that's definitely a chemical change taking place okay so we take a powder baking soda we mix it with this liquid vinegar and then all of a sudden this gas is being produced now it's not boiling anything or anything that is not it's not like when you boil water you see a gas being produced that's different it's just changing from liquid to vapor okay but here we're just mixing two chemicals no heat is involved it's not definitely not boiling so what's happening there is you're getting a chemical change that's taking place and the bubbles are actually bubbles of carbon dioxide gas the carbon dioxide wasn't there before you mix the vinegar and the baking soda uh glow sticks will emit light when you mix the chemicals inside okay uh production of heat so sometimes like a fire it's a good example of a chemical reaction where it releases heat some reactions are the opposite like the cold packs okay that you use to let's say in a medical kit somebody like you know sprains their ankle or something is getting swollen and you can just open up this package and you uh you know give it a little twist sort of like the glow sticks and then it mixes a chemical inside and it turns cold that turning cold it's absorbing heat from its environment is a sign of a chemical change so spontaneous changes in temperature are indications of you know chemical change uh you can mix two liquids together and get a solid that's another example of a chemical change okay all right so let me give you some examples here we have the iron i know i wrote it underneath it's right there so here you have iron and what's doing is it's reacting with oxygen now oxygen atoms combine with each other to form oxygen gas we'll talk more about this later okay well there's so much to talk about in chemistry but like why oxygen like a lot of time elements don't occur as individual atoms sometimes they combine in a molecule with each other so these are oxygen molecules there's three of them here okay and what happens is there's a slow reaction the iron and the oxygen in the air and it produces rusty iron that's called iron oxide and actually this is orange in color the rust color that you're used to seeing on a piece of iron that's left outside okay so you take a hammer in your toolbox or something and you leave it outside it'll turn rusty trust me on that okay and you know rain and water and stuff accelerate the rate of this reaction so turn rusty faster but it's still a relatively slow reaction with oxygen all right here's an example of a really fast reaction with oxygen this is methane it's a carbon in the middle so that black thing in the middle is carbon and the rest of it is actually four hydrogens stuck to it this is oxygen okay and when they react you'll notice new molecules get formed so here's the reaction this little arrow here indicates a reaction and this reaction produces carbon dioxide that's co2 i wrote it at the bottom and this is water okay this is called a combustion reaction and this is a fast reaction it's a fire this is how you heat your house the combustion of methane combining methane with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water all right this is i was telling i showed the students this today i have a bunch of demos i'll show you on monday okay so i'm don't worry i'll show them to you okay so this is uh the reaction of uh that's taking place inside a glow stick so there's a really long complicated name this 246 trichlorophenyl oxalate okay uh this is inside a glow stick this long chemical and by the way at every sort of corner of this hexagon in here is a carbon atom they just don't show them so there's lots of carbon atoms in this and then they're bonded with chlorine and oxygen okay you mix it with peroxide peroxide is something you find in the drugstore 30 30 solution so inside the glow sticks those two chemicals are separated they're both transparent liquids okay then what happens is you break the glow stick and then this chemical gets pulled out of that long molecule so that's a chemical change right there and then that chemical reacts with the dye to release carbon dioxide okay for one thing which is trapped inside the glow stick by the way and then the dye enters an excited state and because of that it glows okay and that glowing emission of light is a chemical change all right so here this one here is kind of cool wow smart board is acting weird today that should work better than that all right so um i'm gonna it might seem strange i'm gonna circle it again one at a time this is actually baking soda sodium bicarbonate you recognize the sodium atom there this weird molecule with three oxygen and one hydrogen is called bicarbonate okay so that's sodium bicarbonate baking soda this here is vinegar sometimes we call it uh acetic acid okay or hydrogen acetate okay would be all valid names for it okay there's a hydrogen stuck to it and this weird blob here is called acetate so acetic acid is vinegar okay so hydrogen stuck onto that weird blob anyway you can see what happens is chemical change that takes place this is sodium acetate okay this is water this guy here and then this thing gets released it's carbon dioxide so you see this carbon dioxide gas being bubbled off so you mix baking soda and vinegar what do you see bubbles the bubbles are the carbon dioxide gas that's the sign of the chemical change now i wanted to tell you about the reaction i'm going to show you in class this one here is an example of a chemical change when you mix two clear liquids but they're solutions it's important they're not pure uh substances these are solutions so they're mixtures so if you look at this this is a mixture of in this case it's called lead iodide so here there's lead i'm sorry not that iodide it's potassium nitrate kno3 in there and there's lead iodide er sorry lead am i getting this right it's potassium iodide and lead nitrite okay let me fix this for you i'm not getting it right so on the top here they say potassium iodide and here is pb okay and then they say no3 this is called lead nitrate now they're both solutions okay we call them salt solutions where you take a ionic salt and you mix it with water you get what you know just like salt water except the salt is not sodium chloride this time something else now anyway he makes these two salty solutions together and what happens is as soon as they mix you see a yellow solid this is a solid product and the solid sinks to the bottom it's called the precipitate now there's a color change too they go from being transparent to being this like sort of very brilliant yellow color the this is uh lead iodide lead iodide is insoluble in water okay and so what happens is it sinks to the bottom in the form of a yellow solid okay so here we see the lead iodide at the bottom okay and it turns this brilliant yellow color so that's again evidence of a chemical change all right so there you go chemical changes physical changes i was going to show you some some examples of chemical change on monday when i see you in class all right so let's move on and we'll talk about characteristic physical properties okay so let's talk about that um so some properties help us to identify an element or compound okay these are called characteristic physical properties for example water boils at 100 degrees celsius that's a characteristic of water alcohol boils at 80 degrees celsius that's a characteristic of alcohol see so you can identify the substance based on its boiling melting point or boiling point so both of these things are called characteristic properties like water freezes at zero right salt water actually freezes at some temperature below zero i forget what the temperature is but see like things have their characteristic freezing points and melting points density is also characteristic property of uh substances heat capacity that's like how much heat energy it takes how much energy it takes to change the the the temperature of a substance by one degree celsius is called the specific heat capacity of the substance and that is something specific to them whether or not they're soluble in water so how soluble they are can be a defining characteristic or a characteristic physical property okay i use this example here of water water has this melting and freezing point of zero that has a boiling point of 100 and that's characteristic of water and i also pointed this out water has the strange characteristic that it actually takes up more space this is less dense as a solid because of the crystal this is the lattice okay if you look at this is the lattice of the water molecules so here you can see an individual water molecule right there here's another one see they bond together with a certain geometry and they form this crystal lattice structure okay and that structure takes up more space than the liquid took up this is more dense that's it okay that's a peculiar property of water that the ice crystals expand and float on top of the liquid sub layer when ice freezes okay so that's why you see icebergs floating by in the ocean for example okay because the ice is less dense so it floats okay so let's talk about density we're gonna i'm gonna finish the lesson with density density is defined as the mass per unit volume of a substance which means it's the amount of matter that that will naturally that amount of matter that naturally occupies a unit of volume for a given substance okay we'll do some examples here helium if you have a cubic centimeter now a cubic centimeter is a little box it's a little cube here let me see if i can draw a cube for you a cubic centimeter imagine a small box that is one centimeter and i'll draw like a little dotted line that represents the back of that box like this so imagine if it's one centimeter by one centimeter and it's one centimeter tall so little tiny box that's called one cubic centimeter you get it so it's an amount of space it's a volume okay so cubic centimeters well if you have helium helium has an extremely low density that's why i included it on this little list here its density is only 0.000178 grams will fit at a cubic centimeter of uh of space and that's at standard temperature and pressure so that means that you know basically let's say room temperature okay at normal atmospheric pressure air has a is much more dense okay like more than like around 10 times as dense as helium so helium balloon floats on it right it rises up in the air because it's less dense water has really interesting density of one gram per cubic centimeter so if you're pouring if you're gonna pour fill this container with water okay it'll be one gram of water will fit in there and then it'll be full okay that's at least at four degrees celsius so i could write so a nice cold glass of water okay ice has a density of less dense so it's only 0.91 68 grams per cubic centimeter and therefore it floats in water right just like helium floats and rises up in the air so ice will rise to the top of a pool of water all right so there's a way to calculate density this is the formula for density you just take the mass and you divide it by volume okay so normally we would do a lab on this but mass is measured in grams volume and cubic centimeters and the density is in grams per cubic centimeter when you divide those two quantities okay and that's what you get so here uh i gave an example let's say for example you had a block that has a mass of 30 grams and in class we actually measured the block it was 2.7 centimeters like but it was a cube and so it was 2.7 by 2.7 by 2.7 so to get the volume we multiplied length times width times height for the box so in other words it was a box like the other box except much a little bit bigger than a cubic centimeter right so here's our box it was 2.7 centimeters by 2.7 centimeters by 2.7 centimeters in height we multiply volume equals length times width times height we multiplied them together to get the volume now to find the density we just take mass we we divide the mass by the volume and we got this is the density here for the block 1.52 grams per cubic centimeter okay so anyway that's how you find uh that's how you find density it's pretty simple just divide mass by volume now i i wanted to show you some that you can rearrange this formula okay if you're solving for density it's mass divided by volume like we said so that's this formula here however i'll use a highlighter if you're solving for mass mass will equal density times volume and finally if you're solving for volume volume equals mass over density all we're doing here guys and i'll explain it a little bit better maybe for you when you're i see you in person all we're doing is a little bit of math on the first formula and solving for one of the other two variables now what i did in class was i said there's a little triangle so this triangle that you see here will help you decide like if you don't want to do the algebra which i prefer if you learn the algebra but if you want to use a triangle you can let's say i'm solving for density density will equal mass divided by volume okay so the triangle tells us how to find density let's say you're solving for volume well volume will equal mass divided by density okay so the triangle tells us that too and let's say finally you're solving for mass well mass will equal density not over volume but times volume down here okay so since density and volume are side by side in the triangle that means you multiply them together and that's equation number two that i highlighted in yellow over here so anyway there's three different versions of the same equation and you can solve for any one of those three things so let's say for example if i know that my density of my metal is 1.52 grams per cubic centimeter of my object what if i have more of that object what if i have um you know 50 cubic centimeters instead of just you know 19 cubic centimeters well how much mass would that be so how much mass if i had a density of 1.52 grams per cubic centimeter how much mass would occupy 50 cubic centimeters then so then i just go ahead and use the formula like here i'll do it over here for question b i'm solving for mass mass will equal density times volume according to my density triangle just above so i will go 1.52 times 50 whoops times 50 cubic centimeters and i get 76.1 grams now remember mass is measured in grams okay so let's say instead i ask a different question let's say i tell you okay i've got a mass of 1000 grams my density is still 1.52 grams per cubic centimeter and i'm going to ask you what is the volume of that so if i have a kilogram of this metal how much volume will it occupy well now for this question i'll do it just below it here you're going to write volume equals mass over density now i did the equation right there so it's going to be a thousand divided by 1.52 and that works out to be 67 657.9 cubic centimeters all right that's how you do density okay now i did have a worksheet for you the worksheet is on the last page of the notes here okay and there are several questions on density so um yeah can i i just want to tell you in this first question that says you are given four blocks of different materials they all have identical mass the materials are foam gold aluminum and ice there's a table in your book that has a list of densities of common materials but i mean you could probably guess that the foam is the least dense gold is actually the most dense aluminum okay is here i'll put them in order it would be full ice aluminum and gold okay that's in order of least dense to most downs so which would have the largest volume the largest volume would be the thing that has the smallest density it will take up the most space okay so if you understand what i mean by density like a kilogram of foam like foam weighs almost nothing a kilogram of it would be a very large block of foam but a kilogram of gold would be a small block like just like maybe the size of your fist okay no bigger than that because gold is quite dense it's one of the denser elements on the periodic table okay all right so question number two i'm just going to do a couple of examples and i'll leave it to you after that so question number two it says the density of aluminum is and i highlighted it here i'll do it again for you 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter that's a true story okay four students each measure the mass and volume of a sample metal their results are as shown which one has aluminum so what you have to do is work out the density of each of these things so if you do the first one just go density equals mass over volume divide those two numbers in your calculator i can just by looking at the numbers i already know you're not going to get 2.7 so the first guy does not person a definitely does not have a piece of aluminum there okay now b looks pretty close and it could be that more than one of them has aluminum you'll have to just check so just find the density of each guy's block okay and see which one matches 2.7 now it might not be a perfect match maybe it's 2.69 but that's close enough that there's a source of error whenever you're measuring so it could be a little bit off but that's definitely close enough to call it aluminum all right so the rest of these are pretty straightforward you just go ahead and use the formula that i gave you i told the students that you do need to i'm going to write it here you have to show a step for a homework mark okay so go ahead and show the step and uh by showing the step you'll um you'll show me that you're you're you know what you're doing okay so please don't just write a number as the answer i need to see that like you're you know you're whether you're multiplying dividing whatever it is show me one step and then the answer is fine okay and that's it for today guys so please do this for homework if you check the homework in the outline the homework is here so um don't forget you guys have an element quiz on monday so we're gonna do that on monday so we did lesson six today so we did lesson six so you can do this homework here there's no lab so forget the lab business we also did a density handout so you'll find that in the page i showed you there so please do that and we're not doing a lab just yet normally we do a density lab um we can't really do it because of the pandemic so i will do it with you and i'll probably do it with you on monday all right so guys that's it uh 30 minutes that's not too bad 33 minutes so uh listen have a great weekend please get up to lesson seven down in the homework and don't forget this weekend on checking the space homework make sure it's all done for a completed mark otherwise we will talk to you soon okay bye", "tVp-Pjw4Rws": "[Music] looking at video 2.1 which is gonna investigate atomic theory how did we ever discover that matter was made up of particles too small to see over time technology improved and our theories evolved give me us a much more accurate model of the atom we're gonna look more carefully at this in this video to start off with we have Democritus in the fourth century BC he is a Greek philosopher and he is the one that coined the term atoms he hypothesized that atoms existed of course technology was not available to test his hypothesis he stated also that atoms were indivisible now this did create a little bit of controversy at the time there was also a famous philosopher Aristotle that disagreed with Democritus and there was a specific reason for this Aristotle did not believe that there could be empty space between the atoms he supported the existence of what were called the four elements at that time where we have these four kind of natural elements we have fire an office of that would be water we also would have air and earth which would be opposite of each other as well and there's an interface in between each of the pairs so we have dry hot cool wet for example so it makes sense if you study the diamond a little bit this simple idea went unchallenged for about 2,000 years until we had enough technology to basically prove otherwise that this idea of atoms was valid John Dalton was a British schoolteacher who can't be six ideas based on experiments and these ideas are really important it gives us a really strong foundation for what we currently understand about matter even though it's not totally perfect but we'll start off with the beginning here that matter is composed of extremely small particles called atoms that those atoms are indivisible and indestructible atoms of a given element are identical with their size mass and their properties if we have a sample of atoms of a specific element that element is different from the atoms of another element the fifth one here is that different atoms can combine in whole number ratios to form compounds and then lastly number six that in a chemical reaction atoms are separated combined and rearranged or rearranged this image shows us how Dalton was looking at a mass ratio during chemical reactions here we have a reaction between oxygen and hydrogen and it forms the water which is something that you are familiar with he was looking at the mass ratios between these things we have 16 mass ratio or mass units of oxygen that would combine with two mass units of hydrogen to create 818 so we're showing the law of conservation of mass here now don't didn't notice a pattern during these experiments that there would be specific whole number ratios with these compounds and it leads to the law of definite proportions saying that a given compound will contain the same exact whole number ratios of elements regardless of the size of the sample that was used now which of these ideas from Dawn's atomic theory are still believed to be true an atom is the smallest particle of an element that still retains the properties of that element that's we can't divide it up anymore and still retain those properties here's a comparison of how big atoms are first we're going to compare an atom and an orange so an atom is - an orange as an orange would be - the planet Earth big difference in size there here's another way to look at it the diameter of an atom is to one millimeter as a thickness of one piece of paper is to the entire empire state building height big difference piece of paper - the Empire State Building so it gives you a frame of reference as to how big atoms are looking at subatomic particles now we know that Dalton's stated that atoms are indivisible and we know that's actually not correct there are subatomic particles and we do have evidence of that those subatomic particles are electrons protons and neutrons and different scientists are credited with discovering each of these particles will start with Goldstein a German physicist working are discovering a proton he discovered the atoms at a positive charge and he was looking at neutral particles that would give negative cathode rays an electric field that they must also then have a positive peace which is where he developed this idea behind a proton Thompson is a big name for us Thompson is English and discovers the electron and he was a physicist working at Cambridge he was quite klutzy he would break his equipment and a lot of different physicists were using cathode ray tubes at this time so Thomson discovers the electrons using this device here's a diagram of the cathode ray tube what I want you to notice that this would be a device made of glass on the left-hand side is where we would be introducing a beam of electrons the black area is the cathode ray which is a it would glow kind of a bluish color and what I want you to pay attention to also is that there are some charged plates there's a positive plate at the bottom and notice that the beam is deflected down towards the positive plate keep in mind that opposite charges attract so it's likely that it's a negatively charged beam Thompson noticed that if it was a magnetic field or that he would see this deflection in the same manner no matter what gas was within this to that we would see the negative plate deflect and it would be attracted towards the oppositely charged plate so the cathode rays were deflected by the negatively charged plate and no matter what metal was used inside of the tube same results this is the model of the atom that he is credited with called the plum pudding model of the atom think of the bread pudding kind of like the positive area of the atom the negative electrons would be like these blue plums included in this diagram so overall it would be neutral because the red pudding would be canceled out by the negative plums shown there in blue so again the plum pudding model can't like chocolate chip cookie dough there was a quote that was kind of capturing how Thompson was so surprised at how small and light the electrons were it was an insignificant fraction of the mass of an atom he does win the Nobel Prize in Physics and estimates that electrons about a thousandth the mass of either approach on a neutron we now know that the electrons are part of an electron cloud but that was not part of Thomson's discovery Robert Millikan is an American scientist who improves the estimates of the mass of the electron using this oil-drop experiment particles that are introduced to the device and we're using charged plates to kind of suspend those particles in its base and the relationship between their mass and their charge he estimates that an electron is one 1,830 seventh the mass of hydrogen now Rutherford the 19:06 does this experiment called the gold foil experiment where we fire alpha particles which are really like helium particles at a very thin piece of gold foil you know like aluminum foil some of those alpha particles which are heavy go straight through which is what was expected but some of those particles do not they're deflected at all kinds of different angles Thompson does when a Nobel Prize for this as well so here's a diagram we see the gold foil in the center we see our alpha source in purple up towards the so this it's like a gun of you know fighters alpha particles which are somewhat heavy at this very thin piece of foil we expect them all to end up in the back in the center but they're deflected as you can see at all kinds of different angles which was really a surprise so the back up would think well what would cause them to be deflected at all kinds of different angles so look at this close-up of one atom and we're firing gold particles from the left-hand side I'm sorry firing alpha particles at the gold from the left-hand side and many of the particles that particles pass straight through we can see some at the top and some towards the bottom of the atom but the ones that come closer in contact with the nucleus are deflected at those various angles and they conclude that there must be a very very dense core of positive charge within that nucleus Rutherford says if an atom was the size of a football field the nucleus is the size of a marble bill bryson is in his book a brief history of nearly everything does have some quotes about Rutherford one saying that all science is either physics or stamp collecting Rutherford was not really impressed that he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry rather than physics and he also was known Rutherford for being an extremely hard worker he did not give up he considered alternative views and other kinds of interpretation of data which really led him to some unique perspectives he was prepared the quote at the bottom he was prepared to work at it harder and longer than most people and be more receptive to unorthodox explanations never give up Chadwick and this fascinates me Chaddock also English wins a Nobel Prize discovers the neutron using a particle accelerator which is still used for research now there's bigger and better ones now he was a student of Rutherford and I find that that legacy is so unique and important Niels Bohr was also a student of Ernest Rutherford and he develops the planetary model of the atom so thinking about the nucleus in the center kind of like this son is in this center of the solar system then we have in the solar system those planets orbit around the nucleus Sun kind of like in our planetary model of the atom the electrons would orbit the nucleus as an electron moves from one orbit to another it's like gain er losing energy and they're called quantum leaps and he also wins a Nobel Prize here are three laws I'd like to summarize the law of definite proportions is first this is looking at a given compound containing exactly the same ratio of elements by mass next is the law of multiple proportions thus if we have let's say two compounds like carbon monoxide which is a one-to-one ratio between carbon and oxygen and carbon dioxide which is a 1 a 2 ratio between those two so we can have different whole number ratios of those elements lastly would be the law of conservation of mass and this says it matters never created nor destroyed thanks for watching", "LD4N2wFBv5U": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hi everybody let me turn that off here uh just a few updates on the upcoming schedule so hopefully everybody is read the announcement I posted last night I might need a little more time to go over all the material before the final so I'm gonna use part of tomorrow's lab lecture and QA as also more lecture content I'm actually not super worried about this class because we're pretty much on track to finish that said I would like to use the time just to make sure that I can get all the stuff in in time the exam will cover all the content that we cover this week and all the way back to whatever we covered before or after exam number one there will also be a chapter 9 quiz which will be posted one more finish with chapter 9 there will not be a chapter 10 quiz I will simply just roll that content into the exams or final whatever we end up covering uh with that said there is also gonna be a lab tomorrow I will unlock that later tonight so that you can look at that and then it will be available and yeah it should be just like any other lab lecture other than the extra regular lecturing coming after that so let's continue with chapter 9 we are almost done chapter 9 will probably finish it today and start chapter 10 so yeah let's talk about collision Theory collision theory is basically the idea that all molecules are moving and when molecules are moving they bunk into each other and if they bunk into each other with enough energy they will react but if they don't bump into each other with enough energy they don't so not all collisions a container with molecules whether they're in the liquid phase gas phase or whatever are gonna result in reactions a analogy for this would be if you threw a ball at the wall the ball would bounce off of it and make a loud sound or just dunk but you could probably imagine a situation where you throw the ball hard enough and when I say you I mean like with like a cannon or something and you launch it at the wall and it could go through the wall it could cause enough damage that it would break the wall that would be the difference between a reaction as in the wall breaks and no reaction where the ball just bounces off the wall the amount of energy that you need to do that is some threshold and that energy could be calculated in reactions we have done that and so we will represent that using a picture show you what we mean so there's two criteria that we care about we're not really gonna care so much about orientation in reactions because this is an introductory class and that's a more of an advanced theory but the most important thing to take away is that we need a minimum amount of energy to cause a reaction when two entities collide with each other it's called the activation energy the activation energy is the amount of energy you need for the reaction to happen and pictorially we're gonna draw it as like a hill so like I'll have something at the bottom of the hill and then if I can throw the object high enough to get it over the hill it had enough energy but if I didn't throw it high enough it will hit the side of the hill and come rolling back down towards me now when we do chemistry or any sort of reaction outside of the laboratory you will probably see that energy is involved in some way for instance if you have a wood-burning stove or a fireplace or something like that I guess you would never word wood-burning stove who uses that anymore if you have a fireplace though and you put wood in it and you light the wood on fire you don't do that because it's pretty like there's a very specific function for burning firewood in your in your fireplace and that's because it releases heat so what you could say is that if we were to compare the firewood versus the ash and stuff that's leftover and all the combustion products do which will be co2 and h2o we could say that the firewood itself has high energy now that would be potential energy the reason it's not kinetic energy is because it's not moving potential energy is energy that's stored in bonds like we talked about in chapter 7 we can turn that potential energy into kinetic energy by making gaseous products like this the water that you make when you burn stuff is a vapor so this would be considered to have low energy because we've converted it all into another form if I were to draw a diagram of this this is kind of what it would look like so on the y-axis we're gonna have energy and on the x-axis we're gonna have reaction progress now what this just means is that how far through the reaction are we our week before anything has happened or are we after the reaction has occurred so in other words on the left side we're gonna have reactants and on the right side we're gonna have products now we're gonna plot their energy coordinate based on what we said over here so we could say firewood has high energy so I'm gonna put it high up here that's actually a really bad line let me try to do that again and we'll just put that on there firewood and then what we could say is we could say that well the other stuff that we made so ash sio2 etc is low energy I did that in their own color that's okay then now in order to get from reactants to products I would have to draw a curve to connect the two but if I do this then what's implied by this reaction is that firewood would spontaneously just turn into ash and carbon dioxide and all the other things on its own as far as I am aware firewood does not spontaneously self combust and so this diagram is drawn would not be right so we can't do this what we have to do is we have to put activation energy in there so we'd have to do something like this in other words I have to give the firewood some initial energy and that's this right here now when you light your fire would you do so by using a match or fire starter like those little clicky things when you do that you are providing the firewood with an initial amount of energy to get the reaction started once you've provided that energy the reaction goes on its own because the energy that is produced by the reaction is once it's lit it would be this much right well we've already paid this much energy to get the reaction started in activation energy so this difference right here would be the energy of reaction the energy of the reaction is the difference between the reactants and the products now because the energy was lost from the reaction because the total energy went down the energy must have gone out of the reaction which is the firewood itself so the energy is coming out of the firewood and we perceive that as heat which is why we do this process in the first place we're cold we want we want warms let's set things on fire you might see this term written for energy Delta H this is a thermodynamic Stern called enthalpy you just think of Delta H as energy that comes out of a reaction or goes into a reaction we're going to talk about exothermic and endothermic in just a second but that's the gist of what an energy diagram will look like so when I put all this text on the screen because I'm gonna have to clear this in a second it will say that here's a generic reaction you can think of a and B is the firewood and a B as the ash or whatever plus the heat that's released so here's that again on our diagram since my reaction releases heat the reactants must be higher in energy than the products when something releases heat you're gonna perceive that as hot that's gonna be an opposite to if something absorbs heat if you touch like say an ice cube with your finger the ice cube absorbs heat because it will start melting and the feeling that you will perceive on that is Oh cold BRR and the reason for that is because your thermal energy is being transferred to the ice cube which is what our body interprets as cold these are just the same terms that we talked about before so this right here is Delta H and this is the activation I didn't mean to cross at that I meant to underline all right for this specific reaction as shown the energy is leaving the reaction for any system where this happens and the energy is lost from the reaction and gained by the surroundings we use the term exothermic EXO meaning out and thermic meaning thermal energy Delta H is not activation energy Delta H is this difference right here activation energy is this difference right here there are two different things there is not a term for activation energy for this class if you look in different textbooks you'll just see this C sub a thing but we'll never use that term I will just say activation energy but they are different things another thing to remember for about the energy released by the reaction will be it's the difference between reactants and products whereas the activation energy is just the highest point on the graph relative to where you start in order to get this reaction going I gotta get over this hill if I don't give it enough energy nothing happens this would be kind of like if you light a match and then put it next to the wood for like one second you didn't give it enough energy so it didn't start but if you hold it there for like five seconds then you have given it enough energy and it will start alright so again if a reaction releases energy that is the reactants have higher energy than the products and the energy is emitted we call it exothermic exothermic reactions feel hot the opposite would be something that is an endothermic reaction where the energy goes into the reaction now what would a diagram look like if it was endothermic well that's actually what I want you to try and draw you've seen the exothermic example so I want you to try this example so let's suppose you have something like a cold pack hopefully people have seen cold packs or use them before in the cold pack are some chemicals and I'll just call them a and B because you we don't need to know what they are when you break the seal the chemicals mix and then it gets really cold and so you make a product and the product the result of the product being formed is cold sorry I was trying to not spoil the answer here so what I want you to do is draw an energy diagram for the scenario the energy diagram or the activation energy is not zero but it is small tell me if the reaction is so thermacore endothermic and then write a chemical reaction like we showed before so I did a B or a plus B makes a B and heat for the exothermic reaction try and write a reaction like that for the endothermic reaction using the same process that we did before which is okay where are the energies of the reactants relative to the products draw those first and then draw curve and then identify all of the parts of that as shown here okay so I'll give you a few minutes to do that we'll go over the answers in just a second you I'm sitting here talking for like 10 seconds I realize I didn't actually cook the thing hopefully everybody has drawn their diagram so what I'm gonna do is go to here and that's probably good enough for now I gotta zoom this in a bit so we have some space to draw on and I'll do that all right so we know that the reaction involves us adding these two things together and there's my text step right and we're gonna make this now we also know that the reaction is cold so if the reaction is cold that means that our heat needs to get absorbed we can't release it if we were gonna release it it'd be a product so we're gonna add it in as a reactant we're gonna remove heat from the surroundings and put it into the reaction to make the product it's really hard to write sideways on this thing I mean I guess I could turn the tablet sideways but then I don't know where I am on the screen all right so we got the reaction progress on the x-axis we got energy on the y-axis I know that my reactants must be lower in energy than the products because I have to add heat to them so I'm gonna put my reactants right here and my products over here so this would be a plus B and this would be a B and the heat we're gonna add would be this much but I am also supposed to have some sort of activation energy so if I do this then nothing is stopping my reactants from just my products just going back into reactants I need them to get stuck over there so I got to get rid of this line so we need some sort of activation energy like this and so now we need to describe the activation energy and the energy gained ur released by the reaction so first of all if this line continues this way that's not very straight line but it's okay this would be the energy that the reaction gained and because we are not the reaction we are on the surroundings of the reaction we feel that as energy being lost its cold sorry that's my chair creaking so this would be Delta H Myra the Delta H is the difference between the products and the reactants in red the activation energy is this peak up here and that is going to be relative to where we started so this I missed up on is our activation energy activation energy is always relative to the reactants if I wanted to do it relative to the products I'd have to reverse the reaction and draw the diagram that way in fact if I were to reverse the reaction this then the diagram that you would see would look like what we did on the previous slide which let me see if I can actually squeeze that into the top corner there we go yeah so you can see that the reaction for the exothermic diagram is just the opposite of what we did that's the next slide all right and so we have already drawn the energy diagram for this and we put heat in there so we're all set all right so now you know the difference between an endothermic reaction and an exothermic reaction as shown and again because this one gained reaction or gained energy its endothermic so your your job will be to look at a reaction tell me if it's exothermic or endothermic based on where heat shows up in it and then attribute gauge to the correct diagram other things you ought to do is I might show you a diagram you ought to click on where like Delta H's or where the activation energy is or whatever where you'll have to click on is it exothermic or endothermic or something like that all right here's no more practice for this section so that's energy the next thing we're gonna talk about is kinetics which is how fast reactions go and this is the fun section because I get to show you a lot of videos including one that will probably get me a copyright strike so we're looking forward to that because that one I'm not gonna meet because it's just great all right here are two reactions one of them is fast and one of them is slow which is which me duh right rusting does not happen instantaneously if it did we would never use metal anything because it would just be immediately useless rust is a very slow reaction whereas explosions are extremely fast we use different reactions for different things for example if we want to impart a large amount of energy really quickly into something like say a structure because we no longer need it we would demolish it by setting up dynamite or some other type of explosive if we want something to persist we want the reactivity of that thing to be very slow so we can make things out of Steel because resting is a very slow process and we can either polish off the restor or replace the thing in question or whatever understanding our reactions go quickly and slowly is very important because that allows us to manipulate them and give us the flexibility we need for whatever task that we're looking at in biology we're gonna look at catalysis and enzymes and things like that and we want reactions to typically go fast enough so that life can be supported if a reaction slows down that could be toxic or deadly to a person so this has biological importance too so the speed at which a reaction goes is called its rate the rate of the reaction is in other words just how many molecules react per second now obviously that's gonna be a ginormous number so we usually use like moles or moles per liter per second things like that but the study of this is called kinetics kinetics being speed how fast does it go in our studies and connects we're gonna narrow this down to four different things that can cause a reaction to go faster or slower and those four things I'm going to show you some videos to help illustrate the point now we've already talked about why it's important but here are the four things we're going to consider so we're gonna consider either than so first we're gonna consider the nature of the stuff that we're reacting so like this is a solid as a liquid as a gas whatever we're gonna consider how much of it we have which is concentration we're gonna look at how fast the molecules are moving which is temperature and then we're gonna look at catalysis which is a special sort of thing that allows us to change the energy diagram to something different which can be beneficial all right I'm gonna put this reaction on the screen and I'm gonna note that we haven't really used phase as much but in this specific reaction the phases are gonna be important I react solid a with aqueous B what that means is that my B is dissolved in the liquid and a is just a chunky solid that I've dropped in there so you can see on the screen here that the liquid is the blue stuff and the solid is the pink thing now depending on what how I put it in there I could either put it in as one solid chunk or I could break it into several chunks which of these will react faster and you might be looking at this and saying well does it matter well kind of or you might immediately look at that and say oh it has to be B because b has to touch a in order to react all of the spaces where a is just trapped or and surrounded by other a can't react so that would be in the middle of this cube right here so everything I'm highlighting which isn't really showing up very well this will work everything in here that's in the center doesn't get reacted but the stuff on the outside does whereas over here and this is kind of hard for me to draw because my thing is to baking everywhere that is on the edges reacts and because there are more edges so I didn't erase all because there are more edges on the second one there's more place for it to react so reactivity cares about surface area because this is where the molecules actually physically encounter each other if I have more surface area the reaction goes faster so I have a demonstration for this so I gotta get this video up and you don't need to hear the audio here for this guy but I do need to pause it so window capture - what's this one that didn't quite use that's the wrong thing that I wanted didn't quite get the whole thing there we go I don't need that part and now I can make it big all right we'll leave a little time a question at the bottom here I have three different containers that have HCl so the HCL is the liquid part and in each of these bowls is calcium carbonate we're gonna hit play here and you'll get to see how chunky the oh I guess you don't get to see a chunky there let me go back a little bit here we'll show you how to key the inside so here's the first one which yeah good job dude we still couldn't see that okay that's a little better all right here's the second one you can see that the second one is a little chunkier than the first one and then the third one is very chunky so the first one over here on the left is very fine this one's a little bit more coarse and this one is just basically a few pieces so I'm gonna speed this up there we go he's gonna pour in the first one here's how fast the reaction is going you can kind of visually see I want you to tell me is the second reaction faster or slower then the one on the right all right here we go what does that look like to you faster or slower go ahead and type it in the chat what you think I'll let it keep playing here oh we don't wanna see it the next one yet we'll just do this one again so looks faster how can you tell what observation is telling you that it looks like it's going faster oh we have a different answer what what observation makes it look like it's going slower try and defend your answer type it in the chat tell me what you think is going on here yeah very good so it's making bubbles in the second one much more quickly than it is in the first one here's the third one and the third ones very fine let's see if it makes them even more bubbles yeah there you go so that seems to confirm that the reaction is creating a gas which you couldn't really tell from the one on the far right let me pause in the middle when there's bubbles here the one in the middle made a few bubbles and the one on the right I'm sorry the one on the far left made the most bubbles and that's a direct correlation to how much solid was able to contact the HCL when it's a fine powder all of the molecules can pretty much react immediately but when it's a very chunky solid only the stuff on the surface reacts and you have to keep digging down to the next layer to get to the next part of the reaction so go slower alright so that was the first factor that we can use and so that was the physical nature so grinding stuff up makes it go faster keeping it as a solid a chunky solid makes it go slower now like we said earlier today molecules have to contact each other in order to do a reaction if you put more molecules in there then the odds of the reaction occurring go up so let's suppose that I had two solutions in a beaker in solution one I have one mole of a and one mole of B in solution two I have one mole of a in formals of E and a and B presumably react when they contact each other well if I have a lot of a and the same amount of bees and the situation on the left happens here every a molecule will have a 50/50 chance of running into a bee the other 50% will be a and a bumping into itself doesn't do anything but if I have four moles of B then I have a much greater chance of a reacting with B because there's just more B in the solution so if I increase the molarity of something I give more opportunities to react now this isn't the entire story because what about stuff like the solvent so what does water do in here well most of the solution is water so most collisions are gonna be with water and bumping into water doesn't do anything but if I can increase the amount of stuff that isn't water then I increased the likelihood of the reaction so if I increased a as well I could then do this from the perspective of B and the reaction would increase also so if I have one mole of each versus one mole of a and four moles of B that will go faster but if I had four moles of each it would go even faster still because I am still making more collisions relative to the number of collisions with water this one doesn't have a video you just to trust my graphic that I made so hooray maybe it has a video it doesn't okay now when you increase the concentration of stuff the rate will go up this also applies to gases and pressure so if you have a reaction that is occurring in a balloon or something and you put more gas in there the pressure goes up and so if pressure increases the faster the reaction will go this is why if you give somebody oxygen in like a tank like you have to control what the rate of oxygen is that goes into them if you put too much oxygen then the oxygen will dissolve into their blood to quickly and then you do that reaction too fast then that's bad if you don't put enough oxygen or maybe like because somebody has breathing problem they need assisted ventilation or something like that then not enough auction means the reaction goes too slow the next thing we're going to talk about is temperature remember that temperature is how fast molecules move if they're in the gas phase as well as in the liquid phase therefore if molecules move faster they have more energy and if molecules have more energy they can get over the activation energy and so as a result if I have a sample of stuff and the amount of energy I need is to get to get over is this much but the molecules have on average this much energy they won't get over the hump but if on average they have this much energy then some of the molecules do you get over the hump and so the reaction will go on its own so by heating stuff up you can create a situation where the molecules will react more often and so we have a demo right here for that - this is gonna be glow sticks in water which is not super easy to see on the screen but we'll do the best that we can all right so we'll open this guy up there we go there's our glow sticks they should have the same brightness although it's kind of it looks like to me that the one on the right is a little bit less bright but looking at the middle they should have the same intensity we're gonna put one in hot water and we're gonna put one in cold water which ones which tell me in the chat after we speed up the video so here's the first one and here's the second one and then we're gonna speak I'm gonna actually speed up the video by going like this so I'm gonna advance a few seconds every time alright so that's the end State let's look at it at the start again whoops there we go alright so which one was hot and which one was cold water left or right which one was which the hot has to be on the left how come what made you draw that conclusion so if the reaction is the glowsticks emitting light and we put it in the hot water and it shines more light the reaction must have gone more right so the hot water provided enough energy to make her a glowing reaction occur whereas the cold water suppressed that it made the molecule slow down so that the reaction did not occur as often and the result is you get less light and so he's gonna take these out of the container now and once the focus dies down you could see the difference if you've ever had glow sticks something that people say is oh I want to keep them forever okay throw them in the freezer because what that means is that the reaction will go less often and then when it warms up it'll get bright again so this is why you freeze your glow sticks I'm not saying this as a professional raver I'm just saying this is somebody who's a scientist and also like studying that stuff all right we got to make glow sticks in the chemistry class which was great then we turned off all the lights in the lab and then we shook the vials that we had them in nobody told us that that stuff is carcinogenic and that you really shouldn't be exposed to it so we were a bunch of goofy second-year students running around a lab with the lights out it's probably not the best idea but our TA was cool about it all right here's the last video this is with regards to a catalyst a catalyst is a special substance and what it does is it changes the reaction diagram in doing so it is not used up and can be used over and over again so what the catalyst does is you put it in there and it just allows the reaction to go indefinitely in a different way so what that means is that if this is the normal reaction that I might have I might need this much energy represented by the red line if I had a catalyst that curve will change now I only need this much energy because the catalyst has provided a difference path for the reaction to go for instance a might react with B to make a B here but in this reaction a might react with the catalyst and then the catalyst a reacts with B to make a B and the catalyst is left over or it could be any number of things this little divot represents some sort of intermediate product that the catalyst is involved in so if you see these little like valleys in your energy diagram that's because a catalyst is in there all right now the amount of energy that we need for the catalyzed reaction is lower which means that the reaction must go more quickly because remember if I have my average energy of my molecules is like this much then only the ones that have enough energy get over but if I have the same energy available on this side then all of these molecules can react and the reactions gonna go way faster so let's see that in action here this is a reaction that I would have done today believe it or not at the science fair for Everett Community College which we usually do every year and in the second last week of classes for spring we invite a bunch of fifth graders from nearby high schools and we do this reaction and I actually do this specific reaction I put peroxide in a giant flask as you're about to see a scientist do this is actually where I got the idea and you put in a potassium iodide catalyst and it causes the reaction to go very fast now this reaction is kind of slow because it's peroxide that's not the color I wanted sorry about that so this is peroxide if you have peroxide under your sink or in your medicine cabinet or whatever it's stored in a black bottle or a brown bottle and the reason for that is that we need to store it in some sort of plastic container with a color so that light doesn't pass through it we can't use transparent plastic the light needs to be absorbed generally darker colors absorb light more so we use that specific color for that bottling if it is exposed to light it will decompose and so it will decompose on its own but it's very very slow but if we had a catalyst to it such as in this case sodium iodide I use potassium iodide cuz it was whatever's in the stockroom the reaction goes way more quickly the peroxide binds to the iodide and that allows it to remove an oxygen to make o2 and so this reaction is known as elephant toothpaste this is probably one of my favorite things to do for science and fortunately we have somebody who has done that for us already and his name is science Bob and here he is on Jimmy Kimmel so hopefully the stream will not immediately go down because I'm playing Jimmy Kimmel for you guys science Bob may claim this whatever but here we go we'll see what happens so something I do want to comment before we continue every time a liquid is added to the container music plays and I kind of wish that this was a real thing like I'm just go to the fridge and pour some soda in and then I get happy music playing specifically this music is this how you did your jacket all right so I'm gonna add the hydrogen peroxide because you don't want to do that okay actually yeah let's get all okay now remember safety first in the laboratory not that we've had a laboratory so here's what we're gonna see we're gonna in order to remove the oxygen we're gonna use a catalyst catalyst to speed up the reaction so we're gonna that's what's in here it's a sodium solution we're gonna pour that in and that's gonna remove the oxygen the soap is gonna hold it and his mother to death all of us okay but it will it will create a lot of bubbles really fast okay great and usually this is done in graduated cylinders mm-hm but we're gonna make it a little more intense with these ridiculously large flasks okay good all right so this is what you're gonna use we're gonna pour that in there the Hoxton will be released and we'll watch the reaction okay good step back after okay alright alright so before we start the reaction the reaction is currently going and if you left this here all the peroxide that's in there would decompose the dish soap is added to catch the oxygen that comes out so as the reaction occurs bubbles will pair you can barely see the bubbles down here but that's probably just from mixing it would take years for all the peroxide to decompose completely but when we add the catalyst this happens [Music] there we go and they'll never get that light clean unfortunately yeah so that is the elephant toothpaste reaction I do that for kids thanks science Bob for giving me the idea the the fifth graders love it we get thank-you cards from them and they always say the best thing was that was the elephant toothpaste and then of course there's always the people that are like oh I thought it was gonna be bigger why isn't it bigger I'm like well you get what you get all right hopefully my channel will still be up next week you know the quarter is over so that's all right but please don't copyright strike me science well alright so for our review question let's summarise really quickly here so what are the things that govern how fast reactions go so we care about the physical nature if we can get a higher surface area we can speed up the reaction if you just put more stuff in the reaction will go faster if you heat it up it'll go faster and if you put a catalyst in it'll go faster so with that in mind I'm gonna put this on the screen here I'm gonna give you a few minutes to answer these questions question number one is why do you store milk in a sealed container in the fridge why don't we just put it in a bowl on the counter why do we specifically do this action put it in a bottle and put it in the fridge give some reasons on why we do that using kinetics and then secondly I have a reaction that turns a solution dark blue I guess this isn't me because this is a this is a woman doing this reaction she notices that the chemical in her reaction only goes for ten minutes she wants it to go longer what could she do if she wanted to make the reaction go for longer and then what else could she do if she wanted to make a speed up and go faster so answer these questions we'll go over the answers in just a bit and then we'll take a break so I'll see you in a bit you all right so hopefully we've given this a little bit of thought we have some idea here so do that so let's look at this first question real quick so the question is why do we store milk in the refrigerator in sealed containers so here's my milk jug it's got a little handle on it or something like that there we go and so when you buy the milk it's usually filled pretty pretty good and here's the lid that you put on it so there you go so there's our milk now when you store it in the fridge the fridge is generally cold so what does having it cold due to the speed of the reaction well if it's cold we slow the reactivity of the milk down and what I say by what I mean by reactivity of milk is like things like bacteria or curdling or any specific process that we would not want to happen to the milk the other thing that we're doing is when we have it in a bottle like this we're reducing the contact area that the milk has with the surroundings and so the only place that the milk can really contact the atmosphere or anything outside of the bottle is right here at the surface so by putting it in a bottle the bottle reduces the surface area which in turn slows down any reaction that might be going on now you could also give other reasons like oh we put in the fridge in inside the fridge there's no light so lights can't catalyze any bad reactions or cause any bad reactions to occur we use plastic containers because they're inert with the milk we wouldn't want to store it and say like a container that had a catalyst that would accelerate how it spoils things like that those are the answers that I'm looking for with this question all right for the second question if I have a reaction that is 10 minutes long and I want it to last longer do I need to speed it up or slow it down now if I speed it up it will last less time so I need to slow it down so what are some things that we could do to speed up the reaction for the second part of the question or slow down for the first question and so those answers should be on the previous slide which is right here and so we can just look at these if I want the reaction to go slower I need to do the opposite of all of these things I guess I could just go to this screen here so I would need to not use a reactant that is grounded finally I would not need to dilute the reaction maybe by adding water to it I would need to cool the reaction down and then I would not want to use a catalyst those four things would make the reaction go slower if I want to do it faster I would do the opposite which is all the things that are highlighted on the previous page I would grind up the reactants make them really fine I would concentrate them by removing water I could heat up the reaction I could add a catalyst okay that's catalysis and that's all that we're gonna do for that section so there's the whole cracked ice at the bottom I'll leave that on a set screen for just a few more seconds so you can write that out if you want it and then I am going to put the title card up where we will put the timer up which is hiding does it's down here here it is oops I need to reset that hold on reset timer oh and we got to put break time so there buddy knows all right start the clock start the music I'll see you in a bit [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's close enough oops I clicked the wrong thing alright so let's see where are we now how are on equilibrium okay so let's turn these Oh click here and let's talk about Librium eagle the rooms kind of a weird concept that a lot of first your students struggle to understand and what it is is the tendency for a reaction to reach a point where it makes so many products that the products then react and turn back into reactants and you eventually just don't have any more change in the amount that you have the reactions keep going but the amount that is there remains constant and in order to do that I actually need to set up something really quickly here so let me see here uh that's not what I want I want that's the one I want okay no it's not that what I want sorry hold on there we go Oh wants me to download it I already have it downloaded okay sorry we have out I ruined the chat hold on I'm trying to move the chat out of the way so I can get to my computer where the heck is this that shapes I don't want shapes I'll just download it again whatever phe t stop open oh hold on this job oh my goodness I hate everything normally I just double-click on this thing to make it work and I apologize that this isn't working give me a second let me just put this back on for a sec and I'll let you know when I have it working again so you're back [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you you [Music] you okay so I didn't get it working unfortunately because my computer doesn't like Java I mean that could be my doing I might have disabled Java but what I can do is so I want this window so we're talking about equilibrium and I wanted to describe equilibrium as a sort of process that eventually will go in both directions and so this is what that's not the right thing maybe I need to window capture is it no it's not that one well I'm just getting all the technical difficulties today that's the chat window cancel capture two there that's the one I want okay oops which is too small there we go okay so this is what I was trying to load this is a youtube video that I have paused here so you can see on the left side where it says a I have a bunch of green spheres and on the right side where it says B I have nothing drawn over that is what looks like an energy diagram and this up here is the activation energy now if I hit play all these balls are going to start bouncing around oh I guess apparently he made more and they were set up great he's gonna talk over this this is the problem with me not previewing my videos but no matter what setup I have here what will eventually happen is if you give it enough time the balls will bounce back and forth at the same speed and I'm trying to find a place where he actually shows that oh I gotta hit play there we go so if you had a setup like this and you left it running for 20 minutes and you came back you would notice that there's going to be the same number on both sides because they're eventually going to bounce over but they're gonna bounce back and forth at the same rate but if you were to change the elevation of these like say like this and then do the experiment like so they would still bounce back and forth but you would end up with more of them on the right and at some point the amount that would be on both sides would be different but they would remain roughly constant because they're going back and forth at the same speed there's just too many on the right that aren't able to get up over the hill and then the few that are over here do go up I don't know what this number sheet is going up this video isn't super useful to me I have to suspect it I will try and figure out why that demo isn't working on my computer and we'll run it tomorrow during the lab but now I've confused do all and wasted most of your time let's talk about equilibrium a apologies that didn't work out I was not expecting it to crash when I booted up all right so if I give you a reaction like this this would be a reaction that we've studied all quarter where I have reactants and products and here's some phases and whatever for this specific reaction if I were to analyze the mixture at the end of the reaction and I went looking for HCl and I went looking for h3o plus and I went looking for CL minus I would find that there is all all of the HCL that I put in there reacted completely and that's what you would expect for the reactions we've been talking about you put stuff in it reacts and then the reactants are gone but it turns out that that is actually the exception and not the rule for many reactions most reactions do something like this so on the Left we have acetic acid and water and you'll notice that instead of having the arrow pointing to the right it points in both directions now the reason being if I were to look at this reaction very closely and look for acetic acid which is right here or acetate and h3o plus I would find that most of it actually is still the acetic acid most of my stuff for this reaction is this form right here very little of it actually reacted but it's still reacts so we need to put this forward arrow it's just that in this case if these two things bump into each other the h3o and the acetate they can react to and they have a tendency to recombine this is different from the previous reaction on this slide right here were if these two bump into each other they just go huh and bunk off and they don't care so no reverse reaction occurs this doesn't happen so it all has to do with the tendency of the reactants and the products she wants to recombine and go back to what they started as and this also is a acted by an energy diagram so suppose I had an energy diagram where I had a really tiny activation energy and then my energy dropped by a lot going in this direction is easy but going in the reverse direction is really hard so this would be a reaction where like I have HCl over here and then I make h3o plus and Cl minus we're going in the reverse reaction is just too difficult but the reaction shown above could be something like this where the energies are actually relatively close to each other and there's not that much of a difference it's easy to go in this direction but it's also easy to go back and if it's easy to go backwards then I'm gonna start creating reactants again and the reactions gonna go back and forth this is the premise behind how equilibrium works equilibrium cannot occur if the reverse reaction is possible then you just have both reactions occurring it at once and you end up finding an end point where the reaction settles to somewhere in the reaction here it settles it only 0.5 percent of it reacts so we're gonna call any reaction that can go in both directions reversible a reversible reaction means that I can go in the normal direction that we've been writing all along or I could take the reactants and the products and have them switch places so I could take this guy and this guy and reverse them to get this reaction if both of these reactions occur then what I can do is write them both at the same time using a double arrow so the double arrow is important because it tells us hey the reaction goes in both directions reactants can turn into products but it's also possible that the products can turn into reactants and whenever that double arrow is there you should think oh I have an equilibrium situation I can make the reaction go in both directions now to be more specific about the definition of equilibrium not only do you have to have both the forward and reverse reactions occurring at the same time but you also have to have them happening at the same speed now I'm going to show you some graphs and attempt to explain that but if I had tons and tons of reactants I would make products very quickly but if I didn't have any products at the start I would not be able to produce products at all I'm trying to think of an analogy of this and my analogy would be something like if you are at a restaurant that is just opened and people are preparing food at that instant nobody is eating and so you are you are creating products which are finished food dishes I guess you would say but once the food starts coming out and people start eating it those products are they're not really turned back into reactants because you're not sending it back to the kitchen but the products are getting used up and so as the day goes on all of the food that you're making is being eaten up at the same speed but at the very start of the day you're making food faster than its being eaten because there just isn't any food out there yet to put that in a graph that would look something like let me just skip ahead here real quick that would look like this so for this specific reaction that I've got on the screen here I've got the white molecules and the purple molecules reacting to make a combo at the start I have lots of reactants but I have zero products so the reverse reaction cannot happen but as I go on and I start to make this stuff then I can start to turn it back into the reactants so if H I can return back into H - and I - I won't be using it up at this you start it I won't be using it up at a constant speed so that's what this line is relatively flat at the start means if I were just using up the h2 and the I to this is what would happen I would use them up at a constant speed eventually I would just run out of them and the reaction would stop and then I would just make this stuff at a constant speed and that would be as much as I could make because I ran out of stuff but as you can see the reverse reaction does not allow this to happen I don't just run out of i2 in H and H 2 instead the amount that I have kind of curves to this flat plateau at the start here I'm using up i2 quickly but over here I am using it up less quickly relative to the amount that I'm making it back and once I cross this dotted line right here I'm making it at the same speed that I use it once the reaction reaches the point where both the products are made at the same speed that they're used up to turn back into reactants we get this this is called dynamic equilibrium equilibrium needs you to have both reactions occurring at the same time so we have a double arrow but I have to make my reactants just as fast as I'm making products if I wasn't making them at the same speed this wouldn't be flat I would have either less or more of it depending on what was happening but if I'm making them at the same speed the amount that I have is relatively constant and so all of the concentrations become constant at equilibrium the reaction is still going or just not making anymore if I make 2 pies every hour and my customers eat 2 pie is every hour and I start with 5 pies out on display I could bring out two pies to replace two that are eaten but the number that will be out there will always be the same number they won't be the same but the amount that is on display for people to look at in the purchase will always be the same because I'm making them at the same speed that they're being eaten with molecules it's the same thing if I make a chai at a constant speed that I break it apart into these two things so let's say for every one of these that forms this one will then split apart the amount that I have is equal and so this is equilibrium so let me go back to this previous slide that I skipped over and those are our Chi qualifiers we need both of those two things to occur so both reactions have to occur forward and backwards and I also need the speed of the forward reaction to equal the speed of the reverse reaction if one is too fast I will accumulate stuff and use it the other one they have to be the exact same speed let's look at this visually I don't know why this one isn't animated let me see if I can fix that real quick oh I see why okay so if I do this so stuff is gonna appear really quickly so hold on and I want this to okay sorry just second okay that should work we'll see if it works all right here's our reaction at the start I haven't allowed the reaction just start yet because I haven't started the timer but initially in the container all we have are h2 which is the white one and i2 which is the purple one as I let the reaction progress some of the reactants form and I'm gonna highlight those with this just so you can see how many there are in there so after about 15 seconds I have four products that have made after a little bit more time goes by I will still keep making these but for every one of these that I produce I increase the likelihood that they will bonk into each other and then fall back apart into h2 and i2 and at some point there we go I'm gonna have the same amount in the container regardless of how much time passes so over in diagram C I highlighted eight of them and in diagram D I've highlighted eight of them as well so because my amount is staying constant somewhere in here I reached dynamic equilibrium so equilibrium happened around 30 seconds or so again well so here's the demo that I was trying to run so you can here's the link for it if you want to try this it requires Java and apparently I don't have Java enabled on my computer because I've banned it because it's a security issue but if you don't have that issue you could try looking at this link it will ask you to download a file then you could play with the equilibrium simulator and then you can see what we're trying to do here I'll see if I can do something about that tonight but if I can't then I'll just have to leave it all right so let's go to the next just our summary so this is everything we just said so equilibrium happens with all sorts of situations many reactions are in equilibrium and depending on the nature of the reaction you may or may not want that to happen for example if I am working in industry and I'm do a reaction to produce say ammonia ammonia is important because we use it for fertilizer but the reaction reaches equilibrium very quickly and I don't have many products I might not want the reaction to reach equilibrium because that means I'm stopping the production of things that I want so I would have to manipulate it other reactions we do want to go to equilibrium because we don't want the reaction to be occurring any more for example if we use vinegar vinegar is acetic acid and if it's not at equilibrium it would not be as acidic and it would not provide as much flavor so putting acetic acid into water it will quickly reach equilibrium makes it have the distinguishing taste that it has other more serious consequences would be things like your bodily functions if your body reaches equilibrium then reactions stop producing products such as like heat like if your body stop producing heat that be because you died so you don't want your body to reach equilibrium that would be bad so we keep providing it food so that the reaction keeps that produces energy keeps getting driven in the forward direction so equilibrium is not inherently bad it is a thing that exists and it's important for us to understand more or less what the conditions are to create that now equilibrium will eventually settle to some ratio like before I told you that 99.5% of acetic acid will stay whole in a container that has it in water and 0.5 percent of it will dissociate we're gonna relate the amounts of reactants and products that equilibrium settles by giving it a number and so the number is called the equilibrium constant K and I'm gonna put a scary formula on the board here if this is my reaction I have a and B reacting together to make C and D and C and D could react with each other to make a and B again this is the value of K and you're probably looking at that and going oh my god I don't want to do any more math this quarter I'm so sick of it and that's totally fine because we're not gonna calculate this we're instead do is interpret what it means here I have my products that's C and D on the bottom here I have my reactants that's a and B so what I'm instead gonna write this expression as is this products divided by reactants and that's gonna be close enough for approximation for K now let's suppose that I had a mixture that was 50-50 products and reactants there's the same amount of products as there are reactants and then you put in numbers for how much products and reactants you had so if I did oh I have 50 of these and 50 of these what would K be equal to 50 divided by 50 is just 1 right so if I enter numbers for these things and the numbers I enter are the same K is gonna be 1 because I have exactly the same amount of products and reactants what would happen if I had more products than reactants what would be the value of K would it be bigger or smaller than one you type that in the chat with your guests it doesn't even really have to be a guess because I'm sure that everybody knows how mathematics works here so if I had more products than reactants so like say 90 products and ten reactants what KB bigger or smaller than one it'd be bigger yeah because a bigger number on the top and the smaller number on the bottom means a bigger number so if K is a large number I must have mostly products what if K was a smaller number y must have mostly reactants so these next few slides are gonna show this as like a seesaw now unfortunately my y-axis has to be upside down to make these numbers work and so in order for this to work so numbers at the top here where's my cursor there it is numbers at the top will be very small numbers at the bottom will be very big if I have a 50/50 mixture where everything is equal the middle value will be a 1 so if I have equal amounts of reactants and products the equilibrium value or the value of the equilibrium constant is just 1 like we said before if I have all products and no reactants that would be like dividing a number by zero which is not actually a number but if you picked a really big number and then a really tiny number for the reactants you get a number that was essentially infinitely large so bigger numbers represent more products versus reactants all the way up to infinity where infinity would be the value of all products and zero reactants would be the equilibrium constant for that if I did the other direction and I had no products and only reactants I would have 0 divided by some number and that's just 0 so if I have only reactants my equilibrium constant is 0 so what that means is that if we look at our ranges here any number between oops I thought that was the pen any number between these would represent mostly reactants so if K is between I can't be equal to 0 I guess well I guess it could be if K is between 0 & 1 we have mostly reactants because that's how the math works so this is just gonna bug me somebody get rid of it and then if my K value is larger than 1 I have mostly products and that would be anywhere in this region down here now if K is equal to 1 then that's when we have the 50/50 mixture so your job is gonna be to look at a cave value and tell me about the reaction okay so for instance let's suppose that I had this reaction again and I told you K is equal to one point eight times 10 to the minus 5 that's this right here is that a big K a small K or a 1 K what do you think 1.8 times 10 to the -5 so bigger or smaller than 1 what is 10 to the -5 mean was it mean we have a negative exponent means a small key yeah I knew what you meant there you go yeah so if you have a number with a negative exponent remember that is a decimal that's a really tiny number so this number is very small which means that I have mostly reactants and if you remember before when I said that I have 99.5 percent acetic acid in here in the other amount of products is 0.5 I actually calculated that using that equilibrium expression and you can do that but I'm not gonna make you do that in this class because that's too much math I make third quarter chemistry students do this and they have a tough time so I'm not gonna make you guys do it all right and there's our summary against okay is between 0 & 1 mostly reactants K is bigger than 1 they're mostly products if K is close to 1 there's about the same products and reactants now what do I mean by close I mean like if it's a one digit number that's good enough or if it's like within point one that's fine so on this slide I have some examples for you and I want you to tell me where do their amounts of stuff lie in each of these reactions so here's a k for reaction one are there mostly reactants or products here's reaction 2 mostly reactants or products reaction 3 so maybe a few minutes do that because the class is about to end so highlight the side of the reaction where most of this stuff lives we'll go over the answer in just a second you alright let's go over the answers here so like we said before if K is big and this is a number larger than one we're gonna have mostly reproject saying the wrong thing but I'm highlighting everything this K is pretty close to 1 so you could just say it's in the middle you could also say oh maybe it's more towards reactants so either of those is okay I was intending for you to say it was about 50/50 this K is very small so there is definitely more reactants all right so that's how we describe the equilibrium constant in terms of a number and how we describe equilibrium in terms of out both reactions can happen and we're gonna eventually settle to some midpoint I'm sorry I couldn't get that demo to work again I'll look into it we'll see what I can do but that is all that we have time for today so I want to thank everybody for coming out to lecture tonight thanks for watching if you have any questions make sure to get them to me so we can talk about them tomorrow tomorrow is a lab lecture oops we're alright we're off the break here tomorrow's lab lecture I will talk to you a little bit about the solubility experiment which is mostly just hey watch all these videos and see how things dissolve in each of it shouldn't be too much of an issue then we're gonna talk more about this stuff and we'll continue our lecture probably start chapter 10 tomorrow so make sure that you are able to come out for that or watch this on the YouTube blog when you can have a great night make sure that you're prepping for exam or - and stay safe stay healthy stay home [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "Eeva7Gz8o2E": "okay the electrolysis has gone on very well and what I'm going to do at this point now it has filled the test tubes with with gases I'm going to turn off the power supply just press that switch I'm going to take my wires away from the power source you if you were doing this in the lab you would have been doing the very same thing that I'm doing here you kind of disassembled it get get rid of the electrical current flow first before you start touching things let's take these off the electrodes ah the electrodes are in solution I just have to take them out and rinse them off but what I really would like to test now is how much gas did I get remember this is the electrode that had can had come from the the red terminal okay and that should have a charge coming out of it could be plus or minus and then the other electrode on this side for this test tube it's coming out of the black terminal and that's a different charge coming out of that so let me lift the test tube just a little bit to get them off the clamps and do it this one too I'm just letting the test tubes not rest at the bottom let me get the clamps out of the way let's take out the electrodes I've kept the test tubes underwater because I want to capture the gases there and test them and I want to also compare how much gas is in each test tube and I'm going to bring the computer up a little closer so you can see here okay the test tube that had the red wire coming to it is where my finger is that's the volume of the gas we've trap the other test tubes a little further down and again my finger is pointing to it so the ratio of anumana gases is a little bit different and it's pretty close to what we would expect it to be experimentally there's a ratio of the the two volumes to one another now the next thing I want to do is I want to take the gases and test them and one of the ways that I can do that is with a splint or one of the aim of flame lighters so let me take the test tube that has the most gas in it put my finger on the bottom trap the gas so my fingers on the top light the aim and flame and bring it over to the top of the test tube and you heard that noise that tells me that the gas that was trapped in this test tube was hydrogen gas it pops it explodes a little bit okay for the second test tube what I'll do is I'm gonna get a wooden splint and I'm going to take the gas that's coming out of here and bring a wooden splint over to it and test it so let me put you on pause again for just a moment while I go get a bit of wooden splint and then we'll come back and test it for the second gas we tested already and had the evidence that there was hydrogen present there second gas vents were breaking down water this should be oxygen and so we'll test and see what happens when we put a glowing not a burning splint but a glowing splint in the test tube with that gas in it so let me retrieve the test tube and here you can see the liquid level is not as far down as the hydrogen test tube what I'll do is I'll try to get that gas once I flip it over to come to the top in the opening and we'll test the presence of oxygen gas so let's flip this over I'll put my finger on the top let me light a splint splendas burning let's pull out the splint and get it just the globe and we'll test it the gap the gas on the inside of the tube glowing splint good results try it again glowing splint and it barely read lights that first ignition you saw was the fact that the oxygen was present there I was able to take the glowing splint and it was not burning at that point that caused it to burst back into flame fuel oxidizer for the combination of the two so this was like a secondary test that we can do to approve what gases have been evolved you can also compare their volumes as we talked about how much is in the test tube so here's the experiment complete now on the electrolysis of water the idea is you take the water molecule and then you break it apart using electricity to break the covalent bonds and both of those worked very well now I'm going to turn off the video at this point move to another spot in the lab and we will finish up with a couple more quick experiments all of this again is found in your textbook from this reaction you can eventually find a chemical reaction for the breakdown of water write it down in your notebook balance the equation eventually you're going to show or submit an image of your notes to your teachers today thank you we'll be back okay for our next reaction we're over by one of the fume hoods in the lab and there's a reason why I'm here because one of the materials I'm going to be working with will probably produce a material that has an odor to it and it also is somewhat irritating to your lung so I want to be cautious with you and I the verse first experiment I'm gonna be doing also gives off material but it's not as harmful that's what we're going to test so the first reaction I'm going to do here in this sequence is to just simply show a reaction of combination and so I have a little tiny piece of magnesium ribbon here it's metal I'll bring it up a little closer to the camera so it's pretty small it's very thin I'm going to put it into a flame using a Bunsen burner and I just want to hold it here and I got a pair of tweezers to do that just so I got a good grip on it okay so here it is stuck on the tweezers now let's lie to our Bunsen burner and then we're going to take the magnesium and just put it in the edge of the blue cone and let it react so once I gave it enough energy to start its reaction it went all by itself it has reacted with oxygen in the air and formed a new compound which is kind of a white collar that new compound is magnesium oxide it's very fragile material if I were to touch it with my fingers it would probably break off let me try to do that I have a tray over here and let's see what happens if I touch it with my fingers at this point it's pretty cool it dropped off if I touch it with my fingers it now ends up being just a powdery white material and it actually has some uses the compound that I produced here has a use that helps neutralize acids and in a couple of applications actually actually it can neutralize acids it might be in your stomach and you can buy our product that is built on this reaction at the drugstore it's called milk of magnesia and when you buy a bottle of it if you pour it out into a spoon it is a white creamy liquid it looks like real thick water if a person had an upset stomach they could take that and in the compound that would be made from this would eventually neutralize some of the acid in their stomach in our final reaction which is set up here I'm going to be taking a ordinary soup can flipping it over to use as a little platform and what I'm going to just put some sulfur on this my sulfur is in the powdered form there there are ways that you can get it where some lumps but I got a little bit of sulfur here placing on top of the metal can the metal can is just a support to hold things in place and this way I don't have to mess up a piece of lab equipment I can just put the metal can through a recycling process when I'm finished now to get the reaction to occur here I'm going to use a Bunsen burner flame and I'm going to aim it at the top of the metal can where the sulfur is the sulfur that's here can combust so the reaction you're going to see is actually two types of reaction first of all it's going to be a combustion but secondly it's also going to be a composition reaction and the sulfur will combust or combine with the oxygen in the air and make our new product this is the one that has a smell that I'm not really favoring and it also has an effect on your lung so I'm going to turn on our fume hood it takes a couple of like about a minute to turn on and eventually what I'll do is I'll light up my Bunsen burner put it over top of the sulfur and try to catch it on fire and when I do that I'll lower the sash on the fume little butt so the air is coming and pulling the the burning compounds fumes away from us or away from me now let me take a second or two to react so let me put the video on pause once again so our sulfur is combustible here it is in the jar I'm going to take the jar and get it out of the way and then like there you can probably hear the sound of a thing jealousy to get the flame to go down on top of the sulfur but also in fact city first thing that happens is the sulfur starts to melt and you can see okay you see the white smoke is coming off soccer's actually earning job I have the burner off now I can see a slight blue flame here the sulfur I think I've learned most of it out at this point and the white smoke that's coming off is sulfur dioxide which very irritating to your lungs the can is looted cooler at the bottom children there's no smoke coming off at this point but we now have a residue from the melted sulfur on the top and the white smoke that you saw was the sulfur dioxide going off it's in a fume hood so this is an example of two reactions together combustion and a combination again you're going to try to look these up in your text you will be able to find it in the text material right there chemical reactions to balance the equation so that wraps up our experiments for today and hopefully this has helped that you see real situations and what you can do with equations at home you can put the items people worship to one another good good to be with you and show you this I'll stop your disappointment and actually you'll see this website you", "X3ziP9JrlQk": "[Music] [Applause] warning what you are about to watch may make you question everything you thought you know viewer discretion is advised hey what's up you guys welcome back now today we're gonna be talking about a lot of different types of conspiracy theories we're gonna be talking about cardi B and some possible connections to NPM and we're even gonna be going out into the world and exploring a conspiracy involving one of my favorite places ever target now before we get started I just have to mention that all of these are theories none of them are facts and they're not meant to hurt any company or a person alright let's get started now I know you're thinking Shane how is there a conspiracy theory about mattress stores well I'm gonna let you know that this is one of the most convincing theories I have ever heard and this is also why how to do that legal statement at the beginning of this video now if you look around your city you've probably noticed how many mattress stores there are when you go to Google and you type in why are there one of the first results is so many mattress stores and you've probably noticed when you walk by them there's nobody inside now one of the mattress stores that you see most frequently is called mattress Verne well just check out this theory that was posted on Reddit mattress firm is some sort of giant money-laundering scheme they are [ __ ] everywhere and always empty I remember seeing for mattress firms all on each corner of an intersection once there is no way there's such a demand for mattresses and then they posted a Google Maps link and it was insane yeah twenty results for mattress firms all in the same location some of them are literally across the street from each other now the way I found out about this conspiracy was actually through my cameraman and friend Andrew he told me a couple years ago he was visiting his hometown and he noticed that there were three mattress firms on the same street so I decided to pull up Google Maps and check it out myself all right Mattress Firm near Algonquin boom three on the same street now just to show you how close they are to each other let's look at the satellite view all right here's the first door now we're just gonna go up the street two clicks and then two there's the second one I mean that's crazy and he's not the only person that has noticed this there are tons of videos of people driving around their city showing how close and how many mattress firms there are I need a mattress there's a store I need a mattress there's a nother store it's a good day to buy a mattress so I got mattress stores everywhere to choose from I need a mattress hey it's another store now the reddit theory said that mattress stores might actually be laundering money and that's why there's so many of them all right so first let's talk about money laundering and what that means so if you get money through doing illegal things like selling drugs or guns or terrorism or prostituting you make a lot of money that you don't want traced you don't want the cops to find out what you're doing you don't want to get taxed on it so you have to find a way to hide the money and sometimes you can do that by buying a business for example years ago Al Capone one of the biggest gangsters of all time decided to put all of his illegal money he made into laundromats now laundromats are a cash flow business right people come in they pay with cash they give their quarters they do their laundry they leave well that way he could say oh wow we got $10,000 today from people doing their laundry let's put that in the books okay great when in reality no they probably made $1,000 and that is where the name of laundering came from from the word laundry pass so the theory is that mattress stores might be the new laundrymat think about it this way you only buy mattresses once every 7 to 10 years so why are there more mattress stores on one street than there are grocery stores or Starbucks there is another mattress firm I kid you not there is two mattress firms in the same basic complex folks also there's no customers ever inside of the stores because the stores aren't real they're just a cover-up once again just a theory not a fact don't sue me now when people are laundering money in banks they usually separated to $10,000 chunks and then they'll put it in a bunch of different banks so when you think about the mattress stores it would kind of make sense why there was three on the same street because maybe they're all owned by the same person and he's spreading his money out 3 different ways so he doesn't look so suspicious oh and just a side note another way to hide money that you've gotten illegally is by hiding it in different places in your house well guess what the number-one place to hide money is mattresses I'm just saying it's a weird coincidence but now that you know this I bet when you drive around your city you'll notice the crazy amount of mattress doors and the crazy amount of no customers in sight of them another mattress firm what is going on it's an infestation car DB has blown up this year she's become one of the most famous people in the world and it happened very fast her hit song boat at yellow only came out in June of last year but she's already nominated for Grammys on every single magazine cover and one of the most famous rappers ever now this clip I'm going to show you I didn't take seriously at all but the more I watched it the more weird it seemed this is her being interviewed on a red carpet and then this happens Finnick being so nervous a little bit over well after little shaky oh no no zombie no nobody's good it's good it's good it's good you're gonna get it look great weird right like maybe she was just joking or something but isn't it weird that she went to that hypnotic trance and then when she came out of it she didn't even reference it like she didn't laugh or say like haha sorry that was a joke just watch it again it's weird right like the more you watch it the more you're like but now this got a lot of people saying that there might be some ties with her you know Minotti or maybe she's under mind control I mean she did become extremely famous very fast which the Illuminati attends to be able to make happen well first there's a video of her from before she got really famous where she said this I know my family I'm an Illuminati which one of my cousin you want for that did he well then she posted a video on her Instagram where she was doing the devil horn with her hand [Music] and then there's tons of other pictures out there of her doing the devil horn or her doing the 666 by her eye in this video she's singing something in Spanish and you can clearly hear her say the word witch mckinnon bad I don't know why okay Mucha mckinnon bad pero no way okay Nadine and again Michael Illuminati well that was on March 10th 2016 and then one year later in June of 2017 Oh Dec yellow came out and became one of the biggest hits of all time now cardi has talked about the Illuminati a lot throughout her career but Illuminati but one thing she said during a live stream was pretty scary if something happened to me just note that the government try to kill me because I believe that America be trying to kill you she basically said that when her parents turned 60 she's gonna move them out of the US and send them to the Dominican Republic I want to move my parents out of America like let me tell you something like my grandmother for my mother's death sigh she died when she was 75 because she used to live here in America if you go to the island country people be a hundred and five years old a hundred and some six years old so she's basically saying that the u.s. is trying to kill you sooner now her reasoning is the food industry she thinks that organic food is a Jill how to lettuce and how to fruits last so long out here how how does a travel from places to places and last so long I don't give a [ __ ] if they say that the chicken and the food is organic I don't believe it's organic like I don't believe nothing here is organic I feel like they trying to kill you I mean she's not wrong the amount of preservatives that we're getting on our food the amount of chemicals that they're putting in the air right over our heads it's not a surprise that people in the US die sooner than people outside so like my grandmother was she was diabetic right like they used to go for 10 to 12 pills a day how is that normal so that's why I feel like this country just just they be wanting to kill people so many things that I just don't be understand and I'm and I'm realizing he now I got this email from a viewer named Julie she said what if these famous people aren't cloned but they're hypnotized I mean the Illuminati could completely control what they said and did and then she went on to talk about the movie get out we're all those people in the movie were being hypnotized and controlled and they'd have moments of snapping out of it the chores have become my sanctuary who's controlling it well if you look back at that clip of her on the red carpet you look behind her you see two women and a man who are not looking that way but when she starts to glitch look over and then card he comes back to normal it's weird I mean listen I don't know who those people are they might not even know her but it's not that crazy to think about the fact that there might be somebody around a celebrity at all times to keep them in they're hypnotized zone I mean celebrities always have an assistant and an agent and a chauffeur what if the purpose for that Posse is to keep them under hypnosis then what if one of the celebrities goes rogue and they break out of their hypnosis and they've been so long being a puppet that they don't even know who they are anymore and then they act out and if you think about it that seems to happen quite a lot especially two extremely famous musicians and all of a sudden Britney Spears came in and said in my turn said I want to shave my hair off she had no emotions in her face so the way I found out about this theory was super random one morning I was watching a youtuber named Alicia Marie and she was vlogging her day and then this happened duh-duh-dunnnnn 12:13 p.m. guys I really need to change my background it's still Christmas themed sweet oh my god wait do you see that what is that is someone recording me wait on camera you see that like blinking thing I don't see that in person at all what yeah weird right I had never heard of anybody saying that they noticed the blinking red light on their phone well then after that I started looking into it and it's like more than iPhone Nexus now of course the theory is that that light means that it is recording you at all times but then some people are saying no no that's just the face idea and it's always on because it's looking for your face and that makes sense it does look to be making a cylinder shape around your face and it's not just one way this is what it looks like in the dark when you use your face idea thousands of little dots going all around you coming from that one little light okay so theories over right it's just the base ID light but then I saw this so this is the iPhone and I'm guessing you guys thought that they're flashing red light up there it has to be the camera huh like that doesn't make any sense the iPhone 7 does not have a face ID why is there still the red blinking light that's hidden I mean we pretty much already know that our iPhone is recording everything we're saying do you record and store everything I say and texts on my phone I'm sorry but who would have thought it would be recording everything it seems so of course they started having a full mental breakdown and panic attack and then I saw a user on reddit say this that's the proximity sensor it's how the phone knows you're holding it up to your face when you're on a phone call so it can black out the screen and prevent your cheek from pressing buttons it uses infrared which is the reason your camera can see it but your eyes can't and then they went on to say that you can also see this blinking red light in your remote controls you can't see a middle life but you can only see it with phones cameras which makes a lot of sense because your remote control is based on a sensory so this theory might not be true but I still believe that my phone is recording everything I'm saying and doing after what Apple did with admitting that they purposely slow down our old phones I don't trust in anything Suri would you lie to me I'd rather not say now we have talked about 9/11 conspiracy theories before 9/11 theories are what got me into conspiracies oh and it's not just me a huge percentage of the population believes these theories too I mean even President Bush has slipped up a few times and almost said the word conspiracy himself mr. president I would do want to get right to the news of the terrorism in Boston well at first you know I was deeply concerned that there might have been a organized plot this could have been you know another organized highly organized attack on the country like why would he even think to say that word you know another conservative now one of the biggest theories is that it wasn't just planes flying into the buildings that there was bombs planted as well but of course the government said no no it was just the two terrorists in the planes but some people think that Bush and the government actually coordinated it themselves and that there were bombs placed in the building beforehand because they wanted both buildings to come down the building has collapsed that tower just came down now of course the theory is that the government created this awful disaster so that we would be okay with going to war with Afghanistan but today we're gonna be focusing on the boss the day that 9/11 happened everybody was saying that they heard the ladies that are with me were in the World Trade Center on the on in the first building and escaped through the lobby where they report they believed there was a bomb in the lobby and as we were coming out we passed the lobby didn't see no Lobby but I believe that the bomb hit the lobby first even firemen set it even Donald Trump who had a lot of power in New York at the time said he thought it was bombs I happen to think that they had not only a plane but they had bombs that exploded almost simultaneously now this is where it gets crazy one of the survivors from 9/11 was a janitor at the World Trade Center his name was William Rodriguez and he had worked there for twenty years now he came out and said that he'd heard bombs before the plane even hit I believe that censorship started from the very beginning because when I was telling my story they told me I'll cut this out cut this out it was the first hijacked plane no hello that was an explosion before 9/11 before the plane hit the tower now in 2004 that powers in charge came out and said that there were no bombs well just listen to this audio clip and tell me that you don't hear a bomb going off before the building's collapse come on that's a bomb you could see explosions coming out of the sides of the buildings but of course the government says no now this is where it gets really crazy but somehow seems believable some people believe there were no planes at all and that it was just bombs and that all the clips that we saw in the news of planes flying into the towers or CGI I know it's crazy but just look at some of these videos the airplane did disappear like a bad special effect exactly like a bad special effect a good special effect would have parts exploding and bouncing off and tumbling to the streets below first let's look at this clip of what people are calling ghost plane the plane appears to pass through steel columns and the steel and concrete floors like a ghost it doesn't twist Bend slowdown break or explode now this plane goes right through the building like a knife through butter and I know what you're thinking Shane yeah it's a plane going really fast of course it'll go right there well years before this happened the government was testing to see what would happen if they flew a plane into a big metal wall and it was at the speed of which a normal plane flies and this happened it's doing 500 miles an hour it just disappeared into dust the plane disintegrated disappeared but then when it hit the World Trade Center it went right through no issues but how could a plane even a point even a 767 or 747 or whatever I buy the bit how could it possibly go through this now look at this angle you'll see the plane flying through the building and then you'll see the nose of the plane come out the other side okay you saw that right the big nose of the plane come right through the other side completely in one side and out the other it's physically impossible for the nose of a Boeing 767 airplane to emerge intact well after the smoke cleared it was seen that there was no exit hole that's right no exit hole where the nose of the plane supposedly went right through it nothing and that's why a lot of people think that it might have been CGI and this is the other weird part in most of the clips that are online it goes black for a split second right when the plane hits well this person took all of the news clips and sync them together at the same time and this happened yeah all of them black for a split second not to mention that on some news channels you didn't even see a plane you just saw the moment of the explosion right afterward and the one second that would show the fate of Pinocchio's nose has been edited out why would the now day brothers remove that little piece of video it didn't show the moment of the plane actually hitting it like would go somewhere else or it would cut off or something maybe that's because there was no planes and it was just bombs not to mention another clip that was circulating that was on the news where you can literally see one of the wee of the plains disappear [Music] just disappear glitch now listen I don't know if I believe the theory that all the planes on the news were just CGI - that seems a little far-fetched but I definitely believe there were bombs I mean come on so who are you gonna please the government who lies to you about everything or people who are literally there okay this is my favorite theory of all time and I a hundred percent believe in it have you ever been into a store and you tried on an outfit and you looked in the dressing room mirror and you thought wow I look great I'll buy it and then you took it home and you put it on you said ooh yeah that might have to do with the mirrors in the dressing rooms now on the show shark tank there was a company called skinny mirror and if you go to their website it says this the skinny mirror off errs a subtle and believable slimming reflection 5 to 10 pounds and then they show comparison pictures of what you look like versus what you look like in the skinny mirror oh and by the way there his slogan is you are beautiful what they also have a section on their website where retail stores can buy mirrors from them the skinny mare is an ideal solution for dressing rooms the subtle yet believable slimming reflection will improve the attitude of your customers self-image body image increasing overall sales so that's not even a theory some stores might possibly have them but here's where my theory comes in I love Target I buy everything from Target but I look so much better in target dressing room ears and it makes me buy clothes and then I take them home and I hate the way they look so I want to go to Target and investigate and see if they're using and skinny mirrors okay yeah so we're in the car on our way to target you have no idea what we're doing right no no I thought we were going to talk about we'll do that after touch it we also have in the back seat Rylands sister Morgan how do you feel good well we're gonna go in the dressing room and take pictures in our clothes and I go back home and take pictures of the normal mirror all right believable slimming reflections designed to help you feel good about your body [Music] ah let's do my least favorite thing in the world let's go look at some mirrors there it is oh my god me when I see the fitting room just never tell like I'm trying on this this is a plus-sized Karl shirt no obviously we're not even taking the picture here I can tell you that I am NOT this then oh my god [Music] ooh I need to take it at the same exact well that I'm gonna take it okay so right here so when it I was afraid you want to take one - you're gonna do like a psycho - oh yeah take one in this nightmare - oh this worse let me just see if I can I can't tell alright let's go home and take the same pictures and see if we look fatter all right you ready to go to the mirror alright let's go to the one upstairs maybe can you have this straight oh my god that's crazy it's like in the arms it's like that's the trigger oh my god my legs look so much smaller in the target one it is drastically different ever like if we zoom in movie shirt now listen this could be like a lighting situation yeah either they have bomb lighting or skinny-ass mirrors alright here's the next one my legs look so much smaller in the target wanna alright now let's do you you ready oh my god liking this one oh boy would be like yes and this one would be like oh my god Viper's is real life okay so let's go to the other one oh my gosh I look like I could have like a thigh gap in this one it's not like so drastic that it's insane he's 5 to 10 pounds that's what the skinny mirrors say 5 to 10 pounds I don't think target says they use skinny mirrors because I think legally they have to was the objects in mirror seems smaller than them here social media oh well mystery solved but still just a theory not a fact don't see any target I love you okay bye yeah the tide pot challenge something that has been going so viral lately and I just didn't know why many are looking to become what's called YouTube famous but a local doctor says this could cost you your life now this became such a huge story that tide even put out a bunch of statements on Twitter about it and they even made a PSA saying don't eat iPods the tie pot challenge was everywhere you would think that hundreds and thousands of people were dying every day for meeting Tide Pods but then when you actually look at it the numbers have gone down and you can see in 2017 there were 12,000 calls that's down a thousand from the year before that also to put in perspective over 20,000 people called because they accidentally ingested hand sanitizer 17,000 people called because they ingested too much toothpaste and 16,000 people called because they ate too much deodorant so in the grand scheme of things people eating Tide Pods isn't as crazy and widespread as the news is making it but Tide Pods sales have actually gone up the more people talking about Tide Pods the more people behind them so what if Tide hired a marketing campaign get our name out there more to teenagers and the marketing team said ooh teenagers love youtube they love challenges what if we created the tide pot challenge obviously nobody would really do it but it could become like a meme teenagers love memes and if that happened it worked I haven't thought about type odds at all ever and now it's literally in my brain I hear the word tide pot five million times a day but the even bigger theory is one of the most [ __ ] up things I have ever heard and definitely the most [ __ ] up theory I have ever said on my channel so if you've ever been to the dollar store you've probably seen a bottle for fabuloso and if you look at it it looks just like juice or Gatorade but it's not it's cleaner but a lot of people have mistaken it for juice and it's ended very bad ways now it's a reasonable mistake to make especially when some stores are putting it next to juice yeah that's literally fabuloso the cleaner right next to juice and this isn't the only toxic thing in stores that looks edible look at this picture a floor cleaner looks like a bottle of lemonade or this window cleaner that literally looks like a bottle of blue soda and then this one yep looks just like juice there's even this product for your hair that literally says whipped cream or this cleaner that is called lemonade or this picture of insects brain or this picture or these energy shots that are not energy shots and this is the craziest one this is hair bleach that's hair bleach it looks like cereal for kids and that's where the conspiracy comes in overpopulation is a huge problem maybe it's all just an extreme form of population control thousands of people every year dying from accidentally ingesting things they shouldn't nobody can get sued because right on the box it says do not ingest even though the bottle looks like children's juice and it's not just food there's other little things out in the world that if you're not observant enough you could die from why else would this hand sanitizer be installed here or why would this water fountain be right next to an outlet I don't know maybe the type out challenge is a challenge maybe it's a challenge for the government and maybe if you fail it they didn't want you here I believe that America be trying to kill you well there you guys go hopefully you enjoyed these conspiracy theories let me know down in the comments which ones you believe and also what other ones do you want me to talk about

"all right so now we're on to physical properties and physical changes chemical properties and chemical changes physical properties are quality or condition of a substance that can be observed or measured without changing the substances composition for example there's hardness color conductivity and malleability and there's a whole bunch more you can measure these without changing it like I can scratch my fingernail with a with a with a nail or a paper clip for example my fingernail is not very hard it's soft the paper clip being a metal is much harder so it's going to scratch it the hardest material known is typically called carbon or diamond I should say but it's actually not it might not be anymore it's it might be a new form of carbon called graphene but that's neither here nor there but we can when you scratch your finger now if you test it it it's you're not changing the fingernail it's still a finger now so that's a physical test my pencil on my desk over here is blue that is a physical property of it by observing its color blue I measured in a sense a qualitative property of it but it didn't change anything about it by recognizing that it is blue if you measure the connectivity of a salt solution how much electricity does it conduct per unit of time it's not gonna change what's in there it's just basically are there electrons moving or not malleability is the ability of a metal usually to be hammered into shape like you can take a gold bar and you could hammer it down if you take a gold bar and hammer it down you can get it to the it's about three atoms thick in it so you've got this gold foil and interestingly enough that singular gold bar if you do that can fill up an entire football field so that's malleability this is why people who win gold medals in Olympics always bite the their gold medals to test whether it's really gold or not because fool's gold doesn't do that it's not as malleable but in reality it's kind of a lie because gold medals are only like ten percent gold and ninety percent so er they're it's really just a coating of gold on the outside and all jewelry is just a coating of gold on the outside with something else internal even if it's 24 karat gold that's really only 24 karat 14 karat those things are only talking about that atom or too thick layer of the gold atoms how pure is that and then inside of it's everything else gold is so incredibly dense that if somebody had a real gold earring on their ear it would just it would weigh it down and stretch it out like you you know some people have really really heavy earrings that do that but normally what you buy at a reasonable price is just one atom thick other properties magnetization density boiling point melting point solubility these are things that you can measure without changing them you might think that boiling a sample of water would be a chemical change but if it's liquid water or if it's steam it's still water so that is a physical change that's been made to the water there for measuring the temperature at which it does boil is a physical property physical changes or changes made to a substance that do not change the chemical composition of the substance and there's a couple of examples in there water boiling form water vapor or steam copper is drawn into thin copper wires that is a property called ductility just similar to malleability but you're basically you can form a duct out of it but they literally just squeeze copper through a tube to get the copper wire sugar dissolving in water or salt dissolving in water that's a physical change how much of it can dissolve in water is a physical property solubility and then paper cutting it into tiny pieces to form confetti it's still the the confetti pieces are still paper so that's only a physical change now chemical properties and chemical changes obviously have to be the opposite of physical properties and changes because if a physical change is not changing the composition chemically the chemical change obviously has to chemically change the composition of the substance chemical properties or properties of a substance that describe the ability of it to change into a new substance these properties usually are very specific for example iron can rust you you know it rusts but that's really not enough because iron doesn't always rust and other things can rust but the conditions are very important you could say iron will rust in the presence of water and oxygen at the appropriate temperature I didn't even write that in there but it has to be of a certain temperature as well so does iron rust in the presence of water and oxygen and let's say 80 degrees Fahrenheit yes does iron rust in the presence of water and oxygen at zero Kelvin no is it going to rust in the presence of water but not in the presence of oxygen no and so on and so forth it does aluminum rust yes but in the presence of oxygen and water so it's not only iron that rusts pretty much all metals can rust if I take a piece of carbon and I throw it into water look at Mike let's say charcoal or pencil what is it going to explode no because that is not a chemical property of carbon if I take a chunk of sodium and I throw it into water it might explode it will certainly catch fire but it might explode because it will react with water and I could go into specifics of how that happens and maybe I will when we get to those chapters of chemical reactions but you would say sodium reacts with water to form sodium hydroxide and hydrogen gas that is a chemical property of sodium we can determine that a chemical change has occurred based upon changes in color changes in state so like we could form a solid out of two liquids we can form a gas out of two liquids or two solids even we could see light being given off like a glow stick as a chemical reaction you see the light being given off the reaction can absorb or release heat meaning it can get hot like a fire is giving off heat feels warmth but other reactions feel cold because they're going to suck in heat to them cold pack works that way it has ammonium hydroxide in there and water they add their react with each other and they suck heat in what is called an endothermic reaction the heat is being sucked out of your hands if you're using it on your hands since the heat is being sucked out of your hands your hands feel colder and also the production of electricity can also indicate a chemical change has occurred this table here kind of just shows you the comparisons between physical properties and chemical properties and physical changes versus chemical changes you can see here some of the terms the key terms at the end of the chapter in the book that we've covered today chemical changes chemical properties compounds elements gas liquid matter mixtures physical changes physical properties pure substances solids and states of matter and here are all the problems in the book that I would like you to do again they're not mandatory anything but this is for the whole chapter so I haven't covered it all yet but these problems would cover anything in the whole chapter definitely something you should do before your test is to look at that it's only five problems but it's ideas that combine or they're problems that combine ideas from the first three chapters which is what your first test is going to be over so take a look at that", "UvVG3hn0gTc": "so ever upwards has arrived and one of the most sought-after parts of it is the backpack in this video I'll tell you how to unlock for craftable backpack give some tips for completing the challenges and also show you how to earn mods for it to start off you'll need to go to camp Louis in the toxic valley and talk to the mr. handy Scout leader who's there talking to them we'll start off the order of a tadpole quest completing this quest will reward you with a backpack as well as the plans to craft them problem is but it's a really tricky quest to complete and will take you a while let's start with the easy stuff the kindness helpfulness and bravery objectives first up kindness revive an ally this is by far the easiest one just team up with someone each of you goes down once and then revive the other you've both got that objective done if you're struggling to go down in combat you can always jump off of a cliff instead to go down next is helpfulness clean up kitty-corner cabins fast trouble over to this location and talk to the Scout leader there he'll set you up with a repeatable quest operation tidy this is a fairly straightforward mission where you pick up toxic waste and put it in a barrel it's nice and easy to complete and will take off for helpfulness challenge as well as giving its own rewards in a similar frame you'll also need to travel to Dolly Sods mmoyer and talk to the Scout leader there they'll set you up with a repeatable quest called stings and things requiring you to gather insect parts the quests will give you markers of where to go to collect the parts so it's fairly straightforward the only real tip to give here is to remind you not to accidentally cook or scrap any of the bits you gather if you scrap all during this quest you can lose items essential to the quest and have to regather them once all these parts are done you're on to the final and hardest part growth earn free scout world badges if you check in the world section of a challenge menu you'll find a bunch of new challenges listed as tadpole in order to complete this stage of a quest you need to take off three of those challenges each of these challenges has multiple parts however and some of them are really tricky in this video I'll be focusing on the four of a challenges the ones ever I found are easiest and quickest to complete these are Archer a fleet hunter and mammalogists regardless of which challenges you decide to complete the first stage is going to be the same for everyone each of these challenges require you to pass a knowledge exam on the subject to do this you can head over to camp Adams a location in the forest a short ways northeast of the nuka-cola plants in this location is a terminal with the option tadpole exams selecting this will give you a list of each of the challenges and provide a quiz for each of them the quiz consists of five different questions chosen from a much larger potential pool what this means is that the questions will change each time you retrieve a test to complete the test you need to answer five out of five correctly but you can retry as many times as you want in order to complete these tests I recommend using combination of friends and Google some of the questions are really quite challenging and will test a variety of different subjects including American history computer code and how to trap a black bear I've yet to see a full cheat sheet for this but if anybody does find one feel free to leave it in the comments below personally I would recommend trying to complete all of the tests water at the camp as they are required for each of a different badges your were you wanting later after completing the test you can get on with the more physical side of things and focus on the other challenges to begin let's start with Archer as this is a really straightforward one first things first you'll need a crossbow barrese one that can be found at the palace of a winding path but hopefully you can even craft one already have one stashed away once you have a crossbow head back to camp Lewis and head slightly uphill to this archery test range activate the speaker box and it will instruct you to land a bull's-eye on each of the targets within 90 seconds this is relatively easy to do just pay attention to where your shots land and adjust accordingly the other challenges are even more straightforward than this one craft 50 crossbow bolts repair a crossbow free times and kill 50 enemies with a crossbow user crossbow as your main weapon for a while and this will easy to complete if you want to give yourself an easy time of things just stick to low-level areas and repaired crossbow whenever you come across a weapons workbench next up we have the athlete challenge first two parts of this are to have strength and agility at five or higher for me I have this auto-completed as my stats but naturally however miss if your stats are lower than you can raise remove consumables strength I'd say is the easiest to raise as more at chunks deathclaw stake and buff out all raised fists at as for agility you can eat crispy squirrel bits mile irks softshell cake or charred scorched B sliver keep in mind you can also stack these items together if need be once this is done you have a trio of athletic courses to run through these are located at sunny top ski lanes camp venture a new river gorge bridge at each of these locations you're looking for yellow flags and a speaker box interact with this listen to the instructions and then run the course if you don't complete the course quickly enough first time around you can head back to the box and rerun it until you complete it quickly enough there will be traps and enemies along the course often making the second run much easier as you don't have to deal with them springing out at you once you've completed that one you can try your hand at hunter this will require you to kill various beasts with specific weapons the most important part here is just to make sure you have all the required weapons in order to kill the enemies with the correct weapon when you come across them the hardest challenge in here is to kill a Yahweh with a syringe er however this can be made much easier by weakening the bear with conventional weaponry and then just landing the last few shots with the syringe er ideally with a bleed-out barrel the final challenge I'll be going over is mammalogist the majority of his challenge is to take pictures of various animals in order to do this you will need to have unlocked the new camera that was introduced a couple of weeks ago if you have lost your camera then broken ones can be found in red toolboxes and repaired at a tinkerers workbench once you've got your camera ready head out and start taking pictures of the various creatures listed these are mostly passive creatures but can be found in the forest locations to look for them include flat woods Springs and hell Vasia the creature I struggled most with getting a picture of was a cat but fortunately there's a guaranteed spawn of one head to this location and me a sheep and you'll find a merggle a cat's who is more than happy to be photographed as a sidenote for this challenge the animals don't need to be alive to register as taking pictures for them and quite often it's easier to kill the animals and then snap a shot of them additionally for the challenge you'll need to milk a Brahmin ten times a lot of them can be found at flatwoods and you can also often find them at people's camps if you want the fastest way to get this done though then build your own fertilizer producer not for Brahmin kill it prepare the item and repeat until the challenge is completed to complete the order of a tadpole quest you only need to complete three of these challenges so you can skip over whichever one of these you find the hardest and you'll still unlock the backpack once you've got the required number of challenges completed head over to any of the previously encounter Scout leaders and report back into them once this is done you'll be rewarded with a tadpole backpack as well as the knowledge to craft your own backpacks a standard level 51 races carry capacity by 60 points making it a really desirable item to gather if you want to improve this item further you'll need to purchase plans from the Pioneer vending machines over at Camp Lewis these require badges which are earned from the challenges we listed earlier what this means is that you'll need to complete even more of the challenges in order to improve the backpack and that's quite the daunting challenge fortunately there's a whole bunch of new challenges added now what listed as Possum challenges to go along with your new rank these provide even more opportunities to unlock badges and a little more flexibility in what you can do once you reach this point my best advice would be to take it slow and just try and complete these challenges as naturally as you can this whole endeavor is quite time-consuming so don't worry about rushing it a lot of the challenges listed in all of these different things are just stuff you'll get done naturally as you play so if you're not fussed about rushing to get the backpack and all of the improvements to it just keep playing the game you'll find you'll naturally tick off most of the stuff then you can just focus on the last couple of bits you need to complete and that is going to be it for the video quite the lengthy one as this really is one hell of a challenge once you have the backpack though it's easy to craft extras so you could always start up a backpack shop selling basic rock sacks of a new player vending I'm certain people would be willing to pay a lot for them if this video was helpful to you leave a like feel free to comment with any questions and subscribe to the channel for more fallout 76 content as always thanks for watching Sargent", "ewQcwztiX5Y": "so today the topic is bond types bond types is the first topic we'll get to a couple of other topics so first of all we need to define what a chemical bond is so a chemical bond is when a molecule is formed between two or more atoms okay so two or more atoms two or more atoms connect through electromagnetic and i'm just going to abbreviate that electro oh my goodness what's going on electromagnetic forces wow that o is really low forces to make molecules okay so when two or more atoms come together and they are bonded together through electromagnetic forces they make a molecule is a chemical bond so remember when we talked about physical changes versus chemical changes a couple weeks ago chemical changes are when things bond together when things are changing in the chemical state they are either bonding together between atoms or they are breaking apart okay i know that is really hard to look at sorry electromagnetic electromagnetic we're going to talk about that we talked about ions a bit and you'll see how electricity and electromagnetic forces and so forth are connected to all of this questions on what a chemical bond is so far pretty straightforward it has to do with the electrons and spoiler alert everything has to do with the electrons okay i'm gonna move on here if you need to check this out again of course just go back and watch the video okay so there are two major types two major types of bonds first we we should talk about well first of all before i get there does anyone does anyone know two different types of bonds something that you may have heard about before but on sixth grade my science teachers i don't even know chemicals there's two different ones yeah with chemical bonds the two major types are covalent and another one which we'll talk about in just a second covalent bonds covalent bonds so a covalent bond is when the atoms share electrons i'm going to do the the classic parenthesis s because it can be just an electron or it can be multiple electrons from their valence shells yes and we're going to get to that that that they they cross plays noble gases and and the reason why they're doing this so covalent that makes sense right co meaning together valent meaning valence cells so they're sharing electrons from their valence shells before we get to the other type and i apologize that i have to stand right here it kind of blocks vision but if i don't stand here then people on the video can't hear me um before we get to the other type of bond let's look at some examples of covalent bonding okay let's look at a couple of examples of problem bonding so i want you to look at your periodic tables pull those out or pulling up on good old ptable.com okay i want you to look at oxygen so if you have the those laminated army ones um you'll see numbers in the top corner like this if you have one of the fold out ones the white fold out ones you'll see something in this top corner but it won't look exactly like this those actually represent the same thing they're called the the electron configuration so when you look at oxygen you see this two and then this six okay now look now let's look at chlorine shall we 2 8 7. if we look at antimony 2 8 18 18 5. does anyone have any guesses as to what these numbers represent the numbers in this top corner that is related to the shells yes these are the electrons in each shell and remember that in the valence shell every atom wants to have eight in its final shell yes yeah so antimony has five electron shells and its final shell which is its valence shell right it has five it wants eight so does oxygen oxygen has a shell with two and a shell with six okay so when we look at oxygen we look at oxygen it has six valence electrons six valence electrons okay how many electrons does it want to have in its valence shell it wants eight the number of electrons in each shell eight this is the happy golden number why is it that why is eight the number okay so i'm not going to get into this because this has to do with quantum chemistry and this is not only above what this class needs to cover it's right at the edge of the most advanced chemistry class that i took in college so i don't want to go there it's it's way beyond what we need to cover what i want you to know is is that every electron every atom wants to have eight valence electrons and i i don't expect you to know why i just expect you to know that that is the case okay so eight it wants eight so we we're breathing in and out yes what is what is the atmosphere that we breathe primarily made out of there's a couple of things that it's made out of nitrogen about 80 nitrogen and then it's about 19 or so percent oxygen so it's it's right around oxygen and nitrogen make up about 99 of the atmosphere that we breathe combined both of those are called diatomic molecule which i'll explain what that means at a different time but the oxygen that we breathe is not just a single oxygen atom it is o two all right in a chemical formula and we'll talk about this in in much greater detail later in a chemical formula you have the atomic symbol and then you have the number of atoms which is shown here so o2 meaning there there are two oxygens okay well the two oxygens both have six electrons they want eight six electrons in their in their outer shell right their valence shell they both want eight in their valence shell so they make a deal okay the two oxygen electro or oxygen atoms make a deal and we're going to do this we're going to draw o and o and then i'll do red for the the nucleus so there's the nucleus we'll go back to black for the uh let's do actually so we have one orbital and that orbital has two electrons do you see that in your p in your periodic table here in the top it says two okay the topic says two so the first shell has two electrons we'll use yellow one electron two electrons one electron two electrons that's the inner shell but it wants to fill its outer shell which is this one right here it's valence shell so pretty i just have a whole bunch of circles remember this this right here is supposed to be an o i guess i could have typed that out but whatever okay and in that shell we have one oh let's change it back to the highlighter here we go one two three four five six all right and this one it has the same thing one two three four five and six okay so these two these two atoms make a deal they say i will share two of my electrons in my valence shell if you share two of yours that way we can both pretend like we have full valence shells okay so what happens is these two and these two go back and forth between the two atoms they are shared between the atoms that way both of these oxygen atoms can go to comic-con dressed up as neon remember that they want to be everybody wants to be a noble gas and in this case oxygen is just dying to be neon this really wants to be neon and so these two together pretend that they are both neon by sharing their electrons miguel this neon no neon is non-reactive in fact neon has a very similar density to air and it doesn't have any smell or taste so you wouldn't even detect it the only problem would be if is if it was like the atmosphere that you were breathing was primarily neon you would die not because it was toxic but because you didn't have enough oxygen okay so these two oxygen atoms are pretending to be pretend to be neon when they're actually just two oxygens okay so that's covalent bonding these are sharing electrons they are these electrons are co covalent they are the they are valence electrons for two different atoms and this is specifically called a double [Music] that makes sense i would be a double covalent bond because there are two electrons being shared and if in the case of nitrogen which nitrogen has five electrons in its outer outermost shell the the nitrogen that we breathe is also n2 there are two nitrogen atoms bonded together okay n2 is a is a triple covalent bond they are sharing three electrons also pretending to be neon franklin um hydrogen is what um the the old zeppelins were made out of or filled with and hydrogen is extremely reactive so um if you fill if you fill a blend full of helium you're good helium is not going to react with anything if you fill a blimp with hydrogen you are just asking for it to explode not only does it explode it explodes really really efficiently um it the only the only thing that is made from hydrogen exploding is water it doesn't even make carbon dioxide or soot or anything else it just makes pure water when the when the hindenburg exploded the the uh there was a huge amount of water released in the atmosphere not i mean huge compared to the atmosphere itself is really small but yes it was a lot of water many water molecules were formed in that explosion fun yes oh the humanity as we said okay so that's covalent bonds okay now let's talk about the other major type of bonding which is ionic bonds ionic bonds are bonds where the atoms are bound together together by stealing each other's each sorry that i cannot type today each i can never type them let me think about this it would be each others with the apostrophe after yep each other's electrons so this is not a sharing situation this is a stealing situation and you will see how that is different from covalent in just a second ionic bonds what what do we know about the first part of this word what does ion mean yes making the atoms charged yeah charge it charge it okay these become ions because they steal electrons from each other or give an electron i don't know give if what's what's the word for something that you have that has been stolen from from you what did you do you were you were pilfered you were you're robbed there you go you're mugged pilfered you're mugged okay so when we talk about ionic bonds usually so covalent bonds are usually between two atoms that are on the same side of the periodic table covalent bonds are usually between atoms that are on the same side of the periodic table so for instance oxygen with itself right or nitrogen with oxygen or fluorine with chlorine all right when when we talk about ionic bonds ionic bonds are generally between atoms that are on opposite sides of the periodic table so for instance if we look at this here fluorine and lithium or sulfur and magnesium when they're on opposite sides of the periodic table they make an ionic bond so let's look at sodium shall we how many electrons does sodium have in its valence shell one yes everyone's like uh is this a trick question it's one one electron in its valence shell do you think that sodium is particularly happy to have that one electron it wants eight in its valence shell it is seven electrons away from that so it is not happy about this okay the easiest way for sodium to get eight electrons in its valence shell is just give away that that shell that outermost shell the easiest way for sodium to have eight it can pretend to be neon if it can simply get rid of that one electron and the way that it does this is it will it will bind with chlorine and chlorine pretends to be argon chlorine is just one away it has seven valence electrons it's so close it really wants that last electron real bad okay really wants that last electron so it's going to do anything possible to get that electron and the way that it does it is it steals it from sodium has anyone heard of sodium chloride before it's table salt okay it is table salt chlorine gas by itself will kill you chlorine gas by itself will kill you in a very terrible way even in small amounts which is dissolving most of your lung tissue okay chlorine gas and you may have heard about the geneva peace accord to the geneva con um compactor no yeah the geneva convention but there's there's a like an actual document that was signed by a bunch of countries after world war one world war one was the was the first time that we started using chemical weapons as a species chlorine gas was one of those chlorine gas was a bad time for everyone okay it was so bad that we thought you know you know the saying all is fair in love and war well we're going to make it make sure that not everything is fair and loving chlorine gas is not cool but yeah but but shooting someone with you know a piece of metal at high velocity that's okay but having them breathing chlorine gas that's a little less okay it's warm yeah okay but sodium by itself sodium by itself is also really dangerous sodium by itself explodes when it touches the air okay sodium by itself explodes when it touches the air so here's an idea how about we take the thing that explodes when it touches the air and a gas that literally melts your lungs and we put them together and then we put that on top of our baked potato and it tastes delicious right the whole thing about salt like when you're making potato chips i make homemade potato chips at home y'all fry up some some freshly sliced potato um slices and the thing about potato chips is that they can never have too much salt just just salt just salt away okay i guess you can but it's really hard to oversaw chips let's be honest okay you get the lightly salted because you're a weirdo well i have just learned that i can no longer trust your judgment not that i could before no i'm just kidding all right so fluorine and chlorine and bromine all these really want bruh brahmin bromine and fluorine and chlorine really want one more electron do you remember that this is the reason why they are in the same column the same column has the same number of valence electrons okay fluorine and chlorine and bromine and iodine all have seven valence electrons so when we have a so let's let's do a couple of simpler atoms let's do fluorine and lithium so i don't have to draw so much because let's be honest nobody wants to see me draw that much so lithium we have lithium here okay let's draw the nucleus nucleus and then let's draw the electron orbitals they were red right i don't remember electron orbital number one and how many how many electrons does it have in its first orbital two always two okay and if we draw how many electrons does it have in its next orbital one one electron oh shoot one electron okay now let's look at chlorine chlorine cl chlorine has how many shells has three oh wait let's do our nucleus well that's a really small nucleus but pretty accurate um in terms of size here because of the atomic radius right so chlorine has three oh i was gonna do fluorine oh well we're doing chlorine three electron orbitals one two and three and those electrons are in a configuration of two one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven oh that last electron is really flat all right it's squished okay don't judge it what is going to happen here what is going to happen with these atoms huh what they're not going to share because does lithium want to share no lithium doesn't want to steal lithium wants to be mugged [Music] lithium is going and flaunting flaunting its electron being like hey look at my electron be ashamed of somebody came and stole it from me right well yeah lithium is is finding the uh [Music] i don't know anyway lithium is just wanting to be wanting to be robbed okay lithium goes and finds chlorine and gives it its valence electron okay and so now we have and that electron goes over here now both atoms are happy because both atoms have full valence shells and you're thinking but mr crochet lithium only has two valence electrons the first shell the first shell only has two electrons and so it cannot hold any more and so this is a full valence shell so for lithium hydrogen and helium their their valence shell and same with beryllium their valence shell that they're trying to have full is just the first one which only has a spot for two electrons okay remember that we talked about valence shells want to have eight electrons with a little asterisk and that asterisk is except for the first shell which only has two [Music] that's a great question lead is extremely stable and it is very difficult to ionize lead giving it an extra proton would make it into uh where is it pb would make it into bismuth give it yeah giving it an extra proton it doesn't really care much hitting it with high energy particles it doesn't really care it just kind of absorbs all of that it's it's really stable okay so what has happened here electromagnetically what has happened here the lithium ion this lithium atom is now a lithium ion and what kind of ion has it become anyone what kind of ion has lithium become hence it has become a cation wow that's a terrible seed cation and chlorine has become cl minus which is meaning what what kind of ion has it become an anion do we see how that works two elements that are on opposite sides of the periodic table want to steal each other's electrons or have their electrons stolen in order to fill their their valence shell or have a full valence shell it's not steel it's more like donating i guess you could say but stealing is is easier to to remember so lithium and chlorine get together and lithium says i really want to be helium and chlorine says i really want to be argon and they say all right well if i give you my last electron i get to be helium and if you take it then you get the argon so let's make a deal and we will do this thing where we become ionized become charged by giving each other electrons okay cool so this leads us so two major types of chemical bonds covalent and ionic covalent and ionic now i want you to um tell me so if we had a let's see here so when when we draw these these these uh pictures and yes they are absolutely beautiful i know do we really need to draw these inner shells these inner shells that have all these electrons you think those are important to our drawing yes says ella why would they be important it does it shows how many electrons but when we're talking about the bonding are these electrons in here important at all and how atoms bond together no they're not right so if we want to do a full electron configuration drawing then absolutely they're important like like ella said they're still there they're electrons right we should know how many electrons there are but when we're talking about bonding in chemistry we use something called the lewis dot structure lewis dot structure and when we look at that so for instance let's look at carbon how many valence electrons does carbon have v e minus equals how many valence electrons does it have it has four valence electrons [Music] four so carbon really wants eight so it's kind of in a weird spot the ionic situation is not a great situation because it would have to give up all four of its valence electrons which is very difficult to do and a covalent a single covalent bond doesn't really make a lot of sense either and the way that we draw the lewis dot structure for carbon is we do one two three four in the lewis dot structure you simply or drawing the valence electrons drawing the valence electrons uh let's make this a little bit smaller you're drawing the valence electrons around the atomic symbol okay drawing the valence electrons around the atomic symbol so carbon has four so you draw four dots around okay that's carbon when we are talking about let's say we're talking about oxygen the lewis dot structure of oxygen is 1 2 3 4 5 6. and you draw them in four quadrants okay so you draw them as if it was a box okay so we have in the middle we have the atomic symbol which i'm just going to use a and then we draw the electrons in the quadrants right here and we just draw those as dots electrons go here in the boxes okay the electrons go in the boxes and so why is why this is annoying right why isn't this symmetrical that would that would just make us feel better about it right because humans like symmetry do we not well in the lewis dot structure you go you start at the top you start at the top here so this is quadrant one this is two this is three and this is four so you start at the top and then you go around counter-clockwise in the quadrants and fill in the uh the structure okay so carbon is nice and symmetrical because it has four oxygen is not symmetrical boron will not be symmetrical just get over it i guess because some people would be tempted to draw a boron like this got and then boron has three one two three kind of like a triangle situation you don't do this okay don't do that the correct configuration for boron is b in the middle one two three okay so that's the lewis dot structure it is a much simpler version of doing this right in in this we're drawing the nucleus we're doing each shell you're filling in the shell the lewis dot structure it is nice and easy you just go atomic symbol in the middle fill in the electrons as dots around there so when we look at when we look at uh um different types of bonds so let's talk about carbon so carbon what one interesting thing about carbon is that it loves to make covalent bonds with other carbon and the way that we signify carbon bonds is by are not carbon bonds the way we signify covalent bonds is by drawing a line and it loves to make these these covalent bonds with other carbons okay and here we have the lewis dot structure for carbon in a covalent bond with four other carbons okay so this carbon is very happy the carbon in the middle is very happy because it is pretending to have eight valence electrons by sharing one of its electrons with each of these other four and they are sharing one of theirs with it huh yeah so this carbon in the center has four valence electrons and then it is sharing the other form here so it's it has one two three four and then it is sharing one two three four so you could what you could do is you could draw an electron here the ones on the so you could draw an electron in each of these points here see how that works so this carbon is sharing all four its valence electrons with the other four carbons around it and those four carbons are sharing their one of their electrons with this one these carbons are now looking for for four or three other things to bond with and this actually happens a lot this would bond to some other things more specifically hydrogen so in this case the hydrogen would come and bond out here to these carbons and you'd end up with um c5 h9 which is a type of hydrocarbon hydrocarbon hydrogen carbon you could burn it essentially okay so we have covalent bonds with the other carbons now if we look at this if we look at one of the most common uh chemicals that we will use well that i will use in some demonstrations and so forth which is methane which is ch 4 so ch4 when we look at that we have a carbon in the center and that carbon is bonded with four hydrogens and these hydrogens are actually giving up their one electron to become hydrogen ions hydrogen cations and we have ch4 where these are all sharing or not sharing these are all giving up their one electron to the carbon so the carbon can have eight electrons isn't oxygen flammable so yes and no so oxygen is not actually flammable because oxygen is the definition of flammable so it's like without oxygen you cannot light anything on fire okay without oxygen you cannot light anything on fire um you need something to light on fire in an oxygen environment does that make sense oxygen will react with other things by burst by those things bursting into flame but oxygen itself is actually not burning if you had so if you were standing in a room of pure oxygen you lit a lighter you would instantly go up in flame why because you are the thing that is reacting with the oxygen okay the oxygen wants to react with other stuff okay it cannot react with itself anymore than it already has to be o2 okay so it needs something to burn okay all right so that's lewis dot structure and chemical bond types i'm going to end the video here", "_9Tkq3K1q_c": "[Music] [Music] [Music]

live in Haiti for two years this is my reading culture project pros island is full of beautiful country sides bright blue beaches tropical fruits such as the key napa mangoes and pineapples many more not to mention the friendly the cons literally everything else the country's government struggles to stimulate their economy leaving many poor and unemployed the inflation rates are through the roof a mere 100 dollars here in America translates to eight thousand seven hundred and sixty-four Haitian food their Haitian euros riots have broken out as many no longer have faith in their Haitian president droven el movies at the heart of this recent unrest crippling inflation and accusations of corruption at the highest level I'm in this situation because of president jovenel moise I can't go to school joe vanillas a thief he must go if not we'll burn down the whole country many have resorted to cutting them the beautiful trees causing mass deforestation they come down said trees to make cheap charcoal electricity is a luxury and is mostly found in the cities the charcoal is used to start fires so people could cook their food and light up their houses do you remember when President Trump insulted a bunch of countries calling them wild [ __ ] holes eighties leading cause of death was diarrhea and constipation in AIDS as much as it saddens me to admit this haiti is amongst the poorest countries in all of the Caribbean with over 60% of the population living on less than $2 a day or 1 1 pound and 56 pence those laxatives that you can easily buy from Walgreens here in America is unavailable to people in certain parts of Haiti many kids do not go to school the instead stay homes help cook and clean this is also a problem because it deflates the country's overall IQ scores leaving it as a mere 67 points three points below the average IQ score for child autism pollution is another problem Haiti unlike American many other developed countries does not have an organized way to dispose of waste iron mental damage extends to the sea as well Haiti's coral reefs and marine life once some of the most beautiful anywhere arnoun devastated pushing feeding fish away from fishermen we do worry about getting disease but we're resigned to it what else can we do Rodrigue savy says he can actually taste the difference in the fish they catch as conditions deteriorate but

together tradition number two the dead are most often carried it hurts cars are not used we would carry the caskets our deceased loved ones for one to two miles through the streets tradition number three in Haiti we go to church only on Sundays the sensation parents have more time off in America they would go to church two to four times a week Sunday Friday Wednesday in one day's tradition number four is very common to dance and eat barbecue on Haiti Flag Day or May 18th remind us of who we are and to express our culture myth and stereotypes myth number one this myth that's actually shared between Haitian and Asian people the Haitian people eat cats and dogs no for the most part we don't I say most because this is a poor country after all I can't guarantee that a homeless person didn't look at a stray dog one day and say man they'll taste fire right Bob now myth number two Haitian people know how to do voodoo to an extent yes this is sort of true because voodoo originated in Haiti but it's been so long since the poodle princess has been operating within the country that followers of the food and culture have since moved to Jamaica and Brazil myth number three Haitians gonna take showers obviously Haitians take showers and Haiti cleanliness is a necessity the things like microorganism shamsky toes and various other bugs however I can't say the same for the Haitians in Oakridge I know I know that strays away from the project being only about me but this does contribute to the myth allow me to explain you see if you were to visit Haiti you'll notice dry land in dirt roads but don't be fooled this is not Africa Haiti shares the island with a Dominican Republic key word Island meaning there's plenty of water held in the underground reservoirs if we were to drill down far enough would strike water now to the second part that I mentioned Oakridge Haitians don't shower well there's a reason for that it all boils down to this many of these kids are new to the American lifestyle so I'm starting school is latest 7th or 8th grade it's possible that they're not used to waking up to 6:00 in the morning that and a lot of kids are choosing to get jobs earlier so they have money saved up for collar to buy what they want like a used car than those iPhone Jordans even so I wouldn't blame them if they missed a shower to you but there are a select few that straight-up refused to take shower to clean their clothes these kids creative rumors rumors create opinions opinions create jokes and jokes become fact myth number four kids in Haiti are all butt-naked know most if not all of them are wearing clothes visit Haiti most likely you won't see them because the airport's directly towards the cities if you want to find naked kids would have to travel far into the outskirts also known as a day off the outside which I don't know why you would if you're a part of one of the many charities that are working to get these kids fed and clothed like compassionate international then that makes sense if you're not then wired searching for naked kids first language my first language was Haitian Creole I do know a little bit of French because Haitian Creole is essentially broken down French with slight variations here are some words and phrases I can show you guys bonds ooh his fellow Bo and geo you are and translates to good morning bonsoir it's spelled B land SWA and translates to good evening and the phrase I can show you is bonsoir Monsieur Dom which is French and translates to good evening ladies and gentlemen food clothing d of exhaust wha buzzer Beth buzz Leon what I just mentioned was rice and beans Haitian beef patties and buzz which is a sweet bread eva soler speaker genome is pan fried pork shoulder and it's one of Haiti's most popular fast-food oh and I almost forgot bump on that if you ever go to Haiti do not buy these they're a product of a con artist if they're ours they're basically dirt cookies made by dumping a bag of dirt into a mixer and mixing it up with sugar and water they're mostly sun-dried giving them a dry and crumbly texture they're also known for giving people kidney stones and stomachaches they look a lot like pancakes or cookies the recipe passed down from generations here in Haiti women spend entire days making them grandma younger girl infants are nurse while mothers work the mix kids seem to enjoy them at least when our camera wasn't around but these patties known as bum bum tears by the Haitians who eat them our a grim reminder of just how poor this Caribbean nation is traditional

blues and dance music further dance videos most of them include our track the patient women scantily dressed clothing twerking and coffee handstands since I know miss Frazier was not appreciating showing such videos in a school environment I altered I opted for another Haitian video that had actors in traditional clothing [Music] things we do for fun soccer and gambling lots and lots of gambling there's also cockfighting rings the Haiti has picked up from Mexico personally I don't find it fun to watch as cocaine fed Birds brawl it out to the death and to end the video I invited my

[Music]", "tDE8ayqGWUU": "this is scott condit with the armory life and one of my prime preparedness concerns is what happens if i'm on the road and it hits the fan now that could mean car trouble severe weather a war breaks out or something even more out of this world in any event i always hope for the best while preparing for the worst that's why i have a 24 hour get home bag packed in my truck with the contents of this one bag i'm better prepared to get home to my family on foot if needed i'm going to show you what i've got packed inside my personal get home bag and give you some tips on how you can add your own ghb to your armory all right so i'm going to take you off grid slightly here we're going to unpack the whole pack i'm going to show you what's inside and give you an up close and personal overview of what i've got stored inside of my 24 hour ghb let's get to it all right first things first we got the rush 12 pack from 5.11 i love 511's gear make no bones about it i'm a huge fan boy because i've met with their engineers at shot show and previous expos and the guys and gals down there love gear they just are gear hounds but they're gear heads as well they put so much care and consideration into every aspect of every piece of kit that they've ever made that i've ever owned and used from clothing and apparel to gear just a big fan the zippers are primo like you'd have to try your hardest to break them and you're still probably not going to break the zippers the other thing i love about the 511 rush 12 pack is they give you so many compartments for admin for compartmentalizing your storage for just knowing where every piece of kit is you get to customize it and they give you every option under the sun to do so so again know more about that the pack just make sure you select a very sturdy and durable one biggest recommendation is go out there and test it go on a day hike not just a you know walk around the block it feels good put it back in your truck or wherever you're going to be storing it take it out and put some some use through it give it some abuse really test it make sure your straps don't fail make sure it's not chafing if the pack sucks that's the whole foundation of your get home bag so make sure it's a good one all right what we're gonna do i'm gonna open up the main compartment first and throw down one of my favorite pieces of kitten here this orange survival camping tarp it's orange on one side and reflective on the other you can use this to create a lean-to shelter you can have your campfire going this is going to radiate the heat right back onto you like a big reflector and on the orange side if you're trying to flag someone down if you're trying to alert someone that works also from the air if it's you know like a search and rescue situation the orange and the reflective both positive benefits to this very durable keeps you very dry if it's raining and again the added heat bonus if you have a fire going so let's lay this guy down probably orange side up and then i'll unpack the rest of the gear on top of it all right starting from the front pouch working our way in in this front pouch i keep stuff i might need to throw on first a good sturdy pair of gloves these guys have reinforced knuckles i have a little admin pouch with printed street maps in my nearby areas along with a pen to leave notes or make notes i also have some zip ties cordage you can use these to lash things to your pack to repair things to secure anything you might need to some of the molle webbing on the outside of this kit and if you come across any wiley road warriors that need to be restrained you got them for that too hygiene kit i got toothbrush lip balm some dude wipes because you never know also just have some sanitary sterile wipes here great stuff to have when you're on the go feeling a little grimy those things can really boost morale to have in this kit as well we've got an n95 face mask along with the rain poncho again this front pocket has all the things you know if something hit the fan i'm gonna go to this pocket first throw on some gear and get on the move additionally in this front pocket i have one element of my medical kit now my basic trauma and first aid kit i keep on the outside of my pack it's a quickly detachable i can throw it to a buddy or a fellow traveler if i happen to happen to be with one but this also has some surgical tools basic stuff forceps things like that and this one is from our friends over at battlebox they included the rip spool field repair kit this has a really cool twine thread tape kind of combo around the spool along with a nice i think 16 gauge needle so that's awesome if you're having to repair your pack if it does break down and in a pinch i don't know if you'd want to use that for stitching yourself up or not it might be a bigger needle but uh you know when emergency strikes you make do it's a backup additionally in this kit i have a headband here from 511. this guy came with what i have on the side of my pack here my favorite flashlight in the entire world the hl xr1 you can take this off snap it into your headlamp wear it on your head over a thousand lumens it's got a red light mode for low light signature it's got multiple settings for i believe hi low medium and strobe and again this is the response hl xr1 just an awesome innovative light bright as heck also on the outside of my pack working our way inward multi-tool this guy's the le emt first responder tool that thing has everything you might need paired down so you got a tonto blade you've got a screwdriver you've got a little hex wrench you've got pliers and you know the basics things to keep you on the move not the whole toolbox just some basic things you might need while on the road in a get home situation also on the outside of the pack as we're working our way inward got a chem light out here it's nice just to have one ready to go carabiner never know if you want to lash anything else to your pack i got one of these handy dandy little usb solar charging stations you got two ports if your cell phone works keep it charged while you're on the go but this guy also has a flashlight built into it which i love threw some velcro on the back 511 rush 12-pack already has velcro up top here and it sits really nicely right there so when i'm going in the arizona sun should the conditions be sunny i'm charging on the go again i got a trauma and first aid kit on the side here from my medic that thing is awesome comes with a great tourniquet comes with some basic trauma and wound care provisions inside i supplemented it with everything from extra ibuprofen aspirin and so on basic band-aids mole skin in case you get a blister you can get a lot of pre-made first aid kits out there i highly recommend you pick one up and supplement it to your needs also don't forget to include any prescription medications all right top compartment here i like to keep my communications gear i've got two baofeng radios just in case i'm with a party i can give one to somebody a buddy and stay in communication with them these are pre-programmed with weather alerts emergency channels all that usual stuff i've also got it pre-programmed with a few buddies who also have similar models of radio along the route and they know what channels i might be trying to reach them on should i need to a nice addition on this guy you can tell the difference this has a long range extender they're like 10 bucks on amazon you buy one you supplement it for a little radio that costs about 30 bucks definitely extends the range makes it a great value next pocket and a quick topic food we're not going gourmet guys 24 hours you're trying to get home staying on the move i have one package of mountain house freeze dried food in here just in case my trip takes me longer than i hope but my go-to is gonna be protein bars clif bars we got about six of them in there about 260 calories apiece and i also pack some of these cool sports beans uh they're extreme sports beans by jelly belly what does that mean some of these energy chews basically they're loaded with vitamins nutrients they taste good and they've got about 50 milligrams of caffeine per serving so for me if the starbucks are all on fire i'm going to go to that and get a little a little extra energy on my road keep my morale up they're tasty why not small enough to not take up too much space or wait in here beyond that little small camp stove tea light camp stove you can use it to boil water purified if need be you can also cook that meal in there so for now this guy's in the pack small it's ultra lightweight next since we're on food and water i love this water bottle it's got a life straw built into it you can scoop up water with it put the lid on and drink straight out of the straw and it should be filtered and keep you safe inside of this i've got a little eating kit it's got like a spork a bunch of water purification elements and tablets i also have some emergency and some liquid iv in here keeps that funky tasting water if you do need to chemically purify it not tasting so bad and again gives you a little boost and this is hydration bladder capable that you can put inside of here and i usually do just make sure you keep that clean when you fill it with water use a little bleach solution there's all sorts of guides online on how to do that properly just make sure you have clean water in there and cycle it out every three to six months at a time depending on your conditions i keep about a liter and a half on board in my bag at all times so i know i'm just ready to literally grab this and go that covers it for food and water for the most part beyond that this sack right here what's inside the what's in the bag everyone wants to know what's in the bag it's a spare pair okay this is a spare pair of pants shirt underwear socks and one of my most favorite survival items ever a buddy taught me this thanks tim this is a shemog it's awesome if you're cold you wrap it around you like a scarf if it's hot out you put it over your head and keep yourself shaded if you bust your arm up you can use it as a sling you can carry stuff in it it it is just a versatile tool keep one in your pack you'll use it more than you ever think you will this one is one of my favorites it's also fashionable you know post-apocalyptic fashion shows are a thing but you stuff in a compression sack because you don't want all that taking up too much space in your pack cinch it down keeps it waterproof you've got it in your bag okay this guy right here save your equipment little admin pouch it keeps all of one type of gear in tow here this is fire and illumination i've got a bunch of chem sticks chem lights i have a tinder shaving kit i have some lint from my dryer some of these wet fire fire starter pucks basically if i can't start a fire with this i'm doomed so this is everything i need to start fire also some illumination tools and i also packed one little kitten here that has an emergency survival blanket this i think i got at walmart for like five bucks emergency survival blanket fire starting implements a bic lighter because why go bear grylls survivor man shaving down sticks and you know trying to whittle things to make a fire use your bic guys be smart so this has a bic lighter in there a little button compass which is a nice add-on for navigation you put it all in a pack like this a little save your equipment admin pouch there you go fire now for sleeping i hope i don't have to sleep during the 24 hour period but if i do i've got this guy from kifaru this is just a little bivvy tent it's compact you squeeze the arrow it gets even smaller so i got the tarp for one this guy i've got a bivvy tent if i need it full enclosure and if i'm feeling like staying up off the cold ground and away from critters this little guy right here is a hummingbird hammock but again each one of these is a form of shelter if needed backups to backups these little tent stakes are great i just pack these in here just in case uh my tarp was blown away a second ago i wish i'd remembered those that would have been helpful i could stake them in each corner now the wind has died down and you know also for the shelters and for a number of other reasons cordage is extremely important 550 paracord got 100 feet of it you can separate this guy and on the inside there's a number of smaller strands that you can use for smaller detail work just paracord google it look at the youtube videos on the multiple uses for paracord trust me you're gonna love this for everything beyond that up top i typically keep this felt line pocket filled with a spare pair of sunglasses because in arizona the sun is brutal why i keep my favorite shades here from dillon optics on my eyeballs because they're sensitive okay i'm a sensitive prepared guy all right guys and there is actually one more pocket on this bag that i did not dig into it's up here above the solar panel check this out inside here i got a little back up to the back up packed one of the good old 511 rapid l2 lights four settings uh high medium low and strobe and just an awesome awesome handheld light super durable aluminum construction shock you know resistant rated waterproof rated water resistant rated i should say and uh the thing is just a beast so love having a backup to the backup speaking of it's nice to have a backup phone charging cord for your phone to run to that little solar panel on the front of your gear and this guy is super handy just a little emergency radio on top we've got solar panel so that charges via the sun but you can also mechanically charge it by taking out the hand crank give it a charge and power it up see it says charged right there wow not exactly a bose surround sound system but if you need some emergency updates and they are transmitting you can now be receiving so that's cool now let's talk self-defense on the road hopefully you'll only be on the road for 24 hours or less and you'll be avoiding confrontation at all costs along the way however desperate people in desperate situations do desperate things and you never know what situation you may come up against this is why we carry every single day my edc is a springfield hellcat osp loaded with black hills ammunition luger nine millimeter 124 grain jacketed hollow points this is great defensive ammo and i train regularly with the hellcat so i know how reliable it is and am comfortable competent and confident with this gun that's exactly the kind of gun you want on the road with you in a situation like this beyond the eleven plus one rounds making this a great on-the-go gun the hellcat also has a compact form factor it's lightweight and i enjoy the slide serrations which make it easy to rack especially in intense situations when adrenaline might be flowing much like your ghb it's better to have your edc always on you in case you need it rather than not to have it when you might need it most again this is scott condit with the armory life thank you for taking time to check out what's inside my 24 hour get home bag i hope this has been helpful to you and that you might consider making a ghb part of your armory be safe out there you", "b1b0xTHgJRE": "a very good morning and children welcome to chemistry class children we were doing the chapter changes around us and you know that we have completed the explanation of the chapter and i hope you are clear with all the doubts and you have also done the worksheets of changes around us and children we have also completed the book exercise as well as we have done new words and concept map also okay so today we will be doing the short answer questions and long answer questions of this chapter that is changes around us so i request you all to please check out your fair notebook of chemistry and in that i am pretty sure that you have written the new words and the concept map of this chapter so now let's start with the discussion of short answer questions and long answer question of this chapter that is changes around us so let's start with it i hope everybody is ready children questions you will write with black pen answers you will write with blue pen and in answers the things that are bored and with a good and that is underlined you will write it as it is all right so i'll start with the discussion of short answer question and log answer questions so let's just first quickly go through the chapter so children if you remember we have completed all these things we have for we have started with the first topic that is changes what are the changes that takes place then we have talked about reversible and irreversible change then physical and chemical change we have talked about that also and we have seen uh what is chemical reaction what is reactant what is product and what are the changes that are taking place when we mix two or more substances together so all these things we have seen we have also talked about some more examples of physical and chemical change we have also talked about what is catalyst and what is activation energy this also we have seen so all these things we have completed children we have also done the oral question here and i think and i'm pretty sure that you have written these new words as a homework and you have drawn the concept map of this chapter and we have also done the two the most appropriate answer and very short answer question so now we are heading towards the short answer question and long answer questions today so we'll discuss it one by one i'll send you the pdf of the chapter so after the class gets over please go to the school app go to e-content there you can find the attachment of the pdf okay from there you can write the answers okay so children if you want you can write it along with me now as i am discussing it here so you can write it now also but if you have any doubt if your speed is slow you can ah copy your answers from the link okay so let's start with it i hope everybody is ready with the fair notebook with black paint blue pen everything so let's start with the children okay so um children we have discussed this oral question we have discussed this which is the most appropriate answer and answers are here i have already shared it with you now coming on to the short answer question answer in sentence or a two i hope everybody is ready now question number one question number one is give one example for each of the following types of changes so we have to give the example of physical change chemical change reversible changes and irreversible changes so let's see what is there so if we see here so we have to give the examples of all these things so you will write the answer and you will write like this so what is the example of physical change children tearing of paper is a physical change isn't it tearing of paper is a physical change why does a physical change because when we tear a paper no new substance is formed the molecule of the substance remains same and no new substances form that is why tearing of paper is a physical change you can also write any other example but this is the most appropriate example that is tearing off paper now chemical changes chemical changes example is burning of paper why because when we are burning the paper then the paper is getting converted into new substance and various gases is also released and the molecule of the paper now gets turned to the ash okay so here the internal structure is also changing and a new substance is also formed so chemical change the example of chemical change is burning off paper now reversible changes what is reversible change so the change that can be carried out in a reverse direction it's called a reversible gene so what is the example example is molten wax becomes solid again when cooled so we know that this thing children isn't it that if we have a wax with us this is a candle isn't it this is a candle all right so what happens when we burn the candle the wax this is a wax so what happens the wax melts all right so wax melts but after some time this wax will get solidified isn't it this wax will get solidified all right so that is why more molten wax molten wax means becomes solid again when cooled under such type of changes are called this is cooking of food is a irreversible change i hope this is clear to you so these are the answers moving ahead with question number two question number two says a potter shape spots out of clay clay okay so how you will see it let's see so let's see here so this is a pot all right so this is a pot a potter is shaping the pot and you know how they shape it so they have something like this and another circle another circle another circle and they try to shape it up with their hands isn't it they use their hands to shape it all right so this is the process of shaping the pot okay so when so what is the question a potter shapes the pot out of a [Applause] okay so he takes an oval and he bakes it so what is the question question is identify the reversible and irreversible change taking place in the process is a reversible change this we have to identify so children what is reversible change the process that can be reversed again so if you see this is is a reversible change because we can reverse it again into the clay so pot can be reversed back to clay getting it and clay can be again reversed back to pot all right so it is a reversible change but once we have baked it once we have baked the pot so now it has become a solid material now it is very solid and very hard and just taken a perfect shape out of it so now we cannot convert it back to clay okay because now it has become a hard covering and now clay is converted into a hard material okay so now we cannot reverse it back to a clay so baking of pot is a irreversible change getting my point so shaping of pot is a reversible change whereas baking of a pot is a irreversible change so you will write the answer like this only in the same way you will write the answer now moving ahead with question number three breaking of glass tumbler and burning off paper they are office written twice so breaking off a glass tumbler and burning of paper are changes in which we cannot get back the original substance isn't it so we have two things we have one that is a breaking of a glass tumbler and second [Applause] when we are burning the paper when the paper is completely burned we cannot get back the paper back okay we cannot get the paper back so in both the cases we cannot get the original substance getting it what is the difference between these two so what is the difference between breaking of glass tumbler and burning off paper so what is the difference between the two breaking of glass tumbler and burning of paper so let's see what is the difference between two so in breaking of glass tumbler and burning of paper we have two things so what happens in this case is one is a physical change another is a chemical change isn't it so which one is a physical and which one is a chemical change let's see so now let's take a glass we have taken a glass and this glass is broken from the middle okay take and now we have a paper and this paper is boarding and it has now converted into ash okay so when this paper is converting into ash so this is the ash and this is burning paper and here we have a broken glass tumbler all right we have these two things okay so when this glass is broken this part is also a glass material this is also glass there is no new substance formed okay so in breaking of a glass tumbler what we can see that no new substance is formed and no chemical change is taking place but here when a paper is burnt there are several gases released out like carbon dioxide is released various smoke is released here and the paper is now converted into ash that is all together having a different property okay all together it is having a different property so here we are getting a new substance what we are getting we are getting a new substance here so the changes in which we are getting a new substance is a chemical change and in which we don't get a new substance is a physical change that we already know okay so breaking of glass is a what is the difference between two so breaking of glass is a physical change whereas burning of paper is a chemical change all right so let's see what is written in the answer all right on breaking a glass tumbler no new substance is fought as the molecules of glass remain the same but in the burning of paper in the burning of paper what happens smoke gases are given out that is new substances are formed hence breaking of glass tumbler is a physical change whereas burning of paper is a chemical change so i hope you are clear with the answer that breaking of glass tumbler is a physical change and burning of paper is a chemical change because here we get uh here in burning of paper we get a new substance altogether but in case of breaking of glass tumbler no new substances formed so that was answer number three now moving ahead with question number four what kind of change is cooking of food and why so just now we have discussed that cooking of food is a chemical change now why does a chemical change this is a question so why it is a chemical change children tell me because when we are cooking a food first of all the original molecule changed to form a new substance the original molecule changes to form a new substance consider it as potato so this is a potato we have taken tomato all right so this is a we have taken potatoes we have taken tomatoes and all the other things like we have taken chilis we have taken ginger all right this is a ginger and everything we have taken and we have cooked so now what is going to happen we are going to cut all these vegetables and we'll put it in the pan and we'll make a subji out of it so when we are cooking it so what is going to happen the molecule of this potato this is a potato so the molecule inside this potato will change all right it will entirely change it will be added with the spices it will be added even it will become soft all right so there are several changes that are taking place inside it and we get a new substance with entirely different property with different property all right so when we are getting a new substance with different property such changes are called chemical change so cooking of food is a chemical change this is because the original molecule this is because the original molecule changed to form a new substance with different properties and this can not be reversed so that is why cooking of food is a chemical change i hope you are getting my pointer in now moving ahead with next question that is question number five do you agree with the statement all physical changes are reversible if not give the correct statement so children do you agree with this that all the physical changes are reversible what about tearing of paper we can reverse it back but if you remember the example of tearing off paper or breaking of glass tumbler can we get the paper back by like when once we have pure the paper can we get the original paper back no we cannot and this is a physical change this is a physical change so what we say that no this statement is not right most physical changes are reversible not all maximum of the physical changes are reversible but there are few exceptions like tearing off paper like breaking off glass tumbler exceptions physical changes okay so what is the correct statement correct statement is most physical changes are reversible not all all right so this is the correct statement now moving ahead with next question that is question number six growth is increase in size growth growth increase in size okay what is growth growth is increase in size all right so when so is it a physical or a chemical change give reason so this is the question because growth is increase in size so your physical change yoga chemical change okay yes children so we have seen in when i was teaching you this topic so i have given you the examples and you have also seen the diagrams so growth is a chemical change now why growth is a chemical change because as we are growing there are several chemical changes that are taking place inside our body we take food the energy is generated and that energy helps in the development of the cell and that cell grows then we add into it various proteins carbohydrates and everything so everything if now and then changes are taking place inside our body and that's why we are growing and similarly the cells are also growing in our body okay so growth is increase in size is it a physical or a chemical change so we can see here that growth is a chemical change this is because the substance that make up the cell the substances that make up the cells in the body to cheesy substance means any substance that is that make up the cells in the body are different from the substance present in the food so that is new substances are formed okay so when we are eating the food what happens better when we are eating the food a lot of energy is generated okay and this energy will lead to the formation of new substances in our body okay this leads to the formation of new substances in our body time and again by various processes okay so that is why growth is a chemical change not a physical all right so that was about the short answer question that we have discussed so these were the short answer questions children so this you will write in your fair notebook i'll send the pdf to you so after the class you can go through the pdf and you will find the answers there okay so now can we move ahead with the long answer question so all right long answer question question number one explain the difference between physical and chemical changes giving one example of each so we have to give the difference between physical and chemical change this is also mentioned in your book you can copy it down from there also so yes children quickly tell me what is physical and what is chemical change everybody knows it so what is physical change in physical change first of all molecule of the substance does not change whereas in chemical change molecules the internal structure of the substance changes in physical change no new substance is formed whereas can chemical change new substances with different properties are formed like for example in physical change we have freezing of water so when the water is freezed so it will get converted into ice so this is a water just a second so here we have water this is a water when it is freezed it will be converted into ice all right we know that it will be converted into ice and this is a water okay so what happens the molecule of the water is not changing here also water is h2o and when it is formed into ice it is also h2o so the molecule that is internal structure is not changing getting my point so this is a example of physical change no new substance is formed now what about chemical changes example is burning of paper so we have discussed it in the previous questions also that whenever we are burning the paper entirely new substance is formed and ah various gases is released smoke is released and hence it is a chemical change okay so these are the differences between physical and chemical changes so in a physical change molecules of substances remain exactly the same before and after the change whereas in a chemical change we see that molecules of the substance undergo changes to form the molecule of a new substance no new substances are formed new substances with different properties are formed an example we have seen all right so children in your fair notebook also you will write it like this only in a tabular form okay so that was about long answer question question number one let's discuss question number two also question number two says one way changes are classified in reversible and irreversible explain with examples so we have to define what is reversible and what is irreversible reversible what is the meaning of change in state change in state means water is getting converted into ice all right and water can also be converted into vapor water vapor all right and this is water and this is ice all right so so vapor is in gaseous form it is gas it is liquid water is liquid and ice is solid so we have three different states that is solid liquid and gas okay so this is called change in state okay so it is a reversible change why it is a reversible change because water vapor can again be converted into water by the process called condensation water or eyes can again be converted into water by melting all right so because these process can be reversed again it is a reversible change dissolving of sugar in water when we are dissolving sugar in water that also can be reversed okay now irreversible changes changes that cannot be carried out in a reverse direction so changes that can not be carried out in a reverse direction is called irreversibility like rusting of iron and burning of paper so some student has asked me what is rusting of iron so children what is rusting of iron apnea iron iron even if you see this is your table okay so you have a rod there isn't it here so if you lift look to it very carefully if it is not of plastic is so that is called rusting of iron and same goes with the burning of fire we cannot get it back okay so these are the irreversible changes so i hope children you are clear with the answers so please write down all these answers very neatly in your fair note book of chemistry and i'll send you these answers you can write it down from here okay so i hope this part is clear to you children rest of the answers along with the hot question we'll discuss in the next class so that's all for today's class children thank you and everyone please do complete your question answers in your fair notebook that is your homework for today so that's all for today's class children thank you and jain children", "0kyKCPvw1UY": "do you see my [ __ ] hair is man how's your hair look you got explain it for audience I do so I shaved my head like a year ago I don't even know when like and I never got it reshaped wasn't it right before Covent is literally right before Cove it so now it's just growing out like little straws out the side of my head and it's now at the length where it's standing up on its own it's not laying flat against my head so it's just coming up so now I look like a crazy [ __ ] I'm not seeing the crazy [ __ ] part of it no I don't [Music] warming up guys it's 2 p.m. going but only for like 4 hours hopefully be awake for one hour so yeah we're doing something a little different today we own it during the day this is a daytime podcast now bright sunshine rainbow filled people we're not gonna be as funny funny we're not gonna be as mean as moronic we're not gonna be as aware of social issues yeah they don't you know [ __ ] that [ __ ] apparently we have Soylent here we do Lacroix here we have Corona Light I guess we're still gonna yeah doing our normal [ __ ] so as the as the test progresses I just want you all to know the only reason I'm drinking a beer at 2 p.m. is because I'm doing this podcast because I peer pressured Sarah when she asks like sorry gonna be right out I'm saying you've got you're gonna [ __ ] entertain people right now Sarah so [ __ ] yeah you get a little drunk get a little [ __ ] drunk Sarah hell yeah dude because I'm a good enabler my goal is that your audience they think that I'm an alcoholic my audience yeah like our audience so ok yeah our audience but also the people in your videos I want them to be like why is Sarah always drinking a beer always every video and I want it to be that's the only time I drink a beer yeah but somehow all right are you ready ready yeah let's get the popping of that I came and grabbed the [ __ ] thing damn yeah okay go okay three two one that hurt actually like the hell I don't have calluses on my right hand you need calluses to open your thing apparently what I don't know hi welcome to two morons talk about uh nothing for an hour and a half yeah okay every podcast but we got our first hey come on guys we did it our first comment that was written by a real person it just so happened to be a comment on our YouTube thing so last episode was titled Tucker Carlson is a simp this is the simp the simpie is sent to over simp yeah and I'm not gonna say names obviously but this guy yeah the [ __ ] weeaboo if you get one I'm exactly maybe I mean who knows but I never sent my thing was we talked about so many other things yeah I want to say during this episode I have you friended myself from a stalking axon that's false yeah false stocking accusation I talk about horse racism and also we mentioned that Tucker Carlson is a sim and we just titled the episode that because that's the funny title so haha so then this guy's like don't don't listen oh ya know you're a furry for the full comment I'm ready nothing to see here people period just two morons going on about nothing I mean two days ago I'd have nice because he's telling all the hateful people to not hate us because there's nothing to see here we're harmless yeah but apparently it's not harmless enough cuz he disliked the video too so whatever no it's funny we are it's really we've been celebrating I posted it on the podcast Twitter it means that we made it you know we finally done it we should sob now we're Arab yeah we're good no this is our last episode I'd guess for 60 episodes and then we get an episode we're actually celebrating a 10 milestone yeah crazy that's crazy and you know how we're celebrating by me not having a topic it's just about like how about uh the most meta podcast we could ever make just well I mean because we don't ever really get comments we get a lot of listens which is nice yeah we do we get more lessons than you and I know together combined so we know that there's other people listening bunch of bunch of randos which we appreciate we had follows from Instagram from people in the Philippines which is really cool [ __ ] love y'all y'all the best they safe out there yeah stay safe out there please you know so I mean you know I think we're successful in our own way we're not classically successful like we don't have merchant [ __ ] yeah but we're successful and like yeah we're making people are listening it's nice I like it very nice but it's got to come with your little slice of hate which is this tiny comment that is really not even that rude it really isn't no it's it's more it's more hilarious and very funny I'm tempted I don't know if this is passive-aggressive but to like make it a heart comment like pin that one to the top of that video just horrible 100% do it should I do it yeah all right guys we're doing this live right now well I mean four days ago but a live live from New York it's Saturday night and this little little [ __ ] is gonna I'm paying it if you already pinned a comment this will replace it yeah I'm pinning it alright we did it so we'll update you in an hour no this is like Oh someone liked your comment what comment is that oh oh it's pinned its hearted and it's harder than pinned okay I comment like oh these guys don't know how to take criticism they're just [ __ ] passive-aggressively put in my comment lo how immature I mean I will say I am a [ __ ] I think that's an apt criticism I am a [ __ ] about something sorry telling me this now yeah Josh you've known I I'm also a [ __ ] in everything so don't worry yeah we're two morons and we'd talk literally about nothing yeah we're podcasters yeah that's what it is you don't start a podcast if you're a smart guy Yeah right take that Neil deGrasse Tyson even Neil deGrasse Tyson sometimes he says some [ __ ] these stupid yeah he says somebody why do we Neil deGrasse Tyson the simplest episode now but just name our podcast every episode just other like famed loved person person so I disagree with that statement yeah I mean I don't really know I don't know a [ __ ] hilarious there's something a whole podcast where that's the entire theme well what are your feelings or my feelings on Neil deGrasse Tyson yeah I I liked him back when I was a [ __ ] cool atheist on reddit every single day same right but now I'm like can you shut the [ __ ] up no I love a good black science man but like yeah you have to ruin everything with science like I just want to [ __ ] watch Tony Stark [ __ ] pummel a purple man and not had to think about the physics of a punch on a man's face yeah he says he's kind of like he's so nerdy that he gets to into stuff and he ruins everything like he was cool he was like ooh look at this cool guy talking science and being cool and chill man [ __ ] interstellar such a cool movie because it's so science and then he lost his edge you know and he was like yeah this is kind of weird he's just kind of saying stuff it's kind of like he's just kind of there in the room just like spouting out like facts he has like a little book of like knowledge like I'm actually yeah I'm actually yeah you should make a book called that I'm actually with Neil deGrasse Tyson I'm actually that would be that would be worse than kovat combined with the Senate race think so no that's a lie no no it's mildly it would say it said us like maybe a month back maybe totally I don't know I know Adam Conover probably has already made that book you know what I'm saying yeah yeah he has yeah of course it's called actually the world is broken and you need to fix it starring Adam Conover you need to fix it you [ __ ] dumbass everything that you do is wrong because I stay like Adam Conover a little bit he's also apparently kind of an [ __ ] oh of course he is yeah have you seen him I've with the comb-over and one of the comb-over and wear suits every single day of their life right think about it think about how deep set those eyes are Adam Conover this is completely off topic can we talk about how Oscar from the Isaac just does internet shows now who's Oscar from the Isaac from the office sorry I guess I have nothing okay guys Oscar from the Isaac that's the episode actually legitimately guys I've only had one coffee it is not kicked in I have not had a whole day to process emotions and so Oscar from the office the game in the game in he just does internet shows yeah who was sleeping with Angela's husband the mayor yeah yes yes this is it shows now cuz using a [ __ ] gust gods and Johnson's sketch on the comedy skin comedy today I can't from this Comedy Central Gus Kahn channel Comedy Central apparently I'm drunk when I'm not awake I think is this the maybe the moral lesson of today's yeah maybe we should don't we need to do podcasts at night exclusively because at least what I'm sleepy I'm not drunk so it's such a convoluted way to get there you know it kind of is but okay so Oscar from the office yeah it wasn't a Gus Johnson sketch on the Comedy Central like YouTube channel that like they're trying to do their own like college humor things like they just hire a bunch of YouTube celebrities feel like hey yeah yeah and the there was one where he was that like VidCon yeah and like Oscar from the office just there he's just in the sketch is like a patron of VidCon and then there's an episode of Adam ruins everything which I guess isn't on the but space on an Internet TV show like internet personality yeah where Oscars like a boss of an office cuz you know office and I guess it's not no I'm just making stupid comparisons now I mean I guess you know they all had to do stuff after the office oh yeah of course it's just interesting to me that like he's still like in [ __ ] why cuz I mean is it funny yeah he's a funny guy I'm saying like cuz I mean it's interesting that some people are still like in the limelight in their own way after the office but like yeah yeah he does like everything now yeah I mean not everybody can do what he does oh yeah of course not but I mean yeah like what's uh what's Phyllis doing you know I really want to know what Phyllis was in a bunch of comedy movies well that's after that I remember seeing a lot of like romantic comedy movies I think with John Krasinski in it John Krasinski and somebody else they were like this couple that was like the perfect couple and they had to go on this like couples counseling thing because what's-her-face wanted to get married in a Catholic Church and sometimes to go through Catholic Church you have to get both Jesus and marriage counseling good to go through a course before they will marry you but then also the guy giving the course was like her dad why does this sound familiar I feel like I've seen a commercial for this yeah I went and saw that [ __ ] movie in theaters wait what yeah hold on wait can I kind of look it up to you okay so who's in it again John Krasinski and the lady that played Phyllis alright I was gonna be on Chrissy how the [ __ ] is he in that type of movie though like when he's doing what was before he did like quiet place and uh tom clancy's uh gun man before he played gun man before I played gun man on a waited 13 hours secrets of Benghazi or they were all friends and they were still at movies together and I'm pretty sure Angela was in it too I'm so curious is it something borrowed no I don't think that way maybe okay when did this movie come out Oh like 2012 2014 all right so is it the profits an animated movie no okay yeah Promised Land big miracle nobody walks something borrowed it's complicated something borrowed did come out in 2011 let's see it might have been something borrowed wait what it's I'm gonna think it's this one friendships are tested and secrets come to the surface when terminally single Rachel Falls for Dex her best friend Darcy's fiance no that's not it's not it it's about an art film someone's trying to make an art film is it okay promise land that's okay we're just gonna go this is welcome everyone to John Krasinski's filmography the show I remember very specifically in this movie Josh don't say anything if it doesn't have a wedding in it cuz it's definitely about a way I'm trying I'm looking for it I I I'm so you are looking for it but you're also saying an animated movie this is an art film and I'm like that's not at all what I said but I do remember and this is a scene I think about all the time like one scene deeply impacted me from this movie that's like a piece of [ __ ] that nobody can remember maybe doesn't have a even a thing for apparently unless it's good to you though yeah it was basically this [ __ ] couple and they're like the perfect couple or whatever and then Phyllis is like yo like you know what do you guys do when you fight cuz then then you'll know like you know if you're a good couple or not and they're like well we don't really fight like we have I mean we fight we have like spats or whatever and they're like no like what do you do when you fight like you fight like you scream at each other and everything and they were just like we've never done that and everybody's like oh look at the perfect couple like that's a bad thing because you need to actually fight to realize if you're a good couple or not or what I think I felt I think I found it okay what's it called its called license to Wed yes well Reverend puts an engaged couple through a grueling marriage preparation course to see if they are meant to be married in his church indeed do you remember that Robin Williams is the yes yeah I've a so this came out in 2007 so this is a pg-13 comedy romance movie yeah I'm gonna describe the poster for everyone that has 5.3 stars on them on IMDB this is what the users sink apparently all right the poster it's okay it's it's John Krasinski and woman they're in a bed they're in the sheets oh but in between them is Robin Williams has priest man yeah who made them did we let this should happen in George Bush era of America is this what we let happen 2007 the year that we decided that maybe George Bush needs to get out we didn't decide it it was decided already he gets there yeah somebody just texted the workgroup chat that we're not getting paid for this time and then my supervisor said we're getting eight hours for the day and like you can actually you can say cuz everybody else has said it we're getting paid until the 29 explain its exciting exciting news of my job which is just a straight-up garbage like you know like those fire is garbage fires like those little it's those contained fires that they light on fire for the homeless people to put to be warm because your job you do that for those people no I am the homeless people and they're lighting the fire to keep us alive so next week we'll do a podcast at night don't worry not one not two actually yes to two people got kovat at my job I dropped that by the way [ __ ] has not given about Cove man like they won't pay any of you guys if you get sick with kovat for two weeks like they're just really just [ __ ] evil about this [ __ ] so I got sick like wink Ovid like just when Kovac brand-new just came out yeah it was that February right yeah it was February I was [ __ ] four months ago yeah I got really [ __ ] sick I haven't financially recovered from this because basically I got sick I told my work I got sick I said I would have to take the day off and they were like you need to quarantine and I was like well okay so I quarantined I tried to get a short-term disability because I pay for short term disability at my [ __ ] check every [ __ ] check and sharking disability was like well we have a period of 14 days and you need to be more sick over for 14 days where you need to be unpaid so we're gonna pay you for one day but we're only gonna pay 60% of it so I got like 60 bucks short-term disability and they wouldn't let me come back to work even though I was checked out by a doctor I didn't have kovat and there's like yeah you need to stay away for 14 days because my company is going under and they knew that actually in March so this all makes total sense now they are going under they're trying to save as much money as they possibly can so they're not really paying us anything they're making us all do like three jobs at once like we're doing back-office stuff we're doing customer service stuff we're doing data entry things all at the same time and then they're criticizing us for not being really extremely good at it so that happened and then also their COBIT policies are the worst the worst just like Oh guys we bought you hand sanitizer and the hand sanitizer is like one shipment that they got one time and they've watered it down pretty much like litter did legit the hand sanitizer dispensers that comes out like [ __ ] liquid like you're pouring a glass of water into my hand my friend Elvis says that it smells like feet which I think is hilarious but yeah man so like that [ __ ] we're also sitting like one cubicle apart from everybody which they say is six feet which is not six feet yeah of course it's not no it's not six feet they're tiny cubicles and these are also cubicles I believe that the morning people will use because they don't have enough space to put everybody everywhere but then also they'll go through and they'll quote-unquote hand sanitizer to spray down everything and that's what they say is stopping kovat from happening and it did up until you know cuz everyone went out and just did stuff [ __ ] I can't believe that they're this stupid that now they're really paying for it yeah I mean it's good now that they're people they're just wasting money now cuz yeah they [ __ ] up they [ __ ] up so everybody who worked with the k\u00f6ppen person in the same room as him is now off until the 29th because they're making us basically I'll stay home and quarantine but not quarantine like ground telling us what to do but then they're also like well we can make you basically do whatever we want you to do because if you don't do it then you're not working then you're not getting paid what you may you know I can do the work guys do the work even though we [ __ ] up yeah [ __ ] cuz you guys dared to go out and get kovat you dare to you know get getting stay in your house all the time and go outside to get to your car and then go outside again on our property that isn't that's not work how dare you go to work to sit next to somebody who might have kovat yeah how dare you [ __ ] you so ya know now they're they have to pay us for this time and they're so pissed off about it and it makes my goddamn day it makes my good goddamn day holy [ __ ] so and there's the big amount of miscommunication so we got three or four texts from three or four different people who all said basically the same thing which was we're getting paid up until the 29th I look and I check my email from the HR manager it says we're getting paid up until the 29th as long as we're doing these specific tasks so if you get specific tasks then you have to do them or else you're not getting paid now somebody just asked my manager so it's safe to assume that we're not getting paid and my manager says you're getting paid for the eight hours for the day and I'm like I love my supervisor I love her but you gotta be more clear when it's about somebody's [ __ ] yeah so god alright that's my rant that's my word rant damn it so that's [ __ ] stupid and we all could have just been working from home anyway oh yeah you guys all written yeah guys can you get computers but they don't I don't want to do that yeah because you know how god how expensive it will be for us to not use our building and not use any of our electricity or water or Internet and not have to pay any of those bills and instead get you like a ten dollar laptop and a $100 laptop yeah but it's also just for like 30 people $3,000 yeah that's fine and I have a laptop they could even they don't have to buy me a laptop it's okay yeah yeah it's good because what I would be doing is like data entry right now yeah exactly yeah no [ __ ] yeah so anyway so I got a different job and I'm gratz thank you all right I better be applauding at home you [ __ ] they've known doubt because they're two morons talking about nothing seeing of soon [ __ ] siding about nothing yeah I don't know or segwaying into next I took this chemistry class alright I'm interested that was basically it was all in second life which is a video game know what I did tell you that it was all in second life I don't remember this maybe the more young lady but yeah so it was a chemistry class they basically went through and they set up his entire city they didn't need to do that but they put an entire they rendered an entire city in second life and then they with like a police department and we were playing as like a forensic okay I might have been that okay a forensic chemistry guy and we were supposed to solve a murder I know joke don't remember that being part of second life I did I don't think you've mentioned the second life the part of that that story I didn't go to class as an online class that's why thought it was like an online like oh here's some text and or some not evident evidence no there was like a quiz every week and it was about what we did in second life and we had two scheduled things that we did in second life so we had to get our little the chemistry class right yeah but it was like you know has sometimes you have to schedule your lap time so we had to schedule our lab time in second life so I had to go into second life I just walk around and then do the little things that we had to do and then we would leave but it was also about a murder like the murder what happened in the murder was this university or Community College this is a university I [ __ ] this Florida State University I was paying three thousand five hundred dollars just for my dorm for the semester this class was like $500 was good there's $700 I think it's not okay yeah so okay so the murder I wanna just I really what do you think if you're a professor and you're writing this chemistry class that happens in second life you have absolute power over hat what the murder is what's going on [ __ ] what the kids see cuz these are kids this is like intro to chemistry is the intro so freshmen are taking this class so these are like eighteen seventeen year old sometimes sixteen sometimes kids are really smart if I can graduate I really love did you know like do enrollment yeah well I'm not I guess you could do do now you can't do to enroll minute Florida State you can do it as duva's their Community College to but it's not that but so I didn't know a sixteen-year-old who who went to that busy the [ __ ] nerd now he was cool man [ __ ] cool nerd as cool as [ __ ] he was an art major who his trance was cool but uh Jack was the only nice person to me but okay so yeah so this is this [ __ ] [ __ ] right what kind of a murder do you think they would choose a triple rape homicide it was a rape murder rape homicide and then then they lit the girl on fire afterwards do you rid of her body got two of the three maybe not the triple part but the fire part so what happened was they took a woman kidnapped a woman tied her up with jumper cables to a tree raped her stabbed her raped her again and then lit her on fire why would she hold okay I've got time out everybody I feel like are you [ __ ] the stab wounds after the second one why would you rape her again yeah I don't want to I don't want question rapist here I'm sorry guys I don't want a controversial opinion rape is weird but I guess it's like what I'm I'm gonna waste a [ __ ] you know you know Oh what just because she's dead that makes it not good anymore like well Who am I I was kidnapped a woman and tied her to a tree I'm not a Priss you know that's what the murder was did you get hey Sarah did you get to see the body the dead body after it was raped and lit on fire you bet your sweet ass it was you bet your sweet as it was [ __ ] rendered in second life and I saw the [ __ ] crime scene with my own eyes so why okay what so how how beautifully rendered was the how are the graphics you know what it's so light sapphire no yeah no but naked and jumper cables to a tree the view where the staff rooms just like little red marks yeah yeah I'm not joking you would think it would be like oh this woman drowned or something like Nancy Drew ass murder you know like some [ __ ] no we need a [ __ ] there's [ __ ] blood everywhere in the woods so then you you have a set of men and and there's like a vagabond who like walks through who like smoke some weed near the crime scene or whatever you think he might be the rapist murderer because you're a conservative and then there's also her husband and it like really kind of makes it seem like the red herring is the vagabond and it's actually her husband cuz I'm going through this thinking this was not a real murder that happened in real life oh yeah this was real wasn't it also famous man what a good way to like just respect the dead the the woman that was murdered you know we're gonna we're gonna make a shitty render of her in a second life and we teach to a bunch of kids and also I don't know how we got on that subject but I was talking to your mom earlier and she was like well maybe like the rotten flesh like that's something to do with chemistry that's like that would make it a good case for chemistry class and I was like listen nothing that had to do with the murder other than blood blood and guts entered into the chemistry side of the class so was this whole entire like detective thing like just a little side quest for a chemistry class yeah it was to make it look like it was interesting and cool and sweet but then the interesting and cool part was that this chick got raped and murdered and lit on fire pretty ever give you ask me and like yeah there was a lot of evidence to collect at the scene of the crime cuz she was raped and murdered and lit on fire there's a good amount of evidence around yeah you could also make up a murder where there's a good amount of evidence you can show some more all classes hey kids have you ever become cops maybe sometimes you can cheat the system no you're saying I'm so you as a creative person who's creative enough to put this in second life oh can write a murder to where there is enough evidence to we're in different areas of bagging evidence so that I know how to bag evidence as the student that isn't an actual rape murder and lit on fire case you know rape murder arson yeah but here's the thing though Jimmy Joe bub you gotta love doing Joe Biden so sorry listen sometimes you listen to a crime podcast a true crime podcast and you're like well I'm not work is done I don't have to come up with how do I do anything gonna listen to this podcast go on a blender and [ __ ] make a second life model that looks like a lady using an old old-timey photograph of this wasn't when did the murder happen just like what did it happen in real life when it happened it wasn't like the seventies thing all right so we get oh yeah you get go into Photoshop you're gonna find a black-and-white image of that lady and then colorize it and then face map it onto a rag doll and just [ __ ] put it on a tree and I just I can't describe to you guys how [ __ ] up this is I'm not even done the story this murder has haunted me throughout my entire life the professor did it no so we go through this whole process we're getting all the DNA we're analyzing the DNA and then it's the actual chemistry part of the process which is pretty 8 not interesting the next part after the murder thing they go through and they do the rape kit so you don't even do the rape kit so there's no reason for her to be raped they do the rape the [ __ ] the the guy that does the post-mortem stuff he does the rape kit he tells you yeah she was raped we did it we did it I got something we already knew cool and so all that happens I'm like 18 and I'm doing this I'm 18 I'm chilling [ __ ] having beers at college and finding out if a [ __ ] was raped and second the computer stopped my bender this book in football [ __ ] we gotta take a quick rest I gotta call my computer to do my second life chemistry class oh this [ __ ] is raped and murdered on fire [ __ ] the seemingly racist I can't believe they banned [ __ ] Indian headdresses at our football games that is [ __ ] man I'm 17 and [ __ ] king of the world do you have any [ __ ] statues there are I mean I'm gonna guess like double digits at literally every crossroad on FSU yeah that sounds needs to be taken back okay FSU students you're better than your your predecessors welcome to tear that [ __ ] down alright tear that [ __ ] down dude come on stop doing your stupid [ __ ] Indian part of the and I'm part of the antifa organization terrorist organization me to come fight me and we're telling you all to commit horrible heinous acts of not being racist so Thursday I'm just gonna take a quick side note did you tell it all that was use racist but there's a the Indian chant that the the Knowles Seminoles do I'm not gonna do because it's [ __ ] racist good yeah it's supposed to mimic like an Indian War Chant guess Josh pop quiz was it made by Indian wasn't it is it an actual Indian War Chant music come on well I don't know I feel like the history of I feel like the Indians didn't have like Cheetos so I feel like there's a really good chance I make it guess who made it was it some stupid-ass white dude with a bunch of drunk frat boys of course dude pretending to sound like Indians put a couple syllables right next to each other maybe they'll sound a little bit like [ __ ] Indians man I don't know crazy hey should we change our sports team now it's not a difference of syllables it's Oh over and over and over again two different notes yeah racism is just laziness man okay but so so okay we're getting outside talk about this rape is rape murder in second life at this racist college this rape and murder in second life we go through the process we try to figure out bla bla bla it's becoming a strong stance on it's the husband who did it because and it becomes a thing where he must have gone out and talked to somebody and orchestrated this big thing to where he strolled up on his wife as she was coming out of like a marshals and then put him in the back of his truck and then went into the woods and raped and murdered his own wife because there was two different types of sperm and and in the rape kit so it's two different men she was raped and murdered by two different men so it was like okay that's the big reveal right and it gets to almost the end where you're about to say who you think murdered this woman and then you get a whole bunch of new evidence wipes and it's a black man who confesses why she walks into a police station and puts in a statement of yeah I just kinda I don't know why I did it I just went out and I just [ __ ] raped and murdered ba bla bla so so and the statement josh is like scanned police reports for real that's that I didn't realize this was for real all throughout the thing until I got to there and I was like it like stuff was redacted and [ __ ] and I'm like I'm shouldn't be looking at this like I can't actually look at this this [ __ ] looks crazy and then so we go in then we take our final test and it's like the Vagabond the guy the other guy who you were led to believe was the actual murderer and the black guy who just confessed and I'm like I basically wrote a thing and then we had an answer to say why I still said the husband because I was like maybe the husband convinced the black guy to confess yeah like paid him off or did something so that's what I said I got that question wrong it was the black guy and then I was just like this is racist fake murder because why would a professor take a real murder digitize it and put it in second life and then evade the actual culprit from you the whole time because listen this college is raised to say yeah the college is racist so I was just kind of like okay the traumas out of my mind I'm gonna forget about it forever and now years later I'm transferred to Valencia College a good college a good college I'm waiting I'm waiting for the links 15 bus to go to Valencia college to go to my classes and I'm listening to a podcast called my favorite murder and if you guys don't know [ __ ] that ain't podcast that your professor listen to yeah well no because this is a new episode so if you guys don't know FSU is in Tallahassee Florida so they were doing what's called a mini episode where they have people call in with stories from their hometown about serial killers and you know you know whatever weird things that have impacted them so I'm listening to this bah bah bah and then this one person writes in about Tallahassee Florida and I'm like Oh crazy cuz Tallahassee is a really small town yeah like they have one like graveyard basically and it's like three blocks away from FSU and it's gorgeous and it's a piece of history and everybody should go look at it but you know like it's a you know it's like a tiny tiny town in its it's pretty nice I I don't think I would live there but I think it's a it's a nice town for people who do live there it's very quaint so this person resident about Tallahassee and it's basically just like so did you know that one of the biggest serial killers was jailed in Tallahassee county jail and then got out on bail with another murderer a black man who murdered a Tallahassee English teacher English professor FSU English professor by kidnapping her from a Macy's taking her to a forest lighting her on fire and raping her twice and they this big-time serial killer I don't remember his name became best friends with this guy they went out and they would kidnap women and then like like slice off their their breasts and then like tape them to like the front of their car and just go enjoy rides and like the forest and I'm sitting there like these [ __ ] actually made a second life okay video game but that's not where the story ends because a couple months later yeah your professor was a ghost for 20 years no that's not even where it ended because I went out with my my favorite English teacher from high school we went out to it was like right after the time that Donald Trump got elected it was around his inaugural inauguration says January whatever and I was sitting there talking to her about my time at FSU and I mentioned this batshit chemistry class that joke and she was like oh was it the one in second life and I was like what like yeah I added an old friend colleague of mine who taught chemistry in second life and we were taught chemistry and we had this idea to maybe have like this mystery that's like murder mystery in second life I didn't really help out with it much though but I did give him the idea and I was like no way no [ __ ] way gave him the idea wait the sheet suggests it be a base on a real thing I don't I don't know I mean maybe a achieve might be the type of person I don't think she's she's a very sensitive intelligent person I don't think she would think that like it might be cool knowing her if she was likely like it might be interactive to have students you know do something in second life and if you're gonna teach it are behind you know and you could do it probably in these different like Mozy you're probably do it in seconds you professor there we go raped and murdered oh I think some gods an idea just planning out like what this professor has been alive since like alright this professor was like a student of that the professor that a got ready to murdered and all just had a like a grudge just a big grudge we got okay here's okay so [ __ ] dude like and he was waiting for the day that he was like I'm gonna [ __ ] make shitty [ __ ] render of you one day like that's the big that's the end of the story where it cuts back to the fifties where this professor is just like in class it's like this you can make fun of him once like why are you wearing that jacket gross and all the kids laugh at him and we cut you the graveyard I will memorialize you in second life your raped and murdered lit on fire body okay Sara we cut to you so that's the flashback we cut to 2017 yeah it's raining we're in the graveyard at Tallahassee it's the late it's where we come sumit on the lady's gravestone like the murder frat house music in the background I was literally a frat house across this yeah from this graph we could cut to the ground a pair of feet walk through or stop in the middle from the grave we panned up it's it's your professor in a trench coat and a fedora trying to hide conceal his identity as much as you can yeah Ranga black sunglasses he takes out a laptop he opens it towards the grave shakes and this is what you get what you making fun of my jacket and then he tosses on the laptop the laptop way down from the ground and then pisses on the grave and then we cut the black and then it's in the way that you use it please you know this poor ass woman man I don't think she wanted that [ __ ] to happen to her after she was [ __ ] I don't want that [ __ ] to me like [ __ ] if I am ever murdered don't put me in second life the league in second life either because [ __ ] so that's my topic I had to tell this story yeah I get it Sarah's stories from F as you corner corner because there are many the mounted coroner so there are many more stories or Memphis I guess I'll do them later but that's one of them here's my stories from Valencia corner I didn't do anything at Valencia I'm a [ __ ] nerd okay we finally did it guys we finally hundred thirty 20s Jesus let go grab my ax grab my dice which I actually see now [Music] alright okay I collapsed and went out of his way like you know what I had that professor at FSU I'll do I'll do him a solid I don't know if it's the same guy it's got to be the same guy though you know you know what I mean yeah I should do get you Mia I'm cured I'm so like the [ __ ] does that man who in the world man the [ __ ] world okay alright des Corey so welcome

because that's what she looks like even though she's like 40 array is she's 40 years old never mind me I don't think I ever we leveled up right yeah you were level 3 now yeah I've not ruled for HP okay you should do that I think yeah I've been at 19 this whole time or 19 since all the to [ __ ] off I'm at 22 now we did it guys [ __ ] okay so you guys go back home basically what will happen is you're ambushed you're asked for money from a homeless man on the street right though and all this man is actually a quest that will earn you a billion dollars all right so roll a D 100 plus 10 what yeah oh is this like something might happen no hold on first one's gonna be the ten second one's gonna be the number 144 okay cool great guy started speaking in tongues to me right now just 60 bucks for something I gotta pay her 60 bucks at the end of the day and apparently but then you guys have to spend that too ooh [ __ ] okay so I'm just walking right now nothing haven't no not a care in the world nothing bad is happening I'm just living my life you know I just rolled a 50 for her 44 and then added 10 to it you know just living life and I'm gonna keep talking until I'm cut off because okay so basically what happens you walk in and bolo has his head in his hands and he's sitting at at the the sort of bar kitchen area by where you guys are by your kitchen and he's got a bottle of mead next to him and a glass full of meat and he's just sort of like god dammit of although what happens what's up he goes I'm not gonna I'm not gonna I'm not gonna listen I'm not gonna sugarcoat it I'm not gonna you know you know run you guys around or anything the business isn't doing great it's not doing a great and it's not doing great um okay okay bolo what happened why what why are you telling us this now well I mean in general it's not making a lot of profits enough you just have a bunch of people yesterday coming in buying [ __ ] sort of but I don't know if they bought anything the people that I hired those where rat people they're not really doing that great yeah i selling them Oh yellow I'm sorry I forgot I'll fire them tomorrow but fire them now [ __ ] call him up and [ __ ] fire it up right now I was like well okay hold on let me get through the rest of my schpeel all right fire them and then we got to rob them because clearly they've robbed us yeah I guess but then also that guy down the street he's also been telling everybody that we have rats and we kind of do have rats because of the Marshalls remember I put them in the walls not me but somebody put them in

oh wait hold on and your sneak attack and another d6 so a five plus seven total damn that's pretty good alright so now that you've done that roll initiative course yep [ __ ] I'm gonna say total because I don't have below stats up but was just gonna run away that's what he's gonna do 10 total for me okay you got a 10 I think she goes did I do a lot of damage on the where router now you did like a third of his health [ __ ] yeah where we're at this is me doing the initiative roll of 20 alright so you got a 10 sponsored by Caitlin yeah yeah time keyline toptenz 3 my new youtube channel Key Lime top tens you top 10s on all the limes in the world you upload daily 3 p.m. Eastern Central this would be a 3 p.m. Eastern 2 p.m. Central that's what I mean the 1 p.m. mountain then 12 it's plus 6 your decks is plus 6 well it's 23 total oh because somebody else rolled 10 as well ok so they go first [ __ ] you yeah the one that you just sneak attacked is gonna turn around and oh my god one of which can be a bite okay so he's going to bite you [ __ ] [ __ ] okay okay oh he got a critical hit you have 24 yeah no [ __ ] it's okay so he's gonna do one D 4 plus 2 and then I'll add 6 to it so you did 10 points of damage I'm at 9 oh no way I'm a dumb because I just rolled yeah uh 12 points and hit points left great and then he has another attack if you get another critical hit 22 that's not critical though right no okay I know so it's okay and then this one's gonna be with the short sword so beat d6 + 2 so you did 6 points of damage now I'm at 6 iris you better do some crazy [ __ ] okay iris you need to make a new character right now that has a hundred everything and so it's now your attack it's my attack yeah it's not your turn next turn I'm gonna help iris in any way I can to give advantage of other players or help another player within 5 feet attack oh you're gonna help well that's a bonus action ok you give her what I'm get a advantage I think ok yeah and also I can help attack her if she's within 5 feet of me ok cool yeah I believe that's what this is because I double check we're going to the referee portion of 30 20 all right so I'm gonna attack with the short sword again Coolio does a damn it 24 hit not natural yes another 5 points of damage ok that's pretty good pretty much knocked him down to half nice yeah well I mean I'm [ __ ] I'm past half right now but uh you know yeah so the other way rat is now his time to attack he is next to the first where rat he sees iris and he's going to try and attack her with a hand crossbow because he figures you've looked kind of ragged already so he figures he's trying to get like all the attacks in fair enough and now these thank you all for being here for our last episode of 320s we did it 60 episodes of the podcast in the 10 episodes of dari 20s going out by a stupid idea I had the dumbest idea I could have ever had in a game so he does that twice and the second one was a critical hit so let's be this plus eight oh but he'd only did okay so he did nine points of damage plus five okay 9 plus 5 is 14 Irish I think is that my a smooth talker I'm gonna check that real quick what's 31-14 27 1717 yeah okay oh boy iris you better do some crazy [ __ ] yeah so now it's irises turn she has advantage the problem with that poison spray it's that you're there in the middle of everybody and she revived me afterwards though no she doesn't have that ability can she take me to a hospital laughs yeah but you have to do that within a minute to revive you this fellow know anything about you have health potions I think she's gonna give you a health potion not as a bonus action I have a harmonica does that do anything it doesn't she's going to give you a health potion that's all that she can do as a bonus action if she wanted to force-feed you a health potion that would be an action all right at its hands man yeah so she's gonna do that so the next time that you she's going to jump out pretty much in front of you with her movement mm-hmm what does this do extend your hand pointer figure magic grants a brief insight oh that's stupid why did I put that on myself what is that I don't know what any of my spells are I'm looking them up to see what would be best you do an extra one d6 oh that's a bonus action so she can't do that she'll do that next time strength saving through one fail take half and see trying to dig ourselves out of a whole portion of dirty twenties yeah right come on man okay I'm ready I'm so [ __ ] ready dude I'm ready to die biggie are you I'm gonna mitigate are you failed save targets and can't take reactions until its next turn oh successful own Richard takes half damage but suffers no effects are you good at strength saving throws I mean I have a +4 to strength how do you see 14 and then you would still take half okay so he's just gonna do L tricks Eldridge blast to the one in front of you huh she's basically just gonna cause a commotion so she hits so that guy is gonna take one d-10 he does he takes seven and he was at a 24 and then you got what I did a five didn't I did five so he's it okay oh yeah he's a 19 she's at that second guy didn't take any damage she's in front all right I think does she get two attacks no damn it damn dumb idea okay that way to rewind the gay the clock yeah can't wait to wake up and it's all a dream and it's all a dream so now it's the where rat that's hurting badly he's gonna attack iris cuz she's right in front of him and she just attacked him these multi attacks though you know [ __ ] oh he misses Oh [ __ ] got him dude and he misses again okay thank [ __ ] christ [ __ ] and that was your turn I'm gonna during that health potion okay good so that's 44 plus 444 yeah big money 1 1 1 3 so that's 10 oh yeah you were at 6 so I'm at 16 ok that's not too bad and short-sword [ __ ] I was so close to being critical fourteen plus does the dirty 20 hit yes d6 4 points 4 points of damage to the Diane guy yeah pretty much yeah I want his friend to know well I won't want them to be alive to see it okay so that's yours and it's the other way around he tried to attack iris this time so I think he's going to make another attack on iris I guess a rollup [ __ ] it doesn't matter role because you're both doing the same amount of even her odds Josh evens alright so he attacks you [ __ ] he's gonna come in with a bite another bite and he misses because he rolled a [ __ ] four yeah this would be an 11 yes yeah [ __ ] and he misses cuz he rolled it to little [ __ ] ass [ __ ] [ __ ] so okay in Soylent so now it's irises turn she's still in front of this guy all of her a oe attacks would still affect to you but she's going to say like want me to dodge yeah she's gonna tell you to dodge basically all right next turn to get out of the way but she's gonna cast this anyway alright dude yeah so everybody has to make a DC 14 strength savings well dirty 20 oh [ __ ] nice okay so you only take half that's not too bad yeah and then they have to roll that one passes that one does not okay great 2d6 are we actually doing good eight eight to me now you dig for the other guys i'm now that twelve and the first where rat is done we did it he is out and so the other one now he's taken four so that means he's at this amount of health okay great [ __ ] can't believe we're doing this I can't believe we're doing this okay well I wanted to so now is your turn Josh short so how close is he to me actually he's like right this is all very close comments short so uh sure you know what I'm gonna run so iris can do area tax I'm gonna head to the stairs okay he's my um what is it short bow all right also for people that wanted a description of what iris did she's the arms of Hadar which meant that tentacles came out of her and basically bitch-slapped everybody around her so she'd slip bitch-slapped a guy to death basically i dude does a dozen 25 yes I wish it was though five yeah 5 points of damage you he's not hurting yet but he's he's taking some damage Damon's taking some Damon's taking some Matt Damon's so role a stealth check because I want to know if he can see you it was nineteen plus plus of 10 so she nothing yeah so he's gonna do a multi attack on iris no oh damn sorry cuz she's the one yeah sorry no you're good and he did a create a critical fail what so that means iris gets an attack of opportunity so she's gonna cast eldritch blast again as says irises tentacles come flying out and my phone drops in the drills go one behind me eyes there's a there's a lot of house I apologize try not doing this in the mornings damage and so that's his first attack so he gets another attack that's to me like a [ __ ] critical hit and he misses because he sucks and so now it's irises turn and now that she can do a OE attacks she is going to do poison spray so just going to spray poison out at this [ __ ] do it out of her tiny little baby mouth and he has to Oh any critical effects great fails which I don't think it matters I'm gonna add anything no he just purposely Alex saw swallows it like yeah this is good alright so she did that amount she she did like sixteen points of damage Jesus he's still alive yeah alright short bow uh 18 total yes or so he's really confused and poisoned and he's just [ __ ] pissed off so he's just gonna start biting [ __ ] because he's like I don't [ __ ] know what to do anymore and he misses this is his first bite I can't believe this is working he apparently he can only do one byte per multi attack so he has to use a short sword so he's just biting and stabbing and he misses again so he's just kind of he's he's blinded and now it's irises turn and iris is going to take the bonus action and just sort of be like who do you work for you don't work for us but like who made you come here to you know [ __ ] with us and the the guys just gonna be like [ __ ] coffee guy what and I'm not gonna say there's any persuasion or any intimidation or anything because he's poisoned needs persuasion yeah it's like the guy that makes the coffee down the [ __ ] Street can I [ __ ] go now you killed my brother and I'm gonna go to the police people are gonna know about it and then iris kind of looks up at you like should we let him go to the police no do you say that just tell I shouldn't say anything I say no to the Pope no to the pig [ __ ] the pigs Dee okay [ __ ] [ __ ] okay so I well we can't let you do that and she's going to wait a minute wait hold on wait hmm what would it take for you not to go to the police sir like uh I don't know [ __ ] like I mean nothing is gonna stop me from morning my brother all right bring you joy numb in heaven sir okay well never mind [ __ ] it yeah is gonna be like you know what [ __ ] this guy [ __ ] these [ __ ] she's gonna do so are we the bad guys another elder really wants me to roll [ __ ] - okay so now he's she did - damage and as your turn Owen all right yeah I kill this [ __ ] all right I have to you have to cuz I I'm gonna say on his next turn he's gonna try to run away all right shortbow there's a 20 something hit yes it three points of damage but he's on his last legs man his literal last legs so he's crawling he's gonna crawl away he's gonna try and crawl away and it is his turn and that's all he's gonna try and do he's not gonna attack okay so ours is there she's with the decision on whether or not to kill this man she looks at the other man that you guys killed it she's like well I mean I guess [ __ ] it you know I just got stomp on his [ __ ] head oh [ __ ] and she misses you gotta be kidding me not kidding you she rolled exactly as they see which means that he/she misses so it's up to you oh I gotta go I got shoot again again there's a natural 20 hit or is that it what we call a critical head right there so what is that okay so so a full he's dead yeah how do you want to do this Mishima is stupid [ __ ] head dude stupid [ __ ] I'm gonna say it explodes [Music] I was gonna look up at you and be like Ludum okay we have to listen all right I didn't realize that I didn't realize to think you they can go to the cops all right they've been [ __ ] Robin for us we should have [ __ ] sued them first but alright we're here now okay Jesus Christ okay so [ __ ] okay fifteen plus something 12 19 total okay so I'm gonna say what'd you guys find is challenged to comment can't speak in rap for him does it say no somebody's gonna make it up so you're gonna say between them they find you find a hefty piece of you know I'm out of gold and also a note from Emmett for the guy down the street saying like go to their shop steal from them and report back and leave morsels no so we have proof that they were robbing from us yeah again I guess we can go to the police now everybody knows Waterdeep is a stand-your-ground stage so what time what time of day is this right now this is like oh no because you guys went home this is the night time this is night okay Oh iris you guys fine I'm gonna say fifty gold pieces between you guys I tossed 20 of Ollo and I'm like clean this [ __ ] up like you guys murdered my employees what

that they were [ __ ] you over and they were not employees they're not all right I'm sorry well Jerry's PTO doesn't matter anymore because he has all the time off for the rest of his goddamn life okay so I'm sorry Volo this had to be done well should we do the police are gonna wonder where these two where rats are and then just as he says that he kind of laughs out loud because he's like nobody really gives a [ __ ] about where rats so they're probably not gonna do that he's like we're actually we're actually probably fine actually all right here's what we're gonna do all right we're gonna clean up the crime yeah we had dumped these bodies somewhere I don't we can burn them can't we yeah probably all right we got a fireplace [ __ ] throw them in the fireplace burn them up clean up the blood and the evidence tomorrow morning I'm going over to that [ __ ] coffee shop flame spell green flame blade what the [ __ ] is that why didn't I use that wait a minute do they have anything that would if I were to show it's the coffee that they would know that we killed him like a ring or something the note yeah alright I know what I'm doing tomorrow morning like I know what I'm doing I know what's up green fire leaps probably target to a different creature we're choice thing can see within five great fire damage blah that I don't know if pressed education makes fire that will actually burn stuff I think it's I don't know like a mental one yeah yeah we have a fire plentiful trick yeah we have a fireplace just yeah let's just do that all right yet so let's burn some bodies ah no we're gonna have three ghosts in here now looking at our stuff IRA said $45 this whole time but now she is 60 because you guys gave 2200 and now right now I have 15 so it's been a long night I'm sorry iris I overreacted and I know we didn't need to do that but I had to stop this I'm sorry iris cuz I think we should take the bodies to the lake let's take the bodies to the lake let's take the bodies to the lake but yeah we have to do this sneakily because then if anybody sees us dragging the investigators of the terrorist attack that happened in front of our house alright well sneak iris I get it yeah I get it alright we're gonna sneak [ __ ] chop him up put him in a bag let's [ __ ] go all right all right let's meet puzzle this [ __ ] out okay and then bolo is just like he goes back to drinking basically because he's like oh [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] yeah yeah Volo you [ __ ] just sit there have your nice [ __ ] margaritas we're gonna do the heavy lifting right now all right I'm sorry bolo this is how it has to be well just disassociating he got really close with Jerry and Steve 25 sneak I get roll the real one all right yep okay does a 15 sneak a 15 I'm gonna say is good for is good yeah I say 15 is good because you're you're under the cover of you actually have advantage oh it's okay I could roll again to was a 14-0 Irish rolled the 19 so then I'm gonna say that's good for the both of you okay yeah so you guys definitely sneak over to the lake where you found iris communing with her God her patron and you throw the bodies into the lake iris grossly gets into the lake with the bodies and just starts to commune with their patron and like basically you see like what plays out on her face even though you don't hear it other than maybe some deep bassy guttural sounds you see on her face like a conversation like I don't know what that I listen I I do a lot for you you need to do something for me one time well I mean I know I'm your servant but like you need to like help me out sometimes or else I'm not gonna be with Amos you're like it's like a pretty heated argument like much like a child would have with their parents yeah they're not you know yeah so then basically you see tentacles come out of the water and this time not out of iris grab the bodies and then bring them into the water damn yeah and then I always comes back in and she's like alright

"u6MfZbCvPCw": "[Brady] What is the most dangerous chemical you've ever handled? The most dangerous chemical, I believe, was one called cyclopentadienyl nickel nitrosyl. It was claimed at the time to be one of the most poisonous chemicals in the world. It's a blood red coloured liquid - it looks pretty evil. And I dropped the bottle on the floor, and it broke. But fortunately only the neck of the bottle broke, so I could pick it up, and none came out. The molecule, or the material I've had to handle with the most care, let's say, is probably tertiary Butyllithium. And, I used this as a PhD student, and it's a fantastic reagent, we use it as a strong base when we're doing synthetic chemistry. But, if you take a concentrated solution of tertiary Butyllithium, in a syringe and you squirt it, it bursts into flames instantaneously when it hits the atmosphere. I suppose it's similar to many other things that Steve has shown us on some of his videos, like the Zinc chemistry. Tertiary Butyllithium, actually, is one of the most - one of the molecules that I have the utmost respect for. Probably the most dangerous situation that I've found myself in whilst handling compounds is when I had an ampoule, - so an ampoule for those of you who don't know, is a bottle which is completely sealed. That's all glass, and you have to break it with a hammer to get to the contents. and I had a 250ml bottle of SO_3, and I needed to pour this into a vial which we could open and close, or a bottle we could open and close. So I got my hammer, I'd pre-scored the glass, and - I don't have an ampoule here today but - you can imagine a sort of - a bottle, and then it goes up to a neck, and you get a thin piece at the top, and you hit that off with a hammer. So I did this, I'd three pairs of gloves on, two lab coats, and this was all wrapped round. We were in a very good fume hood with scrubbers and all the rest of it. I hit this off, and immediately, as soon as SO_3 hits water in the air, you get sulfuric acid. And there were just clouds and clouds of sulfuric acid. And there I was pouring this stuff in to the glass bottle, as quick as I could. Put the top on. It was like \"Wow, thank goodness for that.\" And the - I'd three pairs of very thick gloves on, The outer one, it completely dissolved. It was black. The second one, was pretty black as well. Luckily, the third one was intact, we were okay. But, yeah, that was a scary, scary time. And it was good fun. [He laughs]", "dP3Z8ShTmW0": "g'day welcome back to the 40 channel so we've got to get this chassis rolling [Music] again [Music] it's been a little while since we've done anything to it heaps of stuff going on which is okay we're going to rip the springs off the axles with the axles a really good cleanup freshen up order oil our new suspension hopefully it'll be here within the next week or so and we fit it all up that way we can move it in and out get some more room in here and we can move forward on the fj 45 project right now the first thing we're going to do obviously is going to rip these monstrous springs off they are some seriously solid springs now being a ute and obviously a fire truck i would assume that these springs have been upgraded at some stage with the original u-bolts on here but amazingly it's only just been held on at the bottom of the nut there i would not recommend doing that ideally you want to have at least three threads hanging out past your nut and we're only just hanging on by about half a nut with these monstrous springs and these and these u-bolts so that's not ideal but it might make it a bit easier to come off because the end of the threads haven't been damaged as it's been cruising along well we're just going to hit with the r10 pretty rusted up so we're just using a 19mm socket didn't come off too bad might actually go get the impact driver see how they come off with that [Music] the original u-bolts are in really good condition and i'd actually say probably what saved him is that the nuts were only about this far on so you can see the end of the nuts have been damaged but we've had no damage to the thread and they could possibly be kept for another project or used on this one but we're going to put all new gear on it so we'll keep these for something else a bit later on our support plates again are in great condition just going to cut these rubbers off get all new rubbers when we get the suspension this thread is again in excellent condition let's give it a clean up with a wire brush clean this all up give it a good paint do all like new let's whip the other side off all right so one of these u-bolts are a little bit worn away so it's really tuning into thread which compromises the u-bolt so it gives it a weak point and that's a possible point where it could snap later on so it's probably a good thing that would rip these off and then we're going to replace them but we can still keep this you never know for an emergency backup or spare or something like that don't just chuck them out hang on to them take care when you're lifting these rear springs they're ridiculously heavy so you do think you need to lift on your own you've got no one else to help you out make sure you lift from your legs and don't bend over straight from your back right i'm going to take the rear brake line off this goes between the two brake cylinders behind the brake drum so we take them off now as always we're keeping everything we're bagging it and labeling it so that way we don't lose it down the track if you can't adjust the torque setting on the impact driver then you're better off just using one by hand make sure you grab all these copper washers don't lose them we're now going to remove all the hardware off these axles so we've already moved the brake lines we're going to remove the little diff breathers so we can keep all these tabs these ones are tack welded on so that's okay we'll just have to work carefully around them with the wire wheel but we'll pull these off right here now we don't want to leave that hole exposed so just get a m10 by 1.25 we're just going to screw that in there that way we can work right around at the wire wheel we're not going to damage the diff breather by blocking that hole off we're stopping any rubbish or any gunk getting inside there getting inside our diff gears so that way we try to keep it as clean as possible all right time to clean up this axle strangely enough this was the same that was on my last one got all this splatter that's built up over here from when they welded it i guess in the factory and it was never cleaned up so uh quality wasn't a major thing back then i wouldn't imagine back in 1965 so we're going to clean all that splatter up and make it look nice and smooth and [Music] pretty [Music] all right now that's cleaned up really nicely we've flat disc before that welding splatter's gone now what we're gonna do now is give it a quick clean over with a stripper disc and then we'll finish off with wire wheel we're ready for some paint [Music] now let's check on the wire [Music] wire wheel and then the whole wire brush to finish it off [Music] my wife to the rescue thanks all right so cleaned up this axle really well and you're probably wondering if i'm going to paint this what am i going to do with the rest of this well the idea is because you don't have much room we don't have cranes we don't have workbenches that we can just throw it along we're doing it all outside here if we can clean up this whole axle we can paint right up to the ends here and then when we put the suspension and the axles onto the chassis we can pull off the wheels pull off all the brakes pull up the backing and we can clean all that up and paint all that up separately so i'm not too concerned about any of this at the moment because all that can be cleaned up and painted at a later date there is a method to madness [Applause] [Music] [Music] right now we're done it looks smick ass actually it's smooth it's clean give it a really good clean down with some wax and grease remover and then we'll hit it with some oxidizing primer i'm gonna clean the whole axle down with some uh chem tools wax and grease remover great thing is i got one of these little pump bottles fantastic so again you can get these from chem tools just pump it up spray it on we'll wipe it down if you're struggling for rags i recommend just ripping out one of the kids bed sheets they won't know any different i'm not actually joking bed ink and this is one of the kids bed sheets all the wax and grease remover wipe the whole lot off not only will that remove any of that leftover dirt and wax grease obviously dust and all that stuff get rid of it all but you don't want any wet patches at all so once you've wiped over the entire lot just let it sit for a while you actually see it sort of evaporate last thing you want to do is spray paint over where it's still wet the galmax zph also comes in a nice handy sprayable aerosol can the beauty of the zph is if it's lightly rusted just give it a bit of a buff back with a wire wheel clean it up best you can clean up with some wax and grease remover and the zph can be used directly over rusty surfaces this is a gray oxidizing metal primer so it'll seal up the rust and give us a good base to spray a top coat on over there now i know i'm going to get in trouble for this and i should be wearing a mask i'd put a mask on if i was you guys i'm just being really lazy most other primers like your gow primer or your etch primer has that dull matte finish your zph comes up with a high gloss tough finish before you even put your top coat on i really like this stuff very impressed now as with the chassis we're going to go overboard so with the chassis we did some serious rasp protection so this axle is going to be well and truly protected from any corrosion down the track [Music] oh [Music] [Music] all right jack we've just got a bit of delivery for the uh fire truck this stuff has come all the way from perth now that's three thousand seven hundred kilometers this stuff has traveled just for us to get to [Music] cool some rusty bits from rusty right hey front driveshaft the reason for that is because jack smashed it over his head because jack tried to karate chop it jack tried to bite it how do reasons so that was the uh front drive shaft that we pulled out it uh wasn't going to do us any good how'd that happen jack no clue he knows so we've got the steering box excellent right steering box what else we've got the other parts for it so we've got that like that nice all right let's open in the next box check this box out this is awesome yeah this is like an old chest from 1965. i'm going to be cool if we incorporated this old box on the back of the uh tray when we finish building it that would be cool that would be cool i think we should do it open it up jack let's see what's in it so this is how he sent it to me so rusty all the way from perth packed it up in this really cool box which just suits the era of our old fj45 so it's really cool i'm super impressed rusty i wasn't expecting this don't get packaging like this anymore all right jack what's in here take a look that looks very light i think that's what she likes to do wow wow an empty box oh i think it was just for the packing kid's gonna love that bubble wrap i know what's in there jack what we got ah our steering arm front right end and the reason we got this arm is because so that's the one that was on our cruiser very creatively put back together nice sort of strong back welded on it at some stage what else we got jack this is an exciting unboxing steering um column nice it's great nice where do you reckon that goes steering column yes nailed it so that goes into the steering box so here's inside the steering box you can see that turning this steering shaft moves backwards and forwards that is a really cool setup you don't see steering boxes like that anymore all right rusty thanks for that mate i'm uh i'm super impressed with the box i know i'm impressed with the parts and i'm stoked that i was able to chase some parts down which is good but uh i reckon we can incorporate this box what do you reckon okay we could on the back tray old-school toolbox all right we're continuing to prep all the stuff to get the suspension on which is now ordered but we're not going to get it in this episode we clean out all the bits of hardware that we've um ripped off the cruiser so there's a whole lot of sharp edges and burrs and all that type of stuff on these especially these rear plates obviously these have tapered absolutely caning over the last few years driving through the bush and scrub fighting fires and that type of stuff so we've cleaned all that up so there's no more burrs straighten it out it's quite dense we've got a hammer bending it back into shape it will come off nicely anything underneath the vehicle it's going to be really exposed to all sorts of environmental craziness if that makes any sense we're chucking on with the zph okay swing arm let's hammer into this swinger i'm going to strip this down punch out these bushes so bushes have also been ordered with a whole new suspension kit a bit of exciting news okay so here it is the suspension kit is coming from online auto parts so online auto parts and 40 channel we've got a bit of a collaboration going on which is really cool so they're going to jump on board they're going to help me out with some pricing but throughout the build what we're going to be able to do is show you some of their products so from online older parts the first step we're going to do is we've ordered a full tough dog suspension kit now this tough dog suspension kit is going to be awesome really looking forward to it now the cool thing about this tough dog suspension kit is we haven't just picked one straight off the shelf we've been able to talk to the guys at online auto parts to be able to work out exactly what we need for the truck we're building so they work out your weights they work out what you're going to be hanging on the front hanging off the back all that type of stuff all right so let's clean this swing arm up punch the bushes out give it a bit of a paint then we can set that aside and get that ready for the suspension install as well so just a 14 mil spanner all right so make sure you keep all these bolts they've got a reduced head on them and they've also got a castle nut on the back so we don't want to lose any of that type of stuff like everything through this build bag everything and label it these are in great condition not bent or damaged they just flared out a bit at the top so we'll just tap them back in straighten them up a bit punch these bushes out clean them up for paint all right so again we're going to use the same old trick this is actually a 15 mil socket just sit on the top and then we can punch out the bush makes it so much easier to get out let's knock this one out just going to give the bush area a little bit of a spray clamp to the bench hopefully that will make it a bit easier to get it out okay there's the old bush to me it looks like these bushes have been replaced before they actually look a little bit handmade it's okay it obviously did the job for all this time but we're gonna go with something a much better quality than what these are i can see the sky right so that's it for this episode looks like we didn't achieve much but i tell you what we've spent a stack of time prepping cleaning getting ready for the suspension fit up cleaned and prepped all the axles we strip down the swing arm or the componentry removing all the rust cleaning all up so we're making sure that we're going to be totally protected against all the extreme environments that this stuff's going to be exposed to so there's some really good news coming down our way too which is i'm pretty excited about actually so we've got our suspension order which is tough dog so tough dog suspensions coming in australian made poly tough bushes and all this is coming from online auto parts so it's really exciting online auto parts and 40 channel would come together so in turn will be sharing their products and how they're used in the fire truck build anyway guys we had a fantastic response from our chem tools giveaway last episode people from all around the world responded which is fantastic but the international winner hasn't come forward yet right hey guys thank you so much for your support it means an absolute lot to us feel free to give us a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe and make sure you take care of yourselves and until next time jack's not here to say thanks for watching", "_OXiTr6d77M": "a very good morning and jain children i hope you all are preparing well for your half yearly exams so children yesterday we have started the revision of the chemistry first chapter that is fibers to fabric okay and we have completed till the production of cotton so i hope you all have uh prepared well and revised well till the cotton so children as you know that the fibers are of two types that is natural fiber and synthetic fibers so natural fibers are those fibers that are obtained either from plants or animals they are called natural fibers okay in this chapter we are mainly focusing on the natural fibers so we have to study in detail about the four different types of natural fibers so first that's cotton second is silk third is wool and fourth is jute so about all these four different types of for natural fibers we have to study so um we have studied about the cotton and now today we'll continue with the production of wool silk jute and we'll also talk about the synthetic fibers okay so please now get a get ready with your science book check out your science book open this chapter fiber to fabric we are again going to revise this chapter okay and children i hope you all have learned the exercise as i have given you the homework yesterday to learn the exercise of the chapter so i hope you all have learned that so in the next zoom interactive class whenever we are having the next zoom interactive class we will discuss the oral question very short answer question choose the most appropriate answer and i'll also tell you few extra questions that can come in your exams all right so children um in zoom interactive class only we are going to practice the worksheets so till then please learn and revise these chapters in the zoom interactive class will practice the questions okay so um and then all then only i'll share the worksheet in your school app okay so today now i'm going to share the ppt and we will continue with the revision of this chapter so as we have done the introduction and we have done the revision of the introduction of this chapter that is what are the different types of cloth material we have studied what is the difference between fibers yarns and fabric this also we have studied now today we are going to revise how silk is made how wool is made how juts are made and what is the synthetic fibers and how synthetic fibers are made okay so let's start with it now i'm going to share the ppt okay so children we um were doing this and so we uh discussed this the production of goal we have discussed so let me again start with this okay uh so this topic we have covered we have discussed about the how cotton is produced how cotton fibers are made so i'm again quickly revising you this topic so children you can see the first figure it is a cotton plant from here the cotton bowl is removed and plugged out then the seed is removed from this cotton the process is called ginning then this seeds these fibers of cotton are spun the process is called spinning spinning is basically the process of formation of yarns okay from the fiber so now the yarn is prepared yarn can also be prepared by two methods either by a hand spindle or by charcoal okay and after the yarn is made it is then weaved either in the power loop or in with the help of a hand loop now these yarns are weaved together to form a fabric and then these fabrics are dyed okay color so that the fabric is colorful and we wear it accordingly okay so then a beautiful clothe is prepared so this was uh the production of cotton now moving ahead with the production of wool so children we know that the wool is prepared or wool is manufactured or it is taken out from the sheep it is basically the fleece of sheep okay the fleece of sheep is removed from the body of a sheep or it is basically the hair of the sheep that is removed from its body this process is called children sharing this process is called shearing s h e a r i n g the removal of the hair from the sheep is known as shearing okay now after the um this hair is removed from the sheep the bundle of for this sleep uh this fleece is made and it is transported to the mill okay now where in the mill what happens these um this uh uh like the bunch of the hair of the sheep is washed all the dirt is removed and it is made to dry dry mujata they an instrument through which the fiber is now converted into yarns okay after washing it is converted into a fiber and then these fibers with the help of for this machine it is spun together and it is formed into a yarn okay now these yarns are again sold in the market after it get dies okay so and then we twist and turn it and then it is converted into the bowl of wool that is sold in the market so i think every month everybody must have seen the yarn of a wool yes so just say i'm sweating that is called the yarn off okay so let's see children what is written in the chapter so we'll go through the chapter also so let's see what is written here okay so we have discussed about the cotton we have seen what is cotton and everything this we have covered so we have seen what is ginning what is a spinning what is weaving this also we have seen okay now moving to the wool this is important children so wool is the fiber derived from hair of it is derived from the hair of sheep this is important this is basically the hair of sheep okay this removing the wool from sheep using a special clippers is called shearing this is important children this is called shearing decapoli after the shearing the wool is packed in bales and transported to the mills as i have told you here it is cleaned and then combed by a machine with the help of machine and the yarns are made it is spun into a fiber and then yarns are made okay now after that knitting is done sweater knitting is different from weaving knitting is different and weaving is different in knitting we take a single yarn and we knit it i'm sweating a single answer but in case of weaving the multiple yarns are clubbed together and they are then converted into a fabric okay so this is the difference between knitting and weaving okay getting my point this is important here okay uh then we know the texture of wool we know that full is fluffy in nature it can retain air children because it can retain air that is why it gives us heat it gives our body heat and hence we wear a woolen cloth in winter season okay that is why we wear woolen clothes in winter season because it can hold the air body past and our body feels warm okay so this is uh the reason why we wear woolen clothes in winter okay so children here very important thing about the history of wool is australia is the leading producer of vulture and please underline this line in your book australia is the leading producer of bull in world and followed by new zealand so first is australia and then second is new zealand okay so the first production of wool is there in australia and then in new zealand and then china and india okay so this is important please underline this line children i hope you have done this oral question and you have learnt it also so whenever we are having the zoom interactive class i'll ask you the oral question so be prepared for that okay so that was about the wool now coming on to silk this is important children so well we get it from the animal that is sheep so that is called a animal fiber silk also we get it from animal that is silk warm okay and again it is an animal fiber so i'll show you the complete cycle and the complete process how the silk is made okay so i'm again going to share this ppt and you will see okay so are you able to see this so coming on to silk children this figure is the complete life cycle of a silk wall so basically silk is produced from a silk warm what is silk warm see we have a moth here this is a moth apne moth so this is a mod that is like a butterfly butterfly butterfly the wings of butterfly are attached together but moth is having a spread with rings okay now these mods lay hundreds of eggs these moth lays hundreds of egg in a mulberry tree okay in a mulberry tree they lace hundreds of eggs now after they lay hundreds of eggs after some time these eggs burst and caterpillar comes out of it a small caterpillar comes out of it of a black color you can see here in the figure now these caterpillar starts to eat these mulberry leaves so they start to eat the mulberry leaves now when they eat these mulberry leaf they become more and more stronger and because they are becoming more and more stronger they start to secrete a white thread like structure and it starts to cover its body with that white thread okay as you can see here in the figure okay this is called larvae stage now here you can see a multiple threads coming out of this uh caterpillar and the caterpillar has covered its body with a multiple thread so this is called cocoon what it is cultural this stage of growth of silkworm is called cocoon okay now this cocoon when it is exposed to water and air the counter covering of this cocoon becomes harder okay and inside this cocoon there is still a caterpillar and this now the caterpillar is called pupa okay now this becomes so hard and after this at this stage only outer cover at this stage only this cocoon is taken out and it is boiled and a thread of silk is taken out from the cocoon of cat or cocoon of the silk wall okay and hence the silk fiber or silk fabric is made okay so i'm again repeating this this is a moth it lays hundred of eggs in a mulberry tree the caterpillar comes out of the egg and it eats the mulberry leaf and it starts to secrete a white uh thread like a structure and cover its body with it and forms a cocoon now this cocoon becomes harder and then what they do this cocoon is taken away and it is boiled to kill the silk worm present inside it and the silk or a thread is taken from this cocoon okay and hence the silk fiber or silk fabric is made okay so this is the complete process or the complete cycle of silk wall okay and let's see what is written in the chapter silk so silk is obtained from the cocoon of the silk worm so i have shown you the cocoon you can also see here in the figure you can also see here this is a cocoon this white uh thread like structure you can see here is covered and it is a very hard covering this is our cocoon okay silk warm and a cocoon okay so uh the silkworms are fed on the leaves of mulberry trees each warm spin continues thread up to eight hundred meter long thread it is almost 800 meter long okay then the cocoon is boiled in water to kill the silk warm and then unwind to get silk fiber okay then these threads are taken out and the silk fiber is made the rearing of silk worm for the production of silk is called seri culture this is important please underline this line the rearing of silk wall for the production of silk is called cere culture s is a silk so you can remember from here s for silk and s for seri so silk is or seri culture is related to silk okay now coming on to the history of silk so important thing here is that silk was first developed in china okay possibly five thousand to eight thousand years ago then there was a trading of silk between the europe and asia and it became and the route through which the trading was done was called a silk road okay so this is important about silk now coming next to jute so children i think you everybody has seen a jute material everybody has seen a rucksack everybody has seen a juice bag and everything so basically jude if we talk about the texture of jute so it is a bit rough and it is very strong so that if we put a very heavy weight or if we put a very heavy vegetables inside it it can hold it will not break so it's strength is very high okay and it is a bit of a rough texture but it is very durable okay so let's see how jute is made we know that jut is made from a jute plant okay and it is a type of a plant fiber like cotton is a plant fiber jute is also a plant fiber whereas silk and wool are animal fiber okay so this is jute let's see the structure and the figure of jute plant so coming on to the jute plant see children this is a jute fiber you can see here this is a jute fiber a thread like a structure of jute is called jute fiber when from these fibers the materials are made it is called jute material so you can see here it is a ruck sack then we have a bag of jute okay now coming to coming next to the production of jute basically children during the production of jute we it is produced in basically warm and humid temperature we require a very warm and humid climate with plenty of rainfall the rainfall should be in abundance okay and it is basically found in the sundarban area of india in west bengal and bangladesh okay so this is a jute plant you can see here in the figure so ismith there is a stock this is a stock and they are a leaf okay so uh basically when jute is formed from a jute plant we don't require the leaf we require stock of the jute plant okay so we require the stock of jute plant now what happens in the process the stock of jute plant is taken out from the truth plant and then it is soaked in water for about 20 days it is soaked in the water for about 20 okay now this process is known as rating this is important this process is known as retting okay now after 20 days this jute stock is washed so you can see here here the jute stock was looking a bit of a greenish color because of the presence of chlorophyll but now the chlorophyll has gone the no content of chlorophyll is present and it is now a brownish in shade okay you can see here in the figure now after washing the stock it is put for drying so it is hanged to dry the sim cap there so now it is hang for dry now after it is dried it is sent to an industry where these fibers are polished and it is converted into yarns and now the bundle of yarns are formed and again it is sent to a market to form a material so this is the complete process how jute is made or how truth is produced okay so because you have studied it earlier i am going bit fast with this topic i hope you have understood it so the water the jute stock is soaked for 20 days then it is warm and it is hang to dry then a yarn is made and from yarn the material is getting it so now coming back to the chapter let's see what is written in the chapter yes jute so important thing here is jute is bio degradable it has high durability and strength biodegradation is breaking down it into smaller pieces so that it can merge with the soil okay so this is called biodegradability so jute is biodegradable in nature it is durable in nature and it has a high strength what is durability durability means the strength durable even if we put a very heavy weight in that then also it will not get turned off okay so this is the durability and strength of the material okay so uh we know that jute is best grown in warm humid climate with plenty of rainfall it grows best in the alluvial soil this all we have is to eat this we have talked about okay uh now coming on to here that is after harvesting the stock of plants are tied and ritted reddit means soaked in water for about 20 days okay this process softens the tissues and permits the fiber to be separated so again i have explained you this topic so please children read this topic if you come across any kind of doubt please do ask so apart from these uh natural fibers we also have few other types of natural fibers that is coil and silk cotton so these two are again a new type of natural fiber so coil is basically obtained okay so because it is easily available it is cheap and it is resistant to the salt water isla and nowadays the door mats brushes mattresses sackings and ropes are made from coils okay so let me show you the figure so i'll show you the figure here just a second yes so this is the outer shell of coconut yes everybody has seen it from these shells of coconut doormat mattresses brushes all these things are made okay so nowadays coir is used and also silk cotton is used uh cotton is present inside that uh it is present inside that the soft toy or the cushion okay but it is not pure cotton it is a bit shiny in texture and a shiny cotton is present so children that is called a silk cotton okay so let's see what is written in the chapter first so that is a cell cotton when silk is mixed with the cotton it is called silk cotton it is basically very light and fluffy okay used in the stuffing as a cushion and in the soft choice also okay so these are the two other types of natural fibers that are important now moving to the last topic of this chapter that is synthetic fiber so we have talked about the natural fibers so natural fibers are basically made up of plants and animals now we have a synthetic fibers synthetic fibers are also called human-made fiber or artificial factors they are also called human-made fiber or artificial fibers because it is made from the artificial process or it is made from the chemical that we use basically petroleum so few examples are mentioned here that is nylon and polyester are the synthetic fibers what is basically done is the we take a plastic material okay we boil it or we heat it and these plastic gets melted give your plastic milk then we pass it through a spinneret what is the spinneret i'll show you after a while a spinner it is a net like structure it has a small small holes from that these melted plastics are poured in that spirit and a thread of the heated plastics come out and when these plastics heated plastic come out it is allowed to cool down for some time and hence it is again then converted into a fiber okay so i'll show you the diagram so just a minute yes so see this is a spinneret this is a spinneret you can see the white thread like structure is coming so this is the heated plastic heated plastic [Applause] a plastic will come out in the form of a thread and then it is cooled down and solidified okay and then it is twisted and turned to make a yarn and hence a septic cloth okay so that was about the chapter so we have almost revised all the topics of this chapter okay let's see if anything is left so we have covered this synthetic fibers also we have so i think nothing is left children please do uh learn these oral question answers and exercise of this chapter so we will discuss and i'll ask you these questions whenever we are meeting again for the zoom interactive class okay so children be prepared for it so that's all for today's class children i hope you have understood the chapter please learn it please study the chapter very well okay so that's all for today's class thank you enjoy", "zOtlby-CPts": "what's up guys patrick wolf here so i've always been a fan of skill builds in this game especially playing in legendary missions solo the skill build i'm gonna be showcasing today is the highest amount of damage you can possibly get from a skill build in title update 12. the turret and drone combination is one of my favorites and this is going to be perfect for that i have made a pts video link will be in the description and at the end of the video i go in depth with this build comparing it with the new gear set and brand set empress international we put a whole bunch of combinations together and i find out that this is the highest amount of damage that you can possibly get in tu12 with a skill built so i'm very pleased to bring this bill to you guys i had to grind out to get level 90 to acquire the waveform holster this is going to be a very very and highly anticipated build video i think this will be my best skill build i've ever released in this game and let's get straight into the gameplay you're watching me do some footage it's just going to be some casual legendary mission this is the first run i did of t of fresh t12 gameplay this is my first run of this mission guys so i do apologize i'm a bit rusty but it goes to show how strong this build actually is notice the damage you can hit over 400k a shot with your turret when you have the artificer hive but in the gameplay i just use the turret and the drone i think it's a really really good combination so enjoy the gameplay and we'll get into the build in a second much alright from oh um coming in the book hopefully you guys did enjoy that gameplay so let's get straight into the specialization and crack on with this build because i don't want to talk too much about this we have gone in depth like i said before in the video in the description the tu12 pts video i made basically what's changed since then is we actually have a bit more skill damage from the capacitor weapon which you guys need to acquire so make sure you go and get that i made a video about that link will also be in the description how to acquire it takes about 20 minutes you get it from summit challenges so the specialization we need to use is technician because it gives us an extra skill tier it's just very very good and the artificial hive is unbelievable it allows us to give our turret that beautiful over 400k uh shot damage which you can acquire if you get everything in combination that is uh when you go into the firing range when you're in a mission to get over 410 420k a shot with your turret you would need to have overcharge artificial hive proc a full stack of the capacitor and also the waveform to be on the correct side for your your turret and uh also perfect combined arms to be fully procked so that's how you can acquire upwards of 420k a shot with this turret but it's not really that important you can use whatever skill you want with this you don't have to use artificial hive you can just use the turret and drone combination that's my favorite but you can also use the oxidizer chem launcher it's really really good hit over 600k a tick and it lasts forever so let's go through the special edition further so make sure this is definitely activated because this is important amped gives us one skill tier you can also have the named pistol which gives you an additional tier but i wouldn't really recommend it you can if you want to and have two reds or two blues but having an extra red i think is more important because the capacitor is just really good with the damage and it just helps you just hit even harder but it doesn't really matter you can just go for whatever specialization whatever gun it's completely up to you guys if you want to use spike rather than the capacitor you can go for that but i do recommend using it because you get 60 percent skill damage so make sure assault rifle damage is up if you're going to use it and everything else needs to be activated as well this is very nice also 12 damage to drone skill proxies and robotics because those robot dogs they push you they are very aggressive and this helps you get them down a lot faster also make sure you have skill damage proct on the overclocked cpu the passive tenant make sure that's activated and everything else should be uh with regards to faraday field remember that when you drop your hive because your hive can be on your back if you're going to be using this artificial hive if it's on your back this will not proc so make sure you drop it near you i don't think it procs but just double check that guys there will be like a blue line going towards the the skill and that allows you to be immune from shock and disruption which can be quite important we have discussed that before but just a quick little side note so once you've done that let's have a look at the build like i said before this is the the most damage you can get from a skill build in this game county there's no build that will give you more damage i've done countless testing and in the comments section i've also done research online and you guys do agree with me and this is probably the way to go but if you find something out that i don't know of let me know in the comments because you never know we might discover something hard wired is very close to this but hard wired three-piece it gives us about 2 000 a shot less than empress international because that gives us 20 skill damage whereas uh the hard ride only gives us 15 so just keep that in mind also if you get stuck a bit of headshot damage with for example providence defense that will work with the drone or the turret but if you want to use other skills it's not really a true skill build then so that's why i've gone for the wyvern way so you can also change that because the drone and tire do actually hit head shots and you can acquire possibly a slightly more to the head if you're hitting headshots with the drone but it depends what npc you're facing it depends what skills you're using so i want to make sure that we only have skill damage but even with that being said you know this is still the highest amount of skill dams you could possibly get uh with a skill built so let's have a look at the weapon first so we have got the capacitor make sure you guys acquire this it's very good that's 60 skill damage and we get forty five percent weapon damage from having skill tier six so six tiers we only have five but actually no we've got six because of the technician specialization which is very good and then we that gives us 45 weapon damage which means you can actually hit quite a lot of damage with this and it's important to note that we have got perfect combined arms which requires us to hit our shots every couple of seconds so this is going to match perfectly with the backpack talent so make sure you guys have this activated the decay is very slow and it doesn't really matter at all then once you've make sure you you try and get this as high as possible go recalibrate it because this is a very very strong weapon you get damage to armor and health damage which is a great combination there are also some good modifications on here if you guys didn't know uh we've got more crit chance and more cut damage than usual on each mod which is very very nice as well the secondary weapon i would go for the mechanical animal you can go for whatever you want it's completely up to you perfectly in sync is very close to the damage of the capacitor so it's up to you guys whatever you want to be utilizing but this gives us overcharge which gives us that huge amount of damage from the turret upwards of 420k a shot so make sure you guys use whatever pistol you want as well but the card custom is probably the one to go for if you want to put it extra blue or yellow and then just hold the pistol when you're doing damage with your skills it's completely up to you you can do that as well then we have got obviously one red and then five yellows but because we got technician that gives us an additional yellow so this build has got one wyven three empress international the waveform holster and the perfectly combined arms bag now you can use another hanayu chest it doesn't matter because the one piece is skill damage and the two-piece honey is also skill damage so it's completely up to you it probably would look a bit nicer if you have 200u but i don't have the best one you're probably thinking to yourself glass cannon that's a bit tricky glass cannon is more damage than the new rigger gear set it is way more so i don't recommend using the new rigger gear set with if you want to get the most amount of damage it is way less because this is amplified damage uh even though the chest piece from the rigger sounds like it would be more it is not we've i've done all the testing so you can just take my word for it guys or go test it for yourself so we have got three piece empress international as well which gives us uh skill damage 10 and skill efficiency which is damage haste duration all of that stuff so that's also damage that's 20 skill damage for the three piece very good best in slot by far and the waveform holster now this is important to note so our damage is going to be swapping from one to the other so we create a stack of 30 skill damage one of your skills every second capping at 10 stacks so it's 30 skill damage it's a must have for any kind of skill damage build i have a few combinations coming up so if you guys are thinking about making other builds like with the rigger i will be bringing out builds with that so don't you worry so make sure that notification bell is clicked so this is situational with some skills like the chem launcher because if the damage is not on the right hand side it goes from right to left so if it's on the right it's your right hand skills and left left hand still the arrows point left and right and then you know if you're shooting your camera it might not be on that damaged side which is not the end of the world but it is important to note that's why using the drone of the turret is the best combination to have with this holster but let's just go through the build from the beginning so i'm sure you can see what i mean this works perfectly with with the capacitor because we have perfectly combined arms this is 30 skill damage for three seconds works very well with this if you don't want to use this i will be making another gear set soon against that video or skill build video where we use tech support so just try and find that first so we have got the weapons covered so let's go through the actual each individual piece so all of my modifications i have put skill haste try and get those juicy 12 skill haste mods if you can so like i said before three three-piece empress international we have got the uh weapon damage role as the core tribute for this one because of technician uh so skill health skill damage skill efficiency this works great i think my skill has about 130 which is really really nice so skill damage and skill haste is what we want to roll on absolutely everything so the three piece is going to have skill damage skill haste again on the knee pads skill damage skill haste and then with the chest piece we've got skill damage unfortunately it's not skill haste but we do have the one piece skill damage which is great glass cannon amplified 25 weapon damage i know a lot of you guys don't like using glass cannon but i recommend it because if you want to get the most damage this is what this build is about is how to get the most damage out of your skills so the holster is the cornerstone of the build to be honest that's 30 skill damage that swaps from left to right every 10 seconds which is very very nice still has skill damage there so just remember that you don't have to pay attention to this unless you're using a situational skill like a chem launcher which only does damage once you use it whereas you know if you've got automatic firing skills like the drone or turret you don't have to worry about it at all so the backpack we have got the one piece hunter you you're probably wondering why i've only got the one piece because it is the best combination and unfortunately uh you just don't have the skill damage but that skill damage is acquired from the the one-piece wyvern so you can have two piece hunter you it doesn't matter but you know if you try different combinations maybe take one of these out it does it doesn't give you more damage so it's just one of those things like i discussed in the pts footage so skill damage and skill has once again there perfect combined arms as long as you're shooting the npcs keeping that capacitor stack up and you know procking perfect combined arms with glass cannon and the waveformers on your skills you will be absolutely destroying content in this game this is for the most difficult content in the entire game legendary missions are a breeze with this as you saw from the footage uh i didn't show the whole thing because i don't want you guys to watch a 40 minute video it takes about 40 minutes to use this build it's very easy you throw your skills and that's that so we've gone through the build let's go through the statistics quickly like i said before if you guys want a full detailed description uh my pts video will be in the description so we have got chance good damage nothing to worry about there you guys can pause the video if you want to go through the stats in detail let's just have a look at the skill haste now 130 skill haste which is really really nice i really enjoy that skills come back really really quickly so with regards to the actual skills themselves make sure you put the right mods on skill haste we've got more damage now you can if you use demolitionist make sure you put this ssg cpu version 2 on which gives us 10 skill damage mortar damage sorry so health don't i don't recommend it just go for duration then with the secondary skill or the other skill we've got the drone this little drone does a lot of damage it takes away the aggro it's very strong i really do enjoy especially when npcs are being stubborn and hiding behind cover this will push them and actually get them out and you can dish out quite a lot of damage over 200k bullet so i really do recommend this uh i have got a shaytech skin this was for pre-ordering the game getting the ultimate edition it's not really fancy it doesn't really look it hardly does anything but anyways what that was not a waste of money okay so armor repair that's completely useless for this but i don't have any more mods for some reason i think i'm gonna go and have to craft some more i don't know why guys some of my skills have got really bad mods on them but yeah so this build like i said before is the the the most amount of skill damage you can get in the build county and 212. let me know what you guys think in the comments is there something that you're gonna be using like i said i will be bringing more builds out very soon so make sure you guys leave a like subscribe and i'll be seeing everyone in the next video peace out guys", "SnIq0_sH1y8": "but they are now this fibers so what do you mean by fibers how they are obtained thread like part in animals and vegetable dishes is called fibers understood so i have a doubt it's an indirect statement it's not directly given it red lightness is there how old is yes one minute red like thing is apart from animals and even vegetable tissues in the controllers even when we go to the glute and all we get some problems so which is obtained from plants and animals are considered as fiber okay so generally i have given different kinds of fibers which are used in textile industry understood so these fibers are very very important okay not only textile industry many other like stitching of nets understood that yes bags curtains and different kinds of users are there okay so all these are mainly how these are obtained these are obtained on the basis of this threads how these threads are obtained these threads are obtained from the raw material of from plants and animals so they'll take the required source from the plants and animals and then go with it with the different treatments with different chemicals are used here and we'll get finally we'll get the fiber and we'll go with the ironing process um i would like to ask something like i have heard about about some dress that this should dry you are stranded what does it mean even mean dry washing to dry wash in the sands the material like all that there are different kinds of fibers am i so different when we go with the different kinds of fibers simply i can say that cotton is also fiber so it is also a fiber rule is also a fiber okay so based on this we can see that sensitivity sensitivity means some material it it leads to strongness strength and tensile strength is high so it doesn't require the drywash so some uh fibers if we select some fibers that fiber is required the it doesn't require it doesn't have that much strength so it required dry washing distance sensually not by using harsh chemicals harsh detergents hearts heart soap solutions so they'll go with mild soap solution to clear the dirt and to make the texture not to become dull so that they'll go with a different treatment that is nothing but dry wash okay mom i understand yes it is based upon entirely based upon the fiber with which the material textile material is made up of english nylon is the type of nylon is a strong fiber that's what will go one by one will go one by one then only we can go with the examples so that you will be having the white idea about it so that uh you won't have any conclusion uh between the what i mean to between this natural and the synthetic fibers will go classification so mainly these fibers are classified into three types children what are their natural fibers semi-synthetic artificial or synthetic fibers okay so classification why this classification occurs mainly mainly why this classification occurs is to know the source to know the source of the fibers where it is obtained especially if it is natural fiber natural fiber is mainly obtained from plants and animals semi-synthetic means here the raw material can be natural fiber understood natural whether it is from plants or animals semi-synthetic means half naturally obtained and remaining is made up of man-made or synthetic uh fiber can you give me an example of semi-synthetic because i haven't actually heard about it semi-synthetic are nothing but blending blending simply with the cotton and the synthetic fiber is a mixture of blood like if cotton and another world knows like another chemicals another synthetic fibers are considered as semi-synthetic what do you mean by means so half is natural and a half is man-made if you go with artificial fiber entirely it is of use by chemicals so that will get an extraction from the chemicals we'll get the fibers that is all these all these blendings are completely they are made up of synthetic fibers okay i understood so especially we need to much more understand about the introduction part of it what do you mean by the introduction of what you have understood about the interaction for children uh uh like thread part of animals and vegetable tissues is called fibers yeah there are three types of fibers they are uh like classification of fibers they are natural semi-synthetic artificial so semi-synthetic means its partial uh natural naturally obtained and partially man-made what we can say chemicals are used to obtain always why we go with semi-synthetic is whatever we go whichever is the product not only about the fibers if you have taken anything other than the fibers definitely there is a blending one blending one is much more stronger for example for example the best example other than fiber i can give like alloy what do you mean by alloy i know this is a combination of two things two things of metals two things of non-metals very good pregnant very good well done okay two things of what we can say that different kinds of metals different kinds of non-metals static and artificial fiber so these naturally put them mainly from the raw materials okay especially from the raw material so these are natural fiber so when we think this what are the raw materials we'll go with children uh raw materials raw materials the source the main source of this natural fibers mom i think they are like um animals and plants yes girls and plants okay so i i'm going to show you it yes these are natural fibers so fibers which obtained from plants are called plant fibers fibers which obtained from animals are called animal fibers so plant fibers and animal fibers these two are from the these from like natural fibers are obtained from plants and animals understood children so natural fiber are two types what are the two types of natural fibers one is plant fiber another one is animal fiber what do you mean by plant fiber mom uh like the um fibers that you obtain from trees herbs shrubs and plants i'm gonna just go back to that slide yeah yeah and yes so that uh i've been colorful where uh i have gone with why because so that it is you can write the highlighted ones it's better to note down children why because when you're going with the weekend test so all these are very much beneficial mom can i ask a question yes pregnant animal fibers can you give me a few examples of animal fibers yes yeah yeah you want me to give the animal fibers example yeah i'm actually uh yeah yeah can i answer the question yeah yeah yes um from sheep we get wool and camel we use their skin leather okay mom i have a doubt that is this camels can be used and they are known as leather if they are they semi synthetic yes so natural fibers when we go to the plant fiber and animal fiber so in general what are the animal fibers animal fibers were considered ole is an animal fiber am right yeah mom so what do you mean the semi-synthetic polymol polycot polycarb so poly means that the monomer is used and the caught in the since cotton is used polyvolements polyurethane polyester and um mom poly wool natural fiber [Music] this is about plant fiber and animal fiber and natural fiber so we have discussed about the introduction we have discussed about the natural fibers right so natural fibers are of two types one is the plant fiber and the other one is the animal fiber so fibers which is obtained from plants are called plant fibers fibers which are which which obtained from animals are called animal fiber so can you please give me the examples for the plant fiber children uh plant fiber uh like juice important and uh silk silk but i want okay leave so when we discuss about the natural fibers especially the brand fiber there are many examples for the plant fibers cotton juice silk why they'll go with the silk children silk is obtained here silk is obtained from silkworms silk is obtained from silkworms but if we go to the structure if we go to the cycle of the silk especially these cells are obtained by eating mulberry plants understood mulberry plants and then by using it and they'll go with the what we can say that siri culture cultivate they cultivate by using by using this mulberry leaves so we can serve definitely we can go within two ways if you consider plant so we can consider it as a it's also a plant as or animally but especially when we go with it is eaten by it is eaten by the mulberry plant so that they'll cultivate how they cultivate the plants at the same way they'll cultivate by using this in a siri culture understood what i mean yes ma'am so mostly silver this plant or animal also you can but okay so when we go with cotton definitely we know that cotton hot water is obtained cotton is obtained from the cotton plant so these are the various types of uh cotton child yeah these are the various types no no pregnant has texted something bamboo various pieces bamboo box cotton so here also here also whatever it is whatever the naturally obtained product there are many kinds of quality based purification based for example when we go with coal when we go with coal so when we go with coal we can see that there are different kinds of coal materials are obtained based upon the percentage of carbon here also so what pregnant has uh sent just from different species of cotton am right here yes so all these are nothing but all these are based on the nomenclature based upon the scientific systematic study they have given different kinds of iu patents so this names are especially these are nothing but scientific names but simply we call called in genderless button okay so in this quarter also based upon the quantity of quantity and the quality there are different kinds of cotton different kinds of cotton materials okay based upon the based upon the quality of that quarter from which kind of plant what kind of uh like were seeds from the from the seeds they obtained so when we go to the best example so when we go with coal there are different stages of coal the peat lignite bituminous anthracite all these are the different kinds of coal materials so if you go to the anthracite that is the last stage of coal when the coal is decomposed under the earth thrust by the decomposition of plants and animals so we'll get fossils so that coal is obtained so this coal there are different stages of cholesterol speech lignite bituminous and anthracite so these are the four different kinds of coal so when we have seen the purity and quality of the cold anthracite is having high quality different kinds of cotton based upon the quality of the cotton yes if you go to the fire among like there are many coconut plants in the south region of india so in the south region of india the mattresses of the beds are made up of coyote yes but from canada basically i am from uh south india and actually in our houses like near our us we are having many like a piece of coconut and we are you you're using it for many pieces like uh many uh choir we use it uh like uh for making many of the mads mama would uh would like to ask that in the picture you have given of silk it's actually white in color then you know how the textile materials what do you get are in different types of colors shiny why is it so very good actual natural form of silk is white in color we can see that it's very shiny especially when we have have you observed our grannies and all they are having the shiny white color hair it's exactly like silk understood so these silk they obtained from this uh what the serie culture and they'll pass the silk for the ironing process so what they'll do they'll treat with different chemicals and bathing like somewhat they'll go with acid bathing and all so after that what what they they'll undergo they'll send this to yani so when they and so would what the third what kind of fiber they want they'll just pass this to for to undergo this drying process what do you mean by dyeing process to make it uh do a color add color so then then go with the yarning and finally it goes to the waiver waving process so that you'll get the silica textile silk clothing uh mom can i say something yeah now i want you to tell where silk originated from my mouth actually originated from asian china when like there was a queen was a very brave queen like we have classic iranian india so she was also very brave queen but in china so one day she was just drinking tea under a tree a mulberry tree and suddenly a worm dropped in a tree so she when she looked at it from the tree into the cup of tea yes there was many threads coming out of that cocoon of the worm so when the queen looked up at that tree she saw many of these and then her the idea came to her that we could use these for clothings and all so she took all the worms from the tree and um and she threw them in a hot bowl of boiling water and that's how the invention of single was made but china wanted to keep this a secret and china was learning a lot by this because it was a rare thing but later on many countries started to learn china's secret like india siri culture culture like in the small scale industry they are going with the siri culture and even india also plays a major role in children to wheel cylinder okay so especially the silk is much more usable in our country only so and bamboo all these other plant extract cellulose especially so when we go with the jute okay so jut is also especially fibers especially these are used to perform bags nowadays we are having degradable and biodegradable products so when we go with the degradable and biodegradable products definitely so what we feel children degradable when biodegradable nowadays we are going for malls and all where we are getting these food bags it's just a complete replacement of plastic so the whatever it is that they take the cost of the jute bag but jude is a biodegradable okay and we can reuse it okay so then this is obtained naturally so that if there is any deposition of zoot what happened definitely decomposes within less less time okay understood or not understood man yes and silk especially what they'll do you should know very well about the state how it is formed so they'll take this coupons and all they they'll cultivate they'll take these things once and all they'll they'll spread the swarms in in like what we can say that it is made up of entirely made up of uh what bamboo and all they'll construct like that and they'll give this malabari leaves okay so from that uh actually before getting from the component so that here like a silk thread it is obtained so have you seen that uh a spider how it is uh uh network like structures and all at the same way this sync also will form along with the error with that coppers they'll get so they'll collect these cupcakes so before getting the insect out they collect these cup cones so what happened then just go and add these couples in a boiler they just boil it while they boil it to separate this mom to separate a worm from it so that the worm dies and also some extra germs that are there because it's in the bottle and then after cooling they'll collect all this all this separate they collect it and they'll go with the different baths whether it is acid or a base but whatever it is so they'll undergo different parts with few chemicals are added not like harsh they're like mild chemicals are added and they'll go with this bar so when they go with this bath uh so what happened they'll get it and they'll collect it in a kind of thread and they'll send after pouring they'll send it to young so when they learn it what they'll do that wave it into different threads and then they'll allow the threads to form abundance so these bundles before going to the textile industry these bundles will be done so different colors dice are added so whatever the color is added we can see that the silk pure silk is very much lustrous what do you mean by lustrous children like it's very smooth to touch and soft and all now before going also they'll go with the purification so whatever is an actual product not only the fibers or different kinds of things which are obtained naturally definitely they'll go with the refining process what do you mean by refining process purification purification then so why because the substance which are obtained naturally there is the chance of attraction of moths what do you mean by moths mom mama mom are you talking about the insect that looks like a butterfly yes yes we are talking about silk on it i i'm sure you're the cycle also no i'll show you how many children yeah it's they're usually in like gray or black in color but some are like really really rare that um that's what before going to the stages i just show you the cycle how it forms so that you'll be having a clear idea so before wherever the siri culture uh just uh what we can say that the small scale industry is going on so there we can find around the industry we can find the mulberry leaves so where there is a good nice food definitely there is a work also will be very much strong our body also supports at the same way so these they'll add this mulberry leaves especially these cultivators will add this beryllium so that the insects will the eel and they'll very much ponder for this food so that they'll eat much more silk", "xTzEoj1cUCs": "this is lecture 3k and today we're going to discuss the final colligative property which is the property of osmotic pressure osmotic pressure is something that exists when solutions are in contact with a membrane and a good example of this in the biological realm are red blood cells if you put a red blood cell into a solution maybe in a petri dish where the salt concentration in the petri dishes solution is the same as the salt concentration inside the red blood cells we say that these cells are in an isotonic solution the same concentration solution and it turns out if this is the case then water can flow in and out of the red blood cells at the exact same rate so when the cells are in an isotonic solution you have an equal flow rate of water in and out of the cells but if you take those red blood cells and you place them into a solution that's hypertonic hypermeaning more that means the solution in the petri dish has a higher salt concentration than the salt concentration of the red blood cells then the water flow is not going to be even and you're going to have water flowing out of the cells faster than it's flowing in if this is the case and after some amount of time the red blood cells will collapse as the water is passing out of them faster than it's coming in if you place red blood cells into a solution that's called hypotonic hypo meaning less that means the salt concentration in the medium in the petri dish has a lower salt concentration than the salt in the cells you're going to cause water to flow into the red blood cells faster than it floats flows out and that would with time eventually cause the cells to expand and possibly even burst so this phenomenon occurs anytime you have a membrane that's semi-permeable a semi-permeable membrane is a membrane that will allow small molecules to pass through it but not big ones so these membranes here may allow water molecules to pass through but not hydrated salt ions which are much bigger the term hydrated is important here remember when a salt ion is dissolved in water it's attached by maybe six different water molecules with iron dipole attractions causing a fairly large entity to be created so if you have a semi-permeable membrane with really small pores in it the small water molecules can pass in and out but not the large hydrated salt ions you could have a semi-permeable membrane with even bigger pores that would allow water and salt ions to pass through but not really molecules like proteins if you have a chain-link fence around an elementary school that's a semi-permeable membrane it allows the small so bugs to go in and out of the playground but not the kindergartners because they don't fit through the little holes in the chain-lining fence so if we take a beaker filled with pure water and then i take another type of glassware and i fill it with a salt solution so in this picture the beaker has a blue water solution and then the purple solution is going to be representing a salt solution that type of glassware is named after this plant which is a thistle and so it's called a thistle tube so i've placed salt water in a thistle tube and on the very bottom of the thistle tube you might be able to see some black on here this black is supposed to be a semi-permeable membrane you can synthetically make those they actually are a lot like saran wrap so you just kind of wrap that around the bottom and it holds the salt solution into the thistle tube but if it's a semi-permeable membrane it's going to allow water molecules to pass in and out of the thistle tube but the salt ions will not so in the picture the blue solution is pure water the purple solution is the salt water and that black rim is representing the entire bottom of the thistle tube being covered by a semi-permeable membrane if you notice where the level of water is right now in the salt solution i've marked it here with a dotted line so what happens is as water molecules in the blue solution come in contact with semi-permeable membrane because they're all small every single one of them comes up and hits the semi-permeable membrane will pass through so in any one second period of time five water molecules hitting the semi-permeable membrane will all pass through that's causing five water molecules to pass through per second however going the other way around because there are salt ions in this purple solution when a salt ion hits the semi-permeable membrane it won't pass through but when water molecules hit it they will so in the same amount of time if five particles hit that semi-permeable membrane and one of them is a salt ion the four water molecules pass through but the one salt ion doesn't and so therefore we only have four water molecules passing out per second whereas in the pure water we have five water molecules coming in so because the solu particles are blocked by the membrane less water goes out of the tube faster than it goes into the tube and i represent that with the vectors showing the rates of flow the water is flowing into the thistle tube into the salt solution faster than water is flowing out this will cause a net effect after a certain amount of time that the amount of volume of the salt solution is going to increase now that increase is actually important because what's happening is you have a whole bunch of now extra water at the very top here and it's pushing down on all the water below it and if you've ever gone to a concert of a really big venue like maybe angel stadium and in the old days they used to have concerts there where there was no assigned seating and you would show up at noon and everybody wait outside the gates and when they open the gates everybody would rush in because you could go anywhere on the field or anywhere in the stands and if you want to be really close to see gene simmons blowing fire out of his mouth you had to get there early so you can get a really close seat for that so as thousands of us would line up outside the gates at 12 o'clock when the gates would open you would have a big force from behind you of the thousands of people wanting to get in there and you would essentially be carried into the stadium with that giant force behind you well that's what's happening here these water molecules up here that we've added to the thistle tube have a mass and because of gravity they're pushing down on the molecules down here so they cause these molecules to travel down faster than they would have naturally so the extra mass of the salt water builds up pressure on the membrane it forces water through more quickly so in my picture here i say i'm having five particles hit the semi-permeable membrane per second not with that extra mass there that's going to increase to six so what will happen is you'll if i go back a second what will happen is you're going to force the water into the from the salt solution into the pure water faster so i'm going to increase the rate of the water flowing from the salt solution into the pure water it's still not quite equal to the rate of the water going back into the thistle tube so the amount of liquid in the thistle tube will increase that causes a greater mass pushing down on the membrane that's going to force water out even faster and eventually at some point you're going to get to a situation where the rate of water going in is equal to the rate of water going out now numerically how's that happening i have five water molecules going in per second and what do i have over this side well because of the extra mass i just don't have five molecules hitting the membrane per second i have six and if one of them is a salt particle and the other five are waters i get five waters passing through the membrane every second just like the five molecules of water were going in to the salt solution per second so i now have an equal flow of water in and out and we have an extra amount of water it built up in that salt solution causing a pressure on the membrane to make this passage equal that amount of pressure is called osmotic pressure and it's abbreviated by the letter pi it's the pressure on a semi-permeable membrane needed to equalize the passage of water across the membrane between two solutions of different concentrations now if you measure how high the level of water changed in the salt solution we can measure that in any length unit like millimeters and the reason they call this as an osmotic pressure is that historically pressures of gases have been measured with millimeters of mercury the first barometer ever created to measure atmospheric pressure was a big long tube of mercury and they would measure how high a column of mercury the atmospheric pressure would support and so atmospheric pressure was measured in millimeters of mercury they eventually decided to rename a millimeter of mercury at or and we now know that 760 torr is typical atmospheric pressure on earth at sea level so they've actually called that a pressure unit of an atmosphere one atmosphere so you can measure the pressure uh based upon a length unit like millimeters and in our picture here we actually have a difference in heights of liquid water so we could say x millimeters of water is the pressure that's built up in that salt solution to equalize the flow of water in and out and so that's why it's called an osmotic pressure when we calculate osmotic pressure we're going to actually calculate it in the units of atmospheres and to determine the osmotic pressure in a solution we're going to use this osmotic pressure equation pi which stands for the osmotic pressure which will be measured in atmospheres v is going to be the volume of the salt solution measured in liters i is going to be the van't hoff factor in case of our solute is an electrolyte and it's going to stand for the quantity of solute in the salt solution that'll be measured in moles and it'll actually just stand for the quantity of solute in the salt solution as long as the salt solution is in contact with pure water as it was in our previous example for example if i have pure water and then i have a salt solution that has three moles of salt in it or three moles of solute particles then n would be 3 moles however if the contents of the thistle tube is a salt solution and the content of the beaker is a salt solution then the n in this equation is the difference in the number of moles of the two so it's the difference in quantity of the solute between the two solutions so if my thistle tube had three moles of solute particles and my beaker had one mole of solute particles 3 minus 1 would be 2 the end value would actually be 2. most of the time the solutions will be in contact with pure water so n will just stand for the quantity of solute in the salt solution r is a constant its name is the universal gas constant numerical value .08206 liter atmospheres per mole kelvin and t is going to be the temperature and the temperature is going to have to be measured in the units of kelvin now if i solve this for the osmotic pressure and bring the v over to the right side of the equation i place the v under the n because n divided by v equals something that we've learned earlier in this unit and divided by v is molarity so whenever a salt solution is placed in contact with pure water then the osmotic pressure that would develop in that solution is going to equal i multiplied by the molarity of the solution times r times t and this is our osmotic pressure equation we'll use most often the pi i mark equation unless you wind up having a solution where or a problem where they just give you the moles of the solute and the volume of the solution you can just plug the numbers into there but if they tell you the molarity of the solution then you can use this form so here's an example we're going to find the osmotic pressure that would develop in a solution that is prepared at 22 degrees celsius with 0.0300 moles of glucose dissolved in enough water to make 100 with the decimal point milliliters of solution so i'm going to use the osmotic pressure equation that deals with moles and volume because that's what's given in the problem and i'm going to plug all the numbers into this equation the i value for glucose would be 1 because glucose is a non-electrolyte it does not dissociate or ionize into ions n would be the number of moles of glucose .0300 r is the universal gas constant the t we're going to use here is going to wind up being the temperature switched to kelvin and so to do that we take the celsius temperature and we add the conversion factor to 73.2 kelvin to that and we're going to wind up getting a kelvin temperature of 295 and the 0.2 would actually be a guard digit because our 22 degrees was only accurate to the ones place so technically it's 295 kelvin the volume in the denominator will be switched to liters 0.100 so if we plug these numbers in the van half factor the moles the universal gas constant the temperature in kelvin and the volume in liters the units will all cancel out except for the atmospheres and that's going to give us the uh osmotic pressure that has to develop in this solution to make water flow out of the salt solution into pure water just as fast as water molecules flow into the salt solution and this answer comes out 7.27 atmospheres now let's try one application of osmotic pressure all colligative properties can be used to calculate molar masses of solutes and so we're going to do an example of that we're going to try to find the molar mass of a protein if a solution is prepared by dissolving one point zero zero times ten to the minus third grams of the protein in enough water to make one point zero of solution and the osmotic pressure at 25 degrees celsius is 1.12 torr so whenever they give you an osmotic pressure they're assuming you're you may assume that this is the osmotic pressure developed when the solution is in contact with pure water so for us to be able to do this we're going to use the osmotic pressure equation and we're going to solve for the number of moles of the solute why are we doing this think back to each of the problems we've done before when we've used a colligative property to calculate a molar mass what's a molar mass it's grams of the material divided by moles of the material so to get the molar mass of the protein we will need to know the grams of protein in a given solution and divide it by the moles of the protein in a given solution this problem has told us that this solution has 1.00 times 10 to the minus third grams of the protein so we have to use this colligative property to solve for the moles of the protein and that's the value n in this equation so for each of the variables we have to get them in the right units the temperature has to be in kelvin and so i'm going to take the 25 degrees celsius add 273.2 to that and that will give us a temperature in kelvin of 298 with the guard digit 0.2 the actual osmotic pressure in the solution was 1.12 torr so we have to convert that into atmospheres and the equality statement between tors and atmospheres is one atmosphere equals 760.0 torr so if that's an equality statement i'll write it as a fraction i'll put the 760.0 torr on the bottom the one atmosphere on the top the torah will cancel out and this will now be my osmotic pressure in atmospheres .00147 and then a guard digit 4. the volume of the solution is going to wind up being 1 milliliter and switching that to liters would be 0.00100 liters so we now have all the numbers in the proper units we're just going to solve this for n i'll bring the v from the right side to the top on the left i'll take the irt from the top on the right to the bottom on the left and now we'll just plug in all the values .001474 atmospheres for the osmotic pressure .00100 liters for our volume the i value for the protein would be one because a protein is not an acid and it's not an ionic compound so therefore it must be something that's a non-electrolyte the universal gas constant and then multiply by the temperature 298.2 kelvin all the units cancel out except for moles and i get a value of 6.02 and then with a garden digit 4 times 10 to the minus 8 moles so we've now calculated how many moles of the solute are in the solution so the very last step of every molar mass determination experimentally is this you take the grams of the substance divided by the moles of the substance and that ratio will be the molar mass so 1.00 times 10 to the minus third grams of protein divided by 6.024 times 10 to the minus eight moles of protein will give me my molar mass to three significant figures and this comes out sixteen thousand six hundred grams per mole a really large number because proteins are really big molecules so that's the material now for test three let's give you a little bit of review so you know what terms you should be uh studying for in preparation for the test we started with our solution our with our chapter on solids and liquids and you need to know the kinetic molecular theory description of solids liquids and gases we talked about several properties of liquids those would be things like surface tension and viscosity one more let's see surface tension viscosity and capillary action then we talked about crystalline and amorphous solids and then we actually had an activity on unit cells and i would like you to know unit cells and their properties where if i were to give you a unit cell i would like you to be able to count up how many actual atoms are contained in the unit cell determine what the side length of the unit cell is in terms of the radii of the atoms and then if you're able to determine those just geometrically by looking at a unit cell then determine the density or the atomic radii from this unit cell data very similar to the activity we did on unit cells then we talked about classifying matter by the particle type and the attractive forces so we talked about ionic matter which is composed of positive and negative ions metallic matter which is composed of metal atoms macromolecular matter which is non-metal atoms noble gases which is noble gas atoms nonpolar molecular matter which is matter made up of nonpolar molecules and polar molecular matter matter made up of polar molecules for these six different categories i want you to know what the particles are that make up the lattice points which is what i just said be able to identify examples of those know what the attractive forces are between these particles in each of those six types of matter tell me whether the melting points and boiling points are high or low tell me their solubility in both water which is polar or any nonpolar solvent and describe their electrical conductivity then more specifically if i give you pairs of substances in any of these categories i want you to explain which one has the higher melting point or boiling point based upon attractive forces we had one experiment where we actually measured experimental data for substances fit them into these categories and the post lab questions ask you to do this type of explaining of melting points and the test will be very similar to that next we talked about band theory which explains the energies of the millions and millions of molecular orbitals that exist in either metallic matter or macromolecular matter it only applies to those and we use band theory to explain the conductivity of metals the non-conductivity of metalloids the conductivity of doped metalloids and the non-conductivity of macromolecular matter and so you'll have some questions where you'll have to explain some of those we we talked about definitions of a lot of changes in state evaporation boiling sublimation etc and then we learned how to draw a heating curve for any material and i would like you to be able to draw a heating curve and i would like you to be able to do heat calculations using heating curves by using heat capacities and heat of fusions and heat of vaporizations then we finished off this chapter with phase diagrams i would like you to be able to read a phase diagram identify what the normal melting and boiling points are from a phase diagram what the triple point is and what the critical point is our second chapter was on solutions you need to know the definitions of solvent and solute we talked about likes dissolve likes to explain solubilities and so i would like you to be able to do that anytime something dissolves in water or it dissolves in a liquid it's a solute and it can be classified as a strong electrolyte a weak electrode or a non-electrolyte i want you to know what that means and i want you to know examples of each of these then we talked about what happens to strong and weak electrolytes they either ionize or dissociate when they're in water know the definitions for those two terms and then we learned how to measure how much solute is dissolved in a given amount of solvent those are concentration units and you'll be asked to calculate the concentration unit of mass percent mole fraction molarity and molality so be familiar with each of those and then when you have a strong electrolyte like an ionic compound or a strong acid and you calculate its concentration so let's say in molarity you have 0.1 molar sodium chloride i'm going to ask you what's the concentration of the sodium ions and the chloride ions in the solution so you need to know how to calculate the molarity of the ions they're in a salt solution that come from the molarity of the salt solution itself then in terms of solutes we talked about the terms volatile and non-volatile which really mean whether something will be able to evaporate or not and then we went into our final category or final topic which was colligative properties and there were four colligative properties you need to know first one is if you ever dissolve a non-volatile solute in a liquid you always lower the vapor pressure and so i want you to be able to calculate vapor pressures of solutions that have the solvent being volatile but the solute not that'll always cause the vapor pressure to be lowered there are situations where if the solute and the solvent are both volatile then they're both going to cause evaporation and you need to be able to calculate the vapor pressures of solutions that have two volatile components the second colligative property was boiling point elevation anytime you dissolve a non-volatile solute into a liquid you're going to cause the boiling point of that liquid to go up and i want you to be able to calculate the boiling point of that new solution anytime you dissolve a non-volatile solute in a liquid you cause the freezing point of that liquid to go down and i want you to be able to use the colligative property equation to calculate freezing points of any solutions have been prepared and our final one was osmotic pressure we talked about that today and i'll expect you to be able to calculate the osmotic pressure for any given solution in addition to knowing these four colligative properties i will want you to be able to calculate the molar mass of solutes if you measure any one of these colligative properties after that you've read the two chapters and you should be well versed on experiments 11 to 14 and that's your review for our next test", "6YD2Pw9R7jY": "have you ever

a video leave a friendly comment and I'll make sure to reply to every single one of you hi and welcome to another space bound video where today we'll be looking at 25 crazy science experiments simple enough to do in your own home for 25 gum wrapper fire starter this is a great way if you've ever had a bad situation need a quick fire you'll need a double a battery and foil gum wrapper and maybe some gloves for added safety to get the most out of your wrapper to cut it in thirds lengthwise then cut your wrapper into an hourglass shape but not too thick where nothing will happen or too thin where it'll burn away then place a foil part below the battery and on top of it and shall last long enough to get what fire going if you need to number 24 fireworks in a jar for this experiment you'll first need a glass filled with 3/4 of the way with warm water then mix enough oil to fill in a separate container with colors that are different with food coloring and pour it in a glass of water now watch the magic happen number 23 change the color of your flowers flowers are dying well liven up their last moments with some color and let them go out with a bang simply mix some food coloring of your choice and water and pour it into the flower vase like normal within a few hours you'll begin to notice a beautiful change in color number 22 instant ice here's a simple way to get a nice cool water on a hot day take a water bottle and put it in your freezer for about two hours and forty-five minutes just before it freeze into ice times can vary though for different freezers at this point the water's well below freezing it just needs some little bit of help so with a nice tap and there you have it you can also gently pour it into a glass and drop a piece of ice into it with the same results you can also do the same trick with so enough for a delicious awesome result number 21 elephant toothpaste not literally what you'll need to do for this experiment is pour 10 percent hydrogen peroxide because this is a safe version into a flask with a little bit of dish soap and coloring of your choice then in a separate container mix yeast with warm water pour into the flask and you've got yourself toothpaste for a lifetime number twenty firebending finally my dreams of joining the Fire Nation have finally come true but on a real note this one is extremely simple for those of you who don't know hand sanitizers pretty flammable and just by lighting it again be safe don't actually try this it will cause fire but it's actually reasonably safe to grab and hold just not for too long of course and keep your hands in motion in to help and also again as a side note please if you do try this make sure you have parental guidance and you're safe about it number 19 glass candy here's how to make a delicious peppermint candy what you'll need is baking spray 2 cups sugar 3/4 cup of corn syrup 1/2 cup of water and 2 tablespoons of peppermint extract but really you can use any clear extract you like but blue food coloring is pretty awesome I would suggest Ballou it's my favorite color but anyways cover up a tray and aluminum foil next fill a heated pot with your sugar corn syrup and water until it's all liquefied at around 2 to 85 degrees also make sure no sugars on the side of the pot for the best results once boiled add your peppermint extract and drop a food coloring and stir until you get a nice color finally add the baking spray to your aluminum sheet and pour your concoction in and then let it sit for about 30 minutes to harden break it however you wish number 18 fire snake first mix 10 grams baking soda 240 grams sugar in a bowl fill it with sand and pour lighter fluid into it pour the baking soda and sugar mix over it and light it up however you can honestly it's wild and it just keeps growing number 17 levitation what is this sorcery oh just science and a little bit of luck okay so if you have access to an air-compressor gun all you need to do is direct the air compressor just to whatever object you're using in this case a screwdriver and just try to find the right angle where it will float it's simple but it's also difficult so on that no good luck number 16 noodle rocket first you'll need like a small little mason jar and poke a hole into the lid that's about the size of the hole in your noodle not the entire noodle just the hole of it and the small jar fill about a quarter of it with hydrogen peroxide and half a teaspoon with dry yeast and try to tighten the lid by pressing on it shake it up to get the reaction started place your noodle on the lid and light it up now you have a miniature rocket engine number 15 turn water into wine for this experiment you'll need 2 glasses that are the same wine water and something thin like a card or plastic layer fill both glasses at the top one with water when one with wine and place your card over the glass of water apply pressure sword up to get a little vacuum seal and place the glass of water above the wine then gently pull the card until there's small enough gap for the liquid to seep out eventually the wine will fully replace the water number 14 walking on eggs okay so this is extremely wasteful but pretty cool layout however many cartons of eggs you wish in the path that you can walk on but make sure they aren't cracked because you know some grocery stores are a little bit snake like that then go ahead and walk on them this is possible because it's very very difficult to crack an egg on its edges and having a lot of them also helps it also helps to distribute your weight more the cartons of course they play a part in the zoo number 13 crystal ball first mixed together about three parts water to one part dish soap to make a bubble solution then in a bowl pour enough warm water to get an inch of height using a heavy-duty glove which is important place two to three pieces of dry ice into the bowl of water then dip your fingers into the bubble solution wrapping it around the rim of your bowl to make sure not to let any fall in next run a piece of long cotton fabric into a bubble solution and run your fingers through it to remove any excess solution finally run the cloth across the bowl to create the thin bubble layer then the dry ice will cause the bowl to grow and look like a beautiful crystal ball number 12 exploding lunch bag start by filling up a ziploc bag with half a cup of warm water and half a cup with vinegar then add some baking soda to a tissue make sure to wrap it up so none of it gets out of the bag right away now while holding your tissue seal the bag up nice and tight and let the tissue drop boom science baby number 11 it can walk here's another trick that you can do with static electricity rub a balloon on your hair or a towel and you can manipulate a can into rolling whichever way you want number 10 rainbow paper for this we'll need a piece of black paper in a room with decent lighting drop it on a container filled with water and use an eyedropper or something to slowly pour in drops of clear fingernail polish once the nail polish has dried after a few minutes pull out your paper and remove any water set it down on somewhere like newspaper to let the whole thing dry number 9 suck an egg for this experiment you'll first need a flask glass or container that's thinner than the egg at the top make sure your egg is hard-boiled by the way come on I mean we're not magicians next set a piece of paper on fire and place it into your container place the egg onto the neck of your container and watch what happens if you want the aide to come out again just blow some air into it and voila number eight lava lamp this one's actually lit first you'll need to fill a glass with one cup water that you mix with Colerain in this case obviously red then add three cups of oil into the glass gently so that it doesn't mix let it settle then drop in either an effervescence tablet or alka-seltzer number seven invisible bottle to do this experiment you'll need a glass a smaller bottle and glycerin fill the glass with a reasonable amount of glycerin then pour the rest into a bottle until it's close to the same height very carefully place the bottle end of the glass and boom you can't see it anymore this is because glycerin refracts or bends light making it very difficult to see the bottle number six lemon volcano first you'll want to cut a lemon in half and in 1/2 drip any desired food colorings onto the lemon and mix it in then add a spoon of baking soda and mix that in as well for a stronger reaction squeeze the other piece of lemon over it number five bouncing bubbles in a cup mix three parts water in one part dish soap then you use something to make a bubble like a wand or maybe you can even use your hand to make a circle with your fingers then simply blow your bubble over your hand with the Contin gloves on your a bubble bender now apparently number four invisible ink first cut a lemon in half then use either paintbrush or toothpick to take a bit of lemon juice at a time and write your message out on a piece of paper then use a source of light and heat maybe a candle and run your paper over it to easily reveal the message number three liquid layering so you know the same blood is thicker than water well that's true of course but to the point that some liquids have higher densities than others which you'll see here well you can use as an empty bottle something tall a measuring cup dark corn syrup dish soap water vegetable oil rubbing alcohol and food coloring to mix with alcohol measure how much your bottle can hold by ounces or millimeters and divide by five because of our five liquids then pour each one and carefully into the bottle in the way we list it so corn syrup first and alcohol last looks pretty cool right number two waterbending for this you'll need running water either from the tap or you can have a bottle of water with a hole in it either way just have the water running gently next you can either use a PVC type in a towel or just run a comb through your hair but we're trying to get a static charge here then just play around with your pipe or comb near the running water and you can control which way the direction pore is it's actually really awesome to watch and finally number one optical illusion this one next we'll test your drawing skills I mean kind of but yeah they will first draw out two separate drawings that could go together if drawn on the same page like a fish in a bowl cut out both drawings on two separate pieces of paper and tape them around a pencil if you spend the pencil fast enough they'll look as if the fish are in the bowl this happens because your eye can only see images at a certain speed and with that being said and

Tommy [ __ ] up", "9J7JFX8WKH0": "good morning everyone today we discussed about the acid bases and salt the recent session of acid bases and salts in this chapter we started from the type of acid bases and indicators etc I have some questions related to this chapter the first question is what is a non-factor indicator and mean the three or factory indicators my second question is what is M for trick oxide name 2 in for trick oxide and how do you show that to that to which you write in your answer is M for tricking nature to show that Infotech nature of like zinc oxide and aluminum oxide you must write how they are acetic and how they are basic in the given equation so we I have some questions related to this chapter you first I will explain all the questions there are 15 questions related to this chart topic which I selected today and you must answer these question I will discuss all these questions and you must answer these questions in you home assignment today for today's room assignment so let's start from the first question here is the first question write the chemical formula write the chemical formula and chemical name of there is three chemicals washing soda baking soda and bleaching powder write the chemical formula and chemical name so start from the washing soda what is the chemical formula of washing soda it is na2co3 10 h2o and write its chemical name means this Becca hydrated sodium carb likewise baking soda what is baking soda chemical formula baking so dice in hco3 and its chemical name is sodium hydrogen carbonate bleaching powder write the formula bleaching powder as you know cocl2 and its name is calcium oxy chloride second question is write the color of the following compound with their formula first write the color right all these compound then make two lines like this and first you write color and then compound the chemical formula so Penta hydrated copper sulfate it is blue calcium Hemi hydrated calcium sulfate it is white heptahydrate ferrous sulfate it is green green vitriol so it is green deca hydrated sodium carbonate it is wide-reaching powder is white lead iodide it is yellow barium sulfate it is white and copper oxide is black black in color question number three is what happens when gypsum is heated and give equation gypsum is heated there some students always ask me about the temperature at which gypsum is heated to foam plaster of Paris then what happens when gypsum is heated when gypsum is heated it converted into plaster of Paris so give a question for this question in this question gypsum ca caso4 - h2 oven heated when heated above one 100 degree Celsius it is about 120 to 160 degree Celsius it is heated when gypsum is heated it converted into CSO for 1/2 H 2 and what is my next question is what is plaster of vy+ tour of Paris is called so in this question why plaster of Paris why is plaster of Paris P o P is called so because gypsum is found in Paris gypsum is found in in Paris so it is called plaster of so it is called plaster of Paris when gypsum is heated plaster of Paris is from what is baking powder what is baking powder it is a mixture of sodium hydrogen carbonate and tartaric acid this is your fourth question next fifth question is what happens when baking soda is heated when baking soda is heated baking powder means sodium carbonate is found along with co2 and h2o so give a question here what is soda ash I have this question is discussed already discussed so write soda what is soda as it is anhydrous sodium carbonate when sodium carbonate is strongly heated so dice is formed next question is question number seven name the substances used in solid waste process for the formation of baking soda the salt in the solid waste process there are brine solution means sodium sodium carbonate water and carbon dioxide gas has passed through this solution so see you to his third and ammonia is fourth finally sodium hydrogen carbonate along with ammonium carb low right is formed in this reaction in this process solvus process eighth question next question is right the chemical reaction which occur in soda acid fire extinguisher you must write the chemical reaction so does a fire extinguisher which chemical is present in Saudia fire extinguisher concentrated sulfuric acid and sodium hydrogen carbonate so dye sodium hydrogen carbonate so write the equation of this reaction during the next question is question number nine during the electrolysis of brine solution which gas is evolved at cathode and at a known and why this process is called chlor-alkali process first first part of this question is cathode hydrogen gas is collected over cathode and chlorine gas is collected over a node next is why it is called floral carry alkali process because sodium hydroxide sodium high hydroxide and chlorine alkali mean sodium hydroxide sodium hydroxide and chlorine is formed in this process so it this process is also known as chlor-alkali process next question is why acid is always added to water not water is added to acid during the dilution of acid during the dilation of an acid so why acid is always added to water because it it's an exothermic process it is a highly exothermic process when we add water to acid it is start splashing and it may burns name to antacid with their chemical formula right to anti said at sodium hydrogen carbonate and magnesium hydroxide right its chemical formula next question is sink oxide as I asked zinc oxide is an amphoteric oxide so zinc oxide is an a photic oxide to explain this you must write two equation where zinc acts as an acid and zinc acts as a base zinc oxide plus Hyder you take CA and zinc oxide plus sodium hydroxide you must write the two equations of this reaction they'll write three neutral oxides the neutral oxides are water carbon monoxide and nitric oxide and oh right the acid and base need to form ammonium sulfate by which acid in which base it is form and also write the nature of the salt and the last question is what is all factory indicator name three olfactory indicators other than this some some questioners or some questions are related to the pH now what is the pH before meal after meal is it is very important question next is what is the pH of water 2 for the survival of aquatic animals water which which I said which I said is found in bee sting it is formic acid roots formula is her h co h okay some more questions to discuss here with question number 16 named to synthetic indicators you know you know the answer very well write the formula borax its na to be 4 or 7/10 h2o but why nitric acid is not used in the preparation of hydrogen gas because nitric acid is an is a very good oxidizing agent it oxidizes hydrogen to water next question is name or non-volatile liquid name are non volatile liquid acid this question is very very important so always remember the non volatile acid is sulfuric acid so it is used in the electrolysis process there is one word question one one word question five six questions here give one example in which case a basic oxide which is soluble which is soluble in water a weak mineral acid base which is not an alkali a base which does not contain a metal ion and an oxide which is a base an acid which is an acid oxide a basic oxide which is soluble in water basic oxide sodium oxide it is soluble in water to form sodium hydroxide next is a weak when arrested a weak mineral acid carbonic acid a base which is not an alkali a base which is not an alkali al ammonium hydroxide ammonium hydroxide etc a base which is not contain a metal ion a base which does not contain a metal ion its ammonia or ammonium hydroxide an oxide which is a base basic oxide give any basic oxide an oxide an acid oxide give any acidic oxide like carbon dioxide and so to etcetera what will be the action of following substance on litmus paper you have to write the action of blue blue or red litmus paper on these substances reacts HCl no action mauston ammonia gas ammonia gases basic so it turns red litmus to blue lemon juice carbohydrate soft drink curd and soap solution soap solution is basic next question is identify the compound X here is the compound X on the basis of the reaction these are the reaction three reaction given here on the basis of these reactions identify a B and C X also identify the compound X which compound X when react with zinc to form hydrogen gas X must be then react with zinc give hydrogen gas so what is the compound X what is the compound a B and C you have to answer these question by yourself next question is it is exemplar question a metal carbonate X on heating with an acid give a gas which gives which when passed through a solution Y gives the carbonate back first a metal carbonate a metal carbonate X on heating with an S a gives her gas which passed through the solution Y gives the carbonated back that means the gas is carbon dioxide so this is which carbonate it is calcium carbonate it is calcium carbonate gives the carbonate back on the other hand a gas g g a gas G that is obtained at a node on during the electrolysis of brine solution so you know very well that chlorine gas is obtained on at a node during the electrolysis of brine solution so if the gas is chlorine when this gas is passed through this Y then which compound is form a compound that is form means this is bleaching powder is form explain explain these this question and answer this question also these are the question from the acid bases a salt if you have any query any question then ask me in the whatsapp group let let's discuss our chapter 3 chapter 1 2 & 3 these three chapters are in your first term so this is the last chapter of your first term this is first video of chapter 3 metals and nonmetals the page number is 1 for metal and nonmetal so in this chapter we will study about physical and chemical properties of metal and nonmetal metalloid sides as their chemical reactions complete chemical reactions and the bond they form is chemical bonding and last topic of this chapter is metallurgy how to extract metal from their horse so let's start we know that there are three types of elements metal nonmetal and metalloid first of all that's an introduction with metalloid as we have learnt metal or metal nonmetal and metalloids in my class knife also so take a quick revision there are seven metal words boron silicon germanium arsenic antimony tellurium and polonium always remember these seven metalloids this boron is from group 13 this is from 14 this is from 15 and this is from 16 group also you must remember the group also so this is group 14 through 15 groups group 13 14 15 and 16 boron silicon germanium arsenic antimony tellurium and polonium there are seven metalloids and nonmetals are only 18 on metals non-metals are those elements as we know that nonmetals are those elements tendency to gain electrons so there are 80 nonmetals start from the last group group 18 helium neon argon Krypton xenon and radon these elements are called inert gases or noble gases these elements are most not likely to ball form bar bond but some of them can form bond because of their bigger size so these are studied under nonmetals next is group 17 elements group 17 elements are called halogens as we know that these are called halogens but in the halogens this is a certain fluorine chlorine bromine iodine and astatine this a statin is a radioactive element so we all usually discuss about the fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine as halogens these are salt forming elements so they are called halogens next is group 16 this is growth 14 element this is 15 this is 16 this is 17 and this is pro 18 element group 16 elements which is called chalcogen on in in the nonmetal group it is oxygen sulfur and selenium rest are metalloids and metals of this of group 16 elements are oxygen sulfur selenium tellurium and polonium but tellurium and polonium are as we can see here that tellurium and polonium are metalloids so in the group 16 element oxygen sulfur and Salima selenium are non metals in group 15 elements nitrogen and phosphorus only two elements are nonmetals and in group 40 only carbon is nonmetal other two element is germanium is metalloid and rest is metals and as we know that hydrogen is a nonmetal it can gain electron and it can lose electron also but how do we consider hydrogen as a nonmetal here so these are only 18 nonmetals you must remember these nonmetals in according to their group next is metals metals rest rest element rest a limited the periodic table are metals look at this periodic table in this periodic table these two lines these two purple lines blue matte blue indicates all blue color indicates metal gray color indicates metalloids and this this group is noble gas this is halogens and rest is a rest green color indicates nonmetals so these are non metals as as I explained that these are nonmetals these are metalloids and rest is metals in the metals this group group 3 to group 12 elements the elements of between group 3 to 12 these are called d-block element or these also are called transition elements transition elements and group one and two are called alkali metals and alkaline earth metal the rest rest to these two rows shows lanthanides and actinides which are called heavy metal these all are heavy metals for inner transition elements so metals of Group one are called alkali metals and metals of group two are called alkaline earth metals these metals all behave other than these all metals are heavy metals and here in our transition element transition element and in a transition element these are the metals so let's start let's start the physical properties of metal in the physical properties of metal as we know that metals are so Norah's first of all what what is metal metals are those elements which have tendency to lose electrons and nonmetals are those elements which have tendency to gain electrons metals are sonorous Lazarus good conductors these are the properties of metals but there are some exceptions as well so so we will in the definition we must try that metals are electro positive elements which have tendency to lose electrons and nonmetals are those elements which those electronegative elements which have tendency to gain electrons with this introduction I will stop here I am going to stop my video but in the next session we will discuss about the physical and chemical properties of metals and nonmetals with exceptions thank you", "uJi2BUvN0HA": "good morning yes we are again here to discuss the chapter number three of chemistry from Class A and our topic is v plastic we have to continue from this topic

used for various scenarios uh defensive scenarios uh one of the first ones that comes to mind is active shooter response uh generally when we're talking about active shooter more than likely you're gonna be faced with uh with pretty much no warning and you're gonna have to end up fighting with with whatever the tools are that you have on you and in the civilian capacity that's going to be basically your concealed carry handgun and whatever else you may have with you at that time uh you're probably not going to have time to go to the truck and get anything and tool up or anything like that you know generally speaking that's probably going to be unlikely however i know a lot of people are carrying truck guns and different things of that nature and this is just a video kind of discussing some different support gear ideas uh we'll start here with this bag and uh this is a common one it's uh it's easy to put on and off and it's quick to just grab up you don't have to worry about uh getting up with a whole lot of gear to go ahead and start addressing whatever the situation may be at hand another scenario that that could tie into this would be a home defense or a bump in the night and also too like homestead defense you know neighborhood defense whatever the case may be in times of uh disaster or or i mean anything of that nature basically a bump in the night you know if you got property you got a homestead if you got predators or you know four-legged predators or two-legged predators whatever the case may be you know if things get things get kind of nasty these are just some quicker uh easy to throw on and grab up and go options uh commonly referred to as you know active shooter bag or a uh grab-and-go bag and uh so we'll just jump right in and discuss the bag that i have here today and the way that i set it up with kind of some of those theories in mind as far as responding to a scenario that may be similar to one of those that i mentioned this here is the 511 tactical uh this is the four banger bag and here at the back you can place uh 4 30 round ar magazines in these pockets close to your body i really like this style of bag i have uh i've tried a different bag before but uh this is definitely by far the my favorite one that that i've uh that i've been able to deal with and you got uh these uh velcro closures here and there's also a bungee retention that comes with it and there's elastic bands inside of these pockets so that it still retains the magazines even if you run them open top i have my first mag here because i wear this bag on my left side because i'm right hand dominant and my first mag is just quick it's ready to go and it doesn't have any flap or anything over the top of it that way i can get to it in a hurry if i need it so i have that there hold on one second all right sorry about that interruption guys but uh yeah i like this bag a lot and uh it gives you a lot of capability it's got a uh stabilization strap here to keep it uh you can keep it snug to your body you can run it here in the front you can run it on the side you can move it around to the back if you need to do something else uh it's got a little pocket back here like a mesh pocket or you can just put random stuff at and uh maybe documents or whatever case may be and we'll get into the main compartment here and i have adventure medical trauma pack you know you guys probably know about these these are good to go 20 bucks pretty solid foundation for a kit uh you know obviously don't have a tourniquet with it but uh i generally have several tourniquets with me in my edc bag uh every day so to supplement that and uh so i keep that in here i have a bottle of water in here right now just you know just regular drinking water and uh you can actually fit four more 30 round ar mags inside i have two more inside and all this back here is m193 ball and i have uh two two uh usgi mags with uh m85 green tip on the inside and then i have just a regular uh cheapo led flashlight i think it's like a uh rayovac or something like that but it works pretty good got a little bit of duct tape wrapped around it i got a uh gerber multi-tool it's not anything special but it's got a knife and some pliers and some screwdrivers and stuff a chem light here and uh there's velcro in here where you can mount holsters and all kind of stuff and then you got more loops here for other small items uh if you choose so then here on the front you got two separate pockets you got molly on the side here and on this side as well if you want to add something there or fish something through there you can do that and then here i just have a pair of little basic work gloves and a battery-powered kim light it's got a little whistle on it flashlight and it can do constant on and strobe i had several of those so i just stuck one in here for extra light source if i needed it for signaling or or just some low light activities and then in this other little side pocket i have just some spare medical stuff some uh surgical dressings five by nine pads basically for direct pressure extra pair of nitrile gloves and a roll of uh medical tape and i got a little uh a little spool of paracord in there as well never know when you're gonna need some paracord so i just kind of keep that one in there just because i had it laying around and so that's pretty much what i carry in this bag and uh it's a little bit heavy i mean obviously it's got six magazines in it and uh i just stuck those other two bags in there because they just kind of needed a home and uh so i just decided that i'd place them in here that way they'd be out of the way and i knew where they were if i needed them and it boosts me to six mags in this kit but uh this is this is one item that you can place by your bedside you know along with the carbine or whatever the case may be and you can grab it and you can you know you can you can you can go ahead and get active and do the things that you need to do and it affords you a great deal of capability uh in the event that you that you have to respond to to a scenario and i mean the scenarios are endless obviously but this is just a different option aside from a chess rig or plate carrier that uh that i feel like is uh has a lot of different uses and and it's very simple to operate too as well you know just a little bit of practice and uh it's pretty easy to to utilize this thing and uh you can move it around your body as as you need to to to get it out of the way or or facilitate the different activities that you might be engaged in and with that with this stabilization strap you can snug it down real good and you can run and you can jump and you can crawl and you can do all these different things without it uh without it hindering you uh very much at all so i really enjoy this bag uh i highly recommend them they make a smaller one called the two banger i was gonna get that one but i decided to just go ahead and go with the big one and then i'd have the space and if i want to trim it down to four mags or whatever the case may be that'd be fine and if i wanted to add and build it up to eight mags then i'd have the capability to do that as well whereas the other one i think it holds two in the back and then you can put two more inside another good thing that i like about this bag is if i'm running a lightweight chest rig set up or something like that and my drop leg rig and i've done this in practice and i feel like i just want some more ammo and a way to carry it you can use this as somewhat like a bandolier style you can just sling this on over the top of your other kit get it stabilized get it positioned correctly to where it's not hindering you and then you can work out of this bag initially go ahead and lighten it up use the mags out of here first and then you can start working with your uh your chest rig or your drop leg rig or whatever the case may be so if i'm running my my little lightweight chest rig i'll have four 30 round ar mags on there you know in a full loadout uh scenario then i can throw this on and that'll give me at least four more as many as eight more so at that point i mean you know we're getting up in the realm of 12 magazines on person and then if i'm running my uh hsgi leg rig that's two more 30 round ar mags and two more pistol mags as well uh to complement my edc i know i spoke before about uh i like to add to my gear like if i'm wearing my edc which i am you know i always am if i'm wearing my edc gear then i want to be in a position to where the things that i'm adding is gonna are gonna complement my my current loadout i'm not a fan of taking things off and putting on a different belt and threading different stuff on i'd rather just say hey this is what i got so i need to up my game throw this on or throw a chest rig on and then it's like okay well you know things are getting sporty so we'll sling this over and then we can place it strategically or lock it in the vehicle for a resupply so that's just some of the that's kind of one of the ways that i've approached this uh you know in theory and i feel like it works pretty good i can even wear this over um a plate carrier as well if i need to just boost my ammo complement in a pinch without uh without reconfiguring a bunch of gear or or threading molly pouches or doing anything crazy i can just throw this on and it'll boost my capability uh pretty drastically with with minimal effort so i want to go over that and i'll place it over here out of the way actually we'll put it down here and then we can talk about another kind of a lightweight easy on option with uh with ballistic protection and this is a shell back tactical and they they call this one the active shooter rig and it's pretty much a slick plate carrier you do have molly here and on the back as well and you got velcro here you got good padding and you got this breathable material inside which is pretty standard on this kind of gear and uh it's just just two uh straps on the side no cummerbund or anything like that and it came with this little pouch on the front for tourniquet holds a tourniquet well and this whole little tray will just snatch out of here you can just pull that out and you can work with your tourniquet if you need to and it came with these uh inset pouches for 2 30 round ar magazines so as far as just something quick [Applause] just to throw on real easily and and have a little bit of more capability and ballistic protection i really enjoy this chest rig excuse me play carry and i feel like it works pretty good i got some steel plates in here and they're level four plates so it's kind of heavy obviously but that's that's just the way it is when you're running steel plates and then here on the back i put my condor rip away emt pouch and i can't really get to it on the back uh but if i take a hit or something like that then uh if somebody's rendering me aid they'll be able to clearly identify that that's what this is and they can snatch it right off here and then it comes off and of course it just opens right up like that and i got israeli bandage in there some quick clock galls trauma shears a roll of regular gauze a couple pair of nitrile gloves some tape a chem light and a bunch of uh a couple of surgical dressings you know the 5x9 pads for direct pressure and stuff and then i got some uh some gauze pads as well so pretty good little patch up kit and then of course you got the tourniquet on the front like we saw a minute ago so and also i got a little sharpie here in the front one of those little tiny sharpies i had it laying around i said well i'll just tuck it into molly and clip it there and and then it'll it'll be right there if i need it and another thing about this is uh i can just take throw a carabiner on here on this top loop right here and then i can clip it somewhere on the side on the side strap or off of the molle on the front and that'll make it to where i can reach it when i need to which is uh honestly a better a better way to approach it whenever uh if i'm if i'm going to be in a situation where i'm uh where i'm by myself or anything like that then that's probably that probably be the way to go about that that way i can reach it whenever uh whenever i need to if i need to render aid to myself so that's a thought too as well as far as getting it on the front but uh i i was reluctant to place it to mount it on the front because i mean at that point you're gonna be huge you're not gonna be able to get prone or anything like that uh so so that's pretty much that setup and and that's more of like a you know if i'm going out of town and i want some armor protection uh you know at my disposal then i can just pack this up and it comes with a cool little carrying bag but i didn't bring it out here and a real nice high quality carrying bag and you can shove this thing in there and it's real discreet and then that and you know carbine or something or ar pistol in a discrete case then you know that gives you some capability like if i'm going on a long road trip or vacation and uh i feel like i want to carry the play carrier with me this would be the one that i would take with me just uh just by nature of it being smaller and easier to deal with and transport and you don't have a cummerbund and all that extra stuff that that uh that makes it just tough to deal with so uh i got the straps here on the end and i just duct taped the excess tail on there just to kind of keep it uh from being so long and then when i put it on i can tuck those in into the side straps between my body and the strap and that'll keep them from flopping around and flailing in the wind so uh but that's this setup as well and now that's just a couple of options that are all uh just a little bit easier to put on and a little quicker to uh get into the game uh when that's required of you and i really like this this plate carrier for that option also too it'd be a good option for somebody smaller or female or something like that where where they don't necessarily need a whole bunch of extra weight you can uh you can set them up with this and it'll be a lot a lot easier for them to deal with than a than a full-on plate carrier with cummerbund and side plates and all that stuff and this right here alone is still pretty heavy obviously because like i say i run steel armor i don't have any ceramic or anything like that but uh i like i say i do enjoy this plate carrier and uh it's pretty it's pretty high quality as well and this is a shell back tactical uh so like i said that's just another option for you guys or for anybody who's interested that uh that's a little bit easier to operate with and and to maneuver in and much quicker to get on and off uh and it affords you ballistic protection and a couple mags tourniquet and a trauma kit as well for uh you know for if you had to throw it on pretty quickly so i think that's another good option to uh look into for you guys and this is also my workout plate carry i can just take the mags and stuff out and uh tear away this med pouch on the back and then when i go to excuse me when i go to the gym i can work out on this thing without uh without looking you know totally crazy the whole time with a bunch of extra stuff on there and still get some uh some weight some added weight from it and get used to wearing the armor and running and doing pull-ups and stuff like that so that this is my workout plate carrier as well so it it pulls double duty but uh i just wanted to talk about some of those theories and stuff like that with you guys and talk about some of those options for bump kid or you know active shooter response and you know obviously we don't want to be in a situation like that at all but uh it's it's not beyond the realm of possibility so uh we need to we need to at least think about those things and and have some type of an idea of of of what to grab and and how to go about uh employing different different different kits and different strategies based on different scenarios and uh while i got you guys here i'll do a quick uh edc dump i got my keys i'm filming on my phone uh i got my ontario knife company wrap one in my left pocket right pocket is benchmade griptilian and it's a combo edge half serrated that's one of my favorite knives for sure i got my 511 tactical flashlight it's just standard double a sale i like it it's got high low and strobe so it's pretty good to go i wanted a light that ran on just regular double a batteries for edc because my other two that were comparable in size ran on the cr123s and those things are expensive so i have to feed enough lights and stuff with them as it is so i tried to get away from that a little bit that's my spare mag for my glock 26 this is a 17 round mag and just amazon uh kydex mag pouch it works good it stays put i got the glock 26 in my circle because i'm here at home and uh it's more comfortable outside the waistband so got that see what else i got i got some oc spray saber i've had that one for a while still works a big lighter because you always got to have a lighter and i got my little slim wallet from amazon and my core essentials uh kydex reinforced belt with the uh ratcheting system i really love this belt and that's that's pretty much it for me that's what i got on me that's pretty much what i carry every day right there of course the host will change for concealment purposes and sometimes the handgun will change but usually i'll carry this glock 26 pretty much all the time because i like it because it works i can shoot it pretty well and uh i got a slew of magazines for it that hold a lot of ammo and i got a couple actually got like three in the truck so that forced me the option to swap magazines and change my spare magazine uh on the fly you know no matter where i am i can i can up my ammo in the field if you will without going through any grief and like i said other the glock mags are always in my truck so i don't have to think about it i just throw the glock on get in the truck go like normal and i got extra ammo in there already loaded into a 21 round mag i got a flush fit and 10 round mag if i want to conceal a little better and then i got a 21 round mag and a 27 round mag fully loaded with hollow points so pretty well got that system configured the way i want it and it works well for me so i just kind of stick with it and uh i brought out the uh xds 45 today just uh have here on the table top and it's loaded with this is the mod 2 xds 45 and it's loaded with barnes 185 grain tacxp and i think these are plus p actually so pretty nasty nasty defense round that's the uh five round flush mag but i got the pinky extension on there and then in here we got the extended mag which holds seven with the uh grip extension on it and this is just a little twenty dollar twenty or thirty dollar amazon or ebay codex holster with the adjustable cam and the quick clip it works well solid lock up and uh i really like this gun it is loaded i'm not going to clear there's no need to but uh feels great shoots great and you got a fiber optic front sight that's red and white dot at the rear so i really like it but uh i guess that's enough babbling and i just kind of wanted to touch on some of that stuff with you guys and i appreciate you guys watching and uh i'll try to keep the videos coming for you i'm out of here", "G1YL8v94Brk": "all right gen chem today we are going to start a new chapter chapter 15 reaction rates sometimes it's called reaction kinetics or kinetics of reaction so when we talk about reaction rates we're going to talk about them in in concert with kinetics which is the movement of particles so we're going to explain how reaction rates can be changed with different particle motion so let's talk about really quickly first thing what we mean by a reaction rate now a rate is how quickly something happens okay so a rate is a change in something over a change in time so we're talking about how fast a reaction will happen so we're talking about how fast a chemical reaction will happen and we usually measure this by the change and i'm going to use the delta symbol because in greek alphabet that delta means change in usually the mass or the concentration of a product so we'll measure a product of that reaction and we'll see how quickly it changes mass like how much we can weigh of that product or how concentrated that product would be and we usually measure that in terms of time sometimes the time will be quick like per seconds or minutes sometimes even hours and you saw when we did um half-life sometimes the half-life was days or years so sometimes these reactions take place over really long time so that something is usually a change of one of our products we can also kind of change it by measuring how quickly one of our reactants is used up how much mass we lose of our reactants or how the concentration of our reactants goes down but we usually measure it in terms of a product okay so there are several things that affect the reaction rate just by changing how the particles are the first one is the nature of the reactants so if i have a reactant say that's a small little molecule there's only a few places on that molecule that i can hit that molecule not very many options of how i hit that molecule so that reaction is going to go a lot faster than if i have a really large molecule so you have a really large like protein and right here is the place that's reactive but look at all these places i can hit this molecule i can hit this molecule all over but i have to hit it i should put this one in red i have to hit it right here for it to work but all these other places i can hit that molecule is not going to work it's not the active site of that molecule so the smaller the molecule the more chance i have of hitting the right place so let's write that down the smaller the molecule and what we can say particle or molecule the better chance i have of hitting the right place for reaction so smaller molecules end up usually having much higher reaction rates because there aren't that many places for that molecule to be in contact with the other molecule that it needs to react with concentration let's think about this if i have a bin that just has a few molecules in it or if i have a bin that has a bunch of molecules in it which bin has a better chance of hitting another another molecule this one does right all reactions have to happen because we are hitting molecules together and the more chance we have of hitting molecules together the more chance we have of actually having a reaction happen so higher concentration gives us a higher probability or chance that a molecule will hit another molecule or collide with another molecule okay so the more i can increase that chance of actually hitting another molecule the more chance i have of that molecule actually having a reaction so a higher concentration gives us more of a chance than something with a low concentration there isn't much of a chance with so few molecules that those molecules are actually going to come in contact with each other okay i will upload a video showing you how concentration affects the reaction rate the next thing that helps us actually have a good reaction is having a catalyst now if i look at these energy diagrams i have energy on my y axis and on my x-axis this is actually time it's the progress of a reaction in a normal reaction i start out here with my reactants and i have to put in this much energy this is what we call the activated complex it's the activated complex and this energy that i have to put in here is the energy i need to break reactant bonds and start form and start forming product bonds so i have to break reactant bonds and then i have to form bonds of the product and that takes energy to break bonds and to form new bonds okay and there are only a couple or a couple molecules that actually have enough kinetic energy to put in all that energy so if i can put in a catalyst now catalysts give us a different or an alternate way of reacting an alternate pathway catalysts are not used they are not used okay they are just they provide an alternate pathway okay so are not used or consumed and they provide an alternate reaction pathway at lower energy okay so if we look at our catalyst here our catalyst line with the catalyst we don't have to put in nearly as much energy so we will actually have more molecules that have that kinetic energy that can get to here so because we have more molecules that can actually have that amount of energy we will have more molecules reacting so we actually get more products and it will actually speed up the reaction because of that same thing here notice the energy required with the catalyst compared to the activation energy without a catalyst here that catalyst provides us another pathway or an alternate pathway with a lower energy profile so more molecules actually have the energy that it takes to complete that reaction okay and remember catalysts are not used up in the reaction they're they're kind of they help along they're kind of like a helper and then when the next molecule comes along they can take a next molecule they are not used up in the reaction okay surface area surface area is a huge one now think about this if i had a fire and i put a wood fire think about a campfire if i have a normal campfire i usually put on big chunks of wood on that fire logs big limbs big branches where on that wood does the fire actually burn it burns just on the surface so it takes a long while for that fire to actually get into the center of the wood or the log because you have to burn off all the surface so reactions can only happen where the reactants the air in this case and the wood can come into contact with each other so reactions only happen on the surface and they only happen on the surface because the reactants have to be be able to become in contact with each other so a big wood fire in a campfire that log only burns on the surface what if i took that log and put it through a chipper or made sawdust out of that log and then put that sawdust or wood chips on the fire what would happen to the rate of the fire think about it for a second if you've ever seen a handful of asadas thrown into a fire it creates a fireball it's actually a really dangerous situation because the surface area of that wood is now everywhere because the particles of the wood are so small that there's surface everywhere and so it all burns all fast okay so sawdust we have really increased the surface area so the fire burns fast and it burns it all instantaneously okay so the more surface area that i have the more ability i have for the reactants to get in contact with each other and actually react so i can speed up a reaction by increasing the surface area if you've ever taken an alka-seltzer tablet and put it in water and then taken another alka-seltzer tablet and crushed it up into little fine crumbs the crumbs will be used up in them just like that where the tablet takes a while to dissolve so if i can increase that surface area i'm going to increase that reaction rate okay temperature temperature will always if i increase that temperature it will always cause an increase in the reaction rate and this is why i've been saying over and over that for something to react i've got to get it to collide right the reactants have to collide with each other so if i increase the temperature what happens with the speed of the molecules does it increase temperature faster molecules move faster right hotter molecules move faster so the molecules move faster and if they move faster aren't they going to collide more often because they're just traveling faster yeah so the molecules collide more often so because i have more collisions more of those collisions are actually able to produce a reaction so more collisions equal more molecules reacting so the more i can speed things up the more collisions i'm going to have because they're moving around even more and more energetic and the more molecules i will have reacting okay so let's talk about this collision theory now collision theory states that all molecules have to collide in order to react okay so molecules must collide in order to react we've talked about that a bit so far okay but they you have to do more than just collide every collision does not produce a reaction just like we set up here if i have this big huge molecule up here i can have all these collisions but only the red ones going to actually create a reaction because i have to hit on the right part of the molecule okay so that's one of the things that has to happen in order for a reaction to occur there must be a meaningful collision between particles a meaningful collision must involve two things the first thing is we have to hit on the right part of the molecule or the molecule has to be oriented in the right way so the collision must be in the proper or right correct orientation that's just a fancy way of saying the right part of the molecule has to hit the right part of the other molecule so the correct or the right part of the molecules must collide okay so the correct or the right part of the molecules must collide with each other otherwise it's not going to react okay the other thing that has to happen is the molecules have to collide with enough energy to actually make that activated complex and we talked about that a little bit in this energy diagram i said that we had to have enough energy to break the reactant bonds and start forming new bonds so not just colliding with the right spot i have to collide with enough energy to actually start breaking the reactant bonds and start making the product bonds so i have to have enough energy in the collision so our next thing is the collision must have enough energy okay so think about it this way if you've ever been to a demolition derby there's one goal in a demolition derby your car needs to be the last car that's drivable so you need to hit all the other cars in a way that makes them so that they are undrivable so if i'm driving my car and i hit the trunk of all the other cars does that really help me make the other cars undrivable no because i'm not hitting the right part of the car i need to hit the other cars in a way that damages their engines so that it doesn't allow it to drive okay number two so that's hitting in the proper spot number two if i'm in a collision and a demolition derby and i'm driving my car five miles an hour so i'm not hitting anything very hard am i gonna damage the cars that i hit no i need to collide going fast enough to have enough energy in the collision to actually damage the other cars so when we collide to have a reaction those two things need to happen i have to hit with enough energy and i have to hit on the proper the proper part of that molecule to get it to react with the proper orientation so let's think about this we have carbon nitrogen and oxygen right here and i'm trying to get the carbon monoxide this black and red molecule to hit nitrogen dioxide and actually take one of the oxygens off of the nitrogen dioxide and put it on the carbon monoxide to make carbon dioxide okay so if i have the two oxygens hitting that's not the proper orientation i need the oxygen from the carbon from the nitrogen dioxide to be hitting the carbon i need it to hit over here so that's not the right orientation so same here i don't want the oxygen hitting the nitrogen i want this oxygen hitting the carbon over here so it's going to rebound it's not going to react i could have the correct orientation where the oxygen is hitting the carbon that will work notice now i do have carbon dioxide and nitrogen monoxide just like i wanted or i could even have the correct orientation but this is a weak collision it's not very strong it's insufficient energy it will still rebound so i have to have the proper orientation and i have to have the right amount of energy okay so next time we will start getting into reading these diagrams these energy diagrams and start getting some of the information off of that and telling whether a reaction is exothermic or endothermic and telling us how much energy there is in the activated complex and all of that kind of stuff so we'll do that next time have a great time we'll see you next time bye", "ti_E2ZKZpC4": "welcome to this lecture\non chemical curiosities I'm gonna start with the liquid in this container\nand I just pour some into this cylinder since it's a nice\nbright red color let's see what happens\nif I keep pouring I think you can see every time I pour out the\nliquid I seem to get a different color so, in the dictionary\nthe word curious is defined to mean something which is\npuzzling or surprising or unexpected and this demonstration might\nseem rather puzzling at first until we realize that the cylinders\nwere not empty at the start each of them had a little speck of\nchemical which reacted with the liquid in this container and it produced a color change and we'll look at\nthe chemistry of that in just a moment let's have a look at the liquid in\nthese two beakers they are both colorless let's see what happens when I\npour the liquid from this beaker into this one so again we see a color change it's turning\nblue, the blue is getting darker as i keep pouring\ngoes away again thats also rather odd\nit seems as if a chemical reaction began\nand produced the color change and then it sort of changed its mind and went\nbackwards so did it go backwards did that chemical reaction go backwards so the chemistry of these demonstrations\nis based on a simple idea which is that every substance can be thought of is either an acid or an alkali and if it's neither if\nit's sort of in the middle we say that it's neutral now we can use\ncertain substances to tell us whether a material is acid or alkali and probably one of the most famous\nof these is called litmus so litmus is a material which\nis red in acid conditions and its blue in alkali\nconditions and there are lots of other indicators. I normally used in this\nexperiment was called universal indicator this has a range of different\ncolors it's red when things are strongly acidic in the middle where things are neutral its green\nand in strongly alkaline conditions its purple and this experiment is based on an\nindicator called thymolphthalein. which is colorless\nin acid and its blue in alkaline conditions so these cylinders had different amounts of acid\nand alkaline in them producing the various different colors in this experiment the first beaker\nhad a mixture of thymolphthalein and some acid and the second\nBeaker had some alkali and the key to this\nis that when acid mixes with alkali they\nreact to produce a salt plus water so they are sort of opposites\nthey kind of cancel each other out so as I started to\npour the liquid the acid and final fehling from\nhere went into the alkali the alkali quickly cancelled out the\nacid so the final fehling is now an alkaline solution that turns blue but as I keep on pouring I'm\nadding more and more acid its neutralizing the alkali and\neventually this beaker becomes acid as well and the final fehling goes back to being\ncolorless so this reaction was not going backwards it was just\nthe same reaction all along we could ask is there a\nchemical reaction that goes backwards can chemical reactions go backwards at\nall well it turns out to be a really interesting question\nand it's a question that we gonna come back to several times\nduring the course of this lecture but let me just show you\nnow an other example of a reaction involving universal\nindicator and it's this column of water which has universal indicator and also a\nlittle bit of sodium hydroxide which is alkaline and so it's turned it this sort of bluey\npurple color I'm gonna add some acid we should see it go through a\nsequence of colors rather like these now the particular acid that i'm gonna use\nis acid that's going to be made in the water from\ncarbon dioxide so, in this beaker I have carbon\ndioxide but it's frozen its at -79 degrees centigrade it's become\na solid we call this dry ice because when it warms up it doesn't melt to a \nliquid it goes straight to the gas its always dry so when  I add the dry\nice to the water it will react with the water to\nform an acid called carbonic acid thats the same stuff that's in fizzy drinks thats\nwhat gives the the fizzy drinks that fizz so let's see what happens\nwhen I add this now watch for the color changes you should see that sequence\nof different colors okay so in all the reactions we've seen\nso far we mix two things together it produced a chemical reaction\nwhich gave rise to a color change so let's have a look at\nthis flask. This flask has a a colorless liquid in,\nbut if I shake the flask it turns blue that's a bit surprising because i didn't  seem\nto be mixing two things together I was i was just shaking up a single liquid here is another flask it's a similar\nidea this is a yellow liquid if I shake it it turns red if we gave it a really\ngood shake it turns green there is something else rather surprising\nabout this as well. If we keep watching the green is turning back to red and if we look here the blue is\nturning back to being colorless infact the red will go back to being\nyellow so it's going back through that sequence of colors again what's more I can even repeat it so If I\nshake it again goes back to being blue shake this again goes back\nto being red and so on if I wait it will go back so again it\nlooks as if we have a chemical reaction that's going backwards but \nthe first mystery is why do we have a color change at all\nI didn't seem to be mixing two things together what we have to remember of course is\nthat this flask not only contains water but it contains a gas\nin fact the gas is just air and air of course is a\nchemical and when I shake the flask I'm mixing\noxygen from the air with the liquid and that's\nproducing the chemical reaction so the next question is did this\nchemical reaction then go backwards as it fades from blue to colorless is it\na chemical reaction that\"s going backwards well unfortunately it is'nt because\nwhat's happening is there's a second chemical reaction taking place this flask contains a dye\ncalled methylene blue when it reacts with oxygen it\ngoes from colorless to blue but also in the flask there is some glucose\nand that glucose slowly turns methylene blue from blue-color back to being\ncolorless this is the same idea but with the different material\ncalled indigo carmine so again we didn't have a\nchemical reaction going backwards but we're gonna keep on looking for such\na reaction as we go through the lecture so in the reactions we've seen so\nfar then we mix to things together and we got a color change so let's\nhave a look at what happens when i mix these two colorless liquid together so\nfirst all this machine is just called a magnetic stirrer it just spins these little magnets and keeps\nthe liquid stirring it's just because i'm too lazy to stand here\nstir them by hand so if a colorless liquid being stirred\ni'm gonna add a second colorless liquid and watch closely and see if you\ncan detect a color change so keep watching (Audience surprised) okay  (Laughing) very strange, very strange indeed, we mixed\nthese two chemicals and it seemed as if no reaction took place we just sat there for 10 seconds\nand then suddenly it reacted now that seems very odd very surprising but\nwhat was really going on what's really going on is that there\nare actually two different chemical reactions taking place\ninside this beaker the first reaction was\nquite a slow reaction it was a reaction between two\nchemicals that produced Iodine so imagine this reaction taking place\nand slowly releasing iodine into the solution now the iodine would\nappear as a sort of brown color you can't see the iodine\nbecause there's a second chemical reaction taking place\nthere's a material in the solution which is reacting very quickly with the iodine and\nit's absorbing the iodine as soon as it's produced and the secret to this is to\narrange that second material is in short supply so the iodine is being produced slowly is being mugged up by the second\nmaterial as soon as it's produced when that second material runs out\nafter about 10 seconds or so the next little piece of iodine to\nbe produced remains in solution because the iodine is a bit hard to see\nfrom the back of the room we've added some starch the iodine reacts with the starch and produces a\nvery dark blue color that appears to be almost black okay so thats\ncalled a clock reaction so now you understand how that one\nworks. Have a look at this one this involves three color\nsolutions so I poured out one into there and I pour this\ninto here again watch closely okay so thats a sort of  two-stage clock\nso i leave you to think about how that one might be working so in\nthe reactions we've seen so far then we mix chemicals together and we know that a\nreaction has taken place because we had a change of color but there are lots of other ways that a\nchemical reaction can show up and one way is called a change of state so the state of something just means whether it's a solid or\nliquid or gas so something turns to a solid to liquid or from a gas to the solid then it's changed state\nso we show you an example of a chemical reaction that involves a change of state so we will use these two liquids i have a  red\nliquid and a colorless liquid what I'm going to\ndo is to pour the colorless liquid onto the\nred liquid very carefully and try to make two layers so what I want to happen is for the\ncolorless liquid to be floating on top of the red liquid in in separate layers that they don't\nmix so that's worked quite well so what i've got now is one liquid\nfloating on top of another and where they meets they undergo\na chemical reaction and they're actually making a solid\na solid material is  formed where the two liquids\nmeets what I can do is to fetch out some of this solid material and as I pull it\nout of the beaker of course it allows the two\nliquids to meet each other again and so they react again to form more\nof this solid so if I'm careful so as I wind I'm pulling up this material and it\nallows the two liquids to meet again and it forms more this material and this substance that's being formed is\nactually nylon so we're making nylon as I speak and if I'mcareful I'd be able to just keep on turning this\nand making this long thread of nylon atleast until we run out of solutions. Okay so that's an example of a chemical reaction that involves a change of state. So let's\nhave a look at another reaction that involve a change of state and\nfor this i'd like a volunteer please ... who would like to volunteer you are very keen, common, lets have\na big hand for our volunteer, you would like to stand\nthere, put those on what's your name ? Dylan. Dylan, alright\nyou stand just there we gonna do some chemistry we  gonna\nmake a solid alright I'm gonna start of with a flask that contains a solution\nof silver nitrates and I'm going to\nadd a little bit of ammonia now when i add the ammonia you see that it's forming\na sort of brown color now keep on adding the\nammonia and then in a minute brown color should disappear\nthat's disappeared isn't it now what I'm going to do is to add\nsome sodium hydroxide that's now formed a sort of very\ndark brown almost black material so now I'm going to add more ammonia and again I'm going to add ammonia untill\nthe liquid goes back to being colorless It takes a moment or two there we go and then finally\nI'm going to add some glucose so there's the glucose\nI'm gonna put the lid on with a clip-on I'm gonna give it to you Dylan and I want you to hold that and I want you to give it a really good shake that's\nit really hard shake that's good that's it keep shaking that's it so what's happening inside this flask now is\nthere's a chemical reaction taking place and it's forming a\nsolid and the actual material that it's forming is silver\nwe're making pure silver metal keep shaking it takes about three quarters of an hour is\nthat okay (Audience laughing) ... it does actually take a minute but the harder you shake the better it\nworks so keep shaking don't drop it. okay so metal silver metal is\nbeing formed an atom by atom and you can see it's all going quite black\nthat's because very finely divided silver is actually\nblack in color what we're hoping is gonna happen\nover the next minute or so is that those particles of silver will start to stick to the walls of the flask\nand as they build up we should see a silver metal in the form of a mirror building up on the\ninside of the flask and you've all seen those sort of decorations\nyou get it in Christmas those spheres that are shiny and they are made using this chemical\nreaction little balls of glass and the inside is coated with\nsilver using this kind of chemistry doing really well okay\nso I have quick look almost there keep going a little bit\nlonger so it looks a little bit dark excellent alright give it back to me\nthen right let me take the clip off you take out the stopper just wash that off and I pour out the\nremaining chemicals and then I'm going to\nrinse this out with distilled water and I'm going to add a second time third time there we go and just look at that one let's dry this off and\nthen clip back on and if you like to just\ngive that a little polish if you'd like to hold it up by the neck that's\nit and if we bring a camera in and have a look at this and we've got a\nlovely silver mirror there we go ok what I'm gonna do is give that to you. Take  that to home and you can go back to your seat,\nlets have a hand for our volunteer ok so that's an example\nof a chemical reaction the produces a change of state and I\nwant to show you another example of a chemical reaction again this is going to go from\nbeing a liquid to being a solid so in  this flask I have a solution of sodium acetate and this sodium acetate is a liquid as you can see, but it would very much like to be a solid it would like to turn\ninto a crystal but it needs a sort of an excuse\nto get going and the excuse is gonna be some little crystals\nof solid sodium acetate in this dish so watch what\nhappens if I pour the liquid onto the crystals I think\nyou can see that the liquid as soon as it touches the\ncrystals is turning into a solid and with a bit of luck we can\nmake a sort of chemical sculpture seems to be working okay so that's a sort of\nsodium acetate sculpture now what we've learned is that this actually has a\npractical application in this is the practical application this is something called a hand warmer and it's a plastic patch and it contains\nexactly the same liquid as in this flask this is a solution of sodium acetate and it would like to turn into a\nsolid it would like to turn into a crystal but it needs some excuse to\nget going and the excuse is this little metal\ndisc and if I just flip this disc backwards and forwards\nthat should be enough just to start the crystallization and\nthere it is and we can see the liquid turning into a\nsolid as it does so its actually getting warm\nso it's actually giving off heat and there it is it has turned entirely into crystals it's become quite\nwarm in the process and I can put that inside my glove\nand keep my hands warm for half an hour or so and then I can take\nthis and put it into boiling water for a couple of minutes the crystals will turn\nback into a liquid I can allow it to cool and that'll stay as\na liquid that will stay like that for weeks or months until I'm ready to use it again\nwe can use it thousands of times okay so that's sodium acetate\nit's a sort of chemical sculpture I'm gonna show you now another way\nto make a chemical sculpture and chris has been preparing\nthis this beaker contains a mixture of para nitro acetanilide and sulfuric acid and chris\nhas been warming it up and when it's hot enough it will undergo a reaction in which\nthis liquid will turn into a solid this makes quite a bit of smoke so we've got\nthis special hood that will suck away the smoke from the reaction here it goes  okay so that's a chemical reactions\nthat involves a change of state so we've seen lots of chemical reactions now\nin this lecture we've seen reactions that produced color changes we've\nseen reactions that produce changes of States and we're asking\nourselves the question could a chemical reaction go backwards\nyou may have seen several reactions that appear to be going backwards but when we understood them a\nbit more carefully we realize no they weren't going backwards so we'd still like to understand whether\na chemical reaction could ever go backwards now to do that we first of all have\nto ask why does a chemical reaction happen at all why the chemical reactions happen in the first place but to understand that we're gonna\nlook at some very simple chemistry and it's the combustion\nof hydrogen so Chris has filled a balloon\nwith hydrogen gas and we're gonna set fire to the baloon\nand what will happen is the hydrogen will react with the oxygen in the air\nand that will produce a small quantity of water vapor and it will also\nrelease some energy okay so this is the reaction of hydrogen with the oxygen from the\nair here we go okay so can we just have a show of  hands\ncan you put your hand up if you enjoyed that demonstration its quite a few can you put your hand up\nif you'd like to see a slightly bigger one okay that's everybody\nalright come on Chris okay now the last\nballoon may have quite a pop this one is going to make an even\nlouder pop quite a loud bang in fact I'm standing quite close to this so\nI'm gonna wear my ear defenders what you might like to do is to cover\nyour ears for this one because it could be fairly loud okay we'll bring down the lights this is the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen so i think you would have\nnoticed in that reaction that energy was released clearly so we've got a lot of noise we saw the flame we saw the lights I could feel the heat and probably in the front row could as well so energy was released in that\nreaction so what's happening is that the starting material\nthe hydrogen and oxygen were in a state\nof high energy and as a result of the reaction they've\nmoved to a state of low energy now the total energy in the world is always\nconserved you can't create or destroy energy so that difference in energy was given\nout is given out in the form of that bang that's a the heat and the light and the sound and\nso on so maybe that's why chemical reactions happen may be chemical reactions happen because the\nchemicals move from a state of high-energy to a state of low energy and they\ngive out that difference of energy so it's a bit like taking a ball and\nputting it on a slope if you put a ball on a slope it rolls down hill from a state of high energy to a state of low energy so maybe that's how\nchemical reactions work if it is how chemical reactions work\nthen it's pretty obvious that a chemical reaction could never go backwards\nbecause going backwards would be like putting a ball on a\nhill and having it decide to roll up hill that's not gonna happen okay so\nwe'll keep that thought in mind and we'll look at some other examples of\nchemical reactions that give out energy now we've seen energy being given out in \nthe form a bang we saw a little bit light being given off there\nin the form of that flame and I want to show you reaction that\ngives off a great deal of lights it's the reaction of a rather special\nelement it's called phosphorous and the word phosphorus comes from the Greek\nit means that the giver or the bearer of light so this is a reaction that will\ngive out a great deal of light so we could just burn a little\nbit of phosphorus on the on the bench but we thought we'd do is to\nscale this up and do this on the larger scale we could and so this is actually the largest\nflask that you can buy in the UK and so this is about as big\nas as we can make it and we're gonna burn quite a big\nchunk of white phosphorus inside this flask, and to make it burn really\nwell, we're gonna fill the flask with pure oxygen now in order to fill the flask\nwith pure oxygen we're going to use liquid oxygen; and we're gonna\nmake the liquid oxygen by starting from another\nliquefied gas - liquid nitrogen so in this vacuum\nflask I have some liquid nitrogen it's a, a colorless\nliquid - it looks pretty much like water but it's at a very low temperature.  It's at - 196 degrees centigrade so just for a little bit of fun I thought\nwe'd see what happens if we take some liquid nitrogen at -196 degrees centigrade and pour it into some pretty\nmuch boiling water okay and and this is what happens there's no real point in that it\nwas just for fun you understand okay so this liquid nitrogen is extremely cold\nand we can use it to cool down oxygen gas so that it too\nbecomes a liquid that's what Chris has been doing over here. So this cylinder contains oxygen gas and Chris has been passing the\noxygen gas through a coil of copper that sat inside some liquid nitrogen\nand the oxygen has been turning into liquid itself and so this\nvacuum flask contains liquid oxygen i just want to show you one interesting\nthing about to about liquid oxygen I'm going to pour it into this test tube and you may be able to see\nthat although the the air the air contains one-fifth\noxygen; and the air of course is completely transparent and yet oxygen when it becomes a\nliquid turns this lovely blue color okay so we're going to use this\nliquid oxygen then to fill this flask with\noxygen. So I'm going to pour this in and we'll add a bit more for good\nmeasure should be enough ok and so the oxygen the liquid oxygen is warming up as it touches the flask\nand it's evaporating it's turning into oxygen gas and as as it as it turns into a gas it's pushing the air you can see the the fumes coming out\nthe top here is pushing the air out of the flask and filling\nthe flask with oxygen just to help that along a\nbit just gonna swirl this around okay you can see a little bit of liquid oxygen there that lovely blue\ncolor sloshing around in the bottom of this flask so that gradually evaporating and\nthat's filling the flask with pure oxygen of course we could have just\ntaken a hose from this cylinder into the flask and fill it with oxygen\nthat way but I think this was more fun okay while that last little bit is evaporating the next thing we're going to do is to get some phosphorous there are two kinds of phosphorus red\nphosphorus and white phosphorous this is white phosphorous; it's the more\nreactive kind.  It's so reactive that it actually reacts with the air if\nyou just leave it sitting on a a bench it will actually catch fire after a few\nminutes and so we store it under water So I'm gonna fetch out this piece of white phosphorous and we're going to put\nit in a little spoon that's suspended from\nthe lid of the flask You can see the phosphorous is smoking already\nas it comes into contact with the air and that will probably catch fire sometime in\nthe next few minutes but just to help it along I'm going to take a glass rod\nand heat up the end of the rod and then just touch that against the\nphosphorous just to get things going and as a as soon as the phosphorous\nignites we'll bring down the lights what you'll see is\nthe reaction of phosphorus burning in pure oxygen you can see this lovely white light that's being given out it's a very vigorous reaction the flask is filling with\noxides of phosphorous so thats white phosphorus \nthe bearer of light okay so that's a chemical\nreaction then which gives out energy in the form of light, I'm going to\nshow you another reaction now which gives out energy again in form of light but\nalso in the form of sound this is a reaction between\na colorless gas which is in this glass tube called\nnitric oxide and a liquid called carbon disulfide so this is the carbon disulfide. I'm gonna\nadd some of this to the tube and then we're gonna mix them together. So Chris is going to mix the carbon disulfide with the \nnitric oxide the carbon disulfide evaporates and turns into a gas we've got a little bit of water in the\ntube just to help them mix and when they're thoroughly mixed we'll set fire to it now this happens this reaction\nhappens reasonably quickly so we'll just bring the\nlights down first So you've seen a couple reactions there that\ninvolve effectively combustion and combustion can give rise to\nsome very interesting chemistry and for this I'm going to set fire\nto a brand-new fifty-pound note as an example of\ncombustion so let me soak the fifty pound notes\nin some flammable liquid and then we'll set it on fire this\nis a this is my fifty pound notes its brand new, and there\nit is on fire the flames have gone out but the fifty\npound notes I'm pleased to say is entirely intact. I'm very pleased about that Now the reason that the fifty-pound note\nsurvived has to do with the choice of liquid so this liquid was 50 percent\nalcohol which is inflammable and 50 percent water\nand it was the water that protected the fifty pound note - it\nabsorbs heat, and it stopped the note from burning so really that's not too surprising\nbecause we know that we use water to put out fires the fire brigade\ncarry water with them, they have hoses they use water for\nfire extinguishing So let's have a look at some different ways\nof putting out fires I've got here three fire extinguishers based on different\nkinds of Chemistry Now it would be very surprising wouldn't it if we could use a fire\nextinguisher not to put out a fire it to make a fire worse.  It would be really\nsurprising if we could use a fire extinguisher to start a fire okay let's look at the first\nkinda fire extinguisher so this is called a water fire\nextinguisher it contains water under pressure when you let extinguisher\noff the water comes out at the hose you soak the fire and you put the fire\nout.  Now if I let that off in here it would just flood the lecture theatre so we do\nsomething else that's that's equivalent from the point of view of Chemistry and and that's to use a water\npistol so this water pistol contains just ordinary tap\nwater I can pressurize it and we can you're careful or you're wishful so this is just like that\nwater fire extinguisher it squirts a jet of water so could we use this to start a fire well for this I'd like\na volunteer please who would like to volunteer you are very quick lets give a hand for our volunteer please and what's your name yeah\nCiara, right Ciara ifyou like to put on these safety goggles these are special\nsafety goggles because they are tinted nice trendy shades\nall right and what you are going to do is\nto squirt the water pistol at the little metal dish. Can you see\nthat on the little stand there and that dish contains a\nmixture of silver nitrate and finally padded magnesium and if you\nget a little bit of water to land on it we'll see if that can start a fire now because\nthis contains magnesium is going to produce a very\nbright light so my suggestion my recommendation is that you\ndon't look directly at the dish but instead you look to one side now you\ndo need to look at the dish because you can hit it in the water so that's we've given you these special\ngoggles all right so of you go see if you could get a little bit water into that dish well done but thank\nyou very much okay so that was the first time a\nfire extinguisher that's that's the water-based fire extinguisher so if you see a little\nfire involving magnesium and silver nitrate don't try to put it out with that, this is the next kinda fire extinguisher it has \ngot a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher and it contains\nliquid carbon dioxide under very high pressure\nso just I pull out the pin and point the nozzle up\nwe'll just set this off and okay so you can see the liquid carbon\ndioxide and a very high pressure comes out through the nozzle it turns\ninto a gas now carbon dioxide is often one of the main results of combustion\nit's something light wood or paper is burning the carbon reacts with the oxygen in\nthe air to produce carbon dioxide to the carbon dioxide is the\nend product of combustion that's why it is good for putting out fires\nso we use the carbon dioxide fire extinguisher to smother a fire\nexclude the air and therefore exclude the oxygen\nand then the fire goes at to be a bit odd if using a fire extinguisher like this would\nactually make the fireworse rather than better well let's see what that\nmight look like so again we're going to use carbon\ndioxide in a very concentrated form in the form of solid\ncarbon dioxide or dry ice which is something that we saw little\nbit earlier in the lecture this is a block of dry ice and again\nwe are going to use magnesium so I have some\nmagnesium metal here and its gonna make a\nlittle pile in a little trough that we've cut inside\nthe block I'm going to set fire to the magnesium\nand once its on fire chris is going to put the the\nother half of the block on top and then the magnesium will\nbe sort of trapped inside and if we bring the light stand and you\ncan see the combustion is becoming more vigorous this is magnesium burning in carbon dioxide it's not putting\nthe fire out it's actually supporting combustion giving out this beautiful light the white\nsmoke you see is magnesium oxide this is the sort of stuff that's used\nin the indigestion tablets that kind of thing I would'nt recommend that for\ndealing with indigestion so the magnesium combines with \nthe carbon dioxide to make magnesium oxide\nand carbon thank you okay we have a third\nkinda fire extinguisher and that's this one this\nis called a dry powder fire extinguisher it contains\na powder this pressurized when we set this off the\npowder comes out of the hose and we can squirt at the fire and put\nthe fire out now these are actually extremely good fire extinguishers you have an\nextinguisher in your kitchen one in your car is probably a dry\npowder extinguisher and these extinguishes usually contain\nsomething like sodium or potassium carbonate or sodium or potassium bicarbonate\nthey're very effective extinguishers they are good for\ndealing with all kinds of fire and it would be very surprising if using the\npowder out of one of those that actually make combustion faster\non make it worse well i have to say can in this spoon we have a gram of\ncommercial gun powder it's made from a mixture of three ingredients saltpeter ( chemical name is potassium nitrate ) and that act's as a source of concentrated\noxygen we call that an oxidizer it contains charcoal\nwhich acts as the fuel that burns in the oxygen released\nby the potassium nitrate and it contains sulfur and\nthe sulfur is there to aid combustions make the gun powder burn more easily what would happen if\nwe took gun powder and instead of using charcoal\nwhich is the main fuel we use some of the powder from a\nfire extinguisher so this seems pretty odd we gonna take away the\nmain fuel from the Gunpowder and we are gonna replace it with something\nthat's used in a fire extinguisher we are gonna use potassium carbonate for this so if we mix those three\nthings together that is potassium nitrate potassium\ncarbonate and sulfur we get something called yellow powder\nand so in this spoon we have a gram black powder and in this spoon\nwe have a gram of yellow powder now what I'm gonna do is to heat up these two spoons and we'll see if there's a difference between\nthese two powders, so there's the Gun powder and this is the a yellow powder now gunpowder when it burns in\nthe open doesn't make a bang it just burns with the Puff in a little cloud\nof smoke so we are not expecting the gun powder to make a bang\nyellow powder however very probably will make  a\nbang and it could be fairly loud so sometime in the\nnext minute or so there could be quite a loud bang you\nmight wish to cover your ears for this now as the spoons heat up at some point\nthe gun powder will get hot enough but it will ignite we'll see a puff of\nsmoke the other part is a little bit different inside that spoon the materials\nare starting to melt they're flowing together and\nsome chemistry is taking place the chemical composition is actually\nchanging as a result of being warmed up and at some point that\nnew mixture of chemicals should give rise to a little\nexplosion and the gun powder gives a beautiful smoke ring okay so that's some of the science of \ncombustion and that's how the powde the powder from a dry powder fire extinguisher could\nactually make combustion a little bit worse so if you remember one of\nthe questions that we're asking in this lecture is whether a\nchemical reaction can go backwards I said this is a very interesting\nquestion let me show you a fascinating reaction so in this beaker is a colorless liquid\nI'm going to add a second colorless\nliquid it remains colorless I'm gonna add some\nyellow liquid and it turned orange and add a little bit of red liquid and it goes sort of green color kind of muddy color now in a minute\nor so that muddy mess will fade away we'd be able to see the color of the\nsolution what I want you to do with to watch the color of this solution as it changes now the rather interesting story behind this reaction was first discovered in\nabout 1951 by a russian chemist called Boris Belousov and\nhe was trying to study the way citric acid behaves in the human body and so he was mixing various materials\ntogether in a beaker and he discovered some very interesting\ncolor changes any particular he discovered an oscillating chemical\nreaction that is a chemical reaction that went through a sequence of color\nchanges and then came back to the starting point you can see that muddy\ncolor is fading and we've now got got a green solution the solution\nis not gradually turning blue remember that it started at\nGreen and it's turned blue I Borissov tried to sum it\nall by the late in chemical reaction sort of like a reaction\nthat goes backwards and people thought that reaction's\ndidn't do that sort of thing so you wrote this up and\nhe sent it off to the top chemistry journal in Russia and the\neditors looked at this and they rejected the paper because they\nsaid that couldn't happen okay it's not turn from\nblue to red and green to do Reds so missile had his paper rejected\n3 send it to another journal and they did the same thing they\nrejected as well because they thought democrats it just shouldn't\nbehave like this must be something wrong so you got\npretty depressed about this if I got so depressed that he gave\nup being a scientist a discovery was so difficult and and about ten years later\na Stevens have chemistry zabinski that since the\nRussian student discovered status of notes not stand up\nto blues has turned grade all rights so remember that sequence\na green for a little while then blew that it went Reds them but\nsimply briefly now it screened so that the tin CE discovered the\nlittles notes and he recreated this experiment and he was able to is\npublished the conference in Vienna and then the whole world near back\nsittin' again quite a sensation they've got very excited about\nthese kinds of reactions cases gone back to play it is now turning back\nto read we'll keep going through that sequence of colors so it seems as if we have a\nreaction sorta goes back with released it goes round in a cycle so\nmost people started to study these reactions and they came\nup with other kinds all oscillating reactions 2012 show you\none that has quite a nice story to it because this is discovered not by\nprofessional chemists the by a couple earth schoolteachers and\ntheir names were Briggs and Russia and then working a high\nschool in San Francisco and they were using the school\nchemistry labs after hours and they discovered a different\nkind all oscillating reaction so again I have a clear liquids\nI had a second clear liquid and a third clear\nliquid that turns amber to keep watching turns blue radar late so there's a\nlittle bit like the clock reaction the same thing erection\nsomething starts and I attained at this time it doesn't stay\nplay is going clear again so it's become clear that's going back to amber to keep watching\nactively work and turns to blue again okay so those are two\noscillating chemical reactions just seems as if we found a chemical\nreaction the does actually go backwards but really that isn't what's happening\nit's not like a ball rolling downhill and then change its mind a rolling back up hill again\nit's more like a ball going down a so to the helix\nit gets back to the same color as when it started but it's not\nreally in the same condition because some of the chemicals have\nbeen used up we could watch these oscillations happening but after 10 or 20 minutes\nthey will come to a stop and that's because the chemicals have\nbeen used up so we haven't really found reaction yet that can go backwards\nso does that mean that of theory of chemical reactions is\ncorrect member of theory is the chemical reactions\nlike a ball rolling downhill the chemicals go from high-energy to\nlow-energy and they give that back energy difference in the fall\npeople light or sound or whatever well let's look at this reaction\nthis interaction between two powders so in the beaker's some barium\nhydroxide it's a white powder I've got a block of wood I\nwas gonna put some water on the surface the what makes a\npuddle I'm gonna stand the beaker in the puddle and then in\nthis peak and this flask I have some ammonium\nchloride I'm at the ammonium chloride to\nthe the barium hydroxide and I'm gonna stare\nusing this probe which is attached to this the moment\nthat this digital thermometer things in the temperature\nthere is about 20 degrees let me start to mix the prior to us\ntogether and we'll see what happens to the temperature so the temperatures falling\nvery quickly well below 10 degrees now and they took it has just gone negative\nthis is now the low note the grace so it's a -7 degrees so the\ntemperatures falling very rapidly the other thing that's happened\nis that it's turned from a solid into a liquid does not come\nwith a slushie white liquid the temperatures down to -15 degrees so\nwell below the freezing point of water i remember i stupid in\nlittle puddle of water so what should have happened\nis that water should a frozen never got frozen it\nto the block it would so that's pretty strange\nbecause that's the reaction that didn't give an insanity\nit's a reaction took in energy it actually took in heat from the\nsurroundings and that's why the surrounding such\nas the thermometer dropped in temperature\nso that's a bit like putting the ball on a slope and\nseeing the ball roll up hill but it shouldn't happen to\nthis array strange reaction it means that all theory\nof wine chemical reactions happen isn't quite right or\nat least it isn't complete there's something else that's\nmissing so what's missing you know theory all had chemistry happens went\nto illustrate this with the little computer game we got\nhere a hundred discs and each disc is yellow\non one side it's red on the other and the ball\ndown the right answer side show see the proportion of this\ncoochie yellow now starts at the mall of as Yellow and let's see what\nhappens when we run little simulation so that a\nhundred times a second the computer is choosing\na desk and its deciding either to keep it the same color or to\nflip it over and you can see on the right hand side the proportion upgrade and yellow now we\nstarted off with all the disks yellow very quickly we've got to state\nwhere about half of them Red in about half the\nyellow let's try again at this time we can set them all to\nread we can run the little simulation they start of all rate\nvery quickly they come to a state where about half as the\nreading about half of the magellan so me to say this is\nthe think that we started the discs off in a very ordered\nstate they were all the same color and as the simulation run the level is disorder increased it went from a and ordered\nstate two more random States and this is such an important idea given\na special name we call the degree of disorder entropy we say the entropy\ntends to increase with time we start of the things recorded\nand they became very disordered and the reason this happens very simple\nis because there's only one way for the disturb your yellow there are lots and lots and lots of ways\nfor the DS the beast the roughly half yellow and of bread and so it's just simply can sing\nthe number of different ways have arranging these discs that causes the\ndais to go from an ordered States the disordered state now\nyou might think well well hang on a moment\nif we wait long enough sooner or later by chance although\nthis will become yellow again so the system would then have gone from\nthe disordered stay tuned ordered States now you're absolutely right\nyou have to wait a long time this is doing about a hundred flip to\nsecond if we did a trillion flips the second you still have to wait longer\nin the age of the universe on average before you see\nthem or yellow again so it's almost certain that the world will move\nfrom an altered states to disordered state I've got a couple other\nteenage boys and their bedrooms provide a perfect\nillustration of this at if i tidy their bedrooms everything is\nvery or didn't come back the next day is almost certain to be a highly\ndisordered state without input from me it will never gain from being disordered\nto being ordered so that's the idea entropy entry fee increases and that\ncan drive a chemical reaction so let's think about a solid in a solid the atoms or molecules\nare arranged in nicely rose they're very order in so\nthe crystal lattice in a liquid the molecules can move around\nnot in fixed positions anymore so this is a more\ndisordered state in a solid and a gas is even more\ndisordered because the atoms or molecules are free to move\naround they can fill the container so as we go from solid to\nliquid to gas the entropy all the disorder increases up sarra to\nthings that can drive chemical reactions is the ball rolling downhill\neffects the decrease in energy all there is the\nincrease in entropy the teenager bedroom\neffect this reaction is being driven by that increase\nin entropy is gone from a solid to a liquid and that increase\nin entropy is so big the overcomes the fact he actually\nhas two increase the energy that reaction to happen that\nreaction happens spontaneously let's draws energy in from the\nenvironment and cools its environment and that's why that reaction happens so that means that we have two things\nthat can drive chemical reactions it's not just the ball\nrolling downhill it's also the the the bedroom\neffects and so perhaps now that we have that deeper\nunderstanding of Chemistry perhaps we can I find a chemical reaction\nthat goes backwards well to help this find\nthis I'm going to use the word curious in a different\nsense we've used curious to the strange or surprising or unexpected the curious\ncan also refer to desire2learn to curiosity I'm gonna\ntell you a story about curiosity in a a young chemist so\neasily with ira rents in and as an adult he became\nvery famous he founded the chemistry department at John Hopkins\nUniversity and he discovered the first official sweetener let's call saccharine but\nas a teenager he was curious about chemistry and used\nto do some little experiments I'm good telly a story in his words\nabout an experiment which he performed when he was a youngster now the\nexperiment involves the reaction between copper and nitric acid and so when we get to\nthe appropriate point in the story I'm actually gonna show you their action\nthe reactions gonna happen in this flask in this cylinder at the top\nwe have some nitric acid and the flask we have\ncopper now the copper as you for reasons you'll see in\na moment in the former a coil account is the Morton a penny or tea\nparty piece because they're actually made of steel just a thin coating of copper\nso gonna an old-fashioned penny here this was made in there 1945 this actually made of solid copper\nso we put one of these pennies into the flask and we gonna do this\nreaction in a sealed environment in a sealed flask any fumes that a pretty to be led away\nthrough this cheap and absorbed in this sodium hydroxide for reasons that will\nbecome apparent in a moment okay so this is the\nstory although I Ramson while reading a textbook of Chemistry\nI came across the statement nitric acid acts upon copper I was getting tired reading such\nabsurd stuff and I determined to see what this meant copper\nwas more or less familiar to me for copper sense with that in use I'd\nseen a bottle marked nitric acid on a table in the doctor's office\nwell I was then doing time I did not know its\npeculiarities was getting on likely to learn the spirit\nof adventure was upon me having nitric acid and\ncopper I had only to learn what the word act upon meant then the statement nitric\nacid acts upon copper would be something\nmore the mere words all was still\ninterested knowledge I was even willing to sacrifice one\nof the few copper sense that in my possession I put one of them on the table\nopened the bottle marked nitric acid poured some of the liquid\non the copper a prepared to make an observation so let's at the nitric acid to the copper and see what happens I think you can say that quite a\nvigorous reaction is taking place to the green liquid\nbubbling away fumes are coming off I let's\ncontinue with the story but what was this wonderful\nthing which I beheld the saint was already changed\nthere was no small change either a greenish blue liquid phoned\nin fumed over the scent and over the table the area in the\nneighborhood of the performance became colored dark red a great cloud arose\nthis was disagreeable and suffocating how\nshould I stop this I tried to get rid of the\nobjectionable mess by picking it up and throwing it out of the window\nwhich I had meanwhile opened I learned another\nfact nitric acid not only acts upon\ncopper but attacks upon fingers the pain led to another\nunpremeditated experiment I drew my fingers across my trousers\nanother fact was discovered nitric acid acts upon tries as taking everything\ninto consideration that was probably the most\nimpressive experiment and relatively probably the\nmost costly experiment I never performed I tell\nit even now with interest it was a revelation to me it\nresulted in a desire on my part to learn more about that\nremarkable kind a faction plainly the only way\nto learn about it was to see its results\nto experiment to work in the laboratory so that the\nreaction of nitric acid with copper which produce these dark\nbrown fumes that you can see and those fumes are\ncalled nitrogen dioxide and they are actually pretty unpleasant\nwhich is why we're doing this in a SEO apparatus but nice and I oxide is a material that\ncan help us understand this question about whether a chemical\nreaction can go backwards so in these cubes we have equal amounts all nitrogen dioxide\nwhat I'm gonna do is to take one of the tubes\nand to place it in iced water that it will cool down and the\nother cheap a little place in hot water to heat it up\nso come back in a moment and see if they're changed in any\nway let's have a little look at the chemistry that's\ngoing on inside those tubes and nitrogen dioxide\nhas a molecule which consists of one at\nEarth nitrogen and two atoms oxygen if we have two molecules nitrogen dioxide they can react\ntogether to form one molecule all another oxides of nitrogen\ncalled dummy nitrogen tetroxide that process\nreleases energy when that extra nitrogen 19 bond\nis formed it gives out energy so that's like the ball rolling\ndownhill the ball rolling downhill want the notion dioxide come together\nperformed I nitrogen tetroxide but the domination tetroxide can split up the molecule can split in half if two molecules\nof nitrogen dioxide because for every molecule diana ichton tetroxide we\nget two molecules Nigerian dioxide we have twice as many molecules\nthey can be arranged in many more ways and that means the entropy\nhas increased so the entropy tends to drive this\nreaction from the right to the left so these two effects the\nball rolling downhill effect and the teenager bedroom effect a\ndriving this reaction is to love opposite directions what happens is that the reaction\nactually goes in both directions at the same time it\nreaches a sort of balance we call it an equilibrium where there\nis some much in by upside present and some dynamited and\ntetroxide present and the relative proportions that these\ndepends upon the temperature so if we increase the temperature we put energy\ninto the system that's like pushing the ball up hill we go from right to left\nif we cool system banned then conversely we go from left\nto right so that's the prediction and we can test the prediction because nineties and dioxide is this\ndark brown gas that you see in the flask here but die nice in tetroxide is colorless so we\ngo back to a cubes this is the cheap that\nwas in the cold water and you can see that\nit's become a pale kala this is the cheap that was in the hot\nwater I just put the side by side you can see that heating up this\ngas has made it dark brown and contains more nitrogen\ndioxide rest cooling it done has made it at less\ndark it contains more die nitrogen tetroxide and\njust two check of theory what we can do is we can take\nthe hockey if the doc to you and place it into the cold\nwar stop and then the the coach you which is the pale\nkala we can place that in hot water will come back and have a look at those\nin a moment we'll see if they swapped places the case that really brings us\ntowards the end of the lecture want to do is just\nto show you one more curiosity and it concerns a\nrather interesting and unusual element and this elements was\ndiscovered in a mine in a outside a little time court Turkey\nwhich is near Stockholm in Sweden and they have been extracting minerals\nfrom the mine and they found a mineral it seemed rather peculiar\nthey couldn't understand what it contained insulate realize\nthat it contained a new element this is so the beginning of the\neighteenth century and those that is if you discovered a new element\nyou got to choose its name and they decided to name the element\nafter the town to the turkey this element is called yttrium\nwhat rather interesting is that this mineral contain\nnot just one new element but they found out to\ncontain four developments and so they decided to name all four\nelements after the time to the turbine so these four elements\naccord yttrium ytterbium erbium and terbium which is a a little bit confusing I think\nwe can look at the thirsty these yttrium now yttrium can be used to make a compound and I\nhave some at the compound here it's called yttrium\nbarium copper oxide that just a hard black\nlove ceramic material when you to do is\nto put into some liquid nitrogen and so that the tree in barium copper\noxide is now being cool down to minus a hundred ninety-six degrees but takes a moment or two to\ncool down so while we're waiting I also have in this cup another\npiece of identical material exactly the same as the first\nand I'm gonna cover this in liquid nitrogen so that too can be cooling down now at room temperature this\nmaterial isn't very remarkable but when he gets officially cold has a\nvery interesting a very strange property becomes what we call\na superconductor now superconductor is a material that\nis lost all its electrical resistance and material which has 0\nelectrical resistance has the property that it\ncan repel a magnetic field so this rig the ring made of\nsteel and it's covered in little magnets very strong magnets I alternates\nNorth Pole South Pole North Pole and so on and in a minute when this is\ncool down on we get to see if thats yttrium\nbarium copper oxide can repel the magnetic field\nproduced by these magnets this just takes a a moment\nor two to cool down so we're looking here I can see\ntheir boiling away very vigorously that means the the ceramic materials\ngiving up its heats to the liquid nitrogen is boiling\nliquid nitrogen away and and cooling down in the process\nessentially I'm just waiting for the boiling to stop when it stops boiling that\nmeans the ceramic material has reached the same temperatures the\nliquid nitrogen so limit minus a hundred ninety-six degrees okay so let's touch the Sun\nthen let's see if this can repel magnetic field okay so this is actually\nquite a special kind of superconductors what we call the type to\nsee picking up to and that means that as well as repelling magnetic field you can\nalso track magnetic field remember I've got another wanna be sitting\ninside this policy link-up and underneath is a still at that\nand on the top of the cylinder is a very strong magnet now the field from that night that\nwas already passing through the ceramic material before\nI added the liquid nitrogen site now cool it down should\nhave become a superconductor and hopefully it will have traps that\nmagnetic field so should still be gripping onto that field that means I should be able to take\naway the support from this cylinder by the way on the outside the cylinder\nwe've put the logo for the International Year of Chemistry 2011 has been a year-long\ncelebration around the world off with the likes of Chemistry and\nthe importance of Chemistry for our everyday lives I thought it would\nbe a nice way to just mark the occasion I think this is cool\ndown as sunday tea see if I can lower\nthis very carefully the okay well thank you very much that that\npretty much brings us to the end of the lecture just before we wrap up I'm I thought\nwe would we finish with the with a rather nice demo but\njust before we do as 12 ask you to join me in thanking somebody\nplease put a lot of effort into helping me prepare and\ndeliver this lecture and thats crisp black stallion okay just before we finish I thought we\ntake a look at this block of dry ice if you remember we burn some magnesium\ninside this block is dry ice so the chemistry here was that the\nmagnesium reacted with carbon dioxide to produce magnesium oxide and carbon\nand if you look at the surface if this we can see that it's coated in\na white powder and that's the the magnesium oxide\nif we dig down inside the black had a is the\ncarbon and then finally we swaps those two teams\nthat we put the dark to you inside the iced water we put the\nlight-colored cheap in the hot water we can say they have indeed\nswapped places so the cheap was dark has been cool\ndown has become lights and the like quality has been heated up\nit's become dark so we have the role other curious conclusion the chemical\nreactions can go forwards and backwards at the same time alright\nwell that really is the end of the lecture but I thought would have just one\nmore demonstration to finish and I thought what\nwe do is two repeats one of the earlier demonstrations\nit's the demonstration all the reaction between nitric\noxide and carbon by sulfide I thought we did on a slightly\nbigger scale so chris is bringing on a cube of nitric oxide some good add the carbon dice 05 began\nchris is going to mix these together once they thoroughly mixed will set fire to the\nend of the queue all rights and will put the light stand for\nthis might say thank you will for coming we go old its", "ELZ1ccmp9Rc": "[Music] we are going to be playing a really mod version of crisis it's some got blackfyres to mod version 2.0 Wow do HD 4.0 and quality mod 1.9 to see well I also have a compound bow from Crysis 3 we also had the drivable cars I don't I don't know how many I can drive but I don't think I can drive the ambulance I didn't see that in the pictures listed for the MOT on the mod page is anything else yeah I think we have reshape but alright so we are gonna start on intro we are gonna just stick the soldier because it's gonna get my ass [ __ ] kicked I'm gonna get my ass kicked if I do yeah I'm be honest this looks pretty fun and lean Trane's did say $200 gas prices that is a lot of money for gas I'm gonna move this microphone up

really funny title now is it so this looks that that's a really big ass [ __ ] gun that that don't know how to explain it like this I want that gun I don't know I am your [ __ ] support hello my name is aqua chimes what's your name yeah that's what happens oh that dude oh yeah on what me what saving the world laughs I don't do it but to get paid though I'm watching that are do you know how long that damn scene is I really know how long that's pretty long cloak mode to the game crash wait no it didn't did it [ __ ] naval pretty graphics mode well I'm definitely not to this point is because it's you know I took those Scott goddamn while to find the mods to get this to work you know so most the links are all dead and finally get to see the graphics and its glory and melt my PC to dust oh no molten pc dust whatever it's called and there is a dead dude on the ground wearing some weird suits and pistol so that could only mean one thing desi roaches I see our yeah what what do I have to do the water for what warworld's that I'm not gonna lie but you kind of wish to call me prophet remember me well those are your scars it's the sort of infection so you know whoa nice you know this honestly is oddly enough reminding me about that scene from that spider-man movie where the I gotta keep forgetting I don't know some sort of core thing I don't know I kind of do remember playing some of this game back in the back of that my younger bears but not as 40 as this don't I don't think I've ever played this game so if I remember I can kill people with trash bags and I can't see [ __ ] I can't carry the laptop very serious kill your trash broke but I can't carry a laptop please don't tell me that person to the damn okay probably is oh yeah what well hey yeah I can't hear you yeah you're breaking up man Oh yep oh [ __ ] let's go up there again I can't I can't cure my trash bag with me I want to use my deadly trash bag to kill anything I want you know I made it that time but I don't know why and I broke the door how fancy is it i I just it says push but then I just grabbed on it and broke the door and then come on I'm not a sensible human being oh wait nothing Oh override my ass just don't look good private military factory [Music] so Oh oh yeah I can do top-down view I could drive a semi chocolate that's a bit glitchy but you know I don't need no I am up for this I don't need to kill no one I'm not that cruel I may need to run I may need to run now I may need to run and run [ __ ] [ __ ] it we're killing these where are they at where are these mother [ __ ] killing innocent soldiers doing their and this is oddly enough reminds me this looks like [ __ ] the Pearl Harbor but this looks like d-day but they really only knit hold on well what the hell was this aim assistance you know I'm gonna be a good ass and turn aim assist ins on on me off so that's what I had on to make my am that's what my aim looks so damn weird and aim-assist thawne nice I thought you could just put that as an optional but no they had to had to put it on default it reminds me of San Andreas I used or any other game and that dude I'm gonna kill right over there oh and if I can just this is what I think it is he were fine there you go you're are you or did I know where they go I don't know how long I can hold out it's inspiration [Applause] I think I better go I don't think I'm invited at this party at all I don't think I am invited at all [Applause] okay I'm glad at all [Applause] it wasn't the dude in here the last time I played I don't know what the [ __ ] I'm talking about anywhere honestly Oh God what happens when you play games when you're tired you just don't know what you're doing but and again that makes it I can get shot no I don't like getting shot at no one likes getting shot this didn't like getting shot got shot by a crossbow come on man brought guns I brought a crossbow more do you want I feel really sorry for people had to go through this area oh god I have to go gotta go gotta go gotta go [ __ ] [ __ ] and I just got what the [ __ ] what in the no my crossbow is not back here my hands just look like this the hell's wrong with me my

I'm Lisa Friedersdorf. Director of the National Nanotechnology Coordination\nOffice. Today it's my pleasure to welcome Sanchita\nBhatnagar, Assistant Professor at the University of Virginia. Sanchita, thank you so much for joining us\ntoday. To get us started, can you just tell us a\nlittle bit about yourself and how you got involved in nanotechnology? [SANCHITA] Thank you very much Lisa for inviting\nme. It's really a pleasure and a great opportunity\nto talk about my research program. The reason we started working on nanotechnology,\nto be honest is serendipity. My lab is interested in investigating the\nepigenetic mechanism in cancer. But we realized that identifying the targets\nis not really directly helping the patients. So we took a step up on ourselves and we wanted\nto provide a mechanism by which we can translate our findings to clinics. That's where we started working with nanoparticles. I have to accept this that one of the main\nreasons we started working on nanoparticles is because of my postdoc Dr. Song Lou who\njoined my lab a few years back. However, we also were very fortunate to collaborate\nwith another scientist in the department, Dr. Jogender Tushir-Singh, who is an antibody\nengineer. And combining their expertise, we developed\nwhat we call molecularly targeted nanoparticles. And I would love to elaborate on them later. However, what this allows us to package our\ninhibitor of the target, which is TRIM37, a breast cancer oncogene, into these lipid\nnanoparticles. Now these lipid nanoparticles are different\nfrom what we know from various format, is that they have an antibody on the surface. This antibody recognizes a protein that is\nexpressed abundantly on cancer cells in comparison to the healthy cells, allowing us to be able\nto specifically deliver our package to cancer cells. And that's exactly what we saw in our animal\nmodels that these nanoparticles deliver the target, the inhibitor, directly to the metastatic\ncancer, which in this case is lung cancer derived from triple negative breast cancer\ncell lines, and minimizes the growth of the tumor in the end. [LISA] So you mentioned already, I think,\nthe concept of collaboration. And that is an area that we hear a lot about\nwith respect to nanotechnology and intersecting different disciplines. Can you share your experience about the role\nthat collaboration has played in your research in bringing together different disciplines\nin nanotechnology? [SANCHITA] That's exactly what happened in\nthis case, when we started working with nanoparticle. I had an expert who could generate nanoparticles\nin my field, but we always wanted to improve. But I'm not an expert immunotherapist and\nit was very convenient to walk to this great scientist, who is also my husband, to be able\nto design this antibody and help us build this platform which has shown a great improvement\nin the delivery system. [LISA] Can you elaborate a little bit on the\nrole of nanotechnology? [SANCHITA] Triple negative breast cancer is\nwhat this whole work has been done for. Now triple negative breast cancer is a very\naggressive breast cancer sub-type that almost accounts for 20% of the breast cancer cases. The incidence rate in the United States alone\nis around 40,000 patients per year. The TNBC patients are very likely to show\nresistance to chemotherapy, relapse, and reuprise, which is what we call metastatic growth. And that's the reason the 5 year survivor\nrate for triple negative breast cancer is only 77% relative to what we see for the other\nbreast cancer subtypes it's around 93%. Despite the high mortality rate, the standard\nof care for triple negative breast cancer is chemotherapy. No chemotherapy works great initially, but\neventually patients develop resistance to chemotherapy and then we see metastatic tumors,\nwhich is the growth of tumor other than where you have the primary tumor. So the tumors and not limited just to breasts. You find these patients develop tumors in\nbrain, liver, lung, and bone. And that's what we define as the metastatic\ngrowth. Now triple negative breast cancer patients\nhave an aggressive growth of metastatic tumors and that's what my lab is interested in. What we believe an unresolved question in\nthe field is, what really drives the primary tumor to become metastatic? And this is clinically relevant because metastatic,\nbut not the primary tumor are often fatal. So an important issue in the field is, we\nknow several oncogenes, several tumor suppressor genes that drive cancer. But the question that we don't have an answer\nfor is whether the driver of cancer also drives metastases. And that's what my lab did is, my previous\nwork has identified TRIM37 as a driver of breast cancer, a breast cancer oncogene. So when I established my own research program,\nthe first question that I really wanted to address is, is this driver of breast cancer\nalso driving metastases? And that's what drove this research project. We have clearly found out the mechanism by\nwhich TRIM37 drives the metastases and resistance to chemotherapy. Again coming back to our appetite to find\nout how we can translate these findings to clinic, we really want to show and develop\na method by which we can inhibit this protein in the animal and show that it is capable\nof reducing metastases. We have the inhibitor for TRIM37, which we\ncall antisense oligonucleotide. But as you would realize in the field that\ndrug optimization, you cannot just deliver the naked drug. You always worry about the efficacy, the tearing\nfrom the parasympathetic system and the liver. So the question was delivery mechanism. And that's where we utilized this excellent\nnanoparticle platform to package our drug, our inhibitor, to the core of this lipid,\nwhich now protects this increasing the half-life of the inhibitor, the antisense oligonucleotide,\nand increasing the payload. But again, we realize the problem. Based on the literature and vast amount of\ndata that is available out there, that one of the problems that we face with nanoparticles\nis the deliver. And it's the secretion out of the body because\nit's taken up by the phytositic system and is kicked out through the liver. So to improve on that, we utilize the antibody\nthat targets the surface of a cancer cell protein, folate receptor 1. It's a clinical investigative antibody. Now, I would like to mention here that this\nis a little bit of a modification here because the antibody has been engineered to include\na linker. So now, this linker enables us to covalently\nlink the antibody to the nanoparticle using melamine chemistry. And this is different from various other fomites\nout there because usually they are chemically conjugated. Here we are not doing any chemical treatment,\nbut we are using a linker and melamine chemistry to link an antibody and a nanoparticle. Luckily when we use this in our animal models,\nwe could see a significant different in the metastatic tumors. Specifically in the lung of the animal. [LISA] Can you share the way that you engage\nwith students and the make up of your team? [SANCHITA] I think what we have achieved is\na team where I have been very fortunate to have excellent people who are self-driven\nand really really smart. One of the major players in this project is\nDr. Song Lou, who came to my lab a few years ago with an expertise in nanoparticle synthesis. I think my mentoring style has a lot to do\nfrom my own mentors. I have been very fortunate to have some excellent\nmentors in my life. So I'm an immigrant, I came from India. I'm not a native English speaker, you can\nimagine. So when I came here, at the University of\nNotre Dame, I would like to give a shout out to my graduate advisor Dr. Jeffrey Schorey,\nwho not only guided me to pursue my research project at that time, but he also mentored\nme to follow my gut and be inquisitive and open. And I think he played a large part in my teaching\nphilosophy. I learned through him that at some point you\nhave to trust your student. You have to give them an opportunity to make\na mistake and then learn from and improve from it. And I think that's exactly what I follow. I want to give my students and independence\nto be able to pursue a question. But at the same time, I'm always there for\nthem. I don't want them to make a mistake and be\nhard on themselves. I have an open door policy so they're always\nwelcome to come in and discuss with me. I like to help them. I'm a mom, so those things always kick in\nand you're like, you know I can solve your problem. But sometimes I like to hold back, just take\na back seat and see them. [LISA] So I just want to say thank you for\ntaking the time to talk with us today and ask you, do you have any closing thoughts\nfor students who might be pursuing nanotechnology or for our listeners more broadly? [SANCHITA] So for the students, I think I\nwould say, follow your heart. Innovation is the key here. We have tons of literature to say that what\nare the problems with nanoparticles. Keep that in mind and see how you can improve\non it to take this field forward. And for the listeners, I think I would just\nlike to reiterate that this work is preliminary. We have done this in animals and it looks\npromising. We don't have the cure for triple negative\nbreast cancer yet, but I think we have a way to move forward. And we have my lab and others in the field\nare continuously working on it. [LISA] Thank you for joining us today for\nStories from the NNI.

churning beef tallow with skim milk the beef tallow which is a hard form of animal fat was a byproduct of meat production so it was both cheap and abundant when the hard fat was thoroughly mixed with the milk it resulted in a semi-solid spreadable material by the mid-1870s beef tallow based margarine was being sold across Europe and it even made it to the US however in 1902 the formula and the process changed when it was discovered that vegetable oils could be hydrogenated to form hard fats by 1910 most manufacturers were using a combination of hardened vegetable oils regular vegetable oils and animal fats and by the 1950s most US manufacturers had completely phased out the use of animal fats over the decades margarine has gone through quite a lot of development many brands no longer use hydrogenated oils or trans fats and a lot of them went completely dairy-free many brands also offer a whole array of variations that are supposedly healthier depending on the product the level of fat is also highly variable and it can apparently range from as low as 10% to as high as 90 in any case though the main idea across all margarine products is the same it's a combination of fat and water that has been thoroughly mixed together and allowed to solidify it solidifies due to the presence of hard fats which can be derived from natural sources like beef tallow or it can be made artificially by hydrogenation this hydrogenation process is what I'm going to be exploring in this video in particular I'll be hydrogenating vegetable oil which like other fats is made up of triglycerides in terms of structure this is what a typical triglyceride looks like we have a glycerol backbone and three fatty acid tails there are a lot of different fatty acids but in general there are two main types saturated and unsaturated in organic chemistry a saturated molecule is one that has only single bonds between the carbons and an unsaturated one has double or triple bonds in the world of fatty acids though it's pretty rare to get triple bonds what's important to notice is that the saturated fatty acid is very straight but the unsaturated one actually has a bend in it triglycerides that incorporate these bent ones don't pack as well together and they tend to be liquid at room temperature however we can actually change this by hydrogenation we can remove the double bonds and straighten out the molecules this allows the triglycerides to pack together more efficiently which both hardens the oil and increases the melting point with the oil now solid at room temperature it can be mixed with water and made into the spreadable margarine so for this little project I needed several different things from left to right I have aluminum foil palladium on carbon olive oil sodium hydroxide calcium chloride and methanol as we continue with the video you'll see exactly how each of these ingredients are used on a side note even though this is edible chem I'm not going to be tasting my product at the end because I filmed this before I came up with the idea for the series so yeah I still thought it was appropriate to label it as edible chem though because we are making a food product anyway I don't own a hydrogen tank so the first thing that I need to do is generate the hydrogen gas myself there are several different ways to do this but the method that I'll be showing is in my opinion the cheapest and uses the most easy to get supplies it's a pretty simple reaction between aluminum foil and a solution of sodium hydroxide but because I have to collect the gas and store it somehow it gets a little bit more complicated the setup that I'm using is just something I came up with using the glassware that I have but I'm sure there are many other ways to do this anyway this was the final setup at first it might look a little bit complicated but it's actually quite simple in the middle I have an addition funnel that I'll fill with a strong solution of sodium hydroxide when the salut allowed to drip in it will land on the aluminum and it will react to produce the hydrogen gas the gas will leave out the left arm and it will travel through the hosing to the trap all of the white stuff in there is calcium chloride which will pull out the water and dry the hydrogen as it passes through after the trap it will travel through another short section of hosing and it will make it to a balloon the balloon will fill up with hydrogen and this is what I'm going to use to temporarily store it okay so now that we understand what's going on I can actually start the reaction I made a really strong solution of sodium hydroxide and I filled up the addition funnel the concentration of the solution here really doesn't matter but it's probably around 50 percent or something I don't actually remember what I did I seal it with a stopper but I don't include a clip just in case there's a problem or something and the pressure builds up all of the other ones were clipped but I don't actually think it's that important the pressure inside a balloon really isn't that big and I don't think it's actually enough to pop the stoppers off one thing I did forget to mention though is that every single joint is sealed with a little bit of grease to make sure that hydrogen doesn't leak out anyway I'm ready to get things going now so I opened the funnel and I start to add it this reaction is extremely exothermic so the water quickly heats up and boils off if I keep adding it like this it's probably going to get out of control so I have to change a couple things I add a little bit of water enough to fill about half the flask and I also put it in an ice bath both of these things should slow down the reaction and make it not nearly as violent I let it cool down for a bit and this time when it's added it's much nicer it's important not to collect everything from the beginning because the stuff that initially comes out is just the air that was in the apparatus so I waited about thirty seconds or so before I attach the balloon when I feel like it's relatively full I take it off and I seal it by wrapping it around either a stopper or the plunger of a syringe then I attached another balloon and I started generating more hydrogen for now I only think I need two balloons so I close the addition funnel and I actually separate the hosing from the trap when I do this it's also important to close the valve that the balloons attached to otherwise I'll just lose all my hydrogen the reason to take this hosing off is it's going to be part of my actual hydrogenation setup okay so to get the reaction going I start by adding my oil that I want to hydrogenate which in my case is just olive oil in general oil is kind of messy so to clean things up and to complete the transfer I wash it with some methanol then I dump in my palladium on carbon catalyst and everything's topped off with more methanol I take away the funnel drop in a stir bar and then I attach this double adapter thing to the upper adapter I attach the hydrogen balloon and to the lower one I attach my vacuum pump I turn on the stirring in my vacuum pump and I pull as good of a vacuum as I can under the reduced pressure the methanol might start to boil a little but that's not a big problem once pretty much all the air has been taken out I closed the valve to my vacuum pump and I open the one to my hydrogen then I close it again and I repeat this evacuation cycle two more times the purpose of doing this multiple times is to just really make sure that the only gas in there is hydrogen hydrogen is the lightest gas so if there's any other gases present it's probably just going to sit on top and never make it to the reaction also for safety reasons we can't have any oxygen present because it's a pretty significant fire hazard anyway after the third cycle I'm ready to get the reaction going so I just open the valve to the balloon and this time I leave it open from this point on the reaction is pretty simple and we just have to wait for the hydrogen to be absorbed so what i'm doing here is hydrogenating the olive oil which is made almost entirely of tri Olien when the tri Olien is completely hydrogenated we'll get something called tri stearin which has no carbon-carbon double bonds hydrogen gas is diatomic which means that it doesn't exist as just hydrogen alone and it's paired with another one so it's h2 the bond between the two hydrogen's is relatively strong and it doesn't just like to spontaneously break apart if we were to mix hydrogen with just the oil not much would happen we really need the Palladium on carbon the Palladium on carbon is just very finely dispersed palladium that's supported on carbon powder which gives it a large surface area and makes it more reactive when the Palladium comes in contact with the hydrogen it can catalytically split it apart at the same time it also associated with the double bond and it mediates this addition of these individual hydrogen's to either side for most chemical reactions we do want to go to completion but oddly enough when it comes to making margarine we usually want to stop early this produces partially hydrogenated vegetable oils which you might have heard of before the idea here is that by only taking away some of the double bonds we can harden the vegetable oil but we don't make it too hard if we completely hydrogenated like what try stearin we're left with a very hard fat that is not going to spread very well unfortunately I don't know this process well enough to know when to stop and I was really afraid that I would stop too early so I decided I would just go all the way to completion and I accepted that my margarine would just be terrible there is a health benefit though of completely saturating everything because it means that I won't be making any trans fats when it comes to unsaturated fats there are two major configurations that we can have either sis or trans these terms refer to how the groups are oriented around the double bond insists the two non-hydrogen ones are on the same side and in trans they're on opposite sides in almost all natural fats so including things like vegetable oil it's almost exclusively sis double bonds however in the presence of a palladium catalyst it can undergo something called an isomerization and actually flip to become the trans over the years the trans fats have been associated with a lot of negative health outcomes so it's generally suggested to try to avoid them anyway it took about 40 minutes for all of the hydrogen in the first balloon to be absorbed during this time I started to see a bunch of solid forming in the flask and at some point a whole bunch of it got stuck on the side to get it all off I just blasted it with a heat gun and it very quickly melted away when the balloon was more or less empty I closed the valve and replace it with a fresh one I left for about an hour and when I came back the balloon had shrunk quite a bit and there was a whole bunch of white precipitate the white stuff is mostly try stearin along with other fully saturated triglycerides about an hour later this balloon is done as well I attach a fresh one and this one took about two and a half hours to disappear even though the balloon is shrinking I think the reaction is actually done and there's just a leak in the system because I plan for this reaction to go to completion this really isn't a big issue however if I wanted to partially hydrogenated and stop at a specific point I would need to measure exactly how much hydrogen I put in anyway now we need to separate off all of the saturated fat that I made the only problem though is that it's completely mixed in with all the Palladium on carbon so to fix this problem I just need to read azov' all the saturated fat by heating things up you can't see it in this shot but off screen I'm blasting it with my heat gun which is basically just a super-strong hairdryer as the solution heats up the fat will slowly melt and some of it will dissolve I eventually get to around the boiling point of methanol but there's still a bunch of stuff at the bottom this is fine though and purification will just take an extra step so while it's still hot I quickly filter it through some cotton and see light the stuff that filters through looks cloudy but it's just because the methanol is cooling down and some of the fat is precipitating the filtration was taking longer than I thought so I transferred everything from the round bottom flask to a beaker before the black stuff could solidify when everything passes through I do a quick washing with some hot methanol just to try to clean things up the methanol started to cool and some fat came out and started to plug the filter so I had to blast it with a heat gun ok so eventually everything is filtered and it's time to deal with that other black stuff by now it has completely solidified so the first thing I need to do is break it up into relatively small pieces then to separate the fat from the Palladium on carbon I add some dichloromethane I'm using dichloromethane here instead of methanol because the fat is much more soluble in it this way I can use a lot less solvent and I also won't have to heat things up I continued to stir things until the stir bar was relatively free then I place it on the stir plate for several minutes and all the fat dissolves to separate off the Palladium on carbon I do the same thing as before and I just filter it through some see light and cotton after everything passes through I wash it a few times with a little bit of dichloromethane as the Palladium on carbon dries it probably won't be a problem but it can sometimes burst into flames so keep this in mind dichloromethane evaporates really quickly so by the time the filtration is over you can already see some of the fat precipitating at the top to get rid of the rest I place a fan off screen and over the course of about an hour it completely dries up one important safety note though is that when evaporating solvents you have to be careful and do it in a well-ventilated area because it is a fire hazard on top of this dichloromethane isn't great to breathe in either so it's also a health hazard anyway it's eventually pretty much all gone and I'm left with this pasty fat now going back to my other batch which has the methanol I place it in the freezer for about a day to precipitate as much as possible then to isolate it I just filter it through a coffee filter I place it on some paper towel and over the course of a day or so it completely dries up I combine everything that I have and I turn the hot plate on to a medium heat everything that I have here should melt in a range of about 50 to 70 see the major component that I have here is try stearin but there are a lot of other triglycerides present so the melting point is going to have a pretty wide range I crank the heat up a little bit higher maybe to around 90 or 100 C just to really make sure that I get rid of all the methanol and dichloromethane it eventually pretty much stops bubbling so I take it off the hot plate and I let it cool over the course of about 10 minutes or so it completely solidified again I somehow lost the footage but to get it out I had to crack it into a few pieces my final yield of the saturated fat was 13 grams I'm not sure exactly which fat's I started with but if I assume i started with tri Olien and went completely to try stearin this represents about an 86 percent yield the two are so grams that I'm missing are probably still either just in the methanol or we're lost in washing and transfer steps anyway he'll decide it's time to make my terrible margarine right off the bat though there are going to be two major problems with my preparation first of all the fat I'm using is fully hydrogenated and not partially so it's really hard fully hydrogenated fats are normally used for shortening and I'm kind of forcing things to make it into a margarine and secondly I don't have a proper set up to mix things so even if I had all the right ingredients it probably wouldn't turn out great anyway on top of this I wasn't able to find any actual margarine recipe so I kind of had to make it up myself so what I ended up doing was using a combination of the fat I made regular olive oil lecithin and water if you want to know more details on how real margarine is made I've provided a link to another video in the description ok so the first thing to do is melt some of the saturated fat I break up an arbitrary amount and then I just blast it with the heat gun it can also be melted by either a hot water bath or a microwave but I actually found that this was faster when it's nice and liquid I added some olive oil I add the olive oil because I'm trying to balance the saturated fat with unsaturated fat and I'm hoping that this would kind of mimic a partially hydrogenated oil this mixture should have a lower melting point and when it solidifies it should be a little bit softer the next thing to add is some distilled water margarine is an emulsion between water and oil and the usual content is around 20% water because my mixing here is terrible you can see all the water droplets just sitting at the bottom the next thing that I add is lecithin which acts as an emulsion stabilizer so once I mix everything up and have a decent emulsion it should help to keep it like that so now with an arbitrary amount of all the ingredients added I stir things as quickly as I can at the same time I let it cool and I pretty much just keep mixing things until it's more or less solid it eventually gets quite thick so I just wait for it to fully cool down once it's at room temperature I try to take a little bit off using a knife but it's clearly still way too hard obviously I need to re tweak my recipe a little bit so I just go ahead and remelt it to try to soften it up I add a bunch more oil lecithin and water I do a quick rough mix then I blasted with the heat gun to liquify it and then I mix it thoroughly this time it didn't completely harden like before but it looked pretty disgusting at least now though it's something that's spreadable however it really did look and feel like I was just spreading plastic in any case though I did give it a try and it practically had no flavor at all and was definitely not something I'd want to eat anyway that's about it for this video I hope you guys enjoyed it and I'll see you on the next one a big thanks goes

Festival, And Welcome to this lecture on Rocket Science Now, every Rocket that has ever flown, whether its a small firework rocket, or whether its a giant rocket carrying people to the moon every rocket is based on one simple principle. So i thought i'd begin this lecture by demonstrating that principle So this a beautiful reproduction, in miniature of a Napoleonic Canon. But its a working model And its actually capable of firing a live round: A Half inch diameter Lead Cannon Ball Today we wont fire a live round, but im going to fire a blank round and when we do, i want you to observe what happens to the cannon Now the cannon's really just a tube thats closed on this end (left side) and open at this end (right side) This is called a muzzle and theres a small hole we call a \"touch hole\" that we use to transmit fire to the main charge So im going to begin by taking a small slow burning fuse And placing that in the \"touch hole\" Then were going to charge this with gunpowder So the gunpowder is in this nice powder horn the way this works is: I put my finger over the brass nozzle, I press the valve and tip it upside down And powder trickles into that brass spout So I'm measuring a precise quantity of gunpowder And I release the valve and turn it upside... right way up again and we have a measured quantity of gunpowder in the spout So I'll place that into the barrel of the cannon and I thought is since its \"Science Week\" we'll use a double dose *audience laughs* Here's a double dose of gunpowder going into the cannon So that's the gunpowder, In the barrel; I'll put this safely out of the way Now to keep the gunpowder in the barrel and against the fuse were going to use a bit of wadding so this is some fireproof wadding which I'm going to put into the, into the muzzle of the cannon and then use this \"Ram Rod\" to pack the wadding and the gunpowder tight up against the fuse. Now at this point we would put our cannon ball in but were not going to do that today so instead, we'll, we'll simulate that by adding a bit more wadding so I'm going to put some more wadding into the barrel and again just pack that down and then finally, to, uh, to stop the ball rolling out, as it were, we'd use a bit more wadding. So, why not, lets do a bit more wadding. *audience laughs* It is the science festival after all. Okay, so we've got this wadding nicely pack down. Our cannon, uh will be loaded, and it's now ready to fire. So I'm going to light the fuse from where I'm standing, it's quite noisy, so I'm going to be covering my ears; if you're near the front, you may wish to do the same.", "gJ9-JIY8-bI": "well hey

saving all sorts of money compared to something bigger that being said if you do like something bigger with a bedroom slide take a look at the 32 ret wildwood that we have a video on for you here from halodrv the only real difference is just that it has a bedroom slide and a big front wall closet either way we got you covered and i'd love to have you see both sets of footage and let me know which one works for you guys [Music] and this one just has such a huge feeling about it because it has those dual opposing living room super slides and like i said it's like this thing was designed by you know wacky wally's window emporium it's just panoramic views beyond belief in this thing and these are all on the camp side of the rv this is actually one of my favorite kind of living rooms in like big luxury fifth wheels and you're getting it right here in this travel trailer now you might be noticing some interesting kind of seating configurations here like almost it looks like a little half dinette in an l lounge if you're familiar with wildwoods you know that this is called the versa lounge if you're not familiar with wildwoods hang tight till the end of the video i've actually got like a six minute total top to bottom inside now primer on everything this can do for you but basically uh it's what i call a swiss army super sofa because it only does everything if you need more seating lounge space you got it you need more uh dining space you need sleeping space it's an amazing guest sleeper but most of the time i got a feeling it's only gonna be one or two of you in here now the the big windows the light colors the taller ceiling and the accent led lights above the slides i love how they're not blue by the way they're not disco blue they are just a normal bright white light and actually people are so unaccustomed to this that i've actually had customers say there's there's a gap in the seal above the slide out and i mean you can see it right there it's leds [Laughter] now on a multi-slide wildwood like this we'll almost always upgrade this to a larger 15 000 btu air conditioner just because there's you know a lot of space that you need to cool here and these are it's almost a blast from the past recliners are slowly quietly making a little bit of a comeback theater seats are still very dominant but free-floating recliners are they're starting to find their way back into some things um if you wanted to what was cool on this one you could flip those recliners around and just have an epic view like let's say you've got uh something other than just the halodrv lot behind your rv and you wanted to see the lake or the mountains or whatever it is over here awesome place to be able to do that and i hope you like the colors because it's all she comes in it's like a it's like the old ford model a or whatever it was model t which one it was any color you wanted as long as it was black oh i almost had a cool reference there and then i shot myself in the foot big space here if you want yourself a serious entertainment center directly across from this big lounge you got it you could mount a swing arm you could sit the recliners got your little electric space eating tootsie toaster down there by the way a little space to keep your little house slippers under the uh the fireplace little house slippers you know i used to make fun of my parents and i'd say oh you guys are getting old you got your slippers i walked home i didn't walk home i walked in the house yesterday i went honey where are my slippers and i went oh so i i did the only reasonable thing after that i uh you know grabbed the clicker and turned down the tv so sealed edge counters through the entire rv which is nice and some pretty cool kitchen storage space check this out a lot of times in travel trailers when you have a really good living room you often have a really crappy kitchen because they're just not as much space as a fifth wheel but with the double opposing slides they have plenty of room and this is one of those 10.7 cubic foot dc compressor fridges i really got a good chance to get you inside this one and people look at it go yeah but this camper used to have a non-compressor fridge and it was much smaller how is this suddenly bigger the thing is when you don't have a propane cooling unit it's deeper it's not that it's taller or wider it is much much deeper i almost did like a little rv bless you sun right there didn't i the uh uh counter space in this is fantastic and another thing that i really like about this one is how it has a good dedicated pantry space because once again living room focused trailers often have really crappy kind of uh what do you want to say you know kitchen storage spaces and the triple drawers right here but you might notice they're a little bit of a drawer inside of a door what is going on there because this is no mere lazy susan this is active susie uh active susie is a balding 38 year old chubby man by the way so so why are they doing this drawers inside of doors isn't that like harder to get too harder to x ew oh i'm just looking at myself in the viewfinder i'm getting lit up by the sun i look like i belong in the sick word of a hospital yeah sorry so yeah getting the camera off of my face sorry about that what they're doing here is when you have just separated drawers there has to be something in between here closing them off but that also means that you have less space for big stuff in there so um active susan as opposed to lazy susie or whatever name they're applying this i i think i got my name screwed up doesn't matter allows you to have more bigger stuff in here and yes it does mean that you have drawers inside of a door but there's only so much storage you can have there's only so much space here and instead of wasting like two or three inches per enclosing rail for separated drawers they gave you max storage not to mention the fact that when i stand up and i get back here it just has a nice clean symmetrical look about it now over here we've also got some kitchen storage in the island and then some bonus storage in the sofa and this is nice like good wastebasket space down here is kind of one of the first things i thought about you could get a big one in there plus both sides of the island actually have these open kind of cubbies here but when you see the end of the video if you stay tuned for the full versa lounge demonstration you'll get another look at the 20.3 cubic foot of food safe tote storage that comes in this versa lounge even the living room gets in on the kitchen space and uh that sound by the way i swear i swear was this chair going like that that was not me right next to the entry door we have our bathroom here and this is a 30 by 36 shower with a curtain on a track which is nice so it doesn't suck up against you when you're showering and a radius track on the top for extra elbow room this is remember a taller trailer which means i can stand in here without my head needing to be in this skylight and um the legroom in here i tell you what i was really happy with what i had as a bigger guy i had plenty of room to stretch out and if you're wider than me you're also going to be pretty good in here i think and behind door number one you see you've also got a little bonus kind of storage on the left full medicine cabinet on the right still sealed edge countertops but i like the little color changes we get in here in the bathroom i know that in my house my bathroom doesn't look like the rest of the room you know what i mean the rest of the house and we've got a little bit of a special guest for you today mr jody van loew here at haylot rv jody's one of our uh check in quality control kind of people and what he does he goes through the rv proactively even things like the door hinges he flashes a flashlight down all the surfaces to make sure there's no like scuffs and just like that there you go making sure the roller shades roll up basically we proactively quality control stuff so that we've ensured that it is in good working order when it leaves here so that you stay on your campsite in your driveway instead of needing to come back for service now obviously we have a service team to take care of things and yes they do sometimes need to do some work on things but our goal halodrv is to always give you the best experience possible i've always kind of felt that uh you know anybody can have a good trailer anybody can have a good price on it but it's a service you get that really defines the difference from dealership a to b to c and i hope you appreciate the extra work that we do here at halo you don't get to see this most of the time do you and i want to introduce jody because we've already heard one funny little sound earlier in the video um if you hear some more funny sounds that's just jody going through checking doors making sure things are working now the bedroom up here this is a 60 by 74 camp queen it's a short queen and i know a lot of folks aren't uh hot to trot about that but look at this there's like two and a half three foot of space at the foot of this bed they made sure that if you do go uh if you up fit to a 60 by any true queen you can easily still walk around this bed now at a glance this has a normal travel trailer front bedroom you got the dual hanging closets right there but with wild wood it is always the devil in the details like the little cpap uh kind of cabinet stands that they have here notice those cut that cut away you see that household outlet and there's usb plugs on both sides they do this on both sides of the bed so whether it's going to be a phone uh you know your cpap machine i've heard some people say i would like to store the old freedom slinger in that side stand where it's out of plain sight i get that but the thing is that's only where the storage starts in here not where it ends because if we use those struts to lift that plywood decked easy lift bed system up we see that we have basically like dresser storage down below i love what they do here with these little lightweight totes you can take them out of there you could make that like a little cat bed shelf or something like that you could decorate it in different ways it is simple it is light and it provides a lot of storage that you'd otherwise lose plus a handy little shoe garage down below now you are seeing daylight because this does pass all the way through to the exterior which is really handy in case cargo does shift and this is great i love this this is extra stuff they're doing that most don't but the thing is we're still not done in here because across from the bed here we have this big what i mean i i don't know that i call it a walk-in closet it's large enough you could physically fit into it but it's not so large that you physically have to walk into it i'm gonna call it a hide-and-seek closet though that'd be a good little hide-and-seek kind of place uh anybody ever like hide from their parents in the clothing racks at the stores growing up oh my gosh my daughter did that to me once and my heart just about stopped and i know now why my mom was so mad when i did it when she was younger now uh normally i really like to take a lot of time to go through and show you things in travel mode unfortunately we're already done doing that this is really why i call this one a great destination use camper because the living room everything is so awesome when you get there but for traveling you can you know get to your bedroom you can get to your bathroom if you got to make like an overnight stop or stay or something like that but you're definitely going to need to use the slides in transit and if you appreciate the extra information do me a favor hit that subscribe button follow along and let's hop outside we're going to start outside here in that big compartment under the bed remember you can lift the bed to get to it or you can get to it from out here and as i back up take a look at those speakers mounted down by the skirt line that'll help keep you from blowing away the neighbors and keep the total volume outside a little more reasonable unless you know you want to blow the way the neighbors never notice how your music is better than theirs that oh i've never once been camping been like yo crank it up brother anyway god i gotta quit doing that voice it's really it's really starting to get to me you've got dual power awnings here which is really smart because with that door side super slide it eats into the awning space something fierce the more ride steps are standard but the power stabilizer jacks that you might be peeking at those are an optional piece of equipment available on any of these wild woods and x lights the uh full wild wood versus x-lite's a little bit taller inside which is why it looks a little bit different up front it's a little more bulbous but i still like that nice radius front end it doesn't feel like you're towing a brick down the road or anything like that power tongue jack on the front of course power awnings we mentioned the power stabilizer jacks but what is cool is what they got going on down here with their heated enclosed sectionalized protectionized accessibility oh god bless it i gotta quit doing that voice so this is heated it's like a hard plastic shield as compared to like almost like a corrugated plastic cardboard kind of thing this is what they do on luxury fifth wheels in a lot of brands at forest river guys they're doing it here in a wild woody in case you weren't aware there she is prepped and ready for slide awnings tongue and groove plywood floor decking 5 8 thick 3 8 walk on roof decking and walkable slides actually but you might notice no ladder i know i'm going to get questions on that the wild ones with the giant rear window this one the 32 ret and weirdly the 26d bud bunkhouse they are the only full wildwoods where they you cannot uh get a ladder from the factory uh or it's not prepped for a ladder rather just because there's there's too much glass there's no way that you you could mount structure for that ladder stanchion to to log into again all those amazing windows over here on the door side of the rv and we can see another option today well two of them actually spare tire actually an option we would put that on pretty much everything here and an outside shower i really need your feedback please on this outside showers are optional on wildwoods uh a lot of people don't seem to request them is it just because you didn't know or you didn't care obviously the person who bought this rv because this is actually a pre-sold rv they did order it i think i would but what would you folks at home do i'd love you to leave me a note in the feedback uh section of the comments to let me know [Music] hey jody you want to hear something funny yeah excuse me so starting now keep in mind that this is just generic footage to show you how the versa lounge works in all its different variations because we carry so many wild woods and this is available in so many models and it takes a lot of time to juggle between all these different formats to do my job properly i thought i'd kind of record something a little more generic and i think you can definitely get the idea so first of all in the super slides of wildwoods you see that they do have the blackout kind of roller shades what is really nice is they have slide side breeze windows i just have those covered up so that window all the way down there on the end will open for airflow regardless of what configuration you have the seating in so if you're looking at it right now this is what i call traditional where you've got yourself uh you know a u-dinet or a two-bench dinette because there are variants of the versa lounge both ways depending on the floor plan you're looking at and then a uh a sofa over here and that is a very normal configuration you don't you know see a whole lot of variants there but if you take note that rear uh well the uh the seat back closest to us on that u dinette it looks a little different that's because it's removable so if you don't want it there it doesn't have to be there and that's what's really cool about this thing this is like phase one of about five of the versa lounge arrangements you can just create this wide open kind of super dining lounger hybrid combo job now that's a very technical term you know i understand if you need to back the footage up a little bit to uh to pick up what i'm putting down right there but you folks are tuned in to halodervy i think i think you're pretty sharp what's kind of cool about this is it kind of makes it easy to sort of slide over the table slide over to the seating there's there's really no like one way that you have to use this it's just the way that works best for you and your family next it folds down into one super slide super seating sleeper setup i know that's a lot of alliteration for one thing in rv but you get the idea now what i love about this is this is found the versa lounge setup like this is found in all super slide wild wood and x lights once again now you tend to find a lot of bunkhouse models in those families but they make quite a few couples campers too so that means like a super slide rear living couples camper can convert down into being exceptionally guest friendly and it's long enough that like i'm a tall person if i had my head on the right hand side of the frame and then there was a second copy of me sleeping with my head against that firewall you know we we might touch toes but hey no big deal and most of the time you curl up and you're a side sleeper you could make that work for a night for a weekend so it's good for more than just kids it's also like adult guest friendly or frankly some people have really big kids and they need a little bit more than you know just a conventional sleeper uh bunk setup they need something longer but one of the best and most unsung qualities of the wildwood versa lounge is all of this huge tote storage space that you're looking at this is i believe it's 20.1 cubic foot of total tote storage their food safe containers so if you want to put some crackers or oreos or snacks for the kids in there it's not going to be contaminated if the rv you know gets hot while it's in storage you know you could leave stuff in here if need be if they're especially if they're you know like non-perishable kind of things but even if they're perishable stuff you know short-term kind of thing you see that under the sofa there's like a drop-down face that uh you know flops down and you can pull those totes out they're stackable uh and and frankly guys if you don't need them don't use them you know there's nothing that says they have to stay here they're not bolted to the camper by any stretch of the imagination and where they're really useful is especially in bunk models because what you can kind of do is dedicate each tote to one of the people in the rv like say the kids and what you can do my daughter uh chloe what i could say is okay chloe i want you to take this tote go upstairs to your room uh there's clothes laying on your bed i want you to put all those clothes in this and then bring it back to me and bang the kids packed it's an easy way to help get the kids involved it's also an easy way to help keep all the kids toys and clutter and everything uh you know uh under control now under the rear dinette bench on you dinette models because remember there are some just two bench dinettes so this part of the video may not necessarily apply please keep that in mind but they leave it wide open and i like that because you could stuff more totes or duffel bags down there if you're so inclined but i have long legs and when i sit at something for a while i tend to lean forward and i like to curl my legs under me now that's just me but i looked at that and said oh my gosh i could actually be comfortable here whereas you know a lot of dinettes just they aren't comfortable for a bigger person like me and i think i could really get along just fine on this one over here but i think most of the time this is how everyone's going to have this set up at least most folks not everybody i tend to speak in absolutes it's kind of a flaw that i have because it gives us this extra large stretch out kick back relax cuddle up with the family napping lounge over here whatever you want to call somebody called it a fainting lounge on our youtube channel is that is that a thing is that like a regional thing is that something from down south or out west that just this little midwestern boy i am i don't know about the fainting lounge where you can just walk up and faint on this thing i don't know you get the idea anyway i i like the fact that i could just sit in the corner i could stretch out and on most models where you find the versa lounge like this is a good example uh it will actually help you face the entertainment center more organically and give you a more enjoyable experience overall you know there's just there's so many good things like i haven't even talked about the accent lighting over the slide that makes the whole rv look bigger there's so many good parts about this and what's cool is when it is in uh l lounge fainting napping family cuddle mode whatever you want to call it you don't lose a dinette and where i think this is perfect is if you do have kids or guests like this uh if you're in a bunk house you still have a little spot where you could sit down make the kiddos a sandwich or you know hot pocket or whatever you get the idea hot pocket and uh please don't sue me you could uh still have a little spot there they could play some little board games or something card games in the corner but you're still kind of right next to everybody everybody's still in the mix and that's what camping's about for me it's trying to get everybody together so that everyone has a good time and i think this is a great way to do that no matter your style of camping no matter how many people are camping this offers something for everybody it's why i call it a swiss army sofa seat", "M5VsjrgjAwE": "oh to see all of you [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] from a brand new collection of poetry by alden solovey

offerings we make an offering of thanksgiving and our thanksgiving is a reflection of our appreciation for the importance of leadership the importance of claiming it and embracing it in the importance of sharing it and teaching it and calling on new generations of leaders to ready themselves and to grow in discernment and awareness and passion and confidence and competence and comfort with the role of leadership and the importance of implementing it with a sense of purpose and dignity and ongoing gratitude what a beautiful offering we should also mention the true sacrifice that we call on our leaders to make one must invest tremendous time and energy even treasure in order to make for good leadership but that means making the sacrifices necessary to provide that for community and so i'm pleased to be in the midst here tonight with david fleischman smallinski i'm pleased to be here with leah jones david rakovsky i've watched you all assert yourself as leaders and to grow as leaders and to bring your love for our community to bear with every thing that you do for us to make us a better community a gateway for richer and and more engaging participation fulfillment of our mission and to have you teach these beautiful values and to help others understand the power of our mission and to carry it forward is truly a blessing and so i turn it over to you david and dan and thank you so much for being here and for all that you do and for our mensch ventures thank you thank you okay i wanna go ahead david okay i wanna go ahead i wanna thank uh the mensch bench uh graduates thank and congratulate you on completing uh the four sessions of the mensch bench and the graduates this year uh are adele goldblatt barris stanley isis simona bogud karen kovacic sarah duggan goldstein joy getzenberg ed mogul iris merrick adair gulster scott phillips lynne pavellon jessica weinrob and mark weinrob thank you both thank you all very much yep thanks everybody and the the presenters i want to thank the presenters uh for the various sessions uh for their participation their insight and their wisdom that includes michael cohen from the building committee ted may from security committee liz cohn uh she a board member laurel crown to olam canter uh cantor michelle friedman the director of education mandy hurlich rabbi craig leah jones our board president david rakovsky incoming board president thank you david sarabet salesman our executive director and our new senior events producer producer amy guth thank you all very much dan i'm wondering if you had anything else you wanted to to say and further comment about this well um i thought it was it's the second time we've uh had the mensch bench and it was just as successful as the first time for those of you out there in cyberspace who might not be familiar with the mensch bench it is a program designed to cultivate leadership sort of an on-ramp to seeing behind the curtain at a manual some folks want to be involved in leadership but they're not really sure where so they might be hesitant this is an opportunity to kind of see everything that's going on in the manual as best we can in a relatively short period of time and to also meet some people as well and the hope is that after you've been on the bench bench that maybe you see the opportunity whether it's a very organized component or of a manual that's that's uh you know um going strong or that there's somewhere that really needs some help and that that's that's something that you'd like to fulfill so all of that is represented in a manual and we appreciate everyone's participation and anyone on this call who would like to participate will be doing it a year from now roughly uh in particular the next uh annual meeting before the next annual meeting so thanks again for everyone's participation i thought it was a great success yeah i'd i'd like to to thank you if i could um uh on behalf of the whole board and the whole community of lee leaders i want to thank david and dan for putting this second annual mensch bench together last year it was just a great idea this year it was done with just fantastic follow-through and i was lucky enough to to sit in on it this year having had no experience with it last year and all i can say is as someone who's been along on this lay leadership journey for the last six or seven years i wish i had had this um learned you know kind of the lay of the land instead of learning it on the job um so you know this has been fantastic and it was great to meet all of our future leaders who were on these four uh four events that we did including tesla who was an honorary graduate i want to say as he was in on the meetings for a lot of them um so really job well done everyone and job well done david and dan shabbat thank you thank you yes shabbat shalom before you two go anywhere uh we invite you if you would be kind enough to have after this to have the honor of the aliyah yes was there a priestly blessing for the graduates or did i make that up yeah no that sounds like a great idea okay all done president i'm glad someone's in charge of the ritual here this is good all right it's with with honor cancer and i uh seek to bless our mensch benchers and their teachers who are our teachers as well and thank you again much respect to you all [Music] may god keep you and bless you in all you endeavor may god smile upon you and be gracious to you is [Music] may god lift up your face that god might shine in you and shine through you taking the knowledge that you've acquired and sharing it and growing by it and giving you the greatest of all gifts the gift of wholeness i call on david fleischmann for the first blessing i am [Music] [Music] [Music] i love so i wanted to find this for you in um stum and the way it looks in the torah because you'd see this really small aleph at the end of vayikra and maybe one of the theories is that this was just one run-on sentence and so that ah aleph was borrowed by the aleph that comes next but the idea that's even more beautiful is that god calls out in an aleph which is a silent sound so god calls out to moses and says spoke to him from the tent of meeting saying speak to the israelite people and say to them when any of you presents an offering of cattle to adonai he shall choose his offering from the herd or from the flock if his offering is a burnt offering from the herd he shall make his offering a male without blemish he shall bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting for acceptance in his behalf before adonai he shall lay his hands upon the head of the burned offering that it may be acceptable in his behalf an expiation for him dan the blessing after the reading of torah please [Music] amen thank you gentlemen kola kavod cancer for beautiful and dan and david thank you for the aliyahs yashar to you both and shabbat shalom to one and all last year as parashat vayikra rolled around we focused on how the priestly rituals set up for us a legacy of sacrifice not so much literally as in giving up animals and grains in thanksgiving and repentance although that is the essence of the portion itself in its ancient context but we talked more in terms of our own choices to give something up of value for a greater moral or spiritual good at least that's the aspiration behind today's sacrifices the hardships of covet 19 have called us to make many sacrifices for the sake of health and wholeness sacrifices like weekly gatherings for shabbat worship in person that's a lot to give up large seders with family and friends i'm going to have to do that again in in large part in any way easy access to shopping and restaurants and other destinations we simply take for granted air travel and other freedoms of movement big sacrifice in-person schooling and work and perhaps the biggest sacrifice of all that is putting ourselves amidst a general disconnection and dislocation and loneliness for our own welfare hard to feel a sense of wellness in this alienation and marginalization these sacrifices challenged our wellness our patience our resilience but all served to keep us healthy or healthier or to minimize the covet chaos around us that doesn't mean such sacrifices were so easy they weren't or that they didn't frustrate us they did last year at this time i spoke to you about a family a woman working full-time for a small company with no health benefits and her husband a freelancer was out of work and she asked when our money runs out what will we have to sacrifice food rent or health care many of you told me yourselves about personal frustrations about anxieties about loss early on there weren't enough tests now it takes a lot of time to get vaccinated well at least there are vaccinations but it's also true that many of you said thank god i'm okay okay became a pretty good outcome despite these sacrifices or as a colleague told me recently okay became for us a new fabulous this year has brought forth many stories of sacrifice and a full spectrum of emotions on the side looking back it's clear that and i borrow from the spirit that inspired me last year at this time during this very shabbat shabbat some sacrifices have been relatively minor some relatively major some sacrifices have been fair and reasonable some completely unfair and mind-boggling some sacrifices have summoned our resilience some have caused ruin financial and otherwise some sacrifices have brought us greater good and some have made it near impossible for us to cope some sacrifices have been easier to make if one has lots of money some have been harder because one doesn't and some sacrifices have been made more simple by one's race or one's gender or one's sexual identity or one's immigrant status and sadly but not surprisingly some have been dangerously dangerously more difficult and one thing that is very true about this year is it has also called on us to sacrifice attitudes especially racist attitudes george floyd richard brooks brianna taylor ahmad arbory their murderers and others awoke our nation over and over again but for all our collective moral progress there is still so much work yet to do this of course is no surprise but it must be said over and over again until we finish the job sadly and unacceptably the job remains undone you see tonight we mourn we mourn dayufang and elena yuan and soon c park and sutra kim and hyun jung grant and paul andre michaels or michelle's who were murdered in the atlanta area eight deaths all told six of asian descent each a victim of racism each a victim of hate the shooter robert aaron long insists he was not motivated by race authorities explain the perpetrator may have a sex addiction and saw the massage parlors where the murders took place as a temptation captain jay baker the spokesman for the chair of cherokee county sheriff's office had this to say he was pretty much fed up and kind of at the end of his rope and yesterday was a really bad day for him and this is what he did an armed dangerous murderous fugitive who had a terrible horrible no good very bad day taken into custody without incident i wonder if long got a cheeseburger like dylan roof another armed dangerous murderous fugitive captured without incident after he shot up mother emanuel ame church in charleston south carolina killing nine black worshipers in the spirit of eugene robinson's article in the washington post this week i wonder if george floyd was fed up and at the end of his rope before a police officer choked him to death over an allegation of passing a counterfeit 20 bill maybe richard brooks was fed up too when atlanta police found him asleep in his car at wendy's intoxicated the police might have given him a cheeseburger and let him walk home to his sister's house to sleep it all instead they apprehended brooks things escalated he tried to run and the officers shot brooks twice in the back and killed him like eugene robinson cries out whose side are these officers on where's their sympathy for these victims of color interviewed about the atlanta shootings congresswoman marilyn strickland says the default position when violence is committed against people of color or women is to defer from confronting the hate that is often the motivation racially motivated violence must be called out for exactly what it is and we must stop making excuses or rebranding it as economic anxiety or sexual addiction as a woman who is black and korean i'm acutely aware of how it feels to be erased or ignored by the way it turns out that journalists subsequently dug up a facebook post on officer baker's facebook page with photos of a t-shirt describing covet 19 as an imported virus from chi na c-h-y dash the kind of language used by public officials like our immediate past president words many experts blame for a sharp increase in hate crimes against asian americans hopefully we are approaching the end of this pandemic hopefully we don't have to make many more sacrifices because of the coronavirus but that doesn't mean there is not essential sacrifice ahead ones we may find as difficult perhaps more so and so i ask you this are we going to stand by quietly while law enforcement claims colorblindness are we going to stand idly by why while white supremacists and those who aid and abet them claim there is no systemic racism and are we also willing to sacrifice the comforts of white privilege to ensure our neighbors of color gain equity and dignity respect and justice will we give up the comfortable claims of neutrality like i am not racist and will we champion anti-racism whatever it takes will we do whatever it takes to challenge racism and actively change the policies and the behaviors and the beliefs that perpetuate racist ideas and actions which lead to bias and marginalization and oppression vayikra calls courageous sacrifice summons so may we have the heart strength to step up may we respond may we stay in the fight may we live as a collective force for good may we make a difference and may we see all humanity has created but selam elohim in god's image full of intrinsic precious inviolable worth and may the memories of all killed by racial animus this year ends through time always be for a blessing kanehi ratzon may be god's will and may be our will shabbat shalom so shabbat is an interesting time because it's a taste of the world to come it's a taste of a world that has no racial animists has no murders it's a world that reflects the greatest wholeness and decency of our humanity both spiritually emotionally intellectually physically but the the serious truth is as is obvious we're not there yet so shabbat becomes a practice period for us not necessarily a reality that we've arrived in this full and whole world so besides the current events and the sadness they reflect and the tragedy they reflect and the anger and violence and hatred they reflect we also know that there are those in our midst who need more wholeness for lots of reasons emotional spiritual physical and so we take time even during this taste of the world to come which is a much better world than we experienced we take time to remember that things aren't always so whole and we have to not forget those who don't feel so whole to love them care for them show them grace show them respect and so it's in that spirit that we read the following who need refu aviva elisa laura keena aaronson bethany barrett barbara berman harvey bowler joan

with the eleni [Music] oh [Music] i offer you this poem from rabbi karen kadar's amen i lift my eyes a reflection on asa and i i'm searching for words for the words that describe make sense at least comfort words that summon me from the depth of my solitude in the night there is darkness restless attempts to sleep twisting turning into the shadows as i seek a comfortable pose i bring my knees to my chest folding my dreams in half will the crease ever come out and in the days there are silent attempts to find hope twisting turning toward the light as i look for direction a path away it is not easy to find the way and so i lift my eyes to the mountains heaven lays her head upon the mountaintop and i begin to climb what is the source of my help i climb and gaze upon the vistas more mountains more horizons never-ending moments where heaven meets earth never-ending possibilities to meet the divine lift me carry me offer me courage help me understand life's sharpest paradox that to live is tragic and wonderful painful and awesome dark and filled with light i lift my eyes to the summit and as i climb i find my help in the turning and twisting it takes to ascend i found a path and it is worn and sharted by all those who are summoned from solitude i take their lead and i know that in the most essential way i am being carried up the mountain and even now dear god even now i and we are not alone cantor might i invite you to read the names tonight it would be an honor to remember max barron harry berghardt joyce bush marvin cohen richard daumbach charles eby fanny eisenberg william

correction oh no worries no worries all right so i bet you're wondering well geez what do we do in a pandemic i mean where where do we go well where you go is 59.59 online clearly and even after the pandemic although we get to be in person at 59 59 north sheridan so look at these offerings so much to do the why not isha's event is tomorrow night of course but coming up what am i missing a discussion with rabbi edelheit a virtual second night seder members of the tribe a melton class women in wisdom a class sponsored by our eshas emitting our mortality a gift to us from tanya larson who is a member and of course the in most important mitzvah like there really is a hierarchy but this meets value break shabbat for the shabbat of saving a life rabbi anything to add oh well then i'm taking your class members of the tribe oh now i'm nervous and uh i'm going to take the class i'm going to be very quiet just sit in the corner proverbially speaking and uh make sure to mute myself you can absolutely rise just the reason why i want to underscore members of the tribe is that in order for us to set sail we need 15 learners we've got uh five or six already so we need more because we don't have enough learners then it sort of puts our ability to teach the class in jeopardy because we can't get the curriculum or the books and stuff and so um no pressure or anything no you will be in for a huge treat uh not only is cantor great but so is the curriculum oh the curriculum is delicious and it's a lunch and learn it's quick it's easy just go online there and sign up and we look forward to welcoming you and bring your sandwich and bring your sandwich and one of the really wonderful things about these melting classes in really all of our classes is that if you've got a cousin or a one of a parent like my dad i think is going to be coming to rabbi edel heights classes brilliant um but these mountain classes are a great opportunity for you to bring one of your besties to study with your favorite clergy so as long as we're on zoom you have the opportunity to bring people to classes with rabbi craig to people to bring people with rabbi with cantor shelley um so grab those far-flung besties kids parents aunts uncles and get them in class with you it's a great opportunity i love it thank you leah yeah i wanted to highlight something that i found this week which is advancing america asian americans advancing justice chicago league is doing bystander trainings in april they're free they're webinars they're one hour i'll put this link in the chat but i think for people who are feeling uh helpless um prayer and study and and calling things out is so important um but as the world opens up again and we see axes of racism happening in the outside world this is a training to learn how to to handle those um so i just wanted to share it it was something i came across nice yeah thank you and then check the um chat ted houston ted if you're um can re-post ted found uh there's an event happening in skokie on sunday that some people will be attending um but it's our it's up in the chat so ted will i'm sure add that back to the chat excellent thank you i'm glad we have some uh concrete opportunities to uh not stand idly by be it racism or or uh or any anything else that needs our presence and our passion and our soaring moral aspirations it's important to act on those so thank you leah for that that's really important i think i'll take that training myself me too i'll make sure that you have it um there was also i wanted to let you know a request in the chat that this uh for the song honey on my tongue i know that some of these songs need a time to prepare so so maybe just put that in the back of your head as something that folks would like to hear one of these shabbats honey on my tongue how lovely that's a ruthie song i think that she has introduced which is quick on a video no we don't have it on a video but ruthie's now at ruthie's internet is really getting good all right come on sounds good oh is that sweet as honey oh maybe not rabbits honey sweet as honey weed is honey on our tongue that's it then definitely we should have rave for sure all right tonight we'll do something that i've prepared a li it's uh i think it sort of meets the moment tonight was a quietly joyful shabbat kind of wrapped up in the complexities and the darkness of the world and its oppression and racism i hope we were still able to find an ounce of hope and some direction towards justice and a meaningful shabbat so ali ali kind of covers it all hey egama [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] ah oh god my god i pray that these things never the sand and the sea the rush of the waters the crash of the heavens the prayer of the heart the sand and the sea the rush of the waters the crash of the heavens the prayer of the hearts [Music] god give us strength to stand up and not stand by give us strength to call out and to have the heart strength to go beyond privilege and go beyond comfort to speak out to learn to become allies to become accomplices to step into the ring of life where racism is too fierce of combatant and let us do what we can little by little to win that fight and to see the beauty and the dignity in every human being created by zelim elohim and may we do whatever we can if we can't finish the fight ourselves let's bring some friends along and let's do what we can until the world is more whole and healed", "WvdYFFkOgAA": "\u266a \u266a \u266a TAKE YOUR TIME \u266a \u266a I'LL BE RIGHT HERE \u266a \u266a I KNOW NO ONE

checking out the all new the improved rail jack retrofit update 2910 corpus proxima and the new rail jack this is going to be a first look hands-on haven't touched warframe in a little bit i was looking at my steam profile and i have 2500 hours in this game can you guys believe it like for real do i need to do i need to flex with my steam profile no but i got 2500 hours in this game and i'm thinking to myself like why am i not playing warframe and then plus not to yell at you guys but i have these nice wings so we're gonna check out this little this musically here in the background is i want you guys to feel this with me for the first time just in case you can't log on warframe right now this is how it starts real jack is evolving and the corpus take to space rail jack is about to change in huge ways we have revisited rail jack in 2021 and our overall goal is to simplify points of friction by better integrating warframe's signature flow into the overall experience depending on your experience level with braille jack a lot of this may be simply a lot of this maybe simply may simply be new information but for those who have mastered braille jack you can read this you know when you log in basically it's about to get lit um let's see operator messages have arrived in your inbox check it out dudes we get a bunch of loot right when you log in rail jack overhaul new acquisitions full overhaul of this rojak system and architecture is complete better than my dust be aware system optimization has lowered the cost of upgrades previous investments and high cost upgrades have been leveraged towards acquisition of resources and components translation you get new stuff see attached manifest only 3 500 carbides no they gave me a legendary core dude 10 000 endo an umbral forma dude yes but do i have to how do i like loot all this stuff just i just have it in my inventory already take it take it take it accept it yup i got a booster affinity booster resource booster resounds booster one coupon available oh yeah i got the uh fifty percent fifty percent loots so uh quest is available in your products oh snap she's loud i'm gonna talk to you lotus in a while what's up bambi i know it's been a minute i know it's been a minute you've seen you missed me baby i know you missed me come on come on come on you don't recognize me oh it's cause i have these badass

look like this if i buy this it's only 150 is this different purchase 125 225. like hold up first of all we're gonna check out the new loots i just want the landing craft my dude i guess i'll play zephyr dude what dude i got a new ship are you kidding me how do i equip the ship it's gonna be my like options oops or is it equipment orbiter landing craft what i got where is it there it is look where is it should we outfit this real quick dudes we ain't got time ain't nobody got time for that let's roll up all black on black dude strange all black on black wavelengths until now this is gonna roll up all black dude there this cuz we gotta get into this rail jack man all right so configure the plexus this is the first thing we gotta do is configure plexus i think hold up the plexus allows you to use your rail jack mod selection with any rail jack you crew upon lexus mods can be found in rail jack missions integrated mods apply to you on any rail jack aura mods impact the whole squad battle mods determine which rail jack abilities you can use on a rail jack tactical mods determine which rail jack abilities you can use in the tactical menu so we need to configure and then we got an aura right i don't know if i have any good loot where's uh [Music] battle oh i have a void hole when did i get void hole black hole that draws enemies dealing damage uh yeah we need void hole um i really like seeker vortex but i can't apparently i can't use it with voidhole the 2op can you um change these form of these dudes polarization requires max rank plexus before you can polarize these okay so my plexus is not leveled tactical i remember some of this stuff from before so i'm gonna put fire suppression on this um battleforge looks like apparently i didn't have very good dude no there's a bunch of augments i don't have [Music] i'm just going to throw on here whatever i do have integrated um 3.75 forged capacity elemental resistance [Music] but you want to max out one of your things at least there's a bunch of auras here arc wing speed and damage arc wing shield and armor i'm going to put this on just because i think i want to play like arc wing 2. so let me see not that how do i like level up the mod i forget mods which is the one for arc wing the raider matrix doesn't give me a higher mod capacity if i have uh wait that's a matarai aura so let's go back here it doesn't look like it matters what the aura is just an aura like if it's matter it doesn't matter it looks like i like the way the mods pop in and out here okay so configuration a my integrated other stuff so all of my old where's all my stuff that's in my my real jack like my avionics my intrinsics yeah it gave me a mall back so it refunded all my intrinsics and now i have i have to do these i have to set up my intrinsics [Music] i have 959 intrinsics available [Music] you have a rail jack but you need a crew come to fortuna and talk to picker [Music] and they refunded all my avionics this has a necromac cooldown some in the necromac further reduces tactical mod cooldowns by 20 or from ship to crew member yo you can join them in the mission with this warp suddenly um real jack blink double tap space to instantly translate the rail jack forward leaving a trail of turbulence that slows nearby enemies bro this is getting maxed out we're maxing out piloting for sure i mean rail jack is all about driving the rail jack right so you're gonna see me out there flexing and flossing i'm probably gonna do whatever it is with like piloting my rail jack and then [Music] bro i can't even get it i'm gonna have to farm dude it's time to farm some intrinsics because i'm gonna get this ramming speed okay so i guess i'm a pilot dudes i guess we're gonna roll up as a pilot [Music] it's cool though because everybody else is gonna have their own intrinsics they're gonna so this gives me a reason to a reason to grind more um let's see man what i'll just auto install these mods oops see what auto install does how much capacity do i have 57 boost speed i like that ordinance reload time ordnance damage let me level up some of these mods how much and the do i have where's the thing that was just straight boost okay straight up speed just speed overall speed i'm maxing out my piloting today boys reduce the forge cooldown that's nice to have see how much i have now mod capacity 9 out of 57 section density it's interesting they changed like a lot of stuff all into this plexus so how do we upgrade how do we rank up the plexus i just missed doing missions [Music] you think i need more in command let's see intrinsics command apparently i can get a lot of ranks of this apparently unlock third crew member oh yeah let's get some more of this command [Music] there we go so we got some we got level a command convert liches converter liches rank 10 there's nothing in there one of so let's just go farm some loot dude you want to do some missions have you done any missions you've probably done a lot of missions let me see um who was my rail jack boy that was uh out here the um it was nazar dude was my rail jack beast he's not even as a prime attachments f mara obviously need the the wings my arc wing i need to change this to i think it was the old nada was the odinada or the amisha that was op whichever one has that um slow slows everything around me was it the odonada or the amisha i think it's amisha because it's all maxed out we're going to equip for my weapon imperator vandal or the singus i think the imperial vandal was like the one that was like what is this oh that's the melee weapon it's unranked the fluctus let me make sure let me just check out my mods really quick barrier i'll put on arcane barrier let's see where is my little bambi all right dudes please do yes hold up i'm gonna need to buy like neza prime right now what do i buy him that's choking um what are all these dude nautiluses lavos collection deimos swarm supporter pack [Music] is that for harrier collection all right here we go here we go beam me up scotty is there anything i need to do else i need to do for configuring my plexus oh no okay so battle integrated tactical um i don't have any of that mod right there [Music] all right let's see um this is an event thermo thermia fractures but just wait he said go to fortuna let's go to vortuna and get some crew do they automatically repair my ship for me and stuff see ya wouldn't want to beat ya i guess we don't need to skip the cinematic it takes longer to like click that button than this and actually watch the cinematic cinematic so we need to fast travel to ticker you like stories someone like you gara faced up to an idol on might as well have been a god never blinked saved a world see the value of stories isn't in telling you there are monsters stardust it's in showing you they can be kicked square in the down belows what you have a rail jack but you need a crew unconventional people require unconventional work purpose so naturally i looked at my little network saw the state of the system thought of you and uh if i'm honest this was all little duck's idea she made such a good case i couldn't say no come let ticker introduce you to the gang you'll love them they're a hoot syndicate related dudes adichel oh this is my syndicate right here new loca for days and some dudes will be about that repair life this guy looks dope what's this arbiters of hexis i don't think that i have arbiters dude they're cheap though isn't this boy cheap like how much does he cost the boy got zero

cephalon students still meridian thanks brought up in my brand new spaceship predator is the key to staying alive so ld tells me me of course i shall prove worthy of your trust hello captain can you just buy them all and then they uh and then you sign them or i already got a guy that's really good at that let's see boys ain't got no gunnery though wonderful they're just aching to get three of them into space yeah okay i hope you ain't squeamish well this guy's a good gunner and he's new he's like wait that's the parent secret this one i don't have what is this you can only use three dudes i'll be here look at all these tenno getting hungry dude till then we dance some of these people looking crazy get out of my way boys crowding up this whole room let's go get some bad news all right going walk some electricity and damage all right so is my plexus configured all the way where do i put my people at like where's my crew go they're just automatically with me or do i have to configure my crew we're about to get some fat loot for my dry dock i still have a dojo looks like i still have a clan voice you know auto-tune guy that says slit it gets paid like millions of dollars that's me that's not me oh dude i forgot my [ __ ] look nice oh i'm falling help on me help me help me how do i get out okay hold up what up gardener snake yeah look at my ship gardener snake you see that baby

dude i had the nike air real jack skin yes all right so let me out of here research that's already all done configure my rail jack visit your dry dock often to fully manage your rail jack bro i got systems look here i can i can do my stuff here too let me see my intrinsics so engineering this is to heal my ship right we're gonna have to get some people like open that up tactical [Music] the gunnery all right that's enough for now also go to the computer to hire your crew dudes what what where do i put them right here crew my dudes are all here [Music] all right so equip wait wait so they're already equipped these are the dudes that i hired [Music] right he's got piloting but they need weapons and stuff are really going to do me like this give this guy the bolter prime and you just auto equip them do you train them assigned to slot a b and c already let's give them some fat loot so you gotta do equipment appearance train and assign roll okay so this guy wait which one is the gunner this guy's the pilot or this way i think so this guy is going to be sign roll pilot sign roll he's got she's she's okay at repairing she's like okay we're gonna put her in charge of that

even kathy has parents and they also came up on stage last inspire bob and bev harvey so bob will be sharing the scriptures with us in a moment but i just want to say that bob and bev served in brazil for 30 years 40. oh 40 years he's as old as trevor i mean as young as trevor and they went to school together they used slates together back in those days and but they work with a mission agency called wekita national wec international wec stands for worldwide evangelization for christ and uh kathy and fernando also work with that same mission as uh bob um bruce and annette rattray bruce is with the lord and it is uh i don't know she's here today but she's often with us but they served the lord in for 30 years in indonesia and i also work with the same mission and there are also some other ladies here today they've come all the way from adelaide this morning to be to be with us now they're up here on holidays one is jenny she and her husband were the principals of the bible school i went to many years ago uh they're also the international directors of the mission for a number of years and uh helga has served the lord in the gambia in west africa and also in jordan in the middle east and let's give them a welcome stand up okay stand up there you are no no no just then thank you okay all right well that's probably enough introduction bob would you come up please and let's give bob a warm bridgey [Applause] welcome back in the old building we had steps that came up here and you didn't have to leave home so early to get here yeah that's right let me pray for you bob okay brother father we thank you for your word we thank you lord that it's life it's spirit to us and we want to experience that today thank you lord for bob his love for jesus his service for you and me for for decades not only in brazil but in australia and other parts of the world as well and we pray that as he shares with us today our hearts will be inspired and enriched in our walk with jesus bless him now bless our own hearts in jesus name amen thank you brother good morning from latin america i would say bondi that's from brazil of course because we speak portuguese in brazil but if it was other places i'd say buenos dias which is good morning so good morning i guess you're wondering what my name is just by looking at my shirt i thought i'd wear my clown outfit today because i'm supposed to inspire you it actually is a brazilian it is a brazilian shirt that my son gave me and who does it remind you of in the bible joseph of course well if you went to brazil and you didn't know somebody's name well latin america anywhere really if you call them joseph you're probably right because it's like the smiths around here well it used to be now it's like kawawachi or somebody like that joseph and mary are the two most common names in latin america as a matter of fact a lot of boys are called mary and a lot of girls are called joseph can you believe that i have several friends who are called in portuguese would say maria jose which means mary joseph and i have some um that's girls and i have some boys whose names are jose maria which is joseph mary so it's a bit confusing i know the gender thing is very confusing here these days but uh over there it's not really that bad so it's very interesting in latin america everywhere you go you see evidence of the bible why do you think that is whose influence would that be from the roman catholic church the early roman catholic missionaries who came to brazil in the 1500s and catechized the people and baptized millions called them christians but were they christians a bit of water on the head does that change the heart it does not and so what happened was that they said yes we'll be christians but deep down many of them were slaves from africa of course in the 1500s remember all the slaves that came across many of them were slaves and so they said yes we'll be christians but deep down they kept their african gods so you find right across brazil today and latin america a lot of black magic spiritism voodoo they call it uh um there's a whole lot of bundes but they're all got satan at the at the root and it was great that this morning we sang that wonderful song what a wonderful name it is the name of jesus you know there's nothing that stimulates your faith greater than to see the power of the name of jesus the authority that he has brian said without me you can't do anything but with him i give you authority over all the power of the enemy is that amazing and we've seen we went you know i don't know much about inspiring let's get back to inspiring what is inspire to inspire to give courage but you know a lot of inspiration is self-motivated but inspiration that comes from the lord is when he touches your heart and impels you to do something that's inspiration god touches your heart and out of that flows something good because the lord has moved you well you know i didn't know much about inspiration going back to start the story because we'll come back to that in 1950 i was inspired self-inspiration for tennis frank sedgeman can you believe it yesterday i was talking to god i didn't even know who frank sedsman was that's how long ago it was i wanted to be like frank sedgmen and i played tennis day and night even used to hit it hit the ball against the wall in our home at fairfield but it wasn't until i met jesus that true inspiration came to me because it's something of the heart i bent my knee to king jesus under the ministry of george francis some of you probably who knows georgia knew george several people on the 31st of august 1955 bentham became a christian but i was an only child and so i kept it quiet from my parents used to read the bible under the the bed covers with the torch but then one day at high school in 1957 the lord grabbed my heart i was reading song of solomon and it said after i left the guards i met him whom my soul loves i held him and i wouldn't let him go until i took him home to my mother's house and the lord spoke to me and he said bob have you taken me home to your mother's house oh lord it's hard because i'm an only son and we're so harmonious we got on so well i don't want to break it up bob do you love me lord you know i love you i used to read the bible every day at school you know i love you lord take me home to your mother's house oh lord so i complained had this discussion with the lord until finally i said okay lord i'll do it that day i did took jesus home as soon as i told my mum that i'd surrendered to jesus lord she just broke down in tears not of joy but of fear because she was afraid that i might become a missionary and what she feared came upon her years later she bent the knee to king jesus and she was so proud that she had a son it was a missionary that was the start when the lord touched my heart and inspired me to start living for jesus and we saw god do some amazing things at state high i don't know whether trevor remembers revolution day one day at state high a friend of mine don lloyd you might remember don used to pray every morning that god would open the way for us to share jesus with people but the school huh what an impossible prayer how can you share jesus with the school on revolution day one of the boys now class samuels was his name said bob have you got your bible here today they knew i used to read the bible i knew i was a christian i said yes i have he said it's revolution day to day we do crazy things we blow up lockers with crackers we pick up the staff cars and put them between through two trees so they can't get out how about coming down giving us the talk oh i said love to do that so then i go at midday to the park and there's our whole class sitting there seniors 1959 and i start sharing jesus with them the whole lunch hour and as we're going along the other kids revolution they see these seniors even a prefect out the front talking to them getting together what's happening up there must be revolution day let's go up and the kids start coming from down below and the teachers see the kids coming and they come down to see what's happening and they stand around and i share jesus what a privilege what an answer to prayer then we prayed that billy graham might come and speak to state high 1959 he couldn't come but leighton ford did we went down to the odeon theater at west end and the school heard the gospel from leighton ford you see the lord inspires us he touches us he moves us he gets us moving for him to honor him and to glorify his name wherever we are let me just make this a little bit bigger here it's a bit tiny for my my eyes at the moment um where am i can i remember how to do this all right i can't remember how to do it i'm under stress i'm under stress that's all right so the lord had a plan my mum wept i wept to wither but i wept for joy that i'd obeyed the lord and shared him and god started directing our paths and of course the next thing i needed was a partner a wife when i met dev at beach mission stand up sweetie just show your lovely face to everybody bev's a rock she was the rock that kept me on track first question i asked her if god calls me to be a missionary will you let me go i'm going by chem side cemetery it was i remembered it like i didn't ask her to marry him i just asked if she'd let me go she said yes god's will and nothing less i was like yes this is the girl i want the lord led us together and guided us to brazil in 1967. what a an adventure that was we got there we knew nothing couldn't speak didn't know how to act everything's back to front over there you're getting the buses at the wrong end you go like that you think you're waving to people you tell him to come you kiss people everybody on both cheeks you hug men and you rub their tummies oh man everything is so strange but the lord took us there the only thing that i knew to do was encourage people that's all i knew well i said lord you've got a purpose here he'd already told us that we were to go to brazil to encourage the brazilian church to get moving in world missions cross cultural missions brazilians going out to the end of the earth bringing jesus to people that's why we went to brazil so we're all excited to get started in it we got there and we said to the team the wech team about 35 there at the time all doing church planting in a state called minas gerais which means general mining is full of minerals of all kinds iron ore and rubies and diamonds and anything you can imagine it's one of the richest states in brazil the other states of course a lot of them have got uh interesting names holy spirit that's the name of one state spiritus holy spirit state can you believe it can you believe that there are so many people named jesus in brazil it's unbelievable jesus i know stacks of them it's amazing isn't it yeah but we got there into this state with all this religious stuff and there's crosses everywhere on people's chests one day i was talking about jesus being in our heart living in our heart in our spirit and one man said yeah look here he's he's in my heart and he opened up in a great big cross like that huge thing on his chest so the team said to us bob and bev after we told him about our vision for motivating information he said missions we didn't know anything about that our job is to plant churches and evangelize in all of these towns that don't know anything about jesus i said that's fine we'll just put it on a hook in god's time so for seven years that was on a hook just waiting man be patient god's got a plan okay lord when's it going to happen i'm looking at it seven years we waited we went way up in the bush 450 k's of dirt road and 400 k's of of asheville to get to a little village called manga on the san francisco river we worked there for three years then we went down to mariana a roman catholic fortress we had the archbishop and we had a seminary for two seminaries for priests and we had about 15 huge monstrous catholic churches with gold inside where the people the slaves had built them with walls this thick made of mud huge cathedrals but the people didn't know the jesus who's close who's alive at five o'clock or 5 30 i'd be going down the road to get some bread down the bakery six o'clock and the folks would be coming back from the church they bent their early morning thing down there at the church dedicated as they came out of church they'd kiss the rope of a jesus carrying a cross a dead christ the lord was trying to teach us something so we learned for six seven years and then during those seven years an amazing thing happened the spirit of god began moving across brazil in such a way that you would never believe the assembly of god church particularly exploded it began spreading throughout brazil and lots of the towns where we as a mission had planned to move in and plant a church all of a sudden we didn't need to they had a church there were churches there they were just popping up like mushrooms thousands of people were coming to the lord christians were coming out of their shells you'd go down the street in belarus auntie and there would be a christian just standing in the park talking about jesus with the crowd of about 30 or 40 or 50 people standing around him i used to do a lot of traveling and as i travel in the buses i'd be sitting there and somebody would get up and they'd go down the front of the bus near the driver as we're driving along mind you no seat belts running you just hang on to the thing there onto the rail i just want to tell you guys about the lord jesus he changed my life and he down down the front of the bus there giving a testimony and after he'd finished his testimony he'd pull out a stack of tracks and he'd go down down the bus and give everybody a tract and this happened or every time just about that i traveled i would hear somebody behind me talking about jesus sharing him of course one of the main reasons was that god inspired he touched hearts and people responded and started praying they were all nights of prayer all days of prayer churches would go up onto the hilltop in bel horizonte that's where we lived a city of about four million people and they would look over the city and pray the whole night for god to pour out his spirit and god did one of the tiny churches called laguna it's a bit like bridgeman downs god started moving there people getting converted transformed on fire for jesus and now laguna is a monster not just in below design but scattered around brazil in so many places the spirit of god began to move in amazing ways you know he moves in amazing ways he doesn't always do miracles sort of thing but he just works we've seen the miracles even ourselves like a policeman puts his hand up this to tell the traffic to stop do they stop when a policeman puts his hand why do they stop because he's got a policeman's uniform on if he went out there without his uniform on put his hand up for the traffic would they stop that lap that look out he's got authority and all we've seen the precious wonderful name of jesus with the hand over a demon-possessed person there's so many deemed demonic so much demonic activity in brazil and latin america as i said because of the the spiritist influence from the voodoo french spiritual spiritualism and also uh from the indian tribes their own animistic culture with their worship of demons and spirits and so on so it's all there so in brazil one of the most wonderful things that god uses is the wonderful name of jesus to set people free in the name of the lord jesus christ i command you evil spirit to come out of this person and god sets them free deliverance is one of the great ways that the lord has worked in brazil finally the door opened for us to start sharing about missions the team said wow bob you guys came with a vision for missions we never thought it was going to happen but now look what's happening get into it so we started praying that the lord would bring along candidates people who had a heart for missions but where do you start i'm an unknown little fella from aussie land nobody's ever heard of me where do you start with 140 million people and you want to challenge all of these churches that are springing up this baptist and presbyterians and methodists and this charismatic baptist and charismatic presbyterians and charismatic methodists and there's all kinds of stuff and you can hardly speak portuguese i remember my first sermon all fired up little pentecostal church and a guy in the front seat like trev down here hallelujah i'd say another sentence hallelujah oh man every time he said hallelujah i lost track i didn't know where i was he put me off i had it all in my head and the lord hallelujah oh finally i had to say brother could you please keep your hallelujahs i can't keep my mind on track he was kind enough to restrain himself but what can this little guy do you know we didn't do anything in brazil god did it all he took us to a brother called achilles barboza a lovely pastor his father had been a missionary in portugal he let us preach in his church by that time i could get by with the hallelujahs and after church he said bob you've got a heart for missions i'm running a bible school it was a baptist bible school would you come along and share on missions teach on missions i haven't got a teacher on missions we want to teach missions i said i'd love to so i went along and started sharing on missions that opened the door to lots of these guys who later on became pastors and invited me to preach in their churches but achilles was a member of the renewed baptist church it's kind of a charismatic baptist church and every year they used to have a huge convention where all of the renewed christians that's the ones who believed in the gifts of the holy spirit for today and and so on they would all gather presbyterians baptist methodists all kinds of denominations would come for this huge convention bob do you think you could speak at our convention on missions oh brother i'd love to speak at your convention that's why we're here to share about the challenge of the whole wide world for jesus after we'd shared admissions the doors just opened right across the whole of brazil brother could you come and preach over here in archery could you come and preach up in marayam could you come and share this message at the bible school here in the bible school there and then my wife became a widow because i left her i went off sometimes three weeks out of four i'd be off up the northeast 25 hours by bus or down the south of brazil down to rio sao paulo all over the place in bible schools churches conferences meeting pastors encouraging them even they invited us on to the to meet with the mission board to try to help them how to get started with missions the assembly of god can you believe it didn't even have a mission board each church used to send a missionary they only had about a dozen most of them would come back after a short time because they had no orientation so they invited us to come and help them little by little god started moving then an association of missions was formed the various denominational missions and others coming together to encourage one another and help one another god did it all he took a team of people put them together and we would travel together and share on missions around the whole of brazil one of those brothers became the leader of the world evangelical fellowship missions department jonathan santos and is still in the saddle in his 85th year or so still sharing on the lord jesus and the challenge of the whole wide world for jesus god is amazing it's a team but individuals started having amazing experiences creoza i don't know whether jenny met carrierosa santona went to italy she contacted us and she said god is calling me into missions we said hallelujah we're looking for people that god is calling so she said um can you come to my church and meet me so we went down met a church and a pastor and so on she filled in her application forms we accepted her to come to missions so she said okay lord i'm going so the church gave her a farewell and they gave her a suitcase that's all she had didn't have any money but she had a suitcase with her things in it so the day came for her to go and off she goes to the bus lines up in the queue to buy a bus ticket from sao paulo to belo desainchi which is about 600 kilometers and she's standing there no money suitcase by the side a call of god in a heart there's five people in front then there's four people then there's three people he says thank you lord i don't know how you're going to do this but i know you want me in below this auntie two people praise your name lord you're so good and then an old friend comes by and says oh hello creoles the hell are you where are you going oh she says i'm going to below designed to do my candidate orientation course to go to italy as a missionary oh he said i was going to bellow designed you too but there's something uh unpredictable happened and i can't go would you like my ticket would you like to buy my ticket yeah she said i'd like to buy your ticket didn't say i don't have any money here you are oh he said forget the money you can have it she came to bellard's auntie what an evangelist trusting the god trusting the lord on sunday she'd round up people to go to church with her i used to get up early because there was so much to do but her life the light was always on before i got up seeking the lord when it came time for her to go to italy we said all right creoza you're all set to go how's your finances she said what finances how are you going to get to italy she said i'm going to go in a big ship what a big ship a big white ship so it's going to be a very very long journey too i said what are you talking about she said before i came into candidates course god spoke to my heart the spirit of god in latin america working in her heart and he gave revision of this huge white ship traveling to italy except that it was a roundabout route so i said oh as a matter of fact the om ship has just arrived in brazil dulos i said let me ring them up and see if you could go with them she had to go to england first to learn english and then on to italy so i rang that said yes we'd love to have them no no charge wow there goes ghost kodilza and another missionary who went with her as well two of them heading for england on the dual loss i went to sao paulo with her with them when we got there here's this huge white ship first thing she says this is the one this is the one the lord showed me so she gets on board and they discover that she speaks portuguese french spanish she'd worked as a nanny in argentina where the french-speaking family learned french with them spoke spanish like a spaniard so along the way what do they need interpreters so here's carlse interpreting along the way and what do they need evangelists here's carlse an evangelist like i've never met in my life so she becomes the leader of the evangelistic team the next thing om is writing to us and saying do you mind if karilsa extends her stay two years later she got to italy a long drip god moving across latin america but you know he moves in amazing ways he's a missionary he's been years and years and years in brazil convinced in his heart that a missionary has to be a pastor and he's pastored a church and it felt a bit and he passed another church and he felt the bits and so here we are gather together praying for this brother an amazing brother fix anything build anything build a mechanic electrician plumber name it he had it and then on fire for jesus but a pastor just didn't have it but when he served people he would share jesus with them he would bless them maybe he's like some of you guys you're not preachers you're not teachers you're not anything but when you when you help people just interact with them you're free to talk and lord blesses you and uses you to touch their hearts so i said pete have you ever thought that god has given you a gift of helping in the bible it's called helps i said we'd like to release you from pastoral evangelistic type ministry to just being a helps person to help the churches to help the missionaries feet just broke down i've never seen a man weep or cry with sobs so greatly as the spirit of god just touched his heart and set him free to be what god wanted him to be maybe you're like that today you've tried and tried to be something that you thought god wanted to be but it hasn't worked maybe today he just wants you to be you to be what he made you to be and just relax and enjoy him and share jesus out of your heart jesus touches lives in such an amazing way our ministry spread from brazil to latin america we had the privilege of being invited to supervise our wech teams across latin america that took us to venezuela colombia mexico and other countries as well in the course of ministry costa rica uruguay and a whole stack of them so we had to learn spanish as well that's why we can speak a bit of spanish when we were in mexico one time we were out having a day out with the wech team and they were playing a bit of basketball and this dirty guy i mean he was so dirty and and obviously a street person of some kind a beggar he came up and there was a group of young people and they gradually edged away as this guy drew near and he sat down there just looking at these kids playing everybody kept well away but one of the one of our missionary team as he looked at this guy god touched his heart that's what inspiration is god touches your heart and something happens let me interrupt here for a second this is like us before we met the lord jesus just dry dry old sponge there's really rivers of living water available in the lord jesus there's a transformed life available there's a cleaned up life available drink of the waters of life freely when we drink those waters are transformed into springs of living water within that jesus said the holy spirit would flow out and we've seen it in latin america that happens here too in your life in my life when god transforms us so when we bend the knee to king jesus and surrender to his majesty say here i am lord forgive me cleanse me take me make me into what you want me to be and god starts working the first thing he does he picks us up and he puts us into jesus he joins us to jesus this is you can see the water in there can you i hope you can so there's the sponge in jesus if any man is in christ he's a new creature god has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in christ jesus is everything you need there's nothing else what about the grace of god oh god give me grace as though grace is something out there grab a bit of it there's no grace out there grace is in here in jesus all you need need peace here's our peace [Music] you", "yrKqrYYcTag": "um i have tyler and uh mike from energy are here i started a conversation with tyler a little while ago um we have had um energy investments we're in texas so you know this is always this this big energy state there's a lot of oil and gas people here but also there's a lot of renewables as well so that's we've had some um energy customers come our way and we've had a lot of people ask hey i see some oil and gas stuff i'd love to see some more green energy investments more stuff and renewables so tyler and i got started talking they said hey they've handled self-directed iras before they've handled different renewables projects and their team has a lot of great experience so brought mike and tyler in here today to talk about their experience about energia projects that they've done before projects they're doing in the future kind of really educate how renewables can really be added to your portfolio and the theme today is to make your portfolio a little bit resistant to some of these pressures that we're seeing here today whether that's climate change different policies from investment companies um you know we see companies like blackrocks changing their investment standards every day and that moves trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars um i live with a few oil guys that geologists here in texas and they have to talk about that every day people are asking about it people ask their investors about it so just know that these pressures are out there whether people are in the oil and gas sector or they're purely in the renewable space um so with that uh tyler and mike i'd love to introduce yourselves and take it away here thanks brandon and uh first of all just wanted to say thank you to rocket dollar for inviting us today to come and speak on this topic the topic is really about how to incorporate renewable energy into your investment strategy and i think for a lot of people renewable energy is a bit mystical and not many people are familiar with how this asset class works so our goal here is to share some of the ways that we invest in renewable energy with you so that you might consider adding renewable energy to your personal investment strategy with a greater degree of comfort a couple disclaimers you know webinar technology is still evolving we're on zoom here today we do use video as a medium quite a bit in our communications gives us an opportunity to hone our message and to provide visuals that help explain but if you know folks on the meeting here are having a hard time seeing the videos or if the internet is a little choppy for you please just let us know and we'll revert towards a more standard format and also to the extent you have questions we're a small group today we would be happy to answer questions after any particular slide so don't feel the need to wait to the end we're happy to turn this into a discussion um type of uh webinar here to the extent that anybody wants us to drill down on any of the content of a particular slide so thanks for that yeah for any uh video that energy presents today we'll throw a link in the youtube description at the bottom um and then you can get the full high def experience uh as well thanks brandon so uh my name is mike silvestrini uh i'm a managing partner and one of the co-founders of energia i've been in the renewable energy industry for the last 15 years i started a company called green skies in 2007 and grew it to become the largest at the time we exited the largest commercial and industrial solar company in the us uh we had around 450 solar energy projects for customers like target and amazon and walmart and we were there in the early stages of the evolution of this industry and i hope to be able to share some of those experiences with you today awesome thanks mike my name is tyler hurlbert i am a former licensed financial advisor so i spent 20 years at you know really large fortune 500 firms such as ameriprise prudential wells fargo and tiaa really as a wealth manager so you know mitigating risk setting up portfolios financial planning and i noticed a trend happening uh over the last five years in particular uh you know we kind of are entering into this awareness decade where you know clients uh and investment managers are becoming more and more concerned uh with not only the performance of an asset but also the environmental performance and the impact that that investment is having on the world at large so noticing that um and kind of seeing a personal shift for myself i decided to join energia in 2020 um and i'm super super excited about the mission and what we're up to here at energia i really really believe um you know we are we are on to something big uh here i want to share with you guys a video and and bear with me as i kind of i'm going to stop our share and pull up the video here um but i wanted to share with you guys a video that just kind of gets into a little bit of the why you know what what what's happening um you know kind of within uh energia and kind of you know how we go about things uh in terms of making decisions on a daily basis and what that what that looks like we are not on track to control global warming before it has a devastating financial environmental and human cost but we can manage our atmosphere in a way that maintains comfortable living conditions on earth by managing our own greenhouse gas emissions [Music] one of the most vetted sources of climate information is the international panel on climate change in 2018 close to 40 different climate models from different scientific groups around the world were analyzed to create new data the newest report states that to limit the effects of global warming to one and a half degrees above pre-industrial levels we can't emit more than 580 gigatons of carbon dioxide between now and carbon neutrality we are already over one degree above pre-industrial levels and are emitting 50 gigatons of carbon dioxide every year we need to reduce those emissions to zero before spending the 580 gigaton budget combined new wind and solar installed in 2018 resulted in an overall carbon reduction of gigatons per year [Music] at this rate we would burn through our 580 gigaton budget by 2031. many technologies and behaviors will need to work in concert to achieve this daunting objective but wind and solar energy are the most scalable and immediately available options to install enough wind and solar energy to offset our carbon emissions before spending our carbon budget we need to invest four times as much in these technologies per year and sustain that investment level through 2045 using the current cost of renewable projects it will cost approximately 1.4 trillion dollars globally per year to achieve carbon neutrality in time big institutions have promised to increase their investments in renewable energy and we hope they follow through but will it be enough will it be in time do we leave this problem to chance independent investors who wield the majority of american wealth can choose to address the problem of climate change not only are renewable energy investment is necessary to protect our climate future they can be productive investments that help individuals create wealth protect their financial future energia created an investment platform so that every american can contribute to this objective we are all responsible to future generations to address climate change and we're running out of time we're emitting greenhouse gases at an unsustainable rate but we have the ability to do much more log in and own your piece of a carbon-free world all right so uh just bear with me as i kind of get back to our uh deck here um so everybody with me mike you got the the deck we're back we can see it all right good good good so hopefully that was that was pretty pretty good like i said we'll share these videos with you separately uh as well as we move forward but you know brendan mentioned at the beginning of this blackrock and you know it it's kind of fitting i'm not sure if he saw this uh deck before but uh i wanted to just take a quick second and read this quote from larry fink the ceo of blackrock this was in a letter to uh to ceos that he puts out every year and he says today we're on the cusp of another transformation better technology and data are enabling asset managers to offer customized index portfolios to a much broader group of people another capability once reserved for the largest investors as more and more investors choose to tilt their investments towards sustainability focused companies the tectonic shift we are seeing will accelerate further uh so clearly large institutions are behind this um you know and we've really made a you know made a big push and we'll continue to make that big push and and just um tyler brief story of why this brought this up is i used to do 401k education to people and i was an advisor and we worked with fidelity adp um you know you name it every single 401k platform and we had some customers on adp and there was one uh you know a couple key employees that say hey we want to add some type of um environmentally responsible fund or a couple different options that really speak to that and i just basically had to tell them i'm sorry we have this one fund it's really expensive it's not really a great option and uh you know the fees are awful the before the performance it was just not a great well-done fund it was kind of an 80 piece like back burner somewhere and that was it and they're saying this is it this is all you've got to offer and then one of those employees kind of mentioned um larry at blackrock and you know that was hitting news newswire's at the time all his big statements he was making yeah and brandon i don't know if you can kind of unmute the line like i said we have a pretty manageable group here so i usually at this point we'll do a poll but since we got a smaller group today um why don't we open this up to to everyone here i got a list of companies so there's is is that possible to do brendan uh we can maybe do a poll a queue uh the chat might be the easiest way to do it um maybe people can raise their hand um i can ask everyone to unmute i've never done it before so i just don't want some chaos i'm not ready for but um bring it on the chaos let's bring on the cast all right ass is good here so everybody at mute for just a second if you can let's do our question and then i'll go hit the uh hit the unmute here so the question i have for the group is what do these 10 companies have in common all right i'm open to any and all answers that you guys might might have they're all american businesses you can pop in the chat as well um if you're a little shy okay take a stab that they're all in the same fund of some kind an esg fund that's my best guess so these are all obviously extremely large cap companies you know mega cap companies us based companies um you know the other thing that i thought was really really interesting is that they're all part of vanguard's um us esg stock etf for the top 10 holdings in that fund so you know in recent years there's been this ground swell of interest in esg investing you know that stands for environmental social and governance you know and as customers and consumers start to kind of wake up and the investment community starts to wake up uh you know more and more people are interested in in companies that are doing well and and making an impact on the environment and the world we live in however as you can see i think from this list of companies there's a lot to be desired when it comes to you know what constitutes an esg investment so the two main ways that esg is measured these days is either by a best-in-class approach so you have you know hey who's who's doing the best in their respective industry uh towards these measures you also have an exclusionary approach where a fund manager might just eliminate a gun manufacturer or you know tobacco big tobacco or firearms those kinds of things but there's really no set standard for for measuring the impact of an investment and kind of the esg nature and when i look at these 10 companies that's not the first thing that pops to my mind is you know it's it's they're really large they're us companies they're pillars of kind of american business but you know i don't get this overwhelming sense of strong environmental or social government governance policies when i think of uh you know apple or amazon or visa or google or facebook for that matter uh really across the board so i think the the the important part of kind of showing this slide is to let you know that we're excited at energia that there's an interest in esg investing and that people are starting to awaken to the fact that we need to consider the environmental and social impact of an investment but it's not always true impact investing and i think what we want to do right now is we want to turn it over to mike uh who is an expert in this field to talk about how you can invest in true renewable energy investments that are you know 100 an impact investment where you can measure the carbon uh that you're that you're saving from the atmosphere you can kind of you know measure those tangible benefits as we kind of move forward thanks tyler yeah so again we're not talking about esg energy we're talking about true climate mitigating technology which is primarily in the form of renewable energy asset investments renewable energy asset investments are a great fit for a portfolio and tyler is going to explain how to view the cash flow and its purpose and role in a portfolio but we wanted to make a distinction between esg investing in renewable energy investing and as our video showed we need a lot more renewable energy investing and we need it fast and we did about 300 billion dollars last year in renewable energy asset development worldwide uh impressive number compared to most industries but nowhere near enough uh to manage our carbon output in time for there to not be significant climatology climatological problems so we wanted to explain to you guys a typical structure of what it is to invest in renewable energy this is our structure um and there's a couple of points i'll make to start off here uh there's three different scales of solar energy you have residential scale commercial and industrial scale and utility scale utility scale is really best done by institutional banks we're talking about true infrastructure investing yields tend to be in the three to four percent range and offshore wind uh all the stuff in uh brendan's state of texas which is huge solar farms those are excellent infrastructure class assets but a very difficult place for retail investors to to play and the yields are again unimpressive uh when you see a yield co publicly traded collection of projects which is actually a company online that's going to be mostly holding large-scale utility-scale projects but residential stuff is executed by corporates so you can invest in a company like sunrun who would install solar panels on homes but very difficult to invest in the asset and energia we don't really like owning the company and the management decisions and the waste that may be going on at the corporate operating expense level we're more interested in owning projects and the flavor that is best for the retail investor is really the distributed generation scale or that mid middle market and that's what we specialize in so if we understand that we're talking about projects that range from sort of a commercial rooftop building up to maybe a 100 acre solar power farm something in in that type of range you're going to have a higher yield in that segment than you would get in the utility scale but it congregates better and has better uh economics than the the residential scale stuff so we really like uh the distributed generation scale segment and because these projects are relatively small they range from half a million to about 10 million dollars per asset what you'll commonly see in investment architecture like ours is that projects are aggregated into portfolios so if you can see those gray boxes there those are delaware companies that own a series of projects that are in line with the investment theme uh you have a lot of different policies a lot of different markets so you want to know what you're investing in uh you want to diversify but you want to make sure that you understand the different investment classes within the dg segment and then those portfolio companies own other companies which are single purpose entities much like real estate each company has an llc and those own one project they have no employees there's no operating expense that we have to risk here we are essentially owning direct equity into the renewable energy asset itself and since there's no employees the community solar portfolio entity would hire a company like energia global to serve as its manager with transparent fee structures so that's really the type of architecture we're looking for where we can get the investor as close as possible to the cash flow of the project without polluting that cash flow with a corporate company anywhere in the stream of cash so now we're going to dig dig deeper into one of these uh portfolios a little bit and let's drill down into a particular project so what's under the hood of a solar project this could be a wind project this could be biogas this could be a battery storage project and they pretty much all have the same archetype underneath starting uh at sort of 11 o'clock here uh the most important thing is the energy buyer this is the credit that underwrites our cash flow it's just like a lease for a piece of real estate you know the building is worth something but it's really the lease of who's renting that building that we hedge our bets on it's the same thing for a power project we sign 15 or 20 sometimes 25-year contracts which is called a take or pay contract so whatever electricity is produced by the project company is automatically bought by the energy buyer there are stiff penalties for the energy buyer to break that contract and we look at the credibility of that buyer very closely when we decide if we like an investment there's a variety of different contract styles to sell that power contract for differences power purchase agreements lease agreements but they're all essentially the same thing it's an effort to pre-sell the electricity before we invest in building the project second thing is going to be construction epc stands for engineering procurement construction this is where the bulk of our investments are going to go to this is to acquire this the equipment whether it's wind turbines or solar modules and to engineer and design the system to perform the interconnection uh and perform all the services necessary to bring the project to life we generally again want to do business with large construction companies that have a strong balance sheet that can stand behind the meaning of the contract next once we have an energy buyer and we have a construction contract in place it's time to assign a long-term contract for asset management now there's a couple types of asset management there's sort of financial asset management and then there's technical asset management at a company like energia where we're a manager we handle the financial asset management in-house and then we'll often subcontract and manage an on-the-ground maintenance company this is a company that rolls a truck to the project site anytime there's any type of interference with the production of electricity we only get paid when we produce electricity so it's very important that what we call up time or percentage of time that the plant is actively producing electricity is held at a high specification and then finally uh maybe i should have started here this is the site you know this is really the beginnings of the project uh where we identify a location and this is such an interesting industry right now because the world needs to pump trillions of dollars into renewable energy we don't really have a better strategy right now for curbing carbon exhaust and in order to do that we're going to need many many many projects all over the world and that takes up a lot of a lot of real estate so there's a lot of activity right now in our industry to find the right locations because we are tapping directly onto the electric grid and that's called interconnection and there's only so many interconnectable spots for power plants of this size so that's kind of a land grab right now to to go and acquire and locate those locations where we can easily tie plants um you know to the project and we're also looking at the quality of the site in terms of its permitability uh its environmental impact can agriculture be dual purposed you're seeing a lot more of that we call it aggro voltaics so some interesting things happening on the site but essentially those are the components of a renewable energy project and for anybody who's ever developed a piece of real estate they should look a pretty similar list uh our industry definitely picked the pocket of the real estate industry from everything from contractual structure to the types of arrangements we have with customers so when do we invest this is an important question and if you encounter an opportunity to invest in renewable energy you'll want to know essentially you get paid a premium for being in earlier the the farther behind the project is the the higher the return should be but uh at energia we chose not to ever invest in a project prior to a certain status called notice to proceed or ready to invest and this is the moment at which an asset is congealing and is becoming valuable this is a good time for us to put some capital to work uh at this point in time we have the single purpose entity is created it's structured right could pay its taxes uh we have the site as i just went through uh the interconnection with the utility company is contracted it's very important utilities don't like losing customers interconnection can be a point of conflict with certain utilities throughout the world we want to make sure that that is beyond the shadow of a doubt we have the right to deliver our electricity to that grid we want to make sure we're permitted uh and there's a variety of different permitting circumstances state by state country by country make sure that customer power contract is in place we're going to get we're going to make sure the equipment is top quality that's an important thing too in the early stage days of solar we had all sorts of equipment related problems uh there was one year in 2014 i think it was the year the polar vortex if you remember that in new england we had uh 460 inverters that needed to be replaced because it was the early days of what we call string inverters well good news is you know that tech has been figured out and we're seeing fewer and fewer issues uh in our assets than ever before so certainly the technology has come a very long way and in fact now we're pushing the envelope to include battery storage in many of the projects that we develop we got to make sure that the contractor is the right guy to build the thing uh whether that's warranties equipment selection do they have the skilled labor can they stand behind the contract and then lastly we're going to pre-sign before we dig a hole or buy one thing we're going to make sure that all the energy is sold that the price to build it is fixed and that the price to maintain it is fixed and once we have that we have a scenario where we are pretty certain about the cash flow from the asset we can estimate the electrical production which is something that's very uh articulate these days we can estimate what the cost is to build it and we know what the revenue will be to us as owners and that describes our return so this is an example of a portfolio that we developed in brazil which happens to be probably uh the hottest market in the world right now for renewable energy we're very excited about brazil should be a market leader in brazil by the end of the year and this is a portfolio as done by energia community solar is a way to develop solar projects that makes economic sense for all stakeholders from small businesses and homeowners to the utility companies and the project investors it's a popular policy in markets that are developing resilient carbon-free energy systems there's an excellent example of community solar working in minas gerais brazil here hundreds of thousands of homeowners and small businesses are subscribing to enjoy discounted energy produced by large nearby solar plants it's a new way to look at home and small business solar where the solar panels are installed on depleted agricultural land or the arid northeast part of the state instead of rooftops customers learn about the advantages of community solar through our marketing partnerships such as the national league soccer team in minas gerais cruzeiro football club once aware of this cost-saving green energy they self-enroll online the benefit of community solar is a privilege of customers that abide by a subscription agreement we can replace any defaulting customer with another subscriber who wishes to save 10 to 20 on electricity costs just by signing up so a community of us investors can partner with a community of brazilian energy users in a common effort to combat climate change a poignant reminder that we're all members of one community own your piece of a carbon free world [Music] so that's a type of product that we would put together um in a portfolio and then we would issue securities which are using regulation a through the sec in that portfolio to share through our online investment platform let me hand it over to tyler so he can talk a little bit about a broad scope of due diligence and portfolioization and one quick question that i could just ask both you guys uh so you said a little bit why you're so excited about brazil can you explain a little bit some of that was in the video what kind of factors are bubbling up that makes this so exciting and an interesting market right now you know we have a entire video dedicated to the very last thing we're going to do is just show why we're so excited about brazil we have investments right now in the us in africa soon to be japan and brazil and um you know uh having that global perspective and being in this industry for the last 15 years um you know this is a whack-a-mole of a type of industry uh generally you need an alignment of energy prices and policy and an addressable market and there's these moments where a market becomes very uh high yielding and that's where we want to be but you have to be nimble and you have to get there before that market gets hot again not like unrealist unlike real estate where if you get there when it's hot you've already missed it solar is the same thing before the competition rolls in we want to set up camp and gobble up premium deals and then as cap rates compress uh we move on to the next market awesome thank you awesome wonderful and can you guys see uh mike can you see the uh the deck we're back to the deck yes due diligence wonderful so i want to share with you a couple things right now around just doing your due diligence on any of these renewable energy projects and what you know what the risks are what the benefits we feel like are and then we'll talk a little bit about just the the why behind alternative assets and and then the growth there uh so the first thing is you know when you look at the risks associated with any of these renewable energy projects is you know you have power production so you know renewable energy is per uh you know influenced by the weather it can fluctuate we call that intermittency you know there's a rainy and a dry season with hydroelectric projects uh you know when it's cloudy and the sun's not shining as bright solar projects can suffer so there is a risk there just in terms of you know kind of the production of power also you have customer default uh mike mentioned we mentioned in the video customers can default on their electric bill and not pay we usually find that's the last thing to be defaulted upon but it can happen we do have the contractual right to replace customers from that consortium of energy buyers if they do default uh you also could have hey tyler i'll just add to that sorry to interrupt you but you just to put that into perspective um again across my career about 750 million dollars worth of distributed generation renewable energy assets we have never had a customer default um so it is definitely a risk to be aware of and that's why we build these robust contracts where we have all sorts of options we can replace the customer we can pursue penalties there are certain rights that we give ourselves but fortunately um it is not an occurrence that we see uh plaguing our industry uh thus far yeah yeah i mean we we've seen historically you know across the industry about a default rate of about one percent um we've actually even modeled in mike i think correct me if i'm wrong but i think we've modeled in a five percent default into our return projections even though we fully don't anticipate that uh being the case um you know so we also could have a change of policy um so you know global energy policy is a moving target rules change uh prices change and policies can and will change uh so it's something that you know we're the experts and it's our job to kind of stay out in front of that curve and make sure that we are um you know one step ahead of you know global energy policy and mike mentioned the whack-a-mole that's kind of what this is all about here is trying to stay one step in front of those kinds of policy changes to uh to take advantage of risk adjusted returns you also have exchange rate exposure this is just for global portfolios so anything not domiciled in the u.s generally dividends are paid in the local currency and then converted to u.s dollars so if there is a currency exchange rate uh exposure there um the opposite could also be true however you know in brazil right now the real to the dollar is at an all-time you know low it's weak um and we certainly feel like over the life of a 15-20 year project that could strengthen uh and the opposite could be true as far as the benefits to these projects go they are long-term contracted dividends and there's always inflation escalators built into them so again these are 15 20 in some cases 25-year contracted dividends for a set purchase price of electricity adjusted for inflation so it's very reliable steady kind of yields that you're gonna get from these types of investments they're also a powerful hedge against equity and bond markets um you know so you know renewable energy projects investing in this kind of infrastructure generally is non-correlated to u.s uh equity and bond markets and you know with them you know growing talk about a market bubble and when that will come to an end this is just a really nice way to hedge against some of those bets they are real assets as well to that same point it's not paper investing so you know you've seen with amc and gamestop some of the issues and kind of counterparty risk that you can incur uh investing in in these kind of paper markets these are you know steel in the ground it's solar projects or hydroelectric projects around the world and there is that kind of nice real asset component to it and then last but certainly not least these are true impact investments so like we talked about earlier with esg this is not some lip service you know sustainability report that we're generating these are true impact investments for every you know uh kilowatt or megawatt of power produced we can measure you know how much you know carbon emissions that's you know kind of saving and you know how much we're able to kind of offset that so it is a true uh impact esg investment so with that i wanted to talk a little bit about just kind of building portfolios in in this new modern modern age uh so this is from this this graph this data is from seeking alpha uh the name of the article is the 60 40 portfolio is dead uh you know i don't know if i'm going to you know go that far but certainly i think investors are starting to realize that they need to add you know some different sources of yield and different sources of return to their portfolios to kind of help build a more resilient overall portfolio so if you look at this this is projections again adjusted for inflation returns over the next 10 years from seeking alpha u.s large cap stocks a negative 4.7 uh return bonds you know anywhere from negative three to negative four percent um again adjusted for inflation so the question then becomes you know with the with the stock market being you know many would say a little bit overcooked and overbought um and bond yields at historically all-time lows with no with no end in sight the question then becomes well where do people turn to try to you know generate some new yield uh in these portfolios and the answer according to this graph and i think a lot of people would agree it's it's really alternative this is from prequeen's annual future of alternatives reports reports from 2018 but basically what they did was they asked large-scale institutional investment managers private equity you know fund managers the blackrocks of the world you know do you expect to increase or decrease your exposure to the following asset classes over the next 10 years so your allocation is going to increase or decrease when it comes to infrastructure real estate private debt private equity and as you can see here the resounding answer is that you know these alternative asset classes are on the rise um so as we start to look for different sources of yield and the new yield clearly infrastructure you know real estate private debt private equity and all alternative investments you know even like bitcoin uh and some of these cryptocurrencies that have become popular it's just another asset class for for investors to look to as they try to diversify out some of that risk that has built up over the years so not only an asset you can feel good about but certainly an asset you can you know really generate some positive non-correlated yield from from the investment community and that's really where energia kind of steps in and you know really at the core of what we do if we're in the middle you know our digital platforms in the center here we take these renewable energy projects these real asset infrastructure projects around the globe and we connect the everyday retail investor to them so we really believe in the democratization of this asset class and making it available to any and all investors um you know whether you know whether you're looking to invest ten thousand dollars or ten million dollars it really doesn't matter uh you know we believe that everyone should have the ability to uh invest in this platform and this is what the platform kind of looks like um so i would encourage every one of you you know after after we get off this call just log into energia.com um you can just put in an email address create a password and you'll be able to you know do your due diligence view offering circulars you'll be able to view project memos uh look at all of our available inventory uh what's to come uh but whether that's on your you know laptop desktop mobile um you know the platform is you know kind of built for all of those areas so it's kind of connecting you to these uh premium renewable energy projects uh so with that we wanted to share uh brennan you had mentioned a question about brazil and just why we think brazil is is really kind of an attractive market right now it's really the place we went to first you know we wanted to plant our flag there first um so we have a video here one final video that i want to share with you guys um just for rocket dog customers right before we hit play here that chart that tyler showed very much resembles what i hear on the phone every day of different rocket dollar customers calling in asking you know what types of assets they want to get into uh and that that's both on the institutional side and people finding out that they can do that through a rocket dollar account get get their hands on much closer level to these types of assets wonderful yeah we couldn't agree more couldn't agree more renewable energy markets come and go one minute they could be the best place to invest in the entire world then competition rolls in policies change and another market emerges right now we believe the hottest market is brazil we expected it to be a perfect storm of policy energy economics foreign exchange and customer adoption and now it is we've predicted this circumstance and positioned our investors in some of the best projects in the country we're offering them to you through our investment platform for the first time ever anyone can piggyback on energy as investment strategy so we can build even more renewable energy as a community of investors log in and invest with us today so you know i'll i'll turn it over to mike for a couple of a couple of points actually before we open it up for questions on brazil as well but um you know really it's just the perfect storm of like we talked about there you know for the last 20 years uh brazil has you know for for all intents and purposes been frozen in ice you know their their policy you know they just haven't been able you haven't been able to connect a solar project or a hydroelectric project to the grid until recently that coupled with you know higher energy costs and a growing customer base you know it's really kind of that last frontier where you know you can get you know teens to upper teen returns whereas you know if you the same kind of solar project in the us you know you might be looking at a six seven eight percent return uh so i don't know mike did you have any quick points on brazil before we open up for questions yeah i mean i think ultimately we view all the projects the same if we take into consideration the risk adjustment yes there's a greater degree of risk going into emerging markets and places outside of the oecd nations but the returns are significantly higher and where we think we can mitigate those risks and enjoy those fatter yields that's where we want to take our investors we're not opposed to the us market at all in fact we're investing ourselves into a series of projects we have about 80 megawatts worth of u.s based inventory here um but u.s is a particularly challenging market because it requires that investors have a a certain like a certain type of tax efficiency the way that we incentivize solar to offset the tariffs that we apply on the importation of modules is we provide a tax credit but if you're not in a position to monetize that tax credit it makes u.s based renewable energy investing a little bit more challenging we are working hard to solve for that so that our investors can have straight cash yield in the u.s market but most other markets are straight cash yield today and that's why we have interest in a true global portfolio and i also want to add that i think tyler and i and and the whole crew energia are in the belief that inflation uh is a concern on the u.s dollar there's been significant quantitative easing and eventually that has to be paid for and that's why we're interested in a diversified portfolio where we can blend together different currencies different technologies different markets and put that together into a yield that's gonna sustain for a long period of time and that's why uh the global effort uh put forth by energia here and that's why the product is the design the way it's been designed happy to answer any questions guys um thanks very much for listening i know that's a you know a little bit like drinking from a fire hose a lot of information there but hopefully i can answer any questions you have about the projects themselves the asset class or energia please let me know yeah just one one comment i had that i noticed is that that structure that you guys use you said that's been kind of tested in real estate i've seen uh people in other asset classes even work with rocket dollar employing a similar structure for success you know that stan that's right yeah because there's these other types of investments if you were to go online uh there's this company called nrg in 2014 under the ceo david crane they came up with the first yield co and a yield co is a publicly traded portfolio of renewable energy projects the only problem with the yield co is that there's a couple things that we don't like number one is that there's a there's a corporate architecture on top of those projects so it's not just owning the projects like at energia you're only a company that owns projects and that company makes decisions about how to spend its your money the second thing about that is that it is a paper transaction at energia if we have a million dollar project we raise a million dollars we sell a million dollars worth of securities and then we close it up it's done we're not going to allow for uh additional stock to um dilut initial investors um on a particular portfolio so we like that closed uh fund archetype whereas a publicly traded yield co anybody can buy as much as they want regardless of what the yield is projected for that project and if they oversell it starts to dilute yield and that's why you have yield cos averaging three to four percent worldwide right now so that's a yield co product this is a direct equity product and we're not aware of any other way to get access to direct equity other than being in the business itself like we are but if you're not a developer or you don't know one uh it's difficult for people to engage this asset class and that's really what the whole purpose is of the platform is to demystify that and give you access all right we had a question from doug pop in here tyler can you see that yeah yeah i'll go ahead and read it off and mike if you want to take it feel free if you want me to take a stab at it i will for projects would you consider not tapping into the existing grid for example a community where a project would provide electricity for the community itself uh perhaps community members own the project as part of their own land deeds then license out the technology yeah so that's a very that's a question that has been asked in this industry since day one you know do we need the grid the answer is it's so much more uh it's beneficial to us to have the grid and because of the intermittency in the cost of batteries when their grid is present we want to be able to use that grid to transmit our electricity to our customer as efficiently as possible it makes sense to tap onto the grid that said um you know we have a huge important call popped in um so if there's not a current question on there i'd love you know you guys have a lot of solar projects right now brazil has been big um what's your guys experience of wind have you guys done wind projects recently in different areas uh through energy yeah yeah like i said um you know we have uh a market leading position in brazil right now we should be amongst the top one or two solar developers the distributed generation in brazil uh by the end of the year we have uh significant interests in the united states mostly in virginia we have a deal coming with the historically black colleges and universities which is a consortium of 107 colleges and universities we have some projects in the northeast massachusetts and connecticut so yet we are active there we have a portfolio that's launching in the next 30 to 45 days in africa primarily focused on south africa through a partnership with a company called the sun exchange in this case they're developing the projects and we're investing into them as a group of investors here in the u.s high-yield stuff extremely high credits they have customers like vodafone which is the second largest telecom company in africa and we're also eyeing some project opportunities in japan right now but the list keeps going and it's our job to follow these markets and study them and then make a decision and we say no more often than we say yes and um you know but those are the markets that we think right now would blend together to make an ideal renewable energy portfolio great thank you mike all right and uh any more questions i'll just a few things about like the rocket dollar checkbook ira have some slides but we only have a few minutes here so i don't need to bring it all up but um something important about the checkbook ira is something that tyler and mike talked about the beginning is when you get these big giant funds uh wall street basically assembled the funds and you know we're talking about the webinar today they all have a little bit of philosophy and they're all just kind of throwing a lot of stuff that's just in the s p 500. basically it looks very similar to s p 500 fund except like tyler said they'll cut out a few gun manufacturers same exact fund with the checkbook control ira you get a lot more control you get to closer your investment and this is something i hear for a lot of both environmentally or socially conscious investors is they like to be really picky they like to specifically say no to certain companies and investments that they don't feel are doing the right thing and that's what really what a checkbook ira allows you to do you don't have to rely as much on a big fund manager to make those decisions for you on your value set yeah that's great that's so great brandon and i would just encourage everyone here you know we'll follow up um if you have any questions specifically for us but yeah if you go to energia.com and again just put in your email and create a password then you'll you'll be at that point you know signed up we'll send you a weekly email we'll keep you in touch with new projects that are coming onto the site new portfolio i've got a lot of stuff happening right now so just go on to uh the website energy.com uh just create a user profile and then that'll also allow you to start to do your due diligence um and and those kinds of things um it does look like we have one more question i don't know if we can can we take it brendan yeah go for it we still got five minutes and then we'll probably uh cut things off after that all right so we got a question here coming in um investment hold period average roi uh and distribution structure um sure so yeah go ahead mike if you want yes with regards to the hold period when we buy an asset we hold it for its life that's the plan now can we sell it absolutely but unlike real estate we don't make a projection that we're going to sell it for some pop three or five years from now we don't know so we assume in our model projections that we're going to hold it that said you own a security in the holding company and you can sell your security to anyone anytime you want there's a right now there's a three-year holding period to hold your stock once you buy into one of these projects and then after that point in time you can sell your stock and essentially you're hopping off the dividend bus and somebody else is hopping on to replace you but the project remains under our management so hopefully that clears that up makes that clear um average roi depends very much on those risk adjusted markets so in brazil we're seeing stuff in the low 20s in the us we're seeing stuff in the mid to upper single digits uh in japan it's mid to upper single digits in africa we're seeing uh upper teams so if that gives you a sort of a lay of the land those are sort of rough numbers but that's about what we see which makes sense to us and then distribution structure every month we collect the money from the customer's payment the first thing we do is we pay the plants operating expenses that's that operations and maintenance contract i mentioned we pay for the insurance related to the company there's an internet bill for each project so we can see the generation in real time uh so some accounting at the end of the year so we play the plant's operating expenses then a hundred percent of what's left in the account gets drained and distributed pro rata to shareholders so if you were to invest in the south fernando hydro project today you'd get your first dividend next month there are some portfolios that are under construction so there would be a period where you make an investment uh you're going to get an accretive yield on that and then when the projects turn on you'll step into the dividends on a monthly basis the same way great thank you mike and that's just a very close like speaking to how close you are to the actual investment you know these people are paying their power bills just after the cost of the solar are taken care of that's coming right to investors uh that's right you own the plant yeah i really do own the project we usually have two types of customers at rocket dollar we have home run hitters you know who they're just trying to smack smack home runs in any direction uh and then we have yield investors um you know that just similar you know real estate investors they're trying to hit some certain level of yield for a certain level of risk uh but they're usually trying to replace some type of bonds or you know even some equity type products with a higher more aggressive yield type um so mike and tyler thank you so much for coming by teaching us about renewable energy investments uh we're gonna get this recording up on youtube so anyone uh listening feel free to pop that send that to anyone um you can use code energia just the name i don't have my slides up but uh use that name for 50 off if you're still a prospective customer you can throw that out to someone who's interested in investing with renewables um thank you everyone let me just kill the recording right here all right thank you all for attending today we really appreciate your time thanks so much", "FGtyWXYNoBc": "and it's a little bit early here but uh again this is a good way to start the day to have a discussion with the audience today about the issue of lignin that has become actually very important subject of research and developing especially recently and some of you who know what i do probably you know that my favorites materials are cellulose and high tin i work very heavily in cellulose and kiting nano materials but also on lignin even though i'm not a lignin chemist i will focus today to share my experience with living from the point of view of colloids and surface sciences but again this is not my work this is the work of my students and together with our collaborators across the globe and i will be summarizing the work for probably uh last five years not all but some of the work that we have been doing uh with the researchers that you can read on the left of the screen belonging to the different institutions across the planet including finland canada and also austria and many other institutions that really are very interested in looking into lignin lignin valory sessions and of course i acknowledge the funding support uh from the nsr the erc in europe and the north fork that was actually a development that specifically funded work in our group in relation and finally acknowledge the bioproducts institute that i direct in the university of british columbia and also the finn series flagship in finland so when we talk about a legend i thought it's important to put this into context lignin hasn't been really the favorite in science and research in our area of forex bioproducts it has been mostly cellulose and at the beginning i was alluding to that fact but really cellulose is coming very strong and i think there are great opportunities for lignin as a renewable biomacro molecule and of course you all know that lignin is a very complex system that in the native form it has a very complicated three-dimensional structure in the tree and that is it it is very difficult to define the molecular structure of lignin one is it's separated is fractionated and that leads to a lot of discussions about the truest structure of lignin and in this image that you see here in this slide you can appreciate a recent work together with professor balakshin related to the discussion whether lignin is a linear or a branch macromolecule so it's interesting that this discussion still is going on and this really allows us to go deeper into the science of the structure of lignin but no question the lignin is coming back very strongly and on the left i include another paper that we publish related to the topic and you are welcome to to come to that paper because it places literally in the context of the future by your refineries one additional communists as we start is looking at the patents and publications per year in the subject so in this business slide you can see on the right as a function of the number of years since 1990 how the publications in the area of polysaccharides and nanomaterials especially forest-based nanomaterials has been growing very rapidly as well as proteins and also polyphenols and in polyphenols we have included lignin in the orange color and here we have patents publications uh that will be in solid lines and uh the publications themselves in broken lines so it's interesting to see how the pace of production of publications and patent interests has been growing for lignin but especially you can notice in 2010 or around 2005 2010 there has been a a shift in the slope of publications and on patents related to lignin so that signals to the recent interest in the last probably 10 years or so on lignin that has been studied very heavily in the past but i think it's coming back very strongly and of course there are reasons for this so i will share with you my perspective of lignin from the point of view that i propose lignin and its use with little or no deconstruction so we try to reduce the steps to crack the lignin molecule to to reduce the molecule to the building units of the molecule and rather to try to look into supramolecular assemblies of these structures and this is very important in the case of lignin because of the polyaromatic structure and the different substitutions that enable a highly heterogeneous polarity distribution and and for that reason this polyaromatic molecule can act as an adhesive in a in a wide variety of surfaces also the effect of highly non-specific interactions so overall lignin as a polyaromatic molecule can undergo not only hydrogen bonding but high pi interactions uh pi catalyon electrostatic as well as uh hydrophobic interactions of course besides typical van der waals forces and that that means that limit can be virtually interact with many different molecules in nature and for that reason of course there are opportunities for the exploitation of such features in the macro mech in this macro molecule so in the tree lignin offers a water resistance and that also helps in the transfer of water and the transport of nutrients lignin acts as a support as a mechanical support and to resist the stresses adds rigidity to the plant and resistance to rot also antibacterial attack fiber retardancy and has antioxidant activity so it is natural therefore that some of the uses of lignin involve exactly those properties that lignin has in the plants and before we continue to look into these supramolecular construction of lignin based materials i think it's important for us to think about the history where the lignin comes from how it is extracted and if we take a look at a cross section of wood and imagine that the wood is being then subject to digestion to cooking to remove lignin one thing that we need to keep in mind is that lignin is removed at the beginning mostly from the secondary wall that is shown there in red and the lignin molecules that are located in the middle lamella come out later in the later stages of the lignification of wood that's shown on the right diagram where the percent delignification versus uh the um uh wood the daily unification of the whole wood is uh shown and and then here we can see a little bit about this uh topo chemical evolution in the lignin removal and that makes me think that when we remove lignin with time as we collect the lignin in the so-called black liquid different molecules are being accumulated in the solution and those molecules coming from different areas of the plant of the cell wall and the middle lamella may have a different composition different molecular weight so one question is how is that distribution of chemical features change as we extract the molecule and whether there is a relationship between molecular fingerprints and degree of polymerization of the molecule as well as the type of functional groups that exist in the molecule and long time ago that was maybe 2014 2005 um i i started to look at into into this question and we took black liquors and different types of lignin solutions but in this particular case i refer to black liquors from soda pulping of bad gas and what you see here is by using a ceramic ultrafiltration membranes we separate lignin molecules of different molecular weight cut off depending on the membrane type from the black liquid and you can see those solutions in the bottom with different color from a typical process now if we take each of those fractions coming from the black liquid that is accumulated after time we can also look into properties like the surface tension and that's what i show here on the right and immediately it emerges to your eyes the very fact that the molecular weight or degree of polymerization of the lignin will affect the surface tension so the surface activity that and that would be one of the first messages that i want to share that lignin is a surface active molecule reduces the surface tension of water so in this plot the surface tension in millimeters per meter versus limiting concentration we see that reduction and that reduction in surface tension depends on the molecular weight could of fraction that was separated from the black liquid then when we take a look at each of those fractions as a function of molecular weight and we measure the amount of carboxylic groups and aliphatic oah as well as other fingerprints that can be accessed by nmr then it emerges the fact that there is a relationship between those molecular fingerprints and functionalities with the molecular weight so in other words we are separating the lignin molecule from the tree but at the same time selectively producing a correlation between molecular weight and functional groups and perhaps that relates to the topochemistry that is where the lignin was sitting before extraction this is of course something that needs to be proved but at least is an appealing idea so going back to the surface activity of lignin this is also shown here how the lignin considers a polymeric surfactant reduces surface tension and this is comparable to some typical surfactants that you see in the same plot so one aspect here of a typical surfactant is the appearance of a critical micelle concentrations a a break in the tendency of surface tension at a given concentration and this is due to the association of the molecule in this particular case in water and what you notice is that for what for lignin solutions there is also a pseudo cmc there is a change in the slope of the surface tension and that signals that a given concentration lignin in solution starts to aggregate to form associative structures that are pretty dynamic and i became very interested in this topic and also some time ago uh from this uh paper from novgorod published in la mir there was some discussion about the complex colloidal behavior of lignin in the form of the fractal structures that reforms in solutions so it's a beautiful case study for colic chemistry working in the area to think about lignin as a molecule that first reduces surface tension and second associates in solution in very interesting structures that are highly dynamic so so far what we have discussed is a possible evidence of an especial special temporal memory of the lignin that is free from the plant during the cooking process now the question that emerges or comes next is if what we concentrate now in our attention is on the fiber that we separate or the fibrils that are separated in the same process if there is also any correlation with the residual lignin that stays with the fibers not the one that is solubilized but the one that stays with the fibers so this really prompted some interest in more recent times in my group to look at a lignin that is produced from a single cook single digestion of wood woody biomass and to look at a given point during the process how fierce the black liquid composition is and more importantly what is the composition of the fibers so at given point a given so-called kappa number the fibers are separated those fibers contain still large quantities of lignin and then to subject the fibers to microfluidization so that we can produce nanocellulose and and an interest in our group is to produce ligno cellulose that is lignin containing nanocellulose that is a very special type of nano material that i think has very high interest in many different applications so this is what we did we took the cellulose suspensions that were separated from this exercise and we fractionated the fibrils by size and here you can see fabrics are coarse medium size and the finest fields in terms of the width of the fibrils that are separated in this case by scientifical fractionation so using multi-stage fractionation when we look at the fibres if we start with the coarse ones of course what you see on the left is the morphology in the hfm as well as a plain view of a nanopaper or a film that is produced with those fibrils containing lignin and a cross section as you can see here of course this is a relatively thick fibrils and the typical diameter here we're talking about is about 17 nanometers the lignin content is 15 and the apparent molecular weight is a 9000. i want to just highlight that this molecular weight is an apparent molecular weight cannot be taken as an absolute value this is a challenge to measure but we can take it as on a relative basis when we look at the medium field size of course then we have a reduced field width and that means that the aspect ratio of the field resists increase so we have finer fields you can appreciate those in the fm on the left in the bottom as well as the plain view of the nano paper or film that is produced as well as the cross section and for the finest fibers of course then we have even further reduced diameter of the fibrils and more compact and densified paper the molecular weight as you can also see actually is changing and uh increases as we have uh finer fields so it's a very interesting proposition that there is also possibly here an effect of the topology of the lignin and the field that it is uh bound to in such a way there is a there is a correlation between female size and leaning concentration and molecular weight note that the linear concentration is evolving from 50 percent in the course fields down to uh 25 percent so there is a larger accumulation of the fevers in the finer fibers so it looks like residual lignin and the properties as far as the concentration on molecular weight tracks with the fibril size this is i think very important and allow us to think about engineering materials using different nanocelluloses containing lignin and those nanocelluloses can be used for many objectives and one example that we use was as a coating for paper in this particular case the lag ligno cellulose nanofibrils lcnf were used in social applications and provide really very nice uh improvement in different properties in the printed printing process and i don't want to discuss this in in going into more detail there is a a lot still to be discussed but it's here what i want to mention here just simply is that this offers an opportunity of course in coating and surface modification let me go back a little bit about the surface activity of lignin and let's think about acetylating the lignin molecule and here what we did was to acetylate the lignin to change the balance of hydrophobicity hydrophilicity of the molecule the lignin as a structure is a hydrophilic molecule we always say that lignin is hydrophobic yeah it is hydrophobic compared to or less hydrophilic compared to cellulose in the tree is a hydrophobic molecule but once it is separated it's a hydrophilic molecule that can be solubilized in water so for that reason we wanted to add some hydrophobe groups to the molecule and to look at the phase behavior of the lignin molecule the a technical ligand in this particular case and what you see in this slide on the right is a a water face in the bottom in the top face an oil and then you can visualize where the lignin is located because of the color and then you can imagine on the top that lignin is mainly in the water phase but as we increase in the particular case on the top uh the salt concentration the lignin is going to be pushed up to the oil phase so there is a transition from the water phase to the oil phase in the lignin and that points to the possibility of using lignin as a typical surfactant in emulsification processes and and that i think is very important because then of course one can think about the utilization of lignin in a diverse spectrum of emulsions so some time ago we look into lignin to produce a fuel emulsions in this particular case oil in water emulsions but keep in mind that a modified lignin the way i explained earlier can be also suitable for producing inverse emulsions that will be water in oil emulsions provided we hydrophobize the molecule anyhow these emotions are very interesting because in this particular case we were using uh bitumen as well as kerosene oils but in the case of bitumen oil the droplet size of the oil was reduced when the emulsification happened and that meant also the viscosity of the emulsion was reduced a sheer thinning emulsion was produced where you can observe on the right how the viscosity evolves with the shear rate and that speaks to the fact that very heavy crude oils can be emulsified producing an emulsion with a relatively low viscosity that allow us to pump to transport and to store those emulsions in the case of vitamin c oils in the case of kerosene jet fuels and diesels we did similar exercise to produce this type of oil in water emulsions and we subjected the emulsions to combustion in this particular case in a single cylinder aircool ignition system and we found several interesting points and one of those is that the combustion efficiency was improved and there was a reduction in nox and sox so it's a very practical application for lignin taking advantage of the surface activity now there is of course many more aspects of lignin that we need to consider based on the initial uh discussion that we have related to the chemical makeup of the lignin and the possible interactions of lignin within the lignin molecule and together with also other molecules and and that that applies to proteins that applies to carbohydrates and to metals and in all these cases there is a a really large number of possibilities for lignin to be used in for instance nano composites in hybrid materials and also for surface modifications and in my group we have a study lignin for those opportunities going in different scales from serial dimensions one dimensions filaments and fibers two dimensional materials as well as three dimensionals and i am not going to be able to talk about those of all of these so i will stay with the practical formation with lignin as an example of leaking self-assembly into particles or spheres or beads that are shown on the shown in the on the bottom left so this is something that is already known since quite a a long time lignin particle formation and there are basically two processes the wet process that has been proposed quite a long time uh using solvent solvent shifting or ph shift as well as the drive process that that we propose uh actually not too long ago to produce a spherical lignin particles in that process actually we follow a very simple scheme as you can see here we take a lignin solution that can be the black licor or or a lignin solution in general and we use an atomizer and a separator to produce the lignin particles you see those on the right where we inject the lignin solution together with a gas carrier in a heated tube that goes in a laminar flow system and because of the surface tension of lignin they tend to form droplets those droplets are dry and then eventually they become the bits that you see on the right in the sem and the tm images that you can appreciate the beauty of this process is that it's a green process doesn't require really solving if you use for instance black liquors or otherwise and the lignin molecule becoming a nanoparticle or a micro particle can exceed some properties that are boosted given the for instance antioxidant and jubilee protection possibilities as well as the anti-microbial and thermal stabilization of the lignin molecule when these particles are used in given application there is also of course other applications as a mechanical reinforcements in in composites as an emulsion establish a stabilizer in this particular case as a pickering emulsion stabilizer as a particular proteins so we'll talk a little bit about uh these aspects in in in this subject now keeping in mind that the costs are really competitive and here in the bottom you can read a little bit about those calculations that we have made for different types of lignin where the cross can be quite interesting one aspect of these lignin molecules and the way that we assemble the molecule into spheres or these particles is that depending on the lignin type that is not only the the plant species that are used to extract the lignin but the process itself whether it is craft sulfone sulfonate or alkali lignin or wet as well as acetylated lignin you can see the different morphologies but most importantly the surface energy that is going to be tuned depending on the process and that to me opens the possibility and there are not many like this opens the opportunity for using lignin picking lignin from the given process for a given degree of wetability and surface energy as is indicated here from high to low so pretty much a toolbox of lignin surface chemistries so more to this process that i indicated the aerosol flow system i want to indicate this is how it is it looks on a larger a little bit larger scale it's a very simple process and the particles that are obtained are very smooth and they are dry so this is quite important now if we use the uh a composition that allows for wrinkling to happen then it's also possible to create particles of lignin that are not as smooth but are wrinkled and these are the ones that are shown in the bottom now you can imagine how wrinkling can affect the interactions of the molecule or how the wrinkling can affect for instance uh the interaction forces the the or the role of the molecule or the in fact the beads in a composite material so opens many more opportunities if we think about the morphology on the surface of these particles and this is important because shape matters not only whether it's spherical or other shapes but also the surface corrugation that we have on the particle surface so we look at the lignin particles as far as the morphology and try to parameterize the morphology on the surface and for that we use a cryoelectron tomography and this is an example of the particles going from wrinkled to highly corrugated particles so they they can be fine-tuned and our interest was to look at this morphology of the particles identifying what we call reaches vertices as well as the reach and network and trying to compare how the interaction forces of these particles compare with those that are completely smooth so we look into this we calculated the energy as a function of a distance between a lignin particle and a negative charged surface and look at the energy barrier that you observe in the center depending on the lignin type and to make a story short uh in this diagram that you see on the right we have the energy barrier versus the distance of separation for the interactions to be measured and we have the case in the star of a smooth particle but also you can visualize here that depending where we sit if the particle the lignin particle is corrugated or wrinkled then we can also find a stronger or weaker interaction forces so it is just logical that the colloidal interactions between lignin mold and lignin beads or lignin particles with other particles or with surfaces can be fine-tuned by the surface corrugation of the material in another angle about the use of lignin particles i i want to bring up this uh early paper from old envelope in north carolina that talk about the use of lignin as an antibacterial material lignin itself is antibacterial but in this particular case the discussion they they follow was to infuse the lignin particle with silver ions and then they found a very interesting antibacterial effect that was uh even better than that of the silver saw metal silver particles so by a simple process of silver infusion in the organic particle then we obtain super strong antibacterial effects that's very important and finally as far as the interfacial activity um in the case of the emulsions earlier i indicated the case of uh molecular emulsions using uh lignin as a surface active molecule but in this particular case we look into picturing emulsions where the marshall's emotions are stabilized by the lignin particles not at the macromolecule dissolving water and when we have this type of particle stabilized emulsions as you may know then we can achieve a very stable emotions that can be used for many different purposes so this opens a lot of possibilities for this type of supra molecular assemblies based on lignin now i would like to look back into the coating and i think i have roughly a few minutes left but i want to to discuss very briefly about how can lignin be used in the case of coating surface coatings so if we take the same particles you notice that the particles of lignin that we're using in this case are very highly poly dispersed and we try to look how the lignin distribution will happen in a cross section when it is led to a for the water to evaporate the suspended medium to evaporate and for the lignin to produce a particulate coating the first thing to say is that depending on the drying rate we can follow the restructuring of the lignin across the film or the coating layer and that can be modeled rather easily and in this particular case you can appreciate here how the film thickness can or will depend on the drying temperature so we go from drying the coating at 20 degrees 110 degrees you can see by looking at the thickness of the coating that there is a densification at an intermediate temperature or drying rate and that's important because this opens also other possibilities thinking about lignin particles to be used in coating applications where we can control the density or the packing of the molecule and or sorry the the density of the particles and that also speaks to the fact that we can control the transport properties you can imagine here different transfer properties will depend on the drying rate that was used in the production of the protein those coatings of course can be further utilized and improved if we look into super hydrophobicization so in this particular case that you see here on the left we use a tile in uv click reaction to graph or to couple the lignin particles with tidal groups that then were functionalized with hydrocarbons to very easily produce very high quantal angular as you can see here on uh when we place a water on on the surface of the coated layer so here we have the case of self-cleaning materials that were produced by simple coating of these uh hydrophobic lignin particles with very little functionalization then one can achieve super hydrophobicity this particular case now let me bring nanocellulose back and here we have been looking into the same particles of lignin but combined in equal suspension with cellulose and one thing here that we have been claiming and is also being found by researchers around is the idea of nanocellulose acting as a binder or as adhesive and this is exactly what we found when we make cellulose nanofibrils with lignin particles in the bottom you can see the morphology of a social mixture and when we dry the material the water evaporation produces very high capillary forces and eventually leads to a membrane or a film that is very strong very cohesive and can show uh very interesting properties for instance in this particular case that mixture of cellulose nanofibrils with with the particles of lignin can be used for 3d printing or for creating membranes and those membranes in the cross section as shown in blue can be used for different properties uh radical scavenging uv shielding and also anti-fouling against proteins the concept can be expanded if we fabricate no coatings but supraparticles so we take the lignin particles and create bigger particles so for that reason we call them supraparticles particles of particles where the cellulose nanofibrils again acts as act as a glue in this particular case we have the situation where these supra particles can be loaded with given bioactive molecules or for instance in this particular case other nanoparticles that can be used for crop protection and fertilization and the conclusions here if you want to go to the literature you can find more details but the conclusion is really this is a great opportunity in this area where we want to have a targeted delivery of a given bioactive materials the beauty of of of this type of proposition of supra particles is that the cellulose and of fibres can manage to bind particles of different sizes so going from the left to the right we are changing the particle size from a small to bigger ones and still we can produce this type of supraparticles that are very highly cohesive and in the last example about this supraparticle uh assembly we use lignin together with the cellulose and fibres to create the supra particles that you see very clearly on the top and now we took an extra step and that was to carbonize the supraparticle and that allows us to keep the particle morphology as such and to produce particles that are relatively large that can be also put in a column so that we can for instance do things like co2 absorption with very high efficiency so in this particular case the concept of using particles of particles small lignin particles embedded in a larger particles by cellulose and others producing a system that can be packed in a column and by way of the size of the particles reducing the the drop pressure the drop the the pressure drop across the column so allow us to flow gas and to retain given selectively given gases in this particular case it was a co2 i think i'm running out of time but i want to use as a licensed slide to talk about the web method to nucleating lignin particles and very recent work that we polish this year shows how this can be done in the presence of cellulose and fibrils and chitina fibrils and you can find there some very interesting morphologies where the combination of females and lignin particles can be really exploited for a number of applications just to end i only talk about spherical particles but but there is still time in the future hopefully to talk about filaments based on lignin and carbon fibers two-dimensional structures as well as aerogels and foams based on lignin but that's a story for a next time i just want to leave the idea that lignin is an interesting macromolecule there are many opportunities for bio products that we can think about in this recent review we look into the economics and the scale of availability of different lignin types especially for instance graph lignin lignosulfonates and organos of lignin but especially compared to the future biorefinery ligaments where we think there is going to be a huge opportunity for lignin to create high value products like those that you see in this diagram not only from the point of view of energy and biofuels on the right but valorizing the lignin to the left when we think about emulsion stabilization uv protection proteins and composite materials so final thoughts in most cases as you could see from the mixture of lignin with cellulose there is a hint that cellulose containing lignins may show excellent or superior performance in many applications we don't need to have highly pure lignin also crude biorefinery lignins there are opportunities for bowel recession upgrading this can be full can be followed in green processes and cost-effective methods some of those methods are in the bottom purification of core fractionation functionalization and i just discussed today the manufacture of lignin micro nano particles with that i end i hope there is time for questions and it was my pleasure to share a little bit of my thinking about lignin thank you so much so thank you very much uh professor now we open up for questions uh so please if you have any

that i'd like to pass it over to dr bork first oh no we don't want to do that oh okay thank you caitlyn good afternoon everyone uh could you get caitlyn can you see my screen okay everything looks good yes we can perfect okay i just want to try to shuffle off is there a way i can minimize the size of the icon on the side um if you click the orange arrow it'll push it to the side perfect that's what i wanted thank you okay good afternoon everyone so uh my thanks to caitlin for the invite to come this afternoon so barack and i are going to be talking to you a little bit about rotational grazing and a study that's been going on well started in 2016 it's been running for five years it's just at the very tail end in which we are really trying to identify whether specialized rotational grazing systems and by that i mean these intensive adaptive multipatic there's many synonyms for it whether that actually impacts important ecosystem goods and services such as greenhouse gas uptake and also carbon storage but a whole host of other dynamics i want to recognize also that this is very much a team effort there are a lot of people involved in this a number of different postdocs and and primary scientists this project is actually led by mark boyce and so some of you may have seen portions of this before and hopefully you'll be able to extract something something new from it if if you have seen uh portions of it so just by way of introduction you know when we talk about ecosystem goods and services and we look back at the history of of grasslands you know the the contemporary ecosystem good and service is really forged production and therefore livestock production however more recently in the last 20 to 30 years we're starting to recognize that the ecosystem goods and services provided by these areas are much more diverse than that includes things like carbon storage uh pollination pollination services water storage flood mitigation water purification as well and and the provision of biodiversity and habitat for species at risk and also consumptive wildlife species so um the project the larger project is actually addressing a number of these different components today we're really going to talk only about carbon storage and greenhouse gas dynamics so we're only talking about a select portion of this larger project and the reason why this topic is so important is if you look at grasslands globally they are one of the largest uh habitat types that's out there representing you know over three billion hectares a very large portion of the earth's surface and in fact grasslands are the primary or predominant agricultural land that's used globally and if you look at it from a global kind of carbon stock storage perspective upwards of a third of the total terrestrial carbon stock is is found in these grasslands so there is potential to not only maintain and conserve that carbon but perhaps enhance it through the development of optimal management strategies and so what we're interested in understanding here is whether these specialized rotational systems can be used to increase carbon storage and increase greenhouse gas uptake and so i just want to spend a little bit of time reviewing some of the management effects uh and and there are hundreds of studies worldwide and so my objective here is not to go through them all but just to make sure that we're all thinking about the the critical role of both land use change but also grazing activities on soil organic carbon storage and of course associated greenhouse gas fluxes so here's what we do know if if you take these grassland systems these long-lived long-established perennial grassland systems and you convert them into annual cropland we lose a lot of carbon walter wilms who's a retired scientist from left bridge used to call it the furnace effect and i thought that was a very apt descriptor because really what we're doing is we're removing the insulating cover we're warming the soil and that coupled with greater oxygenation of the soil leads to much higher microbial breakdown of that carbon and we globally we lose anywhere from 30 up to 50 or 55 of the soil carbon so a very significant fraction of what's in the atmosphere right now in terms of elevated co2 we usually think of you know fossil fuel and fossil fuel burning but a portion of that upwards of 25 also is coming from land use change we need to be aware of that so there's very specific data from alberta for example that shows if you take those perennial systems you convert it to wheat cropping you lose up to 40 percent of the soil carbon if you take those same native grasslands and you plant them or or plow them down and seed them down to team forages so introduced forages it's not as bad as annual cropping but you still lose a certain amount of carbon presumably because those plants are putting more of their biomass above ground rather than below ground where we can access it for forage utilization there are also differences between native and introduced grassland um in terms of of of how that carbon is necessarily allocated and there's separate work that we've done for example looking at the the allocation of carbon within the mulch components the above ground litter components and and so on bottom line is these native grasslands store a very significant amount of soil carbon much more so than many of our agronomic systems whether they're uh planted domestic forages or whether they're annual crop areas we've also done some some very interesting work across a network of sites in alberta where we've compared the long-term presence versus exclusion of grazing and i know i've reported that here before within the same seminar series but i think it warrants repeating because our long-term data suggests that the continuing presence of grazing animals actually maintains or even increases soil carbon concentration by up to 12 percent and this is important because it means that we you know when we think about trying to at least maintain carbon storage within these grasslands grazing is a part of these systems these grasslands evolve with herbivory they're adapted to cope with herbivory and it's not that we need to remove herbivory in order to maximize carbon storage in fact if we remove grazing our data is showing that we actually lose carbon so an important piece of maintaining carbon storage is to keep grazing these these ecosystems however that has to be done at sustainable levels and we also published another paper this just came out last year and this data is from the province of saskatchewan looking at mixed grass prairie carbon storage values and what's unique about that we were able to link our soil organic carbon stocks to long-term cattle stocking rates and to our surprise we actually found that higher stocking rates led to a net increase in soil organic carbon storage particularly within the topsoil so the top 15 centimeters of what's really the humified or organic matter enriched layer and that signal was actually over and above any signature that we were detecting relative to climate itself because we know that more rainfall for example increases um plant growth and therefore carbon inputs into the system so all of this this preamble background is suggesting that grazing is a very important ecosystem process that's capable of maintaining and maybe even increasing carbon storage within these grasslands so that brings us to the current study the one that basically ran between 2016 and 2021 that's just wrapping up and in this study we basically tried to test questions around the effect of whatever you want to call it we called it adaptive multipatic grazing so amp grazing but there are many synonyms for this type of grazing some folks might refer to this as mob grazing planned grazing holistic grazing i've done work on it before calling it high intensity low frequency grazing where you come through with very high densities of animals for short periods uh regenerative grazing is another term that's now being used of which this type of grazing is an important process regardless of what you call it these are all specialized rotational grazing systems and of key importance is that they adaptively manage the animals to influence ecosystem processes and by that i mean we're trying to control the intensity of grazing in space and time we're trying to provide an adequate post-grazing recovery period to make sure that we have high rates of regrowth and that we maintain the vigor and productivity of the vegetation and we're doing that by essentially modifying livestock distribution and therefore their behavior so the diagram on the right here for example is an example of this so this might be conventional grazing or season long or continuous grazing where these animals have the ability to go wherever they want any time they want throughout the growing season and what that would do is create a very high level of patchiness in use so one strategy is to then subdivide that area into many more smaller paddocks and then to rotate through at higher densities among those paddocks now in this example there's only four paddocks that we've subdivided to but we could divide out into 20 paddocks or 40 paddocks or 60 paddocks and of course those are decisions that the individual producer makes based on what they feel is going to be the optimal strategy for both their animal management objectives and their their their forage management objectives so each individual grazing operation is really using their local knowledge and their experience to implement a given grazing system and so the reason why we're so interested in this is because we recognize that if there's going to be any type of offset payment down the road for carbon storage or reduced greenhouse gas footprints from agricultural activities including grazing that will require a mechanistic and therefore a predictive framework for linking the management actions that we conduct as landowners and managers to individual ecosystem goods and services in this case carbon storage and greenhouse gas fluxes now there's been lots of work that's been done on this in the past and one thing i just want to caution you on is that what's often done in those previous studies is those studies will compare what's called continuous grazing like we see on the left here what we're calling conventional grazing with a specialized form of grazing but it usually involves a binary comparison so you're either a season-long grazer or you're something else or you're a specialized for example holistic razor or amp grazer or something else and those binary comparisons i'm going to argue today are actually defeatist in what we're trying to do because they do not fully document the full range of variability among producers in terms of their behavior so that's going to be one of the the key outcomes and so what we did is we actually uh we conducted a comprehensive assessment where we started out by identifying amp producers we had as many as a hundred that had initially expressed in interest and then we whittled that down to basically 30 individual amp operators this was a randomly selected cohort from a larger group and they're distributed across alberta saskatchewan and manitoba and so that's one of the unique things about this study as well the sheer scope in terms of the the geophysical distribution of these sites was incredibly high and represented a very high range of not only climatic conditions so we had sites in the mixed grass prairie in the parkland in the boreal transition in the alberta foothills but covering a wide range of climate soil vegetation types and so on so that the logistics of collecting all this data was indeed quite daunting and for each one of these amp operators we identified a neighboring operator which i'm designating as namp so that's basically an across the fence line comparison and we had the caveat that those two paired ranches that we were going to compare had to be on the same soil polygon they were obviously within the same climatic unit uh climatic condition in order to facilitate the comparison we also initially at least wanted to have them similar in terms of cultivation history largely because going back to some of that preamble information i provided we know that cultivation history has a very profound impact on carbon storage okay okay so these are the overall study goals so this is across the entire aggp amp project so we basically set out with a whole suite of different questions we wanted to identify the land use history and the way that we did that is through landowner and operator surveys so we basically sent out a survey and where there were clarifications needed we followed up with them and the individual landowners were excellent providing us with really detailed feedback on how big their ranches were how they graze what's their pasture layout what's the sequence of grazing and so on we've also measured things like forged productivity root mass plant community richness so the number of different plant species the diversity and so on now within this particular um within this particular presentation we are going to be presenting on land use history uh we are also going to be presenting greenhouse gas data so this is particularly the co2 methane and nitrous oxide fluxes so barratt's going to be sharing information on that there's two different components there there's an incubation trial and also a field study that he will talk about and he will also review some of the soil carbon storage data which i think you'll find very useful we also have other data on soil microbial composition and enzyme activity we're not gonna oops i think i got a timer going or something there's also soil microbial composition and enzyme activity and also even bird diversity on a subset of these ranches and i also want to just point out that there's also water infiltration data and that's going to actually be reviewed on friday i believe at noon dr tim dauber is going to be presenting uh the results of the water infiltration work which i think you'll find of significant interest as well so i won't give the key result away uh and i'll let tim deal with that on on friday but if you're interested in that that's just a kind of a pitch so my the rest of my portion of the talk here is simply going to be characterizing these amp type operations and so some of the key management based questions that we asked are for example do amp operators so these are self-identified amp operators do they differ from their neighbors where you can think about the neighbors as this kind of random sample of conventional canadian beef producers so did they differ in land use history for example cultivation and and whether they were seeded and what they might have seeded on those properties do these ranches differ in size configuration so the number of paddocks the size of paddocks and then also how do these amp ranchers fundamentally differ from their neighbors in terms of specific grazing management practices and by that i'm talking about length of the grazing period versus the length of the individual rest periods and so i already mentioned that we have this this detailed management survey information and so now i'm going to share with you some of the the highlights that we identified from this so this is all the survey data basically amalgamated down so uh in hindsight when we looked at the what proportion of these ranches basically had a history of cultivation and just for clarity here all of these ranches had to be non-cultivated for at least the last 10 years so they couldn't have been cultivated in the last 10 years that was a minimum cut off that we had so they could have been called uncultivated for 30 years or 40 years or perpetuity and what we found is the majority of them had some history of cultivation so on average the amp 81 not sure why it's doing it sorry folks uh the amp ranches a little over 80 percent of those ranches actually were cultivated at some point in time in the past in contrast the namp so the neighbors were about 70 so a little bit lower the average time since planting 19 years so that basically means that there may be a legacy effect of of annual cropping at some point in time but it's actually been a significant period of time pushing two decades on most of the ranches the other thing is we did ask individual producers about if they knew the seeding history and it all of the cultivated fields had pretty much been seeded i think it was only one exception of the fields that have been seeded we asked producers what what was the dominant species that were seeded and not surprisingly alfalfa range you know was a common species seeded 80 to 90 percent and almost you know 90 to 100 percent indicated that they put in some type of legume which is not surprising the two things i want to draw your attention to are over here on the right side i thought it was very interesting that the amp producers were more likely to have seated with native species now native forage species are generally more expensive they're harder to obtain but they also may have benefits such as enhanced drug tolerance and drought adaptation so i thought it was intriguing that almost 20 percent of amp producers had included at least some kind of native plant within their mix that wasn't the case for the neighbors and another thing is that if we look at the complexity of the mixtures that amp producers were generally more likely about twice as likely to utilize a seed mixture that actually was much more diverse so five species or more so this might be a risk adaptation strategy trying to see more species in order to make sure that there's going to be something that's going to establish and be able to survive under the conditions whether it's dealing with salinity or drought or whatever it is over time so i thought that was an interesting side outcome certainly was not a planned objective but it was a nice bonus to come across okay i want to talk a little bit of now about the ranch physical attributes so again remember that we screened for the amp and then we looked at whatever the neighboring property was so we didn't screen out the neighbors based on size or anything like that but when we looked at the size of the land areas that were either under amp management or the neighboring so conventional management the amp operators were much larger in size much much larger and not surprisingly of course they supported that larger land base supported a larger total herd size so that raises a really intriguing question uh are amp iran is their amp ranching method more likely to happen or take place on lands that are larger in other words do larger land bases are they more conducive to supporting these more complex rotational systems i think it's an interesting question that probably needs some more follow-up another question that we asked is what's the configuration of these pastures and so we had data on the number of pastures and the individual pasture sizes and so as you would expect the amp ranches had a very large number of pastures per operation just over 60 in fact that's a mean number as compared to the non-amp that had um you know typically somewhere around less than five four or five on average across all of the conventional producers and of course the pasture sizes are the exact opposite if you have a lot of pastures you're going to have much smaller pastures the mean pasture size was somewhere around 20 hectares for the amp whereas the neighboring operators were much larger than that pushing 120 hectares so you can see the physical layout is very different among these operations and of course that translates into their management philosophy okay we also ask questions about you know when the animals went in what kind of animals went in yearlings cow calf start of the grazing season end of the grazing sea we were able to use all that information to compute out both a mean stock density so you can think about this metric as a herd effect or a stock density effect and then we also computed an actual stocking rate which takes into account the length of time that these areas are being grazed for what's really conspicuous here is that there is no difference in the mean stalking rate between amp and the neighbors yeah there's a bit of a trend uh for the amp to be slightly higher but it's really not significant the p value tells us that statistically there's no difference between the two what is very different is the mean stock density so the amp producers by having this framework of a very large number of pastures that are much smaller in size were able to maintain a much much higher stock density and so you know those of you that are familiar with regenerative grazing or holistic grazing you're very familiar with stock density or herd effect and this is what's generally creating that effect however this effect at least based on dark data is happening irrespective of stocking rates which are actually quite similar between the two operations we also looked at the kind of temporal allocation of forage use the start of the grazing season was generally earlier on the amp ranches around april 25th as opposed to may 17th so amp producers are able to stretch out their their grazing season starting earlier and they had a much longer total grazing season length averaging around just over seven months as a pair up opposed to about four and a half months so you can see that there are differences manifesting spatially and also temporally in what these producers are doing the last thing i want to share with you is really the length of the early season grazing and the subsequent rest period so we were very explicit with our questions we asked producers during the early part of the growing season which is generally up to about the end of july so prior to august 1st what's the maximum length of time that you will allow your animals into any given paddock and so and when we asked them that and we developed this frequency histogram what stands out very quickly is that amp producers inevitably were striving for less than eight days and quite often less than four days in fact most of them were three days or less so they were striving for a really short initial grazing period whereas the non-amp producers had this much higher length of early season grazing and some of them the continuous grazers were obviously several months long the corollary is also true that when we looked at the rest period you get the opposite pattern the amp producers generally had at least 20 days of rest and in fact most of them had 60 days of rest before coming back into that individual paddock to re-graze the neighboring producers were exactly the opposite now some of them were all over the place but the majority of them the single largest group basically had this minimum rest period that was quite short and and of course that would be our continuous grazers so what we did is we actually combined those two pieces of information the length of the early season grazing period with the the minimum length of rest prior to re-grazing and we were able to develop arrested grazing ratio so this you can think of this as a metric of grazing adaptation so it's the the number of days of rest per active or per day of grazing during the early growing season and when you compute this out you can see that there's really strong separation between the essentially the amp producers that always had an rgr greater than six as opposed to the neighboring operations that were almost always below six so and the reason we're interested in this we're looking for a combined metric to represent this producer behavior of trying to manipulate the spatial pattern and temporal pattern of grazing okay the last slide i have before i turn it over to barat in reality all of these ranchers all 60 of them form a continuum and so i started out earlier making the point that many of the previous research projects are binary they compare amp to non-amp or they compare holistic to non-holistic or they compare continuous to everyone else but that's a dangerous approach in my opinion and here's why this output here is called an ordination and what it does is it looks at the variance in this case in producer behavior so the metrics that producers are using in order to basically categorize or describe their their own grazing operations and when you look at this you can see that the amp operators are basically uh let me just get this right so the non-amp operators are all kind of clustered off to the left side and if we had this really nice clean binary separation we should get one grouping here and we should get another grouping over here you can see the amp and the non-ap but that doesn't happen what you see instead is that there's a continuous gradient of these ranches spread out across this wide gradient which includes metrics like cattle stocking density the rest of grazing ratio the start of the grazing season the stocking rate the number of pastures all these different metrics and so the way i like to describe it is in alberta for example we have 20 000 beef operators their their grazing systems represent 20 000 different grazing systems so to try to condense that all down into binary classes or three or four classes to me is probably not the best way to try to understand what these producers are doing or what impact it's having on the landscape so i i'm very much a fan of avoiding these simple categorical groupings because i don't think they're representative of the real world and instead we should be using these specific grazing metrics that truly represent the behavior of individual ranchers and of course what they're trying to achieve with their animals on their landscape okay so with that caitlyn i'm going to turn it back to you and you can flip it over to bharat and he's going to go through the greenhouse gases and soil carbon okay caitlin can you see my screen yes we can uh which one is um we can see the one with the pink flower i have second screen how to show that okay um do you want to bring your your uh presentation up this is in my second screen yeah we can see your mouse there now okay perfect yeah good to go okay thank you thank you uh kathleen and dr work for covering most of the things so i'll be uh talking much more about the greenhouse gas and soil organic carbon especially the uh ah layer so there are two components in this uh in this component of the project first one is uh incubation study that we did with the soils removed from the uh 11 pair of ranches in alberta so greenhouse gas history was conducted in alberta only not manitoba and saskatchewan so this study addressed the following core question one was uh are the grasslands subject to adaptive multiplayer grazing superior to conventional grazing in terms of greenhouse gas emission or reduction and the dew grazing system altered the sensitivity of grassland greenhouse gas fluxes to change in soil temperature and moisture and what are the linkages between grazing region regime temperature and moisture resulting on resulting greenhouse gas flux is mediated by soil microbes and enzyme activities then how it does in terms of the greenhouse gas emission incubation study compared to the field greenhouse gas emission and final question was to how do amp grazing affect soil organic carbon so we did experiment two experimental approach for greenhouse gas monitoring first was incubation trial we use files removed from field and brought in for incubation of course it has many benefits also it has drawbacks first benefit was it removes all the externalities including greenhouse gases in the field and isolate microbially induced response to temperature and moisture but it is drawback that it is not real representative of the actual field condition then field trial or in situ measurement of greenhouse gases throughout the growing season we measured uh continuously three year three growing season from 2017 to 2019 uh it represents the real world scenario and direct link to greenhouse gas dynamics but drawback is we were just measuring in in six points in each range and combined with high spatial variability which may lower statistical power or detection of the effects might be difficult so what we did in the incubation study was we collected soil from 11 pair of amp graze grassland and neighboring grassland uh across our climatic gradient in alberta we did 102-day lab incubation experimented two temperatures five degrees centigrade and 25 degrees centigrade and three moisture level at permanent increasing point 47 40 percent of the field capacity and at field capacity and to see the direct effect on indirect effects so we uh measure the if use the structural equation model so that use data isolates what are the direct effects on final greenhouse gas fluxes and indirect effect on biological soil biological parameters like microbial and chemical parameters microbial biomass microbial by biomass nitrogen and available nitrogen and we also measured the enzymes carbon cycling enzymes responsible for uh carbon emission like xylite beta glucosidase cellulose and then nitrogen cycling and acetyl beta glucositis so from this uh temperature and moisture sensitivity analysis what we found was the effect of temperature like at the low temperature at five degrees centigrade and grazing gray soil was emitting slightly higher it was uh 70 percent higher carbon dioxide than none and neighboring ranch but at higher temperature it was producing less carbon dioxide compared to the neighboring grants n2o didn't vary uh by grazing type but of course it was increased with the temperature and here interesting is that methane consumption was always higher even in low temperature and in high temperature so it was removing methane from the atmosphere and consumed in the soil in moisture also like increasing with the moisture it was increasing carbon dioxide released from the soil and similar was the nitrous oxide but they were not different by grazing type there are they were almost similar in methane a story was also similar with increase in moisture and then image the uptake of the methane was higher at the input the increase in moisture level so structural equation model uh we did for three selected days first day of the incubation uh and then day 13 and last day of the incubation and with the different uh determining factor so if you see grazing they don't have direct effect on carbon dioxide in all three days microbial biomass seems the main driver in all days and on and then moisture was also effective from the day one but temperature was not effect affecting any in microbial biomass but in day 13 it was affecting but in a hundred and today the effect of temperature on microbial biomass was not direct either and in for nitrous oxide so effect of temperature and moisture was the uh as usual it was clear in day one but in day 13 the moisture effect was not direct but the grazing was affecting the nitrogen cycling back enzyme and then its effect was uh seen and their 100 to all effect was not that much direct for nitrous oxide but in terms in methane here is the interesting story that all grazing has effect from day one and day 13 but on day four one day two last day effect was not direct but indirectly microbial biomass was playing the role in methane consumption as well so here this red arrow means higher higher consumption and then thickness also represents the different and this green arrow means positive relation and microbial biomass was the determining factor and then in the day 13 we can see all those kind of effect played by the microbial biomass so in the field as i mentioned earlier that we went to uh alberta only 12 pairs of ranches were sampled in all growing season from 2017 to 2019 in 2017 we could not cover whole growing season because the experimental setup took a lot of time and we were able to measure field emissions only after the middle of august and we use drag dark chamber method and six random sampling points were chosen to sample greenhouse gas emissions and we also collected soil cores up to one meter depth 15 soil cores from its range in 2017 in alberta sites in i believe in saskatchewan and manitoba it was collected in 2018. so uh dr j langman is a has been working on this field gsd data uh so what we found that soil temperature and moisture also very during the growing season and carbon dioxide also if it follows similar trend and but you see methane consumption was in all three years they were consumed in soil but of course there was a lot of variability in 2017 2018 and 2019. nitrous oxide they do not also differ that much between the grazing system and they vary like their variation was also quite strong so there was no main effect of raising treatment in on any field greenhouse gas flux but we also tried to see the effect of stocking rate and carbon dioxide flux and this shows that in the moist soil there is direct effect of increasing the stocking rate carbon dioxide flux from soil will be increased but with the magic and moist side side it was not that much direct link and in terms of carbon dioxide methane we tried to see the relationship between cultivation history soil moisture and bulk density and it shows that if it was cultivated cultivation history was there it has the higher level of methane consumption as well and uh soil moisture of course it was determining the field emission of uh pill flux of the methane it is all please note that all these negative numbers shows the image not emission about the consumption of carbon dioxide emitting from the atmosphere by the soil microbes and bulk density it is quite interesting also higher the bulk density consumption was uh low like consumption was a lower like this bigger number if we plot positively so this will go down so higher the bulk density then methane consumption is lower so this uh is soil organic carbon in as layer lyo sabrina is doing a master stasis on this uh soil data and he shared this uh as layer data in this presentation and it shows soil mass uh specifically topsoil earth layer uh increased with the combined effect of elevated cattle stocking rates applied to the pasture having a longer rest period after early season early season grain grazing so that this is three-way graph and then as layer there are you can see there are interaction effect of stacking rate and risk to great grades ratio also and in the right hand side stocking rate and also raised to grades and then this is soil organic carbon mass ton per hectare so similar trend similar to as layer depth so stocking rate higher the stacking rate so as layer depth is also increase and so does with the soil organic carbon mass so from this study what we found uh was the soil ghg fluxes did not differ between grassland subject to amp or conventional grazing but instead were regulated by management and environmental factors including catalyst talking rate cultivation history soil moisture and bulk density seasonal mean carbon dioxide emission increase with cattle stacking rate but only in moist grassland seasonal mean methane uptake was higher in grassland never cultivated and amp grazed soil had lower methane emission in at high temperature so amp grazed grassland had greater carbon sequestration in the stop soil carbon sequestration improved specifically from the combination of increasing catalyst taking rates plus longer rest after grazing so with this i would like to acknowledge all co-authors afc's agb program applied ecological service as a aes service usa and participating ranchers in manitoba saskatchewan alberta bunch of people who were involved in this project i don't know i may have missed some names here and we got wonderful help from uh voice lab staff as well and i would like to acknowledge all of them thank you and if you have any questions we'll be more than happy to answer thank you both very much for the very interesting presentation um it's very timely and relevant to to all of the issues that we're experiencing on the prairies today there's a number of questions that have come in um so whoever feels most comfortable answering go for it i guess the first one is from a listener named patrick and he says it looks like only two sides were in the mixed grass prairie was there a reason for the low sample compared to fescue grassland sites does amp grazing seem less feasible or at least less common on the lower productivity grasslands yeah i i i'm happy to take that one so i think that's a really that's a really good point so the study was not designed to deliberately stratify and have an equal sample size among all the different natural sub-regions had we done that we would have gone about it very differently we would have said okay we want 10 in the mixed grass prairie we want 10 in the parkland we want 10 in the portal transition we did not do that we did debate that for a while um but then we were worried about several things first of all we were worried about maybe that we weren't going to get enough amp producers the the way the study was designed is we went out and recruited producers from different workshops and advertised the study and then they came to us so does the under representation of the mixed grass prairie mean that amp is less utilized out there that might well be the case so if you think about it you know because it's a more arid environment there's a shorter kind of active growing season that it might be less feasible to use this kind of amp-style system over a six-month period that's possible i can't say that for sure but what was very clear is that among the people that stepped forward expressing an interest and we had about 100 initially the vast majority by far were within the high rainfall environments of the parkland you know northern fescue parkland and then the boreal transition and that was true in manitoba saskatchewan alberta we only had a handful uh from the mixed grass prairie and in fact i think we only had two and we took them both because we were so you know we were trying to get representation but without going out and deliberately pounding the pavement to recruit those people and so i i i i want to be very clear that we weren't we do have a big agroclimatic gradient that we can test but it's clear that we have under representation within the mixed grass prairie we're very very aware of that one other limitation and you know when you think about this the the non-amp are assumed to be representative of kind of a random grab bag of the of the beef producers in western canada which is fine except that they're looking at an amp operator across the fence line and so there is a chance albeit fairly small that they may be influenced by what they're seeing by their neighbor on the other side of the fence line so i think the risk is pretty small but we had to basically keep the sampling on the same soil polygon and so we couldn't escape that potential bias albeit i think it's small thanks for that answer um the next question is from a listener named hillary uh was there any differentiation between percent cultivation being used for annual crop production versus rejuvenating old perennial stands well we don't have data on that so as i said in the methods one of the caveats was that all of the land bases that we looked at had to be non-cultivated for at least 10 years so that none of these none of the immediate areas that were sampled were actually undergoing cultivation now or even in the last 10 years and in fact you look at the mean dates since cultivation it was 19 and a half years so by and large these were all long-term perennial systems that i mean it does raise it's a good question in that could there be long-term legacy effects that could have gone on 30 years ago 20 years ago 40 years ago it's possible but we cannot rule that out this study was very different because we actually worked with cattle producers that are actively managing their their their herds and their and their pastures which is very different than most other studies where they're done on a research station where you set up these controlled manipulative designs but then there's no flexibility and adaptation built in and that's the inevitable criticism that's levied at most of those studies that they have basically removed the adaptation and so here we did the opposite approach we went and worked with producers and then tried to extract the management information under the scout's honor you know hope that that information is going to be robust on cross-examination and sufficiently accurate to pull out patterns and the answer is it is pulling out patterns because as you'll see on friday and as you saw in the data that bharat presented from from lao sabrino's master's work which is under development there is a carbon response to this interaction of stocking rate with rgr you'll hear from tim on friday he'll talk about these same metrics and we are seeing signals so there is value in going that approach but the logistics are a challenge just to give you an idea how big this project was um i i think the round trip and i you know if jessica's on she could correct me but i think a round trip to all the ranches to sample was something like 6 thousand kilometers wow wow um a listener named barry is wondering when you screened branches for the study and presumably field within ranches for cultivation history did you also screen for winter feeding on pasture we did um okay so now i'm gonna take that in two in two kind of slices so we had to have at least a portion of the ranch that was free of bale bale feeding so in situ bale feeding and the reason for that is because we absolutely wanted to make sure we had a representative area in order to do the carbon stock assessment and the greenhouse gas flux assessment without this this input of carbon because i can tell you that if you go in and you bale feed year after year after year that's a huge addition of carbon so of course you're going to build carbon that's not the objective of our study our objective was not to determine whether bail addition increases carbon i can tell you that you know without even doing it the question is whether the pattern of grazing as influenced by the these different rotational systems influence carbon so in our screening we had we did ask the question to make sure there was an area that was free of bale grazing now some of the producers and i actually have a manuscript it's on the management differentiation among these different ranches some of these ranchers admitted that they had bale grapes but not on the area we were working on so there might have been a third of the ranch or something like that where bale grazing was going on so it won't interfere with our ability to test the biophysical and the ecological responses that you know the the root biomass and the plant diversity all those kinds of things but we we are well aware that that was going on on some of these ranches that could also account for that tiny bump even though it was non-significant in the aggregate stocking rate it's possible okay thanks for that answer um murray is wondering do you have the tons of carbon hectare sequestered in a horizon and b horizon and c horizon and any measurement of carbon loss tons per hectare and a horizon a soil dries out regardless of grazing you want to take that barrage yeah i can check that uh uh lyo is working on that mineral layer data we have uh estimated uh that carbon mass in layer wise like we divided soil by organic layer and mineral air in organic layer is called ash layer so that slide i presented was for the earth layer so soil organic mass if i see this one here it goes from all the way 20 ton per hectare to 140 ton per hectare depending on um different step stocking rate and there is an interesting is i said rest to graze ratio and also the stocking rate so there is interaction effect so it goes all the way from 20 to 140 more than that so yeah layer data still we are working on so lio is working on that data yeah and i can answer that question from another project as well because we the one that i referenced where we looked at the over 100 grasslands in alberta the the carbon stocks are quite astounding and in that study we only sampled to 30 centimeters but we also looked at the overlying mulch layer which is like the various decomposing layers of litter on the very surface of the mineral soil and when we added it all up the the dry mixed grass for example was around 55 to 60 tons per hectare of carbon when you get into those those uh much more music moist grasslands of the northern parkland or even the foothills of alberta we were pushing up to 150 160 and even 180 tons per hectare of carbon and that's excluding the deep carbon that's not including anything below 30 centimeters so that's an underestimate of the aggregate carbon storage they store a lot of carbon wow wow um a listener named daniel's asking uh he says i see that car co2 emissions increased on amp ranches on moist grasslands was this due to the possible higher evapotranspiration on moist grasslands versus drier grasslands that can be the region like evapotranspiration but we didn't measure that parameter so i think that is the good point to use in in further analysis also yeah evapotranspiration plays a greater role although we measure the soil temperature and moisture during the measurement of greenhouse gas and i saw that one slide it shows the relationship directly to moisture level as well and similar in information we found in incubation study so we if we increase the soil moisture level so carbon dioxide or methane consumption both increase thank you um and then back to the other question um lyo has actually typed in lio here responding to the question asked abroad and ed uh yes we did have the carbon data from the ah layer 0 to 30 centimeters 36 centimeters and 60 to 100 centimeters from a to b to c horizon so thanks lyo for chiming in there um i know we're tight on time so um i'll just ask one more question if that's okay jennifer asks what can we tell producers in the boreal transition that are already managing amp and have been for many years is there opportunity for further studies maybe it will happen no go go ahead that gives me a chance to think about it some more well we are thinking about like developing projects uh for this uh peace reason uh in the future as well but i i think uh also erdogan has some projects line up i don't know if he has considered the real reason also think yeah so i i think there are very encouraging signs here that the the the boreal transition is this interesting one because they're grey-wooded soils they're often on the lower fertility side so obviously building up remember that all the carbon input has to come through plant growth so if you don't have a really productive plant stand you're not going to be fixing more carbon you're not going to be putting inputs into the system so then the question is how do you get as much plant input into the system and how do you get that translated into a stable uh carbon pool that's at or below the soil surface and and that's where you know i guess uh obviously we're finding you know significant potential benefits of of maybe employing at least some of these rotational systems to boost plant productivity you know i don't know whether jessica is listening in today but jessica granke her phd project is quantifying the plant biomass and root mass and so there are for example there are net increases in plant biomass associated with the amp type grazing system and so that's the vector for the carbon inputs so that's a good sign so if you can fix more carbon and if that works its way into the ground coupled with things like reduced methane losses or increased methane uptake and i just want to reiterate that those negative values that barack was showing for example on the on the uh on the incubation data are incredibly important because an uptake means that the microbes in the soil are removing methane from the atmosphere that's a good thing because it means they're helping counteract in fact i did a few years ago a back of the envelope calculation because someone asked me well how much methane can these microbes remove and can it offset what ruminants produce what cattle produce and my back of the envelope calculation said they can't they can't replace all of it they can't reduce all of it but they can reduce maybe up to 25 that's a pretty good news story so and yet not a whole lot of people i know about it um i'll just finish up on this question with this so there's a long-term study area south east southwest of edmonton called the breton plots and it is a series of plots looking at enhancing the fertility and sustainability of gray wooded soils and there are 40 year-long crop rotations of perennial forage um long-term crop rotation including three out of eight year forage two out of five year forage and what we are now doing we actually got funding to start a project looking at soil health and looking at carbon storage and looking at the relative contribution of the forge component within there and helping build carbon and change carbon cycling dynamics so hopefully when we have that we will have more insight to go back to was it patrick or daniel daniel and and hopefully tell daniel with more specific ways in which he can capture more carbon and the interesting thing about gray wooded soils is because they're starting out at a lower equilibrium there's potential to build a lot more soil carbon then the fight will be on and how do we make sure those producers get paid for it right awesome i just want to mention that jessica grenke did a webinar for us um in the past camera was a year or two ago now but um it's available on the pcapp youtube channel um so i guess that's all the time that we have for today so i just want to thank you both so much for the awesome presentation we had a great turnout today and um i think everyone's gonna go home and think about this and yeah it's really amazing the research that you're doing so thank you for taking the time to share it with us today okay thank you so if there are any questions we could not uh answer if they're due to time you can email to us and we'll try to reach out to them with the answer perfect perfect that would be great um to all of our listeners out there thank you so much for catching today's webinar we have two more going on this week as part of prairie's got the goods week please check out the pcapp website to register uh this webinar has been recorded and will be uploaded to youtube in the near future and when you leave uh today's um webinar there will be a quick one minute survey that will pop up if you don't mind feeling it that we really appreciate it and keeps us going on uh with our webinars in the future so with that thank you so much everyone and have a great rest of your day thank you thank you bye", "4N2ujDuuUlE": "all of them oh not not just you know necessarily people who you aspire to be but even your peers sometimes they need to be doing great things um and you can learn a lot from literally anybody welcome back to have a map where we talk all things career i'm your host mamadou and jai skurskir um back in the flesh i'm excited because i feel like we haven't done a podcast episode for like two months it's crazy um but we have a guest i'm excited to introduce our guest but before before we go there i want to introduce my co-host aaliyah can you say what's up introduce yourself to the people real quick okay hi my name is aleah kane um i am an intern in the i o department um just like hr kind of um i'm from like small town marlton arkansas and i go to school at hendricks college hendrix that's what's that raphael said okay that's lit that's lit i love it so coming to our host we have uh or our guest for today we have martine balcazar um soon to be mrs obang hmm there we go there we go martine how are you doing can you introduce yourself real quick yes so i'm martin balthazar for now um i am originally from right outside of chicago evanston illinois which quick detour is the first city to actually pass a bill on trying to give reparations back to the black community so shout out to them um so i am currently in hr manager for the frito-lay division of pepsico i've been with the organization for six years which is crazy to say um and i'm really excited to talk to you guys this is exciting wow look at that gave you all some some good insight today i'm geek this is good uh yes and we're excited to have you so as we just you know jump right into it what exactly does your title mean right what does that role mean because you know a lot of students and and for this for understanding of our podcast right have a map is all about finding directions so you know you might see a title but i don't know what you do on a day-to-day basis so can you tell us a little bit about what does that look like for you yeah so um i well for most of my career because i just got into a more specialized project role a few months back but for most of my career i've been what um many people call a generalist so i have focused a lot on literally everything um so from the day-to-day of employee relations so think if an employee has an issue with their manager an employee is beefing with their co-worker and they don't want to work next to them anymore they come to hr um also a lot of change projects to make sure that the organization is being as efficient as as possible and with any change project making sure that we're looking at the people side and the people impacts correctly and then lastly what i actually enjoyed the most which was actually career development so with the managers i was supporting making sure that there was a plan for their career and that we were also focusing on that and getting out of the day-to-day business as well wow you do so much you do so much it's a lot it's it's a lot and hr usually doesn't get a lot of thank you so we are looked at as sometimes the feds of the organization um but you know we serve a purpose um and even though it's a lie it can also be really rewarding as well yeah and especially in that like recruitment space i feel like is super important um and especially all the things that are going with diversity and things of that nature right now so i definitely get that okay can you tell me a little bit more about how you got into that position because pepsi is like a name brand and that's super awesome so in my mind i'm like oh my gosh wow you're a superstar so can you tell me like how you even got there yeah so um it's an interesting journey i don't think well not many people that i know anyway uh grow up saying that they want to be an hr manager or they want to be in hr um i always knew i wanted well what i wanted to do originally was be a um like i want to work with kids and possibly be a pediatrician but then i got into school and i took maybe i don't even think it was chem 101 i think was chem 100 and i was like no that is not for me no science none of that uh so i was a psychology major and then as i was getting closer to senior year i was like i don't know what i want to do i know if i graduate with my psych major i'm not going to be able to make the money to support myself that i necessarily would like um so i started thinking about grad school but then with that i wasn't sure what i wanted to do grad school but i think i took maybe an io class i was like okay um you know at the end of the day most people spend the most time at work they spend more time you know in the workplace than they do uh at home so maybe i can do something to make sure that the work environment is as optimal as possible because thinking back to when i was in high school i've worked since like 16 17 and my first job was in a department store and when i tell you those ladies were miserable like they were like my manager doesn't listen to me doing this this this or that so um all that to say like senior year i was like okay let me look into io but then when i did my research enough so i saw that you know a lot of people have to get their phd i knew i could not spend that much time in school just because i would probably go crazy so my sister told me about this program at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign which was centered around hr so i looked into it great program top ranked and most importantly they had a good placement of jobs after graduating uh so i was like okay let me try it to the gre got into the program um and then from there interned with pepsi and then went on full time wow that's awesome thank you thank you yeah and just thinking about that i want to break that down for our listeners right you face adversity as a lot of us do when you graduate and you're trying to figure out what works well right you understood you know for yourself i wanted to live this type of lifestyle so how can that reflect how you want to live a certain type of lifestyle but you also want to help people so how do those two things come together found a program that spoke to that and then you also understood that that program was a pipeline to get job placement at the same time which a lot of us don't really see or try to accomplish which is so important because there's a lot of those programs out there we just got to do the research and i think that is something that one is a lot to process and think about and most of us are not thinking in that space so how do you even get your your mindset to even start to think in that manner because it's very methodical very thought out very focused um so i will say that i had a lot of help a lot of hand-holding along the way um like most people who look like us um you know i didn't necessarily come from a family that i could lean on for um like seeing the image of what i necessarily wanted to be because first generation mo you already know this um and uh you know my mom came to this country just really working hard and um you know day to day was a struggle so all that to say i am very lucky because i have an older sister um who has kind of paved the way for me um and she already knew a lot about the program she already knew a lot about master's programs in general and the fact that you know a lot of many people may go into a master's program but they still won't come out with a job so she told me if you're going to go into a program make sure you research not just the program itself but who is what companies are coming to that program and talking to students like what access do you have um what clubs can you join how do who how are you actually going to network in order to grow past just that degree so i was very very lucky to have her um to help me think through that because to your point i wasn't when i was researching for programs i was just like i need something to do um once i graduate use your resources that's what martine is telling you use your resources yes okay i actually have a question and you kind of touched on it a little bit but i was wondering if you could talk more about um kind of how you like put yourself into like a situation and frame like um being confident as a black woman and like you know kind of like uh not i guess a position where like you kind of may feel um out of place maybe because i feel like that's kind of like my concern going into the professional environment yeah that's that's an everyday struggle um i i haven't necessarily mastered that i am very much in introverts um i i like to be in my corner i don't necessarily need all of the people interaction and i hate getting in front of crowds um so even when i tell my friends what i do they're like not the martine i know um so i mean what i've learned is that you grow as when you are in uncomfortable positions um and you know you're never necessarily going to grow if you're feeling comfortable right so my first role uh was actually in maryland and i never thought i was going to leave chicago i always dreamed of staying in that beautiful city um but um being forced outside of my comfort zone um that's when i was probably a year into my role and i was like i looked back at the martine that had just moved from chicago and i literally could not understand who i was anymore um because of everything that i had to um do within that year time frame so i don't know if there is necessarily a good way to answer that but all of the growth comes in those times where you are uncomfortable um and even like in my last role where i had to get in front of shifts of people um probably 150 at a time five times a week um and talk um you know it i don't know you just it comes with time um and you have to know how to give yourself that grace to grow because you're not always going to get it right the first time but the more you do it the longer you do it the more comfortable you become that's really good advice and that's helpful because i'm also really introverted even though i want to go into hr which is a people feel so like seeing other people that kind of you know have the same feelings as me is really nice um i also had another question about what does work look like for you um like pre-covered and now like we're still in the middle of a pandemic basically so how is has that changed i think it'd be easier for me to kind of explain what the day-to-day of a hr manager in frito looks like um so most people come in like me as a generalist they either go into what we call a plant so the buildings that actually produce your cheetos fritos doritos etc or they'll go onto the sales side of the organization supporting the people that put the chips on the shelves so if you ever see those uh pepsi or those frito like box trucks um they are going to your walmarts your targets your uh gas stations and playing those chips on the shelves um so if you're in a plant um like i said before you're usually doing a lot of employee relations stuff so all the drama right um they come into your office they're talking to you managers are coming in saying person a did this and i want to write them up or i want to fire them um so uh life was just a whole hodgepodge of everything i could probably have a huge to-do list and it i wouldn't get anything done because somebody came into my office and was crying you know you're walking them through anything um life postcode or i guess during covid um was really hard because um you know a lot of the coveted um responsibilities fell on hr and it became a um you know can this person come into the the building what procedures do we have to put in place in order to make sure that we are protecting all of these front line workers that have to work every day what is the policy of somebody who's lying about being sick because they posted a picture and they're at the beach even though they're saying that they have a 106 degree fever um so a lot of it was making sure that we are still able to run the business um but still keeping our people safe and i will not lie to you i literally became a doctor in the course of one day um so it was a it's been a very interesting dynamic to kind of work through but also like i said at the beginning it is rewarding um scary but rewarding because at the end of the day you are keeping people safe even though your business partners are telling you that they can work and i know i just said a lot so i don't know if that answered your question that was awesome i'm curious this is off of our topic but what type of innovation do you start to think will happen because of cobit right what is what is for you what do you think post covert looks like in the space of employee company relations um it's a hard question because i think it'll be very two-part um like for your front-line workers um that are you know don't have a choice of working at home who have to come in i don't know if there's going to be that much of a change because even in where we are right now it looks very similar outside of mass and trying to stay apart um in terms of like you know your exempt employees who mostly can work from home um i don't know it's i think organizations are figuring out that you know we don't have to get in person of course to do anything um so what are you gonna do with the building spaces that we're paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in rent for every month i i don't think that they're necessarily gonna exist i think they're gonna be more of a hey if we need to collaborate and you know think through a special project maybe we can get together um i think it's i think the way we work and interact is gonna look very different even after covet yeah that's so interesting are you mostly um working from home or are you like actually in the office so in the world that i was just in i was the hr manager for our plant in orlando florida um and i was going in every day and i probably didn't have to but i didn't feel right about supporting a group that was going in every day um so i felt that i needed to be there for my people um in my role today which is more headquarters focused um i am working from home okay do you still deal with a lot of people um because i just want to know like like um what conflict resolution looks like over i guess like a zoom meeting um i think it looks the same as it would if you were in a like a room um it's just now you're talking to boxes over um a computer um i i don't necessarily think it's that different though uh depending on what the issue is um and i can walk you through something that could happen with me so we have a um it's called our speak up line so if a employee feels that something is not going right in the organization they can call this 1-800 number if they don't want to go through their manager or their hr person directly and then that is then a given to the right hr person and in an investigation the first thing you're gonna do is if it's not an anonymous and you know who it is you talk to the person you uh get more of the details and then you know you go to whoever the you know the issue is against so whether it's the manager or another employee then you either call them if we're in the office you know bring them into the office if it's over um you know if everybody's working from home you have a zoom call um depending on what the resolution would be whether it's a lot of times people just need to talk so you know you get them together and you talk to them um or you talk one-on-one and make sure that everybody knows what the resolution is but it all kind of looks the same because you know it's at the basis at the core of it it is a conversation usually i won't say all the time but usually one of my my last questions i'm gonna say just my last question for you has to do with transferable skills right because um and transferable knowledge right so a lot of the times you know when we're working with students they're saying you know a lot of stuff that i'm doing in school is not always completely applicable to some of the stuff that i'd be doing in the real world what is your take on that idea right i know with your role it's probably a lot different because there's a lot of psychology practices methods things of that nature that transfer over but um i'm be curious to know like what are some of the things that you feel like you still kind of use on a on a day-to-day basis from school mm-hmm um so probably um the best class that i took was a change management class and i don't necessarily remember every single detail um but it and i forget his first name but it's like the cotter change model or something like that and i think there are seven steps um and when you go through a change whether it's big or small you should literally go through those seven steps um and i again you know don't necessarily remember every single detail but one of the things i remember my professor said in class was if you're rolling out a change and the first time the manager is hearing it is in the same room as the people that report into that manager you're not doing it right so um before i do any change whether it's you know we're changing the policy from a to b or we're no longer going to be producing something in this way we're producing it in this way um i make sure to you know go through the right sequential order in order to a not ruffle anybody's feathers because that causes a whole bunch of unnecessary pushback that slows the process down and b just to be respectful of people because change is never easy so you want to make sure that you you're trying to be as smooth as possible um throughout the process i was taking those you see i i was just at home okay if you're gonna if you're gonna look into it google the seven steps of change and then the person's name is k-o-t-t-e-r um but yes and that's always relevant in anybody's role very cool oh this is great great information um actually i'll let aaliyah go i bet oh yeah i definitely had a question um okay what advice would you give someone um who's wanting to get their foot into hr like for example i am a psychology major i'm going to graduate my ba in psychology and then i'm going into grad school for management but it's i really want to go into hr too that's kind of like what i'm leaning towards but i just don't know like i feel like nothing i'm doing is very relevant to hr at the moment uh first when are when are you graduating um i am graduating graduating from um hendricks in may okay so i'mma just say early congrats because you are almost there and good job for making it this far and you know you don't necessarily have to have like hr um like roles to go into hr um but what i will say is uh try to get as much like experience in hr type things so think through you know how have you supported other people like there's a lot of ways you can wordsmith things um to show that you know you can do things that are hr related um so if you're going into a program you said um ferment for managing management yes management okay um so if you could find internships during your time um you know always get as involved as you can as well so if there are any clubs that you can join um any uh i'm blanking on um like a lot of the clubs that um are specific to um like grad programs but also think um and i can get you this information as well because i am blanking um but there are uh other organizations you can join um that might be more towards like an mba but still can look great on a resume so all that to say you know always have your resume in mind and what you can put on there um don't if you can help it because grad school programs can also be very time consuming um so don't stress yourself out to the point where you know you can't eat you can't sleep because i'll never recommend that um but as much as you can just not just do coursework get as involved as possible as you can and then when you're looking for internships as well if you can find something that's more hr geared um then do that as well but and i and just to let you know like when i was actually looking for internships and looking for full-time roles um i didn't necessarily have anything hr on my resume that's why i'm saying that um i i didn't have um like before i got into pepsi i didn't have an hr job um but when i got into the interview i was able to say i can be a good hr person because i know how to support people who were work on third shifts because i worked a third shift um i'm a good i know i can be a good hr person because i'm passionate about this and i've done this if that makes sense yes that makes a lot of sense and that helps me a lot too um also this is kind of a technical question but um would you recommend like doing certifications because i know that's like you see a lot of commercials for hr related certifications but are they necessary no they're not um like sherm is a big one one of those that you can definitely get involved in in grad school um but it's not necessary uh i think more so depending on like what program you go to um and if you can get something like an actual hr internship um i would say get a certificate if you don't get a master's in hr and that's something that you can add to your resume that shows that you know you're you have some sort of hr experience but it's not necessarily necessary okay it all depends on what you have this is great insight this has been a great interview i feel like time has flowed by i'm trying so you know this last question we talked about this previously to the taping so my last question always has to do with music because we love music at them events so let's think about this song maybe an artist or an album that speaks to the last week of your life and this is a song for martine this is a a question for aaliyah as well leah will be answering and i'll answer at the end you know or i can start off you go ahead

30-minute walk through the scriptures teaching in-depth Bible truths that change people's lives. Now here's your host, Les Feldick. LES FELDICK>> Okay, once again, we'll get busy and wind up with program number four this afternoon and we can be heading home. For those of you out in television if you'd ever like to be part and parcel of a taping afternoon we usually tape, not always, but usually on the first Wednesday after the first Sunday or the first full week of the month and we'll be glad to you. Just call to make sure that we're going to be here. And we'd like to have you join us, even for those of you in the Tulsa area. Come on in, we've got plenty of room. Again, we always like to appreciate your prayers and your letters, your financial help, everything that makes the ministry possible. Okay, we're going to continue right on where we left off in our last program and again in case we have someone who has missed the last two, three programs, we're going through a study of the covenants which started way back in the Garden of Eden where God mandated the environment, the responsibility of Adam and Eve in the Garden and then the fall. Then He lays out the program for life in the human race under the curse. And that has carried on until our present and will until the end of the Tribulation. All right, now then the next covenant as I mentioned at the beginning of our last program, is in the middle of the seven that take place between Adam and the Kingdom. And I'm going to come back and study that more in depth in a future program, but we'll just touch on it briefly in this program before we move on into the next covenant, which would be the Mosaic. In other words, the bringing about the Law of Moses. But let's just take a brief look at the Abrahamic and like I said, we'll come back to it in detail at a future program. Genesis chapter 12 starting at verse 1. Genesis 12 verse 1, \"Now the LORD had said.\" I'll slow down a little bit, some of you are still looking. Genesis chapter 12 verse 1. All got it? \"Now the LORD had said unto Abram, 'Get thee out of thy country.'\" Now remember he was clear down there in the area of the Persian Gulf, probably south of present day Baghdad. \"Get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred (that is your household, your relatives) and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show thee.\" Now the first thing I always like to point out is what kind of people were Abram's family? Now the best way to explain that is use Scripture. Keep your hand in Genesis, we'll be right back. Come up with me to Joshua chapter 24 verse 2. Joshua chapter 24 and verse 2 because we have to get the big picture as we go along. These things didn't just happen in a corner. Joshua 24 verse 2, \"And Joshua said unto all the people, 'Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers (your forefathers) dwelt on the other side of the river (that'd be the river Euphrates).your fathers dwelt on the other side of the river in old times,' even Terah, the father of Abraham, the father of Nachor (Abraham's brother). And they (the whole family, the whole community, the whole then known world) served (what?) other gods.\" Now you see that? That was what? Idols. Paganism. That's all they knew. Now you want to remember 200 years previous to the call of Abraham, you had the Tower of Babel and it was at the Tower of Babel that false religion was first introduced by Nimrod. And from Nimrod on then, the whole human race, now you want to remember you're only dealing with that small part of the world at that time, in the area of the Middle East and the Mediterranean, but they were all steeped in idolatry. They knew nothing of the One True God. And so it was for that reason, now then you can come back to Genesis 12, that God had to separate this separate man that He's going to use to bring about the Nation of Israel, He had to separate them from his idolatrous relatives. So He told him to leave your kindred. Go from your father's house \"unto to a land that I will (future) show thee.\" Now then here comes the covenant, and we're going to watch it carefully before we move on and then like I said come back at a future program. God says in His covenant promise now, \"I will make of you a great nation. (Separate from all the rest of the nations of the world.) And I will bless thee and I will make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing. I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee.\" Isn't it too bad that the world can't believe that? But you see, if they did that would spare Israel all the satanic attacks and that is not going to be stopped until Christ returns. But nevertheless this is all the promises in this Abrahamic covenant that God will bless those who bless Israel and He will curse those who are against Israel. And then here comes the capstone of the whole covenant. This last part of verse 3, that \"In thee (in Abram) shall all the families of the earth be blessed.\" No you don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand that. What does that mean? That through this man Abraham, God is going to set things in motion that will lead to the place where Salvation will then go out and encompass the whole human race. And that's why I want to spend more time on the Abrahamic covenant than all the rest of them put together because it's on this covenant that our Salvation rests. It's because of this covenant that Christ came. It's because of this covenant that Christ suffered and died. It's because of this covenant that the Apostle Paul came on the scene and became the Apostle of the Gentiles and that's why Paul over and over refers to this man Abraham. And so that's the Abrahamic covenant and we're going to come back to it at a future time. Now I'm going to go ahead to the next covenant on our board and that is the Mosaic. The covenant that God made with Moses and the Children of Israel. Now we're going to jump all the way up to Exodus 19. Now in the interval of course, we have the beginning of the Nation of Israel, with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and then the twelve sons. Joseph is sold down into Egypt as a slave by the eleven others and that of course separated Israel from the Promised Land. It put them down in a place of slavery. It put them in a place of subjection to pagan, ungodly rulers and out of which God had to redeem the Nation with the book of Exodus and we now find the Nation at the Mount Sinai, ready to receive the next, what should I call it? Foundation of the next covenant - The Law. All right, but let's just pick it up in verse 3. Exodus chapter 19 verse 3. The Nation is now out of Egypt, they're gathered around Mount Sinai and God of course is showing His presence on the mountaintop with thunder and smoke and fire. Verse 3, \"So Moses went up unto God and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain saying, 'Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and thus shall you tell the children of Israel. You have seen what I did unto the Egyptians (that is a reference to the drowning in the Red Sea.) And how I bear you on eagle's wings.'\" Not that they sprouted feathers and flew, but supernaturally, miraculously God led them out of Egypt and through the Red Sea and down to Mount Sinai. It was a supernatural event. All right, \"I bear you on eagle's wings and brought you to myself.\" Now here the language already indicates - whose people are they? They're God's people. They're His covenant people and He has mandated it as such and we're going to see that now in a coming verse. \"Now therefore (since I have brought you out of slavery, I have supernaturally brought you to Myself).if (here's the condition now).if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then (and only then) you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above (what?) all people.\" Now right there is the beginning then of God elevating the Nation of Israel, head and shoulders above all the rest of the nations and races of the world. This is why they are called the 'favored nation'. They are called the 'chosen people'. They are God's covenant people and here is the first real indication of it. All right, then verse 6, \"And you shall be unto me\". I didn't finish the verse, I'm sorry. \"You shall be a treasure unto me above all people (and here's the reason) for all the earth is mine.\" What does that mean? He can do what He wants. God is Sovereign. Now you know I learn every day. The other day somebody called and said, 'Les do you know the word Sovereign isn't in our Bible?' Now you know how often I've used it over the years. And is said, 'No I didn't know that.' And so I had to look and he was right. The word Sovereign like the word Trinity, is not in our Bible. But certainly all the evidence of what Sovereignty means is here. So I don't have to stop using the word, not at all. But you know it's interesting, here I've been using a word that I thought was as biblical as anything could be, but it's true. It's not in our Bible, but certainly all the meaning of it is. And here is one of them. If all the earth is mine, what does that mean? He's Sovereign. He can to whatever He wants. And this is what He chose to do. He chose to pick this one little nation of people and set them head and shoulders above all the other nations of the world and He's going to work through that one little Nation. All the rest of humanity as I've used it before, is just going to flow like Old Man River to the ocean and they're going to have nothing to do with the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, for the most part. There will be isolated exceptions. Now, the first that Paul writes that exemplifies that so beautifully, keep your hand in Exodus. Come back with me to Ephesians, I had to think for a minute. Ephesians chapter 2 because a lot of times people kind of look at me cross eyed when I let it be known that the Gentiles were never the object of God's Grace. The Jews were never instructed except to go to Nineveh. They were never instructed to evangelism the Gentiles, but quite the opposite. They were to keep all of these knowledges of God, boy what a word! I coined one didn't I? All of these things pertaining to the knowledge of God, they were to keep to themselves. They weren't to share it with the Gentile world, because God was not in the business of saving the Gentiles. And a lot of folks just say, where do you get that. Well, because of language like we've just seen here, but here Paul himself places it, so easy to understand. Ephesians 2:11-12. This leaves no room for any great number of Gentiles coming to Salvation in the Old Testament economy. It was impossible. Verse 11, \"Wherefore (Paul writes and remember he's writing now to Gentiles at Ephesus. He said).wherefore remember that you being in times past (what?) Gentiles.\" Now maybe for the sake of one or two listeners out in television, I'd better stop. What is a Gentile? Well in plain language, he's anybody who is not a Jew. A Gentile could be an Arab or a Black or an Indian or a Caucasian or you name it. If they're not members of the Nation of Israel they are Gentile. Now you see all the way from Adam until Abraham you don't have any particular Jew or Gentile separation, these are all just simply of the race and the birth of Adam. They are what I call the Adamic Race of people, but now with the call of Abraham, setting out one little Nation separate, and He calls them 'Jews' or 'Israelites.' The rest are Gentile and so from Abraham on, we have that difference in Scripture of Jew and Gentile. All right, reading on in Ephesians. So remember you Ephesians and of course the churches around them, \"that you were in the times past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision.\" And what was that? That was a deriding term. That was the scorn that Jews had for the Gentiles. \"You are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision (or the Jew. Now verse 12. See how plain this is?) That at that time (while God was dealing with Israel under these covenant promises,).that at that time you (Gentiles) were without Christ, you were aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers from the (what?) covenants of promises.\" That's why we're studying them now today. The Gentile world was \".strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and (what?) without God in the world.\" Now what does that mean? They were lost. Even last one of them. They were lost. Well it wasn't God's fault because they had proved for the first 2000 years they didn't have any interest in the things of God. They had proved by their idolatry out of which Abraham came that they weren't concerned about a knowledge of the One True God. They were satisfied in their idolatry. And look, that's the vast majority of people today. They're content with their false religion. They're content with no religion. They're not interested in real Salvation and it's always been this way. All right, so the Gentile world then was totally separated from all the covenant promises of Israel. All right, now then back to Exodus 19, we can pursue this a little further for the next few moments, how that now God is going to supernaturally invoke the covenant promise of a religious system of Law. Now most of you know, I do not like the term 'religion.' Well Judaism, The Law, was a religion. Because it was a works thing based of course on faith, but nevertheless Judaism demanded works. And it was a process and we're going to be looking at that. They had to do this and they had to do that. In fact, you might as well drop back down to Exodus 19 verse 8 and that says it all. \"And all the people answered, 'All that the LORD hath spoken, we will'\" believe? No. What? \"Do.\" And so they gladly embraced a works religion. All right, I think we can move on over into now, chapter 20. And what is it? The Ten Commandments. Hopefully you've all learned them when you were kids in Sunday School or Daily Vacation Bible School, the Ten Commandments which are causing such a furor today. Well, I've got mixed emotions. Naturally they are certainly God's format for society. The Ten Commandments are still the basic law of God, I'll never take that away, but for us as Grace Age Believers you see, the Law is moot, it's been crucified with Christ. But for the unbelieving world it is still God's moral Law. All right, now I'm not going to go through all the Ten Commandments, I trust you all know them forward and backwards, but here in Exodus 20 now is the unfolding of the first part of this three part covenant. We have the moral law, the Ten Commandments. All right, now then when you come on over to chapter 21 in verse 1, we come to the second part of what we call the Law. And it's the civil law, what I referred to I think in the last program. Now in these succeeding chapters and on into the book of Leviticus, the civil law covered every aspect of human relationship with other humans. And as I mentioned, if you have an animal that's known to kill and you let it kill someone then you are responsible for it. And all the way through. How you dealt with your neighbor in business transactions. Morally, how you behaved yourself in society. This was all covered in what I call the civil law. And I think probably a good portion of Israel's 613 laws, which the rabbis concocted out of the five books of Moses, would cover a lot of those little details. And it's interesting to see how much of Israel's civil law is a part and parcel of our own western civilization. I wouldn't doubt that when the British way back in history put together the Magna Carta those men took a lot of their ideas from Israel's civil law. Because after all, God was the One who gave it. All right, for just an example now then, chapter 21, we start with the term 'judgments,' which means in plain English, rules of government. \"Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.\" Now this is aside from the moral, Ten Commandment Law. And all the way through now we have covering the various aspects of Israel's day to day experience within the Nation and you come through all these succeeding chapters, it's the judgments to maintain society in the Nation of Israel. Now I'm going to take you all the way up to the next part of the law, which is the ceremonial or the ecclesiastical or the ritual part of the law. Now remember you've got the moral law, the Ten Commandments. You've got the civil law - how to deal with your fellow neighbor. Now we come to the ecclesiastical or the religious part of the law and that is going to entail the priesthood and the tabernacle, which later became the Temple. Okay, now I think we can come all the way up to chapter 24, where we now have what I call the third part of the Law of Moses and verse 3 of chapter 24. Now this is just.this is just sort of scratching the surface. I expect a lot of my listeners to dig a little deeper. You can do all this instead of watching the stupid television! Get into The Book and pursue this a little further in all three aspects. But now we're getting ready to establish the worship or the religious system of the Law, verse 3, \"And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD.\" See that? God said it. \"And all the judgments (all these rules and regulations) and all the people answered with one voice and said, 'All the words which the LORD hath said, we will do.'\" Well you heard that before didn't you? All right, now then we're going to find that, verse 7, \"He took the book of the (what? The covenant again. This mandate that God has now placed upon the Nation of Israel. All right, so).He took the book of the covenant and read in the audience of the people, and they said, 'All that the LORD hath said, we will do and be obedient. So Moses took the blood sprinkled it on the people and said, 'Behold the blood of the covenant'\" Now you want to remember that blood has been the intrinsic part of God's relationship with man leading up to the shed Blood of Christ on the Cross of Calvary. All right, now as we move on down in chapter 24 you can come to verse 12, \"The LORD said unto Moses, 'Come up to me in the mount and be there and I will give thee tables of stone and a law, commandments which I have written that thou mayest teach them.' And Moses rose up and his minister Joshua and they went up unto the mount of God.\" All right, now as Moses is up in the mountain then, starting in chapter 25, God begins to lay out to Moses all of the ramifications of the tabernacle. All the aspects of it. All the materials of it. He lays out to Moses just as plain as language can make it and it was supposed to be built according to the tabernacle which was already in Heaven and this was merely a copy of it. Now as you come all the way through these chapters of Exodus, we get to the place of chapter 29, maybe I'm going to far. Maybe 28. Just a minute, but I want to start with the priesthood here, if I can. Yeah, chapter 29 verse 1. Exodus 29 verse 1, now you want to remember in order to exercise the religious system that's going to center around the Temple, the sacrifices and all of the ramifications of the tabernacle worship, you had to have a priesthood. You had to have designated men to carry out all these systems of worship. All right, here we come, 29 verse 1, \"And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them that hallow them, to minister unto me in the priests office.\" See, now you haven't seen this before. This is something totally new in human history that God is establishing now a priesthood and \"they were take one young bullock and two rams without blemish, unleavened bread\" and so on and so forth. And then verse 4, \"And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and shall (watch this. Do what?) wash them with water.\" And that was one of the first processes of becoming a priest was wash, wash, wash. And not only for entering the priesthood, but as they would begin to go through the ritual of accepting the sacrifices, and stopping at the leaver of cleaning and going on into the ministry of the Temple or the tabernacle, before they could begin to minister, what did the priests have to do? Wash! Wash. Wash. Even though physical water could never take away their sin, yet symbolically it was speaking of a cleansing before they could step into the office of the priesthood. And so all of this now becomes then the third aspect of this covenant of Law. First the Ten Commandments. Then the judgments, [MUSIC] or the rules and regulations of civil life, and then the religious system to compensate for their time and again.

what's he do he goes well you know he's starting his farm and he runs a drug rehab facility and he's got a bunch of snakes and he runs a podcast and he's covered in tattoos and i was like i still have no idea who this guy is sounds nuts so so hey john takes me and introduced me to kevin and kevin's like what are you doing and i'm like i'm a chiropractor you know i have a couple of offices around the philadelphia area and reading and i'm rehabbing houses and we're getting in there and demo and how he goes you're doing this work yourself and he's like why like none of this makes sense right now so like our introduction was like trying to find out about each other and what each other does and his response is kind of the same one i always get from most people which is like why are you doing this why are you driving this crazy hectic schedule and pushing yourself like this and um honestly like it you know it kind of made me think back and um and think a lot about why yeah why am i doing this why do i do these things and um self-reflection sometimes is good um but the best thing is the best reason i could come up with and you guys all know me and have heard my stories in bits and pieces and probably get tired of hearing the same thing over and over again but uh you know i grew up in normal childhood i was born in 1978 in a small town called phoenixville pennsylvania which is like a steel mill town where the mill had left town and it's you know kind of like one of those things when the high tide goes out and the jobs leave and you're just left with all the crap on the beach is like you know not a whole lot going on there but um for the most part i had a normal childhood um sports was always a part of my life growing up the the normal sports basketball baseball football and um you know with a little bit of practice and being a bigger kid and playing outside all the time like i could usually do pretty good at those sports um i wouldn't say they came natural but it wasn't hard to get good at them and you know make the all-star team and do that sort of thing so when i was about 11 years old i was talking to my dad and um he had told me that you know he got in a fight one time with a wrestler and and the dude just ragdolled him and you know at 11 years old you look at your dad he's like this dude's tough like might be the toughest guy on the planet and i'm like this guy ragged all my dad he's like all right i gotta try and then that and then i i saw a couple kids wearing uh wrestling shoes in school and i thought that was cool so it gives you an idea where my fashion sense is at but so i'm like i gotta give the sport a try so um so i i went to the first day of wrestling tryouts and again i had played sports my whole life so you know i was used to tryouts and cuts and those sort of things and the coach walked in and he hung a rag on the wall and um took roll call and said you know this is a try out but nobody really gets i don't make any cuts because most you're going to quit anyway so whoever comes back after the first week or two that's probably going to be our team i found out later the rag that he hung on the wall was a ice cold rag that he would pull out and put over the thermostat of the wrestling room so that the heat would just pump non-stop in there and to make a long story short i was awful at the sport i was terrible i hated every second of it the sport beat me down every single day and i mean i would just keep coming back to it and like trying to conquer it and trying to beat it trying to be better um and i was terrible i was terrible in seventh grade when i started i was terrible in eighth grade ninth grade i started getting a little bit better um but you know like you look at that sport and then in the years of junior high like what else do you really care about except how other people perceive you like you really don't care about much except like what your friends think of you what this chick thinks of you what these other people think of you and you're you're in the middle of a sport where you essentially have to go out there naked you're wearing a singlet but it's made to mimi it's the worst outfit the worst uniform in all sports i mean let's face it um and you're out there against a kid your age with the same tools that you have wrestling each other and you're putting it on the line in front of your peers at a young age seventh eighth ninth grade and it it kind of that sport kind of fast tracks you into accountability you have nobody to blame you put it on the line in front of your peers at that age where that's all you care about it's how they perceive you and you're willing to wrestle another kid that could hold you down and make you look like a in front of everybody in your school or everybody that's attending the match which isn't many but it's um it's it's while your brain's wiring itself and you're developing as a kid like that's getting ingrained in your head so anyway ninth grade i still wasn't that good but i kept at it um 10th grade i started getting substantially better um then you know 11th grade came and i was getting real good not real good i was getting better than i was but then in high school you know comes like the weight cutting part of the sport um where you're expected to be at a certain weight and again you know the accountability that comes with that if you don't make weight who is there else to blame like you ate too much the night before you didn't come in on weight there's nobody to blame but yourself so you know you think about like 10th 11th 12th grade you're hungry eat if there's food around you you go to the cafeteria all your friends are eating you eat um but not me i you know i i had to i was wrestling 171 that year and i weighed about 185 190 so i was cutting about 17 18 pounds um and so lunch belt would ring um i would head down the locker room with a i still can't eat them to this day i don't want to look at them but like a pack of cheese on wheat crackers and i'd get on the scale naked and i'd put it up to slide the scale to 171 which is where i had to be at and it would inevitably click against the top and i'd start throwing the crackers in the trash can one at a time good day like three four crackers like i'd still have in my hand i could eat those because i had to make weight in three or four hours bad day like maybe one cracker and a sip of water not only that but after you do that you got to go back and sit in the cafeteria where all your friends are eating and laughing and having a good time so it the sport is a drag and the sport is undefeated little did i know at the time but wrestling is undefeated at mentally breaking people at some point like it just beats you down and like going through that time period it was uh i think that's where a lot of my drive came from to be better to push myself to put myself in uncomfortable situations um so getting back to it like we get to senior year high school and i was playing baseball too at the time and i i didn't play baseball my senior year because i knew i was going to wrestle in college like i knew at that point i wanted to wrestle in college don't know why i mean it's it's kind of like being an abusive relationship you just come and keep coming back even though you know the end result is going to be disappointment and more beatings i don't even know if i can say that this day and age but it is what it is um so you know i end up going to um i end up going to college and wrestling there continue to get better at the sport for a while i went to kutztown kutztown university i ended up doing pretty well i qualified for ncaas about my senior year which was the top 32 in the country was something i was proud of at the time and you know was on the schools like all-time win lists in the top 10 for a little while um but you know it it was one of those things where it was like my career your career ends as quick as it starts like as quick as it started in 1990 walking in that room in junior high your last match whether no matter where it is ncaa a duel me your your quality your national qualifier and you don't make it sports over that day unless you're one of the top elite people in the world like there is no more wrestling so um so i took a job after that um i graduated i ended up graduating with a degree in criminal justice um after i went to school with a secondary ed major i had no idea what i wanted to do i don't think any 18 year old kid or 17 year old kid has any clue what they want to do so after my freshman year i went and talked to my advisor she goes are you sure you want to do education like no she's like you know i think you're more criminal justice material like criminal injustice like okay man sign me up so anyway i graduated with a degree in criminal justice and um started looking for a job after i graduated i definitely don't want to be a cop um you know for i would just probably let everybody go i didn't want to be a parole officer or probation officer so i just took a job and i took a job as a child care counselor at a place called kids peace in allentown and i actually really enjoyed the job um it was i enjoyed it because it was challenging like it was hard like you're dealing with kids that you had nothing in common with like these are kids that were in gangs in new york and philly and from all over the place and they'd come there and uh you were in charge of them like you had your kids that were assigned to you they lived on this unit that was kind of like a dorm room and um you would have to go there for nine hours a day and counsel them and try and connect with them and basically just try and get them to do the right thing um the problem was being as big as i was um you know they were sticking me with all the worst kids which i didn't mind because it was more of a challenge and i loved that like it was like all right bring it on and the more kids they gave me the more my kids would fall in line like i did great that job i got great reviews um i you know but the problem is it's a social work job and you know you're making 13 bucks an hour you're putting in 50 hours a week and after you pay rent pay your car pay your insurance it's like i can't afford that shirt that i think might get me laid at the bar next week actually i could i just want to pay my insurance but anyway like i knew i want to go back to school so i was deciding between chiropractic school and law school what chiropractic because i liked anatomy and physiology a lot being an athlete my whole life and i went to a chiropractor when i was at school because i had a lot of back problems and he actually broke things down to me and explained me what was going on and he was really the only guy that was able to help me and get me out of pain so i really liked it i liked the profession but i also liked the law classes i had in undergrad and i love arguing i love debating um so i was kind of signed between those two things and um i was leaning towards chiropractic school i got accepted to chiropractic school and i didn't feel like taking an exam to get back into school which you have to take the l-stat i believe to get into law school and i didn't want to take it like i already got accepted and i'm like you know what i'm going to do that so i told my parents i'm like yeah i'm gonna move down to atlanta and um they were like what i was like you know i told my dad and stepmom actually because that's who i was staying with at the time i just got done with school and i was living with them and you know i told my mom and she was like yeah that's awesome go my mom's from georgia she was like yeah go because perfect like get out of here go go get further education georgia is awesome you'll love atlanta blah blah blah my dad's stepmom were like you can't leave like and then like he gave me all these ultimatums like they were gonna cut me off and they still didn't believe i was gonna leave and go to school like all the way up until the day that i i packed my car and like left and they were just like standing there like he really is leaving you know i just i mean i had a jeep and i put my clothes in there and um probably some posters because those are important um i left and i i drove down to georgia and like the whole time my dad and stepmom were like you know you don't you don't have a job and i'm like i'll find one like was there all sudden no jobs anywhere like i'll find a job like you don't have an apartment i'm like there's apartments there i'll rent one like i'll find a way to get one like i'll figure it out when i get there and um so i just left and drove down and that day you know after drive like that i walked into a bar grabbed something to eat and got hired at that bar um by as a bouncer and uh like that guy that i hired me there he's still my best friend to this day um he lives down in georgia still um and then he was like no here's what you need to do to get an apartment go to this place they'll do your negotiating they'll get you into a place right away it's like cool so i went in there um they got me an apartment so within a day i had an apartment job like so that worked out um and then i started going to chiropractic school so in the beginning of chiropractic school because i was a criminal justice major i didn't have all my sciences so i had to take these science like chemistry um two and organic chem one and two in physics one and two and bio two i think is what i needed um but anyway it was only like four hours of class a day so i was in class for four hours and i was sitting there twiddling my thumbs and you know i'm 22 years old i just got done wrestling and i was doing some submission grappling before i left to move down to atlanta um so you know i busted out the old trusty phone book and looked up a local jiu jitsu gym and called them and was like found out when their classes were and went there and i did pretty well like grappling with their guys um you know just down in georgia at the time like didn't have a real strong like wrestling program down there as far as high school and college goes they do now but they didn't at the time and so i didn't really have too much trouble like rolling those guys um and so everybody immediately started asking like when are you gonna fight and i'm like i don't know i didn't come here to fight i came here to like work out and get a workout in and so um the fighting wasn't even on the agenda but um eight weeks later i was in a fight i was like all right cool like yeah if you got a heavyweight for me i'll fight him so the line up this fight i i really had no stand-up training i didn't even know how to get to the place this isn't this is 2002. um like fighting wasn't even big like and ufc i think just took off in 1996-ish like was when it started but it wasn't big it was almost bankrupt at that time and it wasn't that popular and so everybody down there knew about they called it nhb fighting no holds barred and i was like i don't even know what nhb is like but anyway so i took the fight i couldn't even find the place um i remember my girlfriend at the time and i were looking for the place where the fight was i was at a place called earthling live and i was like a concert venue and i was like the only way i found it is because there was an ambulance parked out front and i'm like well it makes sense that there's an ambulance there so that's probably it so we found the place and i had my first bite i fought that night and it was a decent car there was there was a ton of people there and i just remember after that fight like just being like whoa like i mean it was it was the craziest feeling i i can't even explain to somebody how it feels like the the the fear the anxiety the excitement the the confidence all that leading up to the fight and then when you win like just feeling somebody quit like you can feel the energy leave somebody when they quit before it's even stopped you're like all right i got this guy and then you just start wailing on him to get out of there and get the ref to stop it or knock the dude out or whatever it is and i just remember that feeling and being like holy like can i do this again next weekend and you know at the time too i remember telling everybody in class like everybody was talking about like what they were gonna do that weekend and um i was like oh i'm fighting down at earthlink live in in atlanta and um they were like what it's like yeah i gotta fight like if you guys aren't doing anything come out and so everybody at school thought i was nuts um i didn't think i was nuts but [Laughter] but they all did um so i you know i took i won that fight i took another fight i won that one and then i went down to alabama and fought a dude down there and i ended up getting knocked out it's my first loss it was probably the best thing that ever happened to me from a fight standpoint because it made me realize that i had to go back to the drawing board um and i got knocked out in alabama and like even like i feel like an old man talking about this like concussions weren't really a big thing anybody talked about and um so after i got knocked out of course my friends had come down to alabama to watch the fight we go out to the bar and drink the rest of the night like responsible people do and um i remember driving back the next day to atlanta and um like sitting in the car it was just like i just had this nauseous feeling but i felt like i had to eat so i tried to eat and i couldn't open my mouth because my jaw hurt so bad so um apparently i got kicked pretty hard so i'm told um so uh so the one class in chiropractic school that i failed was this is funny too with cpr um you have to take a cpr course it's like the class everybody just shows up to and passes and gets their certification and leaves um but it was monday morning was the exam it was finals week and i just had this fight and every time i started counting chest compressions like the room started spinning and i was like and i would lose my account like because obviously i was concussed pretty bad [Laughter] so i explained to the dude what happened the guy like the guy that taught the class and um uh he was he was like what i was like yeah i was in a fight in birmingham alabama i got knocked out like everything i don't know what's going on but every time i start counting like the room starts spinning and i feel like i'm going to puke and this is awful he goes all right well we have to have grades in by tomorrow so if you can come back tonight he goes go home go home sleep it off not like go to the hospital or anything go home and sleep it off and come back later and we'll see if you could take it so i came back later of course i still couldn't do it i was still kind of a mess but failed that class which screwed you up because now like you know it sets you back for the next quarter when you're in the program like you have to retake that class which interferes with another class and screws you up a little bit but um anyway so you know now now i'm in the chiropractic program and i'm going to class every day like it's 25 credits a quarter and it's four quarters a year so you're taking 100 credits per year you're in class every day from eight to five with like an hour break and maybe showing up late to a class so you get a little bit of break in the afternoon so i would actually i would go to class in the morning and i was working at the bar too so i'd go to class in the morning and i'd cut out at lunch go work out and run lift weights run go back to class finish class up i'd shoot home and i'd go home and put like notes on index cards because then i would go and train and then i'd go right to the bar and work and while i was at the bar i could hold index cards in my hand and like glance down on them and study um then get done work at three and class would start over again the next day at eight so i kind of got used to this like crazy hectic schedule of just like grinding like just getting after it find a way to get things done kevin said it like he sees like you know i have a grind i just want to keep going and you know that's kind of where it started i mean it started with wrestling and it started by that's where i got the motivation and the the desire to do it but then in school like just you know constantly staying busy and getting after non-stop um it just became like what i do like i it almost happened by accident um so you know i i'm in school i'm training i'm fighting kind of like three years later doing this and and fighting constantly not constantly but that's fine like i want to fight more like i want to fight like four times a year because it you know the more times you get in there but like the more comfortable you get each time the more relaxed you get the more in the rhythm you get it's not a big deal anymore it's just like another day at the office instead of feeling like you're starting all over again um but it gets harder to find fights like you start getting to be like four and one five and one like the fights aren't there like the the upping like the guys that like are trying to make it to the next level don't want to fight you because they might lose and that would tarnish their record and then the lower level guys don't want to fight you because they think they're going to get mauled so you really start fighting nothing but like tough dudes that are like bouncing back and forth between the ufc um and even those fights are tough to find um so like i wasn't getting as many fights as i wanted to but it wasn't the end of the world um so i was in school i was getting towards the end of school um and you know i i started getting the phone calls that i was looking for like two years earlier with like bigger fights that i wanted and now it's like i was at the tail end of school it was getting it was getting a little bit more difficult as far as like you have national boards coming up you have to take to get your license yeah you get a lot on this on the on my plate and so i was taking some of the fights and i was winning them and then um you know i finished school i passed my boards i was done with everything and i was still kind of like just hovering in no man's land i felt like because it was like i finished school i was certified i was working as a chiropractor but i was still training and still like the phone would ring with fights and i was like no no no and then they they finally called with with a fight it's fighting a dude um i can't remember his name uh dan christensen what's his name he was six eight he's a ufc guy with the fight was in phillips arena in atlanta and i was like you know i'm done fighting like i'm moving on like i'm done like i work out to stay in shape and that's it i was like ah one more [Laughter] i mean the problem is like when you're trying to work in an office and you're talking to patients and you have a black eye or your stitches in your face they tend not to take you as serious when you're talking about their health and wellness so so i was kind of at a point where i was like i had to make a decision so i took that fight and um actually in that fight like i was doing okay the fight like it's kind of weird because fights happen in slow motion with in your mind like it seems like an eternity that like takes place like you can lay out like an hour and a half long story of what happened and then you watch it again it was like three minutes but in your mind it was much longer than that so i took the dude down a couple times i took him down he stood back up i took him down again um and he kicked me over and like caught me in an armbar and i knew i was caught i knew what i had to do to get out was to jump to the other side but in my head i was thinking you know if this dude breaks my arm i'm i'm out of work for eight weeks like am i going to risk hopping over and not getting out because the guy is a high-level jiu-jitsu guy and i was like that's it like i tapped and that was my last fight you know in the locker room afterwards i was like you know i'm done i you can't be in a fight and thinking that way like you can't have stuff like that running through your head and interfering with your what's going on so again like i was still in atlanta and i was still kind of cruising um and i just wasn't happy because like i wasn't being challenged there was nothing left there to do really i was kind of working this job but kind of working out and kind of training and um so i was like you know what it it might be time to move home and in the meantime i had met my my girlfriend at the time um i met her working in a bar in atlanta you know the strong foundation of all relationships or those ones in the bar so um i was living with her and she's from tennessee and she is living in atlanta uh working um and you know i talked to her and i'm like what do you think about moving back to pa and um she was like oh i don't know she's like you know if you find a job or whatever i don't have a whole lot going on here so if you have a job lined up and we can move back there then she's like yeah i'm down and so i'm like all right well we gotta figure out where we're gonna go so you know i i talked to my parents a couple times and i was like you know i'm pretty set on coming back it's time to come home like if i'm going to settle down too i want to be close to my family um as much as i didn't want to leave atlanta and i didn't want to be the guy coming back home you know i was thinking all those things in my head like does this mean i failed so now i'm moving home but um it's so weird how you mind yourself sometimes thinking like that but but you know i and i knew my parents were gonna be like well if you don't you don't have a place to go just come stay here so eventually i called him again and told him i was coming home and they said that and i was like yeah i knew you were going to offer that up so i moved back home my dad and stepmom and my wife staying in the bedroom that i grew up in in a small two bedroom three bedroom house and essentially a row home and my girlfriend at the time didn't have a job she eventually found a job but i took a job as a chiropractor working for a guy i knew who started me off at a whopping 20 an hour so i was actually taking a pay cut from my old bouncer position to go work for this dude as a chiropractor um and so you know he i went into his office and i started working and um i remember like the one week i clocked 65 hours and i i was doing payroll at the time like eventually he stopped coming into the office because i was running everything and so you know he was like um you know i'm concerned you're working 65 hours or whatever it was and i was like don't be concerned like somebody's got to do it i'm like you're running an office seeing 300 patient visits a week you don't even have a front desk person answering the phone you don't have anybody here you don't come in you don't have an office manager like i'm here doing everything myself and his hours were real crazy they were like two to nine and one to eight and so i would wake up in the morning and i'd go to the gym and work out and i'd come home and i'd do a bunch of reports and now like patient reports and i would go in to work and i'd get there a couple hours early get the paperwork done that was left over from the day before start seeing patients see patients until eight finish paperwork at home like 10 o'clock at night so again it was the same thing it was that non-stop grind um so he was like you know you're doing pretty good here i'm gonna bump you up to 25 bucks an hour i was like all right dude thanks i appreciate it i guess um so he he ended up sending me over to his other office i'm trying not to make the story boring but he sent me to his other office because the person that was working there went out on maternity leave or whatever and so i started working at that office and they were seeing like 150 patient visits a week and i turned that office around and got it up to like 230 patient visits a week and so when i came back to him i was like i want to review like he's like oh i don't do reviews and i'm like well i want to review like i want to sit down and see what else you want me to do and so i went into the review he finally said okay i'll do it i went into that review saying you know you're i'm either going to get 35 an hour like he's which is still i start the cars that work for me i started them off at 40 an hour like so i'm asking to get bumped up after running the student's office i'm asking for 35 and he put me up to 30 and i was just like all right cool so i left there that night and i immediately started looking for a spot to open my own office now keep in mind i'm still living with my parents and my girlfriend um and she had found a job working at a pharmaceutical company um and she was doing okay it was just a not even in what her her degrees in either but she just took the job um to get out of the house probably because she was hiding upstairs all day in the room i grew up in miserable and so with the with the michael jordan posters for sure um and so i immediately started looking for a location open up my own office which i ended up doing but the place was a dump so because this dude's office openly had these crazy hours everything was second shift i was able to go to that office and start rehabbing it and cleaning it out and putting down flooring and painting the walls going to lowe's and getting paint like that people had returned just to get the paint on the walls for a discounted price because i i literally had like i think i'd save like maybe five or six thousand dollars which is what it took to open this office up i i was getting equipment used off craigslist and so i was only booking morning hours so i would go and rehab that office and i would quick grab a shower and then i would shoot over to his office and work the whole afternoon and so once the office rehab i started seeing patients in my office in the morning and i would see patients in my office in the morning until one and then i would shoot over to his office and then it got to the point where my house was getting a little bit busier um and so it it just snowballed and got busier and busier so then i went down to part time at his office and that's when i told him i was like look i'm going to part-time now because i got my own office open and he was like baffled like what you're leaving like yeah i'm leaving like he you know he gave me no incentive to stay here and i'm like it is what it is um so anyway um you know i opened uh the office was doing well and like everything in life that i do when things get easy i make them more difficult so so i opened a second office and i was going back and forth between those two offices then then i got married to my wife so we ended up having a kid we got married in 2011 i want to say she reminded me the other day she just thought of it that's our 10-year anniversary coming up i'm glad she forgets those things and doesn't put a huge level of importance on them um so i end up having a kid um and a daughter and so that was in 2013 and you know things were still going well and it was now i have a pregnant wife i have an office in northeast philly i have the office in oak lane so what do i do i open an office in redding and things are hectic all over again and so i'm working all over the place my wife's pregnant um but at the same time like it was good because i'm trying to make money and i like now i'm kind of freaked out too because you know your whole life like you live for you like having kids is like a serious wake-up call and i'm sure a lot of you know this but like you get so used to just living for you like you're the only one depending on you like i i can live out of my car it's not a big deal like i've done it before i've stayed in my car you know i can i can get a shower at la fitness the membership at la fitness is 30 i can get a hot shower there and a gas bill is 80 bucks a month so i i can do those things but now that you have a kid it's like that's out the window now like i can't you can't do that and so for a while there i got a little bit less risk taking i'd say with my investing and and expansion and then we ended up having a second daughter and i started another business rehabbing homes to start a rental property business um and you know at the time i had i was talking back and forth with john a little bit murph um as he's known as and um i knew that he was wasn't ecstatic with the position he was in but i know he had drive and i know he's motivated he's a lot like me and it's like you know it let's do it let's figure out a way to do it and so uh we kind of teamed up and started this business renovating houses and that's when he introduced me to kevin and we've been doing well um we're not nearly where we want to be and we probably never will be where we want to be because that's just how i am and that's how he is but um but we're going to bust our ass trying to get there and we'll get there but we'll still be unhappy and i'll probably start another business and make myself incredibly uncomfortable again but um i mean if i if i can say anything about what sums up my life is there's somebody had said a quote one time i thought was pretty funny made me laugh and then i thought like  that's me um he said uh hard work is a crutch for the talentless [Laughter] and i mean it's meant to be funny but at the same time like none of us in this room i don't think are running 4240s none of us are doing writing songs that are top 10 hits none of us have that hidden talent but i assure you you can make up for it with hard work you can blow past those people if you work your ass off i've done it for quite some time now i've wrestled and i've fought with dudes that are way more talented than i am and i could out work them and i could win by outworking them and everybody can do that you don't have any excuse not to work your ass off um and that's pretty much it that's my life [Applause] oh thanks [Applause] well i just want to say i connected a little bit down down there with the uh the georgia part i was in georgia for a while savannah oh okay it's huge right now yeah they're doing well but um what what drove you the most of all what was it was it the adrenaline was the challenge or was it the pure what was it the drive for what huge drive yeah i mean no the drive is not not wanting to fail and not being content with where i am like i'm never content like it's just it's something i'm always trying to perfect i feel like you know it's little things happen in the office and it drives me nuts because i think that that's going to be the end and it's all going to fall apart and i like so i'm constantly like trying to tinker with things to like fine-tune the machine all the time and i'm never happy with it i'm never content with where it's at even like people look at it and they're like oh that's a great system that that runs really well it runs way better than anything else i've seen and i'm like no it's got all kinds of flaws look at them like we we have to improve on this at the next thing and i've kind of been like that throughout my life and like i said i i think it comes from wrestling and and trying to conquer that overcome that feat of just being bad at something like it and it's trying to beat it trying to get better and trying to get better and i think that's what originally fueled it um but it's just something i've adapted over time i don't know where it comes from thank you appreciate it no problem nobody else has questions for sam i can't believe it something that i i really have to point out dude is that uh if you guys notice everything that he did like one of the biggest things that stood out to me is that when you started working in that office you said you went in there two hours early did you get paid for those two hours oh no yeah so he succeeded before the rest came so like i don't know if you guys are seeing the the constant story of that and picking up on the fact that everything isn't about an instant reward to you well i i did get paid i take that back i i didn't get paid monetarily right then and there but i got paid ultimately because i can demand more money because i was on point for those eight hours that we were open right i was ready while the other guy that worked with me was walking in the door with the patients right i was ready like i was lined up and it was funny because i was like you know what i got i i unlocked the door 45 minutes early and he goes don't do that he goes if you do that he goes people will start coming in then and i said well yeah if they come in then i can see them and we won't be swamped when we first open we'll spread it out over the course he goes they'll come an hour early then and i'm like okay then i'll be here an hour early and he was shocked but you were an hourly employee probably getting paid x amount of hours but you wanted to do the right thing and the thing that felt you made you succeed like and i think that's what a lot of people miss that's all i know is that there's going to be a hell of a lot there's going to be a massive amount of effort and work before the massive amount of reward comes and that's the only equation there is but we really get that a lot of people get that twisted that oh well whatever i do i should instantly get a reward for if i go do this i want to be rewarded immediately and when you're building something especially success however you put it like there's going to be time that you have to put in that you may not get that instant reward for so to me like you summed up success with that statement like i i was doing my paperwork on your own time to get caught up you were dedicated not to your business to somebody else's business because you wanted to be a dedicated person and everybody else would become a victim of that yeah and that's success to me like whatever you're in at the time whatever he was in at the time you were gonna do full out whether it paid you in money or in ego or in whatever it was it wasn't about the payment it was about the dedication and the work and yeah and you'll see you'll see it a time and time again when you start doing that you'll see the people that you work with start trying to sabotage it and start getting angry and start getting mad and they literally will get pissed that you're showing up and making making them look bad like i had a buddy of mine carmelo he took a union job he was a former wrestler and fighter too he fought in the ufc no i mean i know you're talking about it yeah yeah good dude good friend of mine um he uh he he started working uh yeah carmelo anthony you may have heard of him um he started working at union job and he said the same thing he was like you know guys are getting mad at how much i'm getting done they're like you gotta slow down like if if you don't take that break they'll take it away we won't get it back because and he didn't know how to conform like he was super frustrated for for a long time yeah so but you guys have questions just throw a shoe at me questions nobody nobody has nothing i just want to say thank you you got to come up here um i just want to say thank you for everything that you do for us as far as working and just allowing us to learn and just uh just even the way like we had a conversation about you telling me how i speak to somebody you know like that stuff matters a lot for uh guys like us i just want to let you know thank you yeah no problem man i love working with you guys i really do um since if we forge this this working relationship that we have um it extends beyond work i like hanging out with you guys too um i learn stuff from you guys all the time um it it it's benefited both of us it's definitely been a symbiotic relationship um i've learned stuff from you guys you don't hesitate to take the time to be like no this is how we're going to do it um you know me and marshall would have done it this way [Laughter] his name is devin his name's david um no but it really it has it's worked out really well and uh i appreciate you guys as much as you appreciate me i'm sure all right anybody else oh uh no i wanna um i i relate to your story you talking about your wrestling and um that high level of accountability um at a young age i was wrestling since i was five yeah and all the way getting into high school um and you talked about that that that love hate relationship that abusive relationships call it like that dude it's so accurate i hated wrestling but i was so good at it and you know i noticed the trend in high school that i went i would kick ass all season long undefeated and in the written into the end of the year tournaments i would give up completely 100 and uh just i'm i was inspired when you were talking about how you took that accountability into wrestling into your life and you just kept that drive going man and like and that's kind of where i fell off at high school at high school was my senior year and uh dude i beat myself up about it for quite a few years yeah up until now up until up until like up until now and like you know um i like hearing like when you talk about that and you relate that wrestling background into your life story today because dude it's it's a huge part of my story i just like don't know how to how i feel about it how to apply it because it was such a huge part of my life that i i gave up on and today i'm starting to feel like i'm getting that fire back but i'm no longer on a wrestling mat so now it's like my life and i got kids you talked about your kids and whatnot and how everything changes and that risk is different but even more so that drive is just um you know i listen to your story and it's exactly the story that i need to incorporate into my life yeah yeah the the accountability that comes with wrestling and i always i always hone on that hone in on that because at that at that age nobody teaches you to take blame nobody teaches you like all the lessons you learn from that sport you don't learn that you were being taught them until later in life and you're like holy like it just hit you and you're like that's why i act that way that's why i make it all my fault that's why i own it because if you don't who else is there to blame like you're out there with one other person and if you get embarrassed in front of everybody what do you blame your coach for not showing you that move like no you just got beat you have to own it and when you take it into everyday life you know that people say all the time like this person did that or that person did this or they screwed it up or murph and i work with guys every day that the first response out of their mouth when they screw something up we laugh about it now but is so and so did it this person did it like no you allowed the guy to do it like why did you give him that responsibility to do that for the fourth and fifth time when he screwed it up when you said he screwed it up before like at what point do you own it because if you don't own it it's not going to change because that guy's not going to change if you're blaming everything on him he's not going to change so if everything is everybody else's fault and you allow all those other people to affect the outcome of what you're trying to do you're stuck spinning your wheels because you'll never get past it until you say it's my fault because now i'm telling that guy to tell him what to do and he's screwing it up so i'm not doing that anymore in fact i'm not even picking the guy up tomorrow he can stay home so what i got and also i do story which i really do i love it is uh i i got the picture that the more work you put in the better you get out in the in the end always it may not know when it's coming you don't know when it's going it's coming and that that's the biggest part like people it's really easy for people to say if you work for one year you're going to get this like the work you put in you had you had no idea all you had to do is have faith that your effort was going to be rewarded with success of some kind you never stopped working there's an old saying and it definitely holds true and it's uh when you focus on money you'll never make it when you focus on bettering yourself every day you'll inevitably make money it's that's business to a t if you think like i got to make money i got to make money how am i going to make money you'll never ever make it because you're you're focusing on the wrong thing if you focus on bettering your business and i brought it up earlier even when i was broke and i was living with my parents my dad and stepmom and i was living with them and my girlfriend was living upstairs like even at that time all i was thinking about is how can i make this business better how can i get more people to come in how do i market myself how do i not how do i make a thousand dollars this week like i never never even crossed my mind for whatever reason like that just happened i don't know why what that came from i don't even know what to attribute that to because it would have been real easy to be like i need 800 how am i going to get it you know so you just did the right thing and then then the other stuff came as a result of doing the right thing and then yeah that's exactly what happened and then it that just repeated itself over and over again we've heard this twice today this morning's meeting this morning's breakfast was about money oh really talked about and we all said like we wish sam would have been here for for the money meeting to have that discussion yeah thanks for showing up this morning anybody else anybody else oh that pat's coming can you can you hurry up that i know it takes you a minute yeah yeah i want to say that your story is really inspiring uh i can relate with um like the wrestling and things like that the uh the adrenaline the the feel for the chase of it and i can honestly say like having us it's kind of like a thrill on itself just taking a chance on somebody giving somebody the benefit of the doubt and i want to say thank you for doing that for us no problem mr house is up it's not just mess my house is up the thing is too just to add a little bit about what what you guys do i i think a lot of people or i think and you can correct me if i'm wrong but a lot of you guys think that people think that you're bags because of your past and like where you come from and where you're at like a lot of people that i've talked to in similar situations like have this very low esteem like that they think that everybody else thinks they're a bag because they went through addiction um it's just not the case like i can assure you and these guys can tell you there's there's times they have to run to home depot and i give them my debit card like guys go ahead take the debit card just leave it in the cabinet when you're done i i trust every one of you until you won't be back to your job sam i'm sorry but [Laughter] i i trust you guys up until the point that i shouldn't and it has nothing to do with where you came from or where you're currently at it has to do with shaking your hand and looking you an eye and knowing that you're a trustworthy person and i've just always felt that with you guys i really have so um so you talk about this drive that you have and you've had us in wrestling um i've played sports the big three baseball basketball football yeah and i had this drive but with what i've been through i lost it and now my want to give up is like extremely easy so i need to know how to get out of that and get this drive back i don't know if you ever lost that at one point and how you gained it back hmm i don't want to say that i've never lost it i mean there's given points in every time that you you get that that feeling of like why am i doing this and i talked about it at breakfast and one day where you're like you hit those lulls where you're just like why am i gonna do that today that can wait till tomorrow is the world gonna spin off its axis if that waits till next week blah you know you feel like crap um as far as losing the drive goes no the times when i lose the times when i lose focus is when things get easy i i it's just the way i'm wired and i guess that's a benefit at times it's been a detriment at times too um as i talked about before but um when things get easy and i get complacent i get extremely uncomfortable and it's just not my comfort zone so a lot of times my drive comes from like just starting new starting something fresh like i don't know how you can do it within the the confines of where you're at i think that has to come from within find a motivation set goals like what goals do you have what is your goal for tomorrow for me and murph i think you're a good one to answer that question like we've quit at times right both of us have quit at times uh yeah numerous times and and i always had to be fighting for somebody else for a little bit does that make sense like i had to fight for something other than myself to get reset and i think that's a lot of you and especially you man is like you got to find something bigger to fight for until you want to fight for yourself again because i i i gave when i gave up when we quit we have no desire for self we have but to serve self that's the crazy part like it's it's about us but we feel like we're scumbags and pieces of so we don't want to do anything about it but we don't want to do anything about it because we want to serve ourselves it's like a really twisted thing right so i always have to find a purpose a something bigger than something to fight for and you have that you have that at home you have that here so yeah well purpose and goals are kind of intertwined i think yeah um but yeah man i i don't know i'm not i'm not good at motivating i'm really not it's not my strong suit at all like there's so many people i come across where i'm they're just like feel sorry for themselves and it's like okay well i'll be over here let me know when you're ready to go again like uh you know what i mean like i just and it's it's not i'm not trying to downplay or be dismissive of your question at all i just i don't know how to i'm not good at motivating other people that don't have the motivation themselves i can feed off of it and we can feed off each other and be motivated and be like yeah let's go let's get this done but if you're dragging and just want to feel sorry for yourself or feel like or feel like quitting then it quit good luck catching up to me when you come back around though because you're going to come back around at some point and now i'm going to be over here and you're going to catch up and it's going to be twice as hard i don't but i get it that makes a lot of sense anybody else anybody come on why do we have to have this 20 minutes in between things don't do that i'll just sit back down god come on get up here well i just wanted to say thank you for like you know the learning experiences that you have on your job sites with older guys here in the program and newer guys like for the newer guys learning on your jobs making the mistakes of is a great confidence booster and then also like on the jobs i've did with you a couple times like you know i did a lot of things i haven't exactly full did from start to finish like i always helped with my dash of like you let your leg just here go do this yourself and whatever mistakes we make it's great because it gets a great learning experience and you're like you're a really awesome guy where you're just like you know what it's cool it's a mistake what do we got to do to fix it and it's just awesome and i want to thank you for it yeah no problem all right that's it clap it up clap it up for sam thanks buddy um yeah um [Applause] like i said i he you gotta understand what this guy and murph have done for us to hire us to to come work on their homes and and they're both you guys have both become great friends and i'm just thankful for everything you've done so say goodbye to the camera there sam see you see y'all later

in the chat if you've heard that modelos are basic drinks now that's what i've heard around the grapevine what i heard it i didn't invent this like finally they're yeah you're right you know what robert is excited that this is a basic [ __ ] drink this is what he says no no he's not excited it's just like finally there learning something so what's so you're not excited but you're just saying finally yeah okay we have a lot of communications issues so i will say that well we do don't we is that untrue so i'm just saying he's like finally blah blah blah i'm like oh you're excited he's like no i'm not excited i just said finally i i don't know i guess it's supposed you could convey a lot of things with the word finally other than excitement i guess i understand i get it i came here for a reason and that reason was to talk about not my marriage classic classic my husband always making my live streams about it our marriage am i right i'm like roberto calm down i'm trying to live stream um so it's me it's my mother sponsored by modelo i wouldn't be i wouldn't be upset i wouldn't be upset to get this call i would not be upset to get this call in fact i invite it universe let's go let's talk about it let's talk about it enjoyed responsibly of course and and or not responsibly and you know what if there's a non-alcoholic uh brand within the modelo family i'm here to support that as well i'm here to support kombucha yeah so hey guys what's up i see every i see some friendly faces people that i would love to be actually here with me drinking this model with me i would actually love for everyone here to be here you want to come over call me you know my number so i thought i would come on to do a little follow-up a little epilogue a little a little part do if you will as the french say do isn't that how they say it yeah you have to say it like that renata is having a medela because she medello because she's a basic [ __ ] we're all basic and let's just embrace it we're basic and complex and that's the point of today's lives let's bring it back to rebrand like an artist part two if you didn't say part one as the french say one if you didn't say part one i encourage you to to hop on over to my igtv archives it's there it never wasn't there it was always there for you rebrand like an artist so rebound like an artist part two let me set the scene i was up there actually let's go i was up there where was i up there and that and inside coming to my window i was up there in that window i'm trying to get my finger on it's really hard because it's backwards i was in that window and uh and i was what i did was i just i was using the analogy of dumping out your backpack i'll uh i don't know the 90s transport days those types of things dumping it all out getting rid of the garbage getting rid of the things in your brand and your business that no longer makes sense throwing that [ __ ] out and then going piece by piece and reorganizing it and re-envisioning it and then and only then embarking upon the rebranding process and then i was like y'all we're gonna do a free challenge we're gonna do some spring cleaning free challenge arenas i will be announcing more details on that later this week so stay tuned in free school don't go anywhere go to rachelkalbers.com and sign up for updates if you want to like not miss a thing for sure otherwise be here secondary and from you know what it'll just all happen so and if you don't care then don't do anything because why are you here so so that's that but then i was like all right before we get into the meat and potatoes of it all before and by the way sponsored by not this i'm and i'm not i'm not sponsored but i will be mark my words mark my sips okay mark them mark them with an x mark them with a dollar sign actually let's all do it so i came here today to talk to you about rebranding the gun artists part two the niche free edition the niche free edition and this is where you know what i saw somebody the other day i saw somebody earlier this morning with an amazing business i love this person's brand and i love this person's business and this person was posting about their old artist days let's just say this they were like back in the day when i used to be an artist um and they posted all these pictures of their former self right they're like this was me and my old career and i resonated with him because like that's me too i'm like oh yeah i used to be an actress i used to be this i used to be that i used to be an actress i used to be a lot of things right i used to be an almost lawyer i used to be in an i used to be the kind of woman who read lots of books not just a single book in a year but many books in a year many books in a month many books in a week maybe many books in a day and now i'm a woman that struggles to to read a single buzzfeed article without getting bored so there's that you know there is that i'm not gonna lie about it um but where was i where wasn't i where am i now i don't know um so i'm telling you about this this this friend that i have who has an amazing brand and she is going under instagram and she's posting the slideshow of her former life of all of her like these are like remember back in the day when i used to be a blank here's some pictures of it and i love those types of posts by the way who doesn't those are fun but then i i was looking at and i was projecting as we all do and i was like that's me too it's always me um and then i'm like but wait but wait but wait before you have a pity party over the woman you almost were and the woman you gave up remember that you are that woman still and that that business today especially in 2021 maybe not in 2011 but in 2021 business today is about being a multi-disciplinary artist okay maybe it wasn't 10 years ago in 10 years ago it was about gaming the system it was about keywords it was about [ __ ] like quantity over quality but now it's about it's there's too much quantity everybody can nobody no anybody can compete on quantity anybody can compete on keywords anybody can compete on filling their niche with flooding their niche with information and somehow dominating that way and if you want to go that route go that route by the way that's the blue ocean route there are very few places that are blue ocean anymore though right so you can do that or and or and or kinda um you can embrace that we all must be artists within our own business we all have to be master marketers deal with it read them and weep accept it or don't i'm not the i'm just the messenger i'm not the re i'm not the truth creator here you know home zone mom this is why i'm on like that's why i'm like not taking clients right now so we're in this place in history where actually it pays to be an artist it really does pay to have the ideas finally finally now it's not only about the ideas though it's about being a marketer of your own ideas so that's stressful for most of us that's stressful for me it's been stressful for me and i'm embracing a new way of doing that and that's what preschool is that's what this and i'm gonna get sponsored by mandela goddammit whether they like it or not it will monster me my kids just clapped she was like so what does this all just do with rebranding like an artist um what does i don't know i just came on here to trick you i'm kidding no so the days of the rochester in the day listen the riches are certainly in the niches no one's no i'm not going to debate that i'm not going to say their riches are not there they are there for sure if you can find a niche especially a blue ocean one whatever the hell that means go for it go all day and go all night as hard as you can for as long as you can get it i mean it however um the riches aren't only in the niches my neighbors are upset my neighbors are upset i'm always upsetting neighbors because i'm a loud person i can't wait till the day when my neighbors are like are you an influencer and i'm like no but like i play one on tv okay so literally when i moved into my house by the way for anybody who knows this early adopter people know that when i moved into my house the week i moved in i filmed jurassic park and i ran around my neighborhood as a dinosaur a for real dinosaurs so that was how i introduced myself to my neighbors and then after that i'm like hey guys my name is rachel and i would love to make your acquaintance okay so i'm that kind of problematic person in the neighborhood i'm the gu that's why i'm not on next door i'm not a next door because i don't want to know what they're saying about me i'm afraid i'm actually it's going to hurt me and i'm not ready for it i'm not healthy enough to be on next door so rebrand like an artist we we listen no one's gonna deny that the riches are indeed in the niches but they are also in other places and in fact there is a niche to be had in your own madness quote me on that put it on a cross stitch somebody need to point that [ __ ] [ __ ] i'll pay you for it if you can if you can somehow needlepoint that on something a pillow preferably a yellow one i will compensate you let's talk about it so what i was going to say was you know these days whereas 10 years ago it might have been gaming the system through quantity or through keywords or through somehow wandering into a niche and being like oh i just happened to happened upon a niche one day i happened upon the glitchery of it all good for you dude that's cool man i'm up for it did you know that one of like the premier like uh bro marketing gods of our time got that way because he invented the potato no no he didn't invent potato guns he invented marketing potato guns as a thing and how to make them on ebay in the days when info products didn't exist do you know who i'm talking about drop it in the comments if you know who i'm talking about anybody who can drop it in the comments first is going to get a prize i'll send you modelo or kombucha depending on your where you're at with uh alcohol so if you're into alcohol i'll send you model if you're not i'll send you kombucha if you're not into either of those things well i'm not i will do it i'll send it to one of your friends so that's what's going to go on there um anybody want to drop into the comments who i'm talking about when i say this early marketing god let's just say the god let's just say the father of funnels how about this the father of modern funnels the father of modern funnels made got his start and made his early money by teaching people how to make potato guns and i'm not even freaking kidding that is literally what he sold i am not he sold it on ebay before before woocommerce was a thing before you could have a wordpress website before you could have a squarespace before you could have there was no squarespace you know what i'm saying before godaddy existed this guy was selling potato gun how to's on ebay dropping in the chat you haven't gotten it yet i see the garyvee it ain't him i lost people and that's fine i'm gonna sit if i'm gonna fill you in i get the prize the prize is to me and the answer is russell brunson of click funnels doesn't it make you mad to know that like this guy like everybody buys his software and like uses it even though they think it's gross this guy like got that way because he sold how to's on making potato guns on ebay well that's [ __ ] up well that's unacceptable to me that's unacceptable to me that is unacceptable to me as a woman as an entrepreneur as a human being as a mother as a as a wife as a future ex-wife um [Music] as a terrestrial of the earth as an inhabitant of the universe as somebody in the milky way i don't i don't appreciate it i don't appreciate it uh and i'm not i'm being funny right now but i will say that russell brunson like years ago has a very famous interview in which he compares himself to both hitler and jesus christ and he discusses hitler in an aspirational way as it applies to building an audience that's willing to do anything in your name so that's the russell brunson story behind the scenes that's the click funnels that's the heartwarming story of capitalism with a smile of capitalism with a bad haircut does that guy have a new haircut yet somebody rebrand that mother fucker's [ __ ] hair can somebody get in there and shave that guy's head and make him and just so he can reveal his true color reveal his true colors yeah anyway i could go on but i don't want to get censored by instagram so rebrand like an artist part two really it's about where we were formerly in the age of gaming the system through quantity and not quality through keywords through blasting the niches of it all um now we're in every niche has been blasted you know what i'm saying like kind of like me at the end of my 20s every hole actually no not every hole i'm actually i have a lot of uncharted territory actually i'm not going to pretend like i have been completely charted i haven't been charted i will say there's a lot to chart there's a lot to chart here and and and if you get it you get it and if you don't you don't so anyway that joke we're going to just leave that we're going to leave that we're going to talk we're going to return to that joke in about 20 years um but now it's not about quantity or it's not about quantity it's not about gaming the system it's about it is about ideas and it is about um the niche is not in like finding some weird blue ocean thing that you can then like tear apart through blood and like destruction and like slaughter which i guess is like the thing because if you have a blue ocean it'll eventually be red and i mean i guess we all have to surrender to that within capitalism but i'd rather not um spend my life thinking about a business analogy that makes me think about blood or the lack thereof you know i'm like i'm a woman okay so i've got that on my mind already a lot of the time um but what i want to say is a hopeful thing here is that we are in the age of we are in the age of the artist of of of and and here's what i would say so some of the argument out there is that we're all being commodified and like the man is turning all of us into products and like personal brands or just reflection of capitalism and neoliberalism and like duh yes of course i agree 100 with that but knowing that being angry about that standing up about that educating about that making instagram slideshows about that doing webinars about that writing blogs about that making videos about that isn't going to change that so i can either be upset about it and yet i i won't change it i'll be upset though i'll be aware and i'll be very aware and you'll be aware too or i can use it against i can i can infiltrate the system i can go into the inside i can make it an inside job i can use the system against itself i can take the rules and learn them so that i can use them against the system itself in as much as i can knowing that in the end of the day within capitalism we're all kind of playing the game and harming each other and it's like there's no do no harm it's like do as little harm as you [ __ ] possibly can maybe you know so here's what i want to say when i talk about when i saw the person who posted on instagram a few hours ago and i loved it it was this really fun slideshow of back in the day when i used to be an artist and now here i am but here is the me from years ago isn't that fun and i was like yes i live for that [ __ ] when i was an actor i used to like be obsessed with going to on people's websites and watching their reels i love watching other actors work i love watching their mashups of all the work they've done over the years i love seeing them grow i just love it i honestly love it and that's why i love going to people's um i love seeing i love like i'm like the weird friend that like when we become best friends like i will go into your instagram back to like 2009 i will look at every picture because i enjoy it because i like like she's having it but she's writing she's doing nothing um she's fine i just want you to know the screaming is mine um i like that and i'm weird like that my sister by the way i'll do that with my sister every once in a while or i'll like go back in time and i'll look at all her old albums i don't need more because she made them private she doesn't let me do it anymore but i got in trouble once because i did that and i was like commenting on stuff and she was like you commented on this picture and you knew it was gonna make my ex-boyfriend see it because he had commented on years ago and you knew you were doing this to hurt me i'm like no i was doing this because i love you i was doing it because i love you [Music] so if i ever go into your facebook albums back to 2009 i'm doing it because i love you i'm sorry i don't understand why this is a boundary for people if it is a boundary why is the photo why is the album i'm like dude it's your album is public why are you mad at me for liking things in it isn't that what we're all doing here aren't we supposed to be liking each other's content this is reverse psychology i don't get it my sister is an instagram influencer she's had 10k followers since before you could have 10k followers okay she had the swipe up feature this is before the swipe was even invented so i'm just like engaging on her content i'm trying to boost the algorithm and then i'm in trouble how did i get here how did we get here how the hell pan left close on the okay um that was a rent analogy that was a rent reference for anyone who isn't a theater kid and extremely uncomfortable right now because if you are a theater person that made you scream that maybe you would be like ooh go no don't do this don't do this to any of us please stop i i will say that i am not the person that will like you know the person i'm talking about that like you're at a college party and somebody finds out that somebody there is a theater major and now we're all singing rent stop it stop it stop it okay so let's go i mean let's just like we've been on a journey it's a sunday i mean guys i'm gonna take you actually let's go on a real journey though let's go on an actual journey i'm gonna show you i actually live in kind of a wonderland the former owners um did a lot of landscaping that i would never have paid for but i will certainly enjoy here i'll show you this in my backyard check out my backyard okay first of all let's first of all our home backs up to a park which is pretty sweet which means and like this is really spacious and i'm into that that's kind of like my thing i kind of think it's a human right to live in a beautiful place i think every human being deserves to live in a beautiful place it's kind of my like philosophy among other things because i think we all need a beautiful thing to recharge and like go and live this hard life of ours every human [ __ ] being deserves to live in a beautiful place okay so that's the park behind my house there's a cute little little little fence it's broken it's jagged gotta fix the jagged reed i don't know how to fix this i'm not i'm not tom sawyer isn't there a whole time so you're thinking about that okay so then we have this cute little drawbridge because sometimes if it rains this gets flooded and then the former owners as i said they put in this cute little like sandbox which i have to admit to you this feels not very functional to me i'm like how much can a child possibly love a sandbox for you need to need to make this a permanent staple of your yard wouldn't have been my choice if i if i had my druthers a permanent sandbox would not be my thing but here we are and we're we have a sam connection top pause due to core connection all right then over here oh we've got discipline happening and a tantrum all right i'm gonna i'm not gonna so then we've got a fire pit over here so this is where we're not on my friend who sets fires to your last [ __ ] she's got to come over first of all is this not the sexiest little roundabout situation look at these pillars guys and then look at the cute little roundabout there's a lot of seating so you guys can come when we eventually have retreats at the home office pal there's a lot of saving for an outdoor party in the summer and then there's this cute little fire pit thing right which we have only used a couple times decor decoratively aesthetically if you will but it's here and renata can you come over or what come over and let's put some fires in this pet if you know what i mean and then let's see what else alice can you show us your house can you show us your house can you give us a tour of your house [Music] well there's a house good job can you walk over there and show me your house so you can see that the whole backyard is paved which is pretty freaking awesome because then we can actually use it whereas often if you have like a yard with grass it's like what are you doing out here so having this paste is actually pretty sweet we've got this cute little bench i mean is this not idyllic i mean can you even right now can you even uh i wanted to wave at people i'm waving alice show us your uh so we've got this little cute little path and then elsa is going to give us a tour of her house beethoven says he wants to paint it he was like what do you want to paint it rage and i'm like you're gonna regret asking me that because i was like of course the only answer to this is rainbow the only and alice agrees i think alice what do you want to paint the house pink pink she says she wants to paint a pink okay well yeah we can do something like a salmon to listen this is not my if i have my brothers we would not this house would not be sage green but here we are here we are all right she's got her she's almost got her shoes on and she's going to give us a little tour of the house i mean is this not the cutest thing you've ever seen look at that drawbridge suburbia am i right this is suburbia people no honey i'm not inviting anyone over tonight i'm saying in general in theory in the future that's fine no no no no no no no no no i'm doing a live babe i'm doing a live i thought you were gonna get wait i thought you were gonna give us a tour of the house oh wait a minute we've been waiting for you to get your shoes on for nothing okay this is great what a letdown well i'll give you guys a tour i'll give you a tour of this dilapidated shack i'm kidding i'm kidding it's a palace it's a little tiny palace we'll probably do a renault on this next next summer once the home office pals is done we'll do the tiny home office pals but you can see i mean she's got a range in there she's got a sink she's got a you know it's got a whole thing she's got a view a million dollar view if you ask me one of the best in the neighborhood honestly we do have the real estate i mean to back up to this park listen i'm not rich enough i'm not rich enough to buy this real estate i'm just rich enough to sit alongside of real estate that belongs to the city okay that's how i do it all right so we've got two dogs and you're looking over here at puffy who's the mama where's karabong's puppy where's cutter bones cuddle bones is puffy's son now cup off he's mad puffy's like where's my son there he is cuddle bones come here so that's puffy's son cuddle bones and it's funny because he's way bigger than puppy but long story short is they puffy was born in mexico in san cristobal and then she had an affair with a passing drifter and got pregnant and had seven little puppies and this is one of them cuddle bones he used to be bony and now he's fat we were just talking about his plan because he's unhealthy the vet is upset about it we're working on it so puffy had seven little puppies she had an affair she had a romance she had puppies and we we raised them and then cuddle bones stay and that's the story of pup that's the story can you show me your house all right can you what are you making today what's on the menu what is on the menu wow all right so here's what i was gonna say to wrap up rebrand like an artist what what a journey we've been on what an adventure i want to invite you to bring art into your brand to not have to be one thing so i was talking to somebody they were like oh i don't know how i'm going to find a way to bring together my person like you know i want to talk about this and my business but is it right because it's my business and it's not my personal thing it's not my this and i used to be an actor i used to be a musician i used to be an artist i used to be a this i used to be that why used to bring it in this is the time i used to be a writer i used to be a poet i used to be a designer i used to be a graphic artist i used to be a teacher [Music] can you hear her bring it in this is the time this is the time and actually it's what i mean it's it's for me when i personally feel like i i think i might have mentioned you somebody said on social media a few weeks ago they're like i really think rachel if you had kept going i thought you were gonna make it you could have been an actor you could have gone all the way and i was like i'm not offended but i wanted to be like but i i i'm like well this person doesn't really see what's really going on here i'm like i did make it i am an actor i did go all the way and then i went and i went further than i ever imagined was possible i'm an actor i'm a writer i'm a director i'm a producer i'm a musician i'm a screenwriter i'm a web designer i'm a marketer i'm a brander i'm a creative director i'm an art director i'm a hundred more things that i didn't just name video producer editor filmographer i'm a i mean a memoir i mean like there's like storyteller like i haven't even hit the tip of the iceberg but i did just pick my nose on camera so we got that going for us i didn't just do that so we got that and going forward i am sitting outside of my robe while my neighbors watch me but what i wanted to say about branding like an artist rebranding like an artist part two free edition is i want to invite us all to bring the pieces of ourselves into our brands into our businesses that we said we once were oh i used to be uh i once had this gift but then i had to give it up because you can't make a living doing that now you can now you can i'm a working actor i'm not a starving actor either but clearly i'm very well fed i'm well fed i'm a well-fed actor i'm a well-fed artist i remember when i first started my business and people would ask me what i do and it took a lot of energy and it took a lot of strength and courage to say i'm a writer because that's really what i identified as when i first opened my business is i was more of a writer than anything and i actually transitioned into web design primarily because writing made me tired i was so tired by writing so people would ask me what do you do and i would say i'm a writer and it was very uncomfortable i felt like i didn't deserve to say that and at the time i actually for a very short time i worked with an organization at the time i think it was called art core and they sent artists to central america to use art as a tool for it was like peace corps but with art basically it was like peace corps what was that and i was gonna work with them it didn't work out it's a long story it's a long story read about it in my book uh the happiest divorce on earth dot com or you can also go to saw this coming a mile away dot com read about it in my book we have a commercial break for a silly goose are you a silly goose so the reason i bring up art core is i remember sitting in antigua guatemala at our training like there was like 12 of us we're all women we're all white women uh not all but most of us were white women artists from the united states sitting around and there was like a cellist and a muralist and a poet and a few visual artists and a filmmaker a documentarian who had done this amazing documentary and there was me there was that there was a playwright and there was a couple other there was a couple other artists as well and we're all sitting around talking about how none of us felt comfortable calling ourselves artists none of us i i just told you there was a cellist and a poet and a documentarian and a a couple of painters and a muralist and a playwright and me and uh oh there's a glass artist and there was like i mean damn there was some amazing artists and none of us felt comfortable calling ourselves obviously we're all like when do we get to call ourselves an artist when do we get to say it how much money do you have to make how many gigs do you have to do how many paintings do you have to sell how many is it when you're in a union is it when you make sag is it when you you know like when do you get to call yourself an artist and i remember we were all like we were all in our mid 20s ish a couple people a little older a couple people a little younger and we were all wrestling with this question when do you get to call yourself an artist and all of us i think came to the conclusion that we were allowed we had like a moment where like we're allowed to call ourselves artists and it was a thing and we toasted i think we were drinking i i think i got a pack of like guatemalan cigarettes i know i got a black guatemalan cigarettes at one point in this trip i don't know if it was then but i know it did happen that's a long story they were like called payasos i think which is the spanish word for clown i really strongly feel there is a brand of cigarettes called piazzos and i smoked i smoked them it was a bad time there were some things that happened you don't want to know actually multiple people got sexually assaulted on that trip which is great which is one of the reasons i didn't end up working with that organization oh oh you want to hear some funny story when i first arrived to do the training here if you're just joining me now i'm in antigua guatemala with this basically art based peace corps organization that sends artists into central american company countries to help help using art okay and i i arrive in antigua guatemala and the the organization founder who's also not a founder she's the director she was also a white woman she was like listen i did get kidnapped a couple times last year here's what you do if you get this is like our first meal i'm like eating a tortilla while she explains to me that i might get kidnapped in my job which is a reproductive rights organization in which i'm going to be using theater to help they actually wanted me to markedly reduce teen pregnancy through the use of theater they're like can you in in six months time can you reduce teen pregnancy using drama and i was like no no i can't but i still took the job and then i got there and they were like listen you might get kidnapped if you get kidnapped here's the plan okay and then in the midst of this a couple of my girlfriends got sexually assaulted and then other things happen other things happen too is the whole thing but why am i telling you this first of all because what the [ __ ] okay this is why by the way things like the peace corps are inherently flawed and i hate to say it i we can go into this another time but philanthropy is a business let's just say that boom so what was i gonna say here was the rebrand like so a bunch of us artists are sitting around a cellist a poet a muralist a bunch of visual artists a glass artist a documentarian a playwright me and some other folks and we're like we don't feel like we deserve to call ourselves artists what and we all gave ourselves permission to call our child call ourselves artists uh michelle i'm reading i'm reading that salvador yeah you know what it was bad there when i when i was living in chiapas mexico and i was living guatemala as well el salvador was was was struggling then too and and the things yeah again like i had girlfriends that had some stories and you know so but yeah i arrived to my job in guatemala they're like you might get kidnapped just deal with it it's a thing that happens you'll be fine and i was like will i i mean i had been living in mexico for several years at this point so it wasn't like a person from the united states of america but in and where i lived in chiapas no i was never briefed and told that i should just prepare for kidnapping imminent okay so i was not prepared emotionally for this so that's why i ended up with a pack of payaso cigarettes and i'm chain smoking them in this hostel in antigua guatemala being like i don't know if i'm prepared for this spoiler i wasn't i didn't i went back to mecca i was like you know what i enjoyed my life in chiapas i'm going back to chiapas mexico what i want to say is we're this group of actual artists sitting around saying we don't believe that we're allowed to be artists because society said that you're only an artist of what you make how much money a year is it the irs threshold for what's not a hobby when you're allowed to be an artist and also who says you can't be an artist in your business who said you can't be an artist and a business owner and who says that can't be the same business because like i said to the person in high school who says oh i really thought you could make it rka i really thought you could go all the way i did make it i did go all the way i am a working actor and it's far better than anything i could have done in hollywood or new york city um even if i was on snl the amount of creative freedom i have in my comedy i would love the lauren michael's money though and the opportunities and the doors it would open 100 but you don't go on snl because that's the job you want you go on snl because of the jobs that snl gives you later tina fey wasn't on snl because that fulfilled her although i'm sure it did to some degree she was on it because of everything she's done after snl right so that's kind of how i feel about that right is that like okay i've kind of gained a system now am i do i have that snl money no but i do have this i got two homes by the way look at that this is my summer home this is my summer home and this is my regular home it's not the prettiest color home but it is a home and i do have two of them technically i have four of them because i do have two cars so you could live in a car so i got four houses i got four homes i'm not trying to brag but i am trying to be honest so so yeah and i invite you to have the same ideology i invite you into this this perspective that you're an artist you're you are like people like to say oh i used to be this i back in the day when i was a blank well you still are like people from my high school be like oh back when i was a singer like people from my choir your community high school shout out to the dukes of mary shout out to the murderables i don't know how i could have possibly made madrigals and not made jazz choir it's still a trauma if anybody's i didn't make jazz square a couple years i understand i didn't make it and i know how to write read music i know how to sight read i know my solfege do re what's up i'm real proud let's do that again because i even know where to put it on my body still miss moe where you at miss moe where you at miss moziati she's a life coach now she's a life coach do can you can i get some like retroactive jazz choir admission now because i'm pissed i didn't make it i should have made it i think it was prejudice because i was like having trouble in the choir room the point is that we're all artists and that you're not used to be something and now you're not bad anymore you are that and we're in the age of the artists we're in the meech the niche free age the age where unless you can somehow gain the system through finding a niche that has yet to be exploited you're gonna have to compete on ideas and artistry so if you weren't an artist before you better become one because if you haven't heard my theory on this there's two kinds of successful business owners one of them is smart sorry one of them is lucky and stupid and one of them is a genius which one are you most of the people who no i have only attracted as clients geniuses brilliant visionary entrepreneurs savants if you will the ones who are multi multi-disciplinary the ones who are not only good at one thing the ones who are master marketers and the ones who are artists and the ones who have 10 different strengths that they apply in their business at any given day 100 in a week right those are the people i've served for the last 12 years so if you're here you're probably that who wants to figure out what the geniuses have going for them because the stupid lucky a stupid lucky person knows that their time is running out a stupid lucky person is just running against the clock trying to accumulate as much wealth as they can before time runs out right so if you really want to survive in 2021 you've got to embrace your inner genius your inner artist your inner visionary your inner savant your inter multi-disciplinary entrepreneur right it's it's not the age of the niche anymore it's the it's the age of the artist [ __ ] anymore am i right am i right am i right am i right am i right let's go it's not the age of the niche it's the age of the angry [ __ ] it's not the age of the niche it's the age of the artist [ __ ] what it's not the age of the niche it's the age of the creative [ __ ] it's not the age of the niche it's the knee age of the wild card [ __ ] yeah it's not the age of the niche it's the age of the wild garbage it's not the age of the niche it's the age of the wild garbage yeah it's not the age of a niche it's the age of the wild card [ __ ] so if you want to scratch an itch well it's the age of a wild card [ __ ] yeah i think that's a great way to end this it's not the age of a niche it's the age of the wild card [ __ ] oh it's not the age of the niche it's the age of the wild card [ __ ] oh it's not the age of the niche it's the age of the wild card beach it's not the age of the niche anymore it's the wage of the wild card beach anymore love you guys [Music] uh you", "V1Tv1IdCUp0": "hello you are here it is with designing healthy environments my name is alicia ponce and i am the founder and principal of ap monarch we are architects and sustainability consultants designing healthy environments and here we have josina morita good morning how are you doing good morning elise yeah we're good it's so good to see you um and i am excited to you know talk about water water reuse but before we get started i'm going to introduce you to talk a little bit about you um to our audience so josina wing marina is a commissioner of the metropolitan water reclamation district elected in 2016 she is the first asian american elected to a country-wide board in co county the second largest county in the country as an urban planner and policy advocate jasina brings expertise in equity policy land use stormwater and regional planning so we're going to be talking about what you have been doing since you have been elected exciting she is a founding chair of the asian american leader caucus she sits on the national blue ribbon commission for on-site non-potable water systems and the bi-national great lakes commission jazina's human rights racial justice and water justice work has been recognized locally and nationally in 2007 she was named one of the top 35 leaders under 35 fighting racism and poverty in chicago by the community renewable society renewal society in 2013 she received the emergent the emerging leader award from the illinois campaign for political reform and the breaking barriers awards from the chicago foundation for women in 2016 she was named one of the 50 young asian american stars in politics by asian fortune magazine in 2017 she receives a spirit of the river award and in 2019 she was named number 22 of the 40 people who made a difference in the last 40 years by friends of the chicago river and in 2018 she was recognized as a national water hero by water now she holds a ba in sociology and international race relations from pitzer college and a masters in urban planning and public policy from the university of illinois at chicago wow always weird to hear your bio written red for you but not for the rest of us and you know let's give it up for josina and especially we're celebrating women's history month and then how appropriate is that so first of all thank you so much for all the work that you do the advocacy that you do around water um you know facing what i'm looking at is you know we're facing a climate crisis right and so but i'm a firm believer that we have the tools and the resources to you know to be able to um live cohesively and coexist with nature right we have the technology and that's what we're going to talk about today so josina tell us about what you're up to or with water use sure i mean i think your audience probably more than the average person knows about metropolitan water reclamation district but just a little quick background i always say we're the most important agency that nobody knows exists we're a 1.2 billion dollar agency that covers storm and sewer water for all of cook county like you said which is the second largest county in uh the country about 10 million people um we have a huge tunnel and reservoir system uh the largest infrastructure project in u.s history that's still under construction um and so but even when that's completed the deep tunnel project uh it'll still equip hold about the equivalent of half an inch of rain on the county surface right when we started designing these things decades ago we were planning for these hundred year storms that had were supposed to happen every hundred years and now they happen multiple times a year and so like you said we are facing a climate crisis um in terms of the amount of the number of storms the intensity of storms um the amount of impermeable surface on the county's you know area holding older aging infrastructure that doesn't necessarily have the capacity um to hold uh these kind of storm capacities you know we talk about building these huge reservoirs to hold storm water but if we have really kind of old and small infrastructure to get it there we say it's like trying to get a bucket to another another bucket through a tiny straw um and so there's been a lot of uh investment in that which needs to continue uh but we also know that we kind of can't dig our way um entirely out of the situation and so we've been focusing on a lot of on-site capture strategies including green infrastructure we have our watershed management ordinance that's been updated that includes stormwater trading which is a little bit more of an innovation right now and then you know one thing that i've talked a lot about i grew up in california under drought conditions um and so moving to chicago and the great lakes region and seeing how much we take it for granted um i think that there is a lot of work to do on what you want to talk about which is water reuse both on the behavioral side on the consumer side but also on um the you know large scale industrial users and things like that so there's water conservation but there is also a huge amount of potential when it comes to water reuse and that's what i'm excited about i mean yeah coming from california i bet it's frustrating i always think about that because if it's not i mean we have lake michigan right and then and so it's not a pressing issue to us so we're not gonna worry about that right now not until it's like okay it's getting desperate here but we don't we want to be able to prepare you know for the future and for now actually and so as architects we want to we want to be able to push the envelope and look at strategies on these water reuse can we you know harvest rain water what are our opportunities there and also what are our challenges you know that's what i look at as well yeah i mean like you said the great lakes you know we're right on lake michigan it looks like an ocean we feel like it's ours yeah but it is something you know the great lakes we share with multiple states but also canada um and it's 90 of the us water supply 20 of the world's fresh surface water is in our backyard so not only opportunity but i really think about responsibility right we have a huge responsibility not just to those in illinois but to the entire region to the entire country and really um to the entire world in terms of how we protect um this natural drinking water source that is so necessary for human civilization and like you said you know i think it is a bit of human nature um to not deal with problems until they're you know so extreme that we're gonna die um you know and so i always kind of have this debate with different people some people think oh we don't have a supply problem in chicago but i would argue if you look at population growth if you look at the amount of water that people are consuming per day we consume over 100 gallons per day on average in the region while other countries are more less than half of that um that when you look at what our fair share of that water should be in a long-term trajectory that we do have a supply problem and we also just have a responsibility um and so there's a lot of work to be done around water conservation every world water day which is coming up march 22nd i launched a campaign called the million gallon challenge and it's a challenge for people to reduce their water footprint um so just like people talk a lot about carbon footprint uh there's a lot of really simple things that people can do you know i think sometimes environmentalists we focus on like oh take a short shower put a bucket in your shower and water your plants and while for those who are willing to do that that's fantastic but you're saving maybe 10 gallons of water at a time but by eating chicken instead of beef for one meal you can save 500 gallons of water by not buying that extra pair of jeans you can save over a thousand gallons of water and so the million gallon challenge gives you 20 you know very easy things that you can do that you commit to do we work with schools we're working with shed aquarium this year on this um last year world water day we saved 1.4 million gallons of water in one day um and so it's just showing how possible that is to little behavioral changes can have a big impact um and then like you're talking about you know particularly from an architectural standpoint um and for me as an urban planner is what what opportunities we have of larger scale right who are our largest water users and how do we change their behavior um to be able to save even larger you know amounts of water and like you said technology has changed dramatically you know people think of waste and it'll continue to change you know and and i think we should put it into think about it is mention this is potable water like what are the technologies that we can reuse water to make it potable right because each time we use it it's um this is portable water we're talking about um and you know your earlier you mentioned in our earlier conversations you mentioned uh of a pilot program right and like that is exciting can you talk about this i know it's one of my favorites and um so like you said you know potable water but i also really try to also also emphasize the people to think about the spectrum of water right i think we're very binary in this country where we think of good water and bad water so potable water is good water everything else is bad water but i say there's in that everything else category there's there's waste water of course kind of in toxic water black water on the extreme end but there's gray water there's rain water there's storm water and each of them has their own end use that that matches their water quality right and so the idea that we have to use potable water for everything is really a false concept i mean it's incredibly wasteful not just of water but incredibly wasteful of energy the majority of energy we use in this country is to treat move and and um and you know it is around water maintenance um and so it also reduces our carbon footprint in a lot of different ways too by by um changing this and so for instance storm water can be used for you know landscaping it can be used for irrigation systems it can be used for um you know a lot of different end uses car washing um things like that and then even taking the worst kind of water that people think of like wastewater we treat at our o'brien plant just down the street from where i am here in skokie we disinfect we do tertiary disinfection and the water that we re-release back into the chicago river is cleaner than river water i think i told you we made beer from it two years ago chicago's first effluent beer and it was so clean that we actually had to put things back into the water in order to make beer so you can take again the dirtiest water that people can think of and take it to the highest end point orange county and california actually takes treated wastewater and bottles it and sells it as bottled water i have some at my house right you know i drank it um i remember when i went to dc i brought it for senator durbin and senator duckworth to drink um and it tastes and looks it is potable water is there hesitation like thinking about our behaviors right is there like i don't know should i was there hesitation or other for me no because i know the science right um you know i think for the average person just the concept of something that used to be wastewater is you know a little squeamish um that's part of why i made beer out of it because i feel like um you know beer is seen as a little bit more gritty right uh people kind of and it's also very chicago um you know to have a beer you know and so i thought it was a good way to ease people in uh to the treated weight drinking treated waste water over just straight drinking water i mean it was something that we were able to do in our own capacity um here in chicago um so i think there is a little bit of a very but that's why you know thinking of fun ways like you know beer as a way to introduce people to the concept that you can drink this treated wastewater um and like you said there's you know there's so much opportunity so for us at mwrd we treat wastewater um it's not up to potable standards but it's much cleaner than river water for example and that's the kind of water that can be used for manufacturing again for landscaping in california they use it for a cooling tower cooling towers it can be used at airports uh you know for airplane washing de-icing can be used at their fire facility that they have at o'hare so one there's a huge amount of opportunity partly because of the huge amount of industrial and the two major airports that we have in chicago and then the location of our plants is actually along those industrial corridors so there's a lot of opportunity i think for partnership between our plants and the airport the two airports midway and o'hare are both near two of our plants um as well as a lot of the industrial companies so the pilot that you were talking about there's a tire making company called coppers right next to our stickney plant that's expressed interest we haven't gotten it off the ground yet but has expressed interest in using uh treated wastewater from our stickney plant over potable just one pilot at this one tire manufacturing company they were they're looking at uh taking a million gallons of of non-potable water a day so they're saving a million gallons of drinking water a day and a pilot a million gallons a day that's 365 million gallons a year three pilots just three pilots could get us to a billion gallons of water a year so to think about the opportunity of scale you know i think a lot of times when people think of water reuse they think about you know toilet flushing um and smaller scale opportunities which i think are really important in california they do a lot of laundry to landscape residential toilet flushing i think that's all very important but not as accessible for the average person and also not having the scale and so it's a kind of all of the above strategy but those scaled up industrial opportunities um golf courses for irrigation public parks for irrigation again airports for de-icing there's actually other models across the country where they take the non-potable water they de-ice the planes and then they take that de-icing liquid and they actually sell it because it's a good starter for a windshield wiper fluid wow so it's actually save it it's also getting a lot of those other contaminants out of the system but also into an end use that matches their water quality amazing josina i have a question here from a beloved cps teacher tiffany childress price she's actually happens to you know walk into our talk here on break she's teaching right now i happen to be on break with my first period and my chem class is talking about tds and water and chicago's water quality so she is teaching this right now and awesome hi tiffany thank you for tuning in um we have another question here catherine alias why is it why is the treated water cleaner than river water i mean one unfortunately because our river water is not the cleanest you know i think people you know may or may not know the history of the chicago river we used to put raw sewage into the chicago river um dead animals people probably are most familiar with bubbly creek you know it's not normal for a creek to bubble um and so there's huge amounts of sediment there's huge amount of contaminants and until we fully solve um a lot of our storm water problems there are still combined sewer overflows where we do have to re-release our combined storm and sewer water into our waterways and into lake michigan and so there are still a lot of challenges and problems um around um storm water and protecting our waterways in lake michigan and so and it's also a living body right um and so it's not that it's necessarily even unclean it's just not coatable and so the water that we take out of our treatment plants goes through multiple processes including a final ultraviolet um is our tertiary disinfection where it goes through ultraviolet light to kill the last layer of bacteria um and so that's what we release back into the river so partly because it's coming from a contained environment where it's being filtered and treated it's a lot cleaner than river water which parts of it are um dirty and there is still a lot of work to get our waterways to be recreational but part of it's also again just the natural life cycle um of of some of our waterways with living things in it um plants animals and things like that but yeah so that's why and i think that's what concerns people is you know the health aspect too that gets very sensitive and so i believe that our approach needs to be you know with very much in mind with health right because you know we start talking about oh we're gonna collect rain water or we're gonna store water and then you know we run into well what happens with legendary's disease right when we're looking at reusing water for our cooling towers um so that comes up and this is where we really want to push the envelope and make sure that it is safe that it is healthy and it's a it's a learning process it is and like you said it is very much a public health issue right and so all permits currently um and other states as well as illinois it goes through public health and that's who would regulate this kind of process and to give some context currently in illinois we don't have a standard process to certify non-potable water systems basically you're required to flush your toilet with drinking water you're required to wash your car with drinking water there is a special permit process um that you can go through you actually have to get permission from the governor and you can submit your plan for a non-potable so there are over 60 i believe currently permits of non-potable water systems in illinois but there isn't a clear process um in which you know here's a plug-and-play here's standard a for residential toilet flushing here is standard b for water quality that need you know here's storage you know um kind of standards and things like that because like you said water is a very dangerous thing when not treated properly and so things like standing water temperature flow all of those things are incredibly important and that's also why um another reason why i think a lot of the industrial and use is are you know both they have the scale but they also have the ability to be regulated by professionals um in a way that it's harder to regulate residential toilet flushing systems right that takes you know an average homeowner who may you know not have any kind of technical background and who may forget to change a filter or you know all these different things um that could happen um you know having it in a more professional contained environment um is i think a good place to start what about in terms of equity jasina um that this is where i you know we can also look at you know how is water reuse and equity how are you looking at that through that lens you know i mean access to water is a human rights issue it's an equity issue i think you know we think of people not having access to clean water as this third world issue that's over there right but it happens here in illinois it's happened in other places most famously in flint and we look at the water quality issues that are happening in houston right now but there are still huge parts of cook county and illinois that are still on well water there are areas that have privatized their water and had a number of issues with water quality particularly in the south suburbs so these issues are are very much at home you know happening here and it is absolutely an equity issue because it is of course the lower income communities that don't have the infrastructure investments and improvements to one protect their water source but also you know have been you know in my opinion sometimes preyed upon by some of these private companies and lured into privatization to fix short-term fiscal problems over long-term kind of uh water quality and and quality of life issues and so it's a difficult thing i don't think that it's a blame thing i just think it's a reality um and i think you know for people like me and government it's our job to proactively look at these inequities um and figure out how do we play a role in being proactive um and and filling those gaps like for instance we're in the process of shifting one of our um our stormwater projects we used to take shovel ready projects right so we basically say okay municipalities across cook county if you have a stormwater project that you want us to help support give us a shovel ready plan um and that sounds nice right it sounds easy because okay we don't want to interfere with municipalities if they don't want it done they come up with their ideas that fit their local needs but at the end of the day when you take a step back and you look at the municipalities in county not all municipalities have the capacity to even develop a shovel ready project right i mean a lot of municipalities are in a place where they're lucky if they have a roads and bridges person um let alone a storm water person or a water person or a planner and so they don't necessarily have the capacity to be developing shovel ready plans and so we're funding projects to to largely wealthier communities um and and kind of leaving a lot of communities that actually have the highest need um off the table and so shifting how we approach as government um you know how we make our investments how we make these decisions and filling some of those gaps in capacity um i think is an important role for us yeah so oh my gosh and we couldn't be luckier to have somebody like you to advocate for that and and that's what you know my area of interest is too is that when we plan for water reuse and this infrastructure and other areas you know now there's a push for decarbonization a serious push and um my voice is to say well how is this equitable right where let's really look at the big picture right um but because you know we know that uh communities of color are in areas where the qual the air quality is bad the water quality is bad and um so now that we're talking about this and planning for this you know let's look at it through an equitable lens you know let let's do this right right because like you we believe that everyone has a right to a space that brings them comfort and joy simply simply that and what is that you know access to water access to health healthy air um you know i'm gonna switch gears a little bit and talk about the ask you about land use as well and this exciting things you're doing with land use as the second largest landowner right we are the second largest landowners in cook county right after the cook county forest preserve um and as we know throughout the history of this country land is a huge issue um access to land and um you know access to green space things like that and as an urban planner and architects right a lot of times we talk about what is the highest and best use um and i think you know part of building equity into questions of land use is reevaluating how we think about highest and best use right that it's not necessarily where you can build the tallest building and make the most profit it is what is the kind of the vision for the community like we look at the example of the burnham plan right here in chicago that if that hadn't been part of his vision that highest and best youth meant protecting the lakefront what would chicago look like right now right many could say oh you could have made millions of dollars off of that property but what is the value to the civic life to the health um and kind of lifestyle of chicago it's a huge part of the identity a huge asset for the city of chicago to have that um but that took foresight and it took taking a step back and thinking about highest and best use in a different way so i mean i think that's one thing the other that we've been looking at and you know you know being in little village a community that i worked a lot with right you guys had the least amount of green space per capita um as a community a huge amount of industrial um and things like that so also thinking proactively about land use how do we protect green space how do we create green space um in communities in particular that don't have it right and i think oftentimes we look up of this model of large parks um and things like that i know little village has really embraced the model of pocket parks you know so also working with communities and community residents of what fits their vision of their community what fits their lifestyle culturally and in terms of accessibility things like that and so part of what i've been working on there is a great model that mwrd did with um in the 47th ward around irving park and um ashland or western area where mwrd had a small plot of land that you know didn't have a you know a real use uh in terms of a renter or lease or anything like that it was like less than an acre along the river bank kind of surrounded by residential and we found a creative way because we're not allowed to kind of give land uh to non-profits or communities but through an mou with a public entity of the local governmental entity that parcel that was being unused that was costing taxpayers because we were maintaining it didn't have a real kind of benefit to the community um or to the water environment we were able to create a partnership with the riverbank neighbors which was kind of a neighborhood association um in that area where they then turned it into a native plant area a path along the river a lot of the schools come annually and do water testing it really is just a place that communities particularly young people come and engage with the river and so it's a really great model and i was like that's great that we have that there on the north side but where else can we do it where else is it needed but where else is it possible particularly in communities of color so we've been doing a land use audit looking at all of our mwrd properties that might be viable for partnerships like that we're trying to look we look at our land use policy we actually have a study session at mwrd at the end of the month if people want to join to give input on what our land use policy should look like um and part of that is proactive community space to me part of it's also how do we regulate industrial users in different ways how do we open up our agricultural land use processes um our agricultural land leases are currently one year which is makes it really hard for people to plan and invest in the land and then some of our other pro leases in my opinion are a little bit maybe too long with industrial users um along the river and thinking about how do we shorten some of those leases and increase accountability um and and standards to protect that land and protect our our waterways but you know i'm really excited about the idea of expanding that riverbank uh neighbors model um to the south side uh you know to the south suburbs so that there are those places where you can engage along the road there is something different about a culture of like growing up as a young person and being able to touch nature right for those of us who live in the city you know again people kind of turn away from the river right it's something that you kind of have this stigma around that it's gross and it's dirty um and you know that has been the history but we're working to clean it um and part of what that's going to take is engaging the next generation and really like loving the river and investing in the river it definitely i mean creates an impact i mean that's the way i grew up you know close to nature access to nature and and and this is what i'm doing this is what i dedicate my life to you know um and i enjoy it so i see hi juan thank juan for signing in he's with asea he's a fan of designing healthy environments um talk about taking action josina you are doing amazing amazing things and we're lucky to have you you know out in the forefront of green infrastructure um you know your what your reuse policy reuse policy you know like we can that's where we can push the envelope right yeah and for you all as architects i mean i see your platinum um you know signs behind you i mean it's a tool that is just not available in our toolbox in illinois right so when you talk about platinum certification and these different things it's also another tool for design um and to exactly your point of designing healthy environments and um you know it's something that people are doing around the country people are doing around the world it's illegal to flush your toilet with drinking water in hong kong right um so it's it's how i think that there's some challenges it's not just as simple as saying we should do it um but i think it's a problem worth putting some time and energy into solving oh definitely and we're here to do it we're here to work with you and excited to work with you and to be able to one day have you know flush our toilets with you know uh treated water not potable water right i think it's possible i mean we're doing it they're doing it in california right and sit back and have a sip of effluent beer beer and celebrate right for our victory sandwich yes so i'd like to thank you so much for joining me um i could talk to you for many many more hours on this um uh we are happy to have you and talk about all of the proactive you know actions that you're taking thank you again i'm like speechless like my mind is really running here with so many so much hope and and you know the fact that you pointed out that these platinum you know certificates back here it's not just ap monarch right it takes it really takes a team it really takes the key stakeholders the owners to really believe that it's possible and it is you know and so i think that we are here we live in a great city with wonderful sustainability professionals of all industries and and we can build this way so that we're not rushing like say you know in an emergency like texas right where it was an awful situation we want to get to the point where you know we do have a peace of mind and be in our home or in our workplace and say i'm not you know emergencies happen but i'm taken care of right yeah i mean that's an important point too i feel like i became an urban planner because of katrina right um you know we saw this hurricane happen and everybody said oh this awful natural disaster um which it was an awful natural disaster but building an entire community of low-income black people below a levy that hasn't been invested in is not a natural disaster that is a man-made disaster um and it's up to people like us and you know again thank you for the work that you do to engage in these conversations because i think architects just like urban planners we're problem solvers right but we have to be asking the right questions about what kind of problems are we trying to solve um and embedding those questions around equity um are important to solving problems the right way without the unintended consequences of perpetuating inequities and um you know so i think that distinguishing between natural disasters and man-made disasters are incredibly important in our field yes and we will what a great way to just wrap it up thank you jasina um have a healthy week and once this pandemic is over we will continue to talk and drink uh beer with uh every beer i'll break i'll get you a bottle that treated wastewater uh too oh yeah and i want to see a poll you know start commenting after you watch this who would drink the water i mean i would i would try it if josina did it i would do it so thank you but have a wonderful week be healthy once again i'm alicia ponce founder and principal of ap monarch we are architects and sustainability consultants designing healthy environments thank you thanks you", "iJuapZdpnME": "cool i should go away boom so here the uh larynx is this all this stuff right here lab or is this powerpoint right relative important to you guys sure okay so what is the larynx well yeah it says right there it is the voice box good job yes it is the voice box so what is that no go back go back give me my pen so it is yes it is the voice box what does that mean one speaking sounds cool where is it located right near the epiglottis technically it's right here let me use a different color if you guys can see it better it's right around here so the larynx is so because it is inferior cutaneous with the trachea so it's basically going to be attached to the trachea so trachea food tube or air tube do not confuse them i know it sounds like it's a joke but students will always confuse those so the trachea is the air tube so larynx can provide three things it's going to provide an open airway what does that mean i'll show you what it means in a little bit switching mechanisms between food and air so the larynx helps with this but what specific muscle in general does this the epiglottis does that little flap right there sorry flap right here my bad flap right here will close up and close depending on what you're doing so normally when the muscle is relaxed is it up or down in a relaxed position are you always eating always breathing always breathing so that's gonna be up right so when you're breathing and talking it's up when you swallow or eat food swallowing actually cause the muscle to contract and it closes it what's up a little bit more in the digestive system but i bring that up because you guys know when a muscle is not doing anything or in its natural state it is considered a relaxed muscle when you make muscle move it's considered to be contracted we'll talk about the diaphragm because the diaphragm is a bit weird and how it works it works the opposite way as you think it does 17th epiglottis and then it has the vocal cords helps us make the sounds cool so we're going to move on so we're not reproductive yet so if you see a picture like this do not think it's the other organ it looks just very similar to this i make jokes like this but again the jokes i make are serious students have confused this with that before i don't know if students have never seen things like this before it's very easy to confuse them okay so the vocal cords are actually called chords because they are like little tiny uh taut strings right there so here's the opening that allows air to flow through and when it closes up air can get through what does that look like to you guys to cancer that's pus so you guys have you guys ever heard your vocal cords before you guys never heard your vocal chords by talking or screaming too much before yeah and it hurts some people have like can have infections on the vocal cords that's all that is right there it affects the vocal cords such as there there there there there there there not good if the vocal cords are infected can a person talk no so this is not going to be inner test but as you guys just know in general if you've ever hurt your vocal cords to see a patient that does tell them to drink warm tea and honey that works the best and tell them not to talk at all whispering actually hurts the vocal cords more than normal talking does because when you whisper you actually are force level chords in a almost in a semi-closed position to lower your pitch down all right so talking normally vocal chords are open and they're vibrating normally to whisper you're changing the way that they're working per word so it's actually more harmful to whisper than it is to talk okay trachea what's part of the trachea is the food tube or the other windpipe air the lungs so first off why is a trachea have these rings right here keep it open what are those rings made out of what type of cartilage hyaline cartilage good and the point of that is keep the airway open because right with a little bit we'll talk about some chemistry which i know you guys love talk about boyle's law and henry's law which are going to help you understand why we need pressure these things to keep open good here's a cross section this is more lab stuff right here but here's a big opening and here is cartilage so this is the front this is the back hey what's this thing right here esophagus so why you want the esophagus on the back of the trachea not the front of the trachea what goes down the esophagus food is everything a giant piece of food before your mouth if that was if this esophagus was in front of the trachea it would compress the trachea do you ever want to compress your trachea no that's what the esophagus is behind it good okay um going down here we have a right and a left so did your professors talk about the difference between the right and the left uh bronchis so i outlined it so they are connected right right and left one we'll go kind of go straight down more vertical one kind of takes a weird horizontal turn why is it why is the left like that heart's right here right the heart is going to be on the left side so long as it will compensate for that by being off centered a bit that makes sense that's more lab question this is a live and lecture question if you haven't had it which side is things more likely to get trapped inside of why so let's say of a patient little boy named tommy and tommy eats a rock and uh even the rock he's crying because his parent yelled at him and he's freaking out the rock will most likely fall down the right side because it doesn't have to make a sharp left turn does that make sense so when the patient is choking or if you feel someone's blocking the patient's lung always check the right than the left that could be allowed most likely as a lab question it could be a lecture question depending on who you have hall likes that question wireman and primacy you just like that question as well i don't know about barn too much okay um what is this right here tensialis muscle oh sorry trachealis muscle triglyce muscle's right here so going back to one another uh not only one sorry 200 210 21 210. what is ans autonomic what's that mean it's not involuntary right it's automatic what two systems control autonomic what is sympathetic fire flight what is stimulated by the sympathetic what stimulates synthetic what's the what's the hormone epinephrine norepinephrine right so if epinephrine is injected or epinephrine is released by your body what happens to your heart rate what happens to your breathing well the reason it increases is because the trachealis muscle actually um in a way uh relaxes more and it opens up your trachea even more so more air can rush in if if the muscle's stimulated by the pns the parasympathetic nervous system what happens to it and it contracts a little bit closes up right kind of doesn't co it doesn't tighten up all the way it is it a little bit right because we ever want our airways quickly collapsed why not is breathing kind of important kinda no you don't think breathing corn okay we'll talk about a little bit okay so yeah primary secondary and tertiary it goes primary to secondary to tertiary so primary is the biggest then it goes on the secondary which then branches off to tertiary which then branches off to bronchioles which in turn branch off the terminal bronchioles then which then branch off again to aviolar sacs everyone understands this so far okay bronchioles contain smooth muscle what does that mean guess we have smooth muscle can you control it yes or no yes you can't so a lot of our lung diseases are going to affect the trachea or the bronchials that's it everything else the trachea is a law it's basically a hollow cartilage cartilaginous tube make sense just kind of like just kind of the blood system we can only control the arterials we couldn't control the arteries the veins or the capillaries we can only control control one of them that's which of the entire system right that makes some sense here we can only control the bronchials and thus that will help us control our breathing okay boom so i doubt you have to examine anything in class about x-rays but just in the case that's too red madison you there yeah okay speaking sure first off lungs black should it be black yes that's air you see the x-ray the lung should be black because what color is bone white air in x-rays is black right so the lungs should be black what's that that's something that should be there the nail clipper right that's in the lung should it be there and look down here what do you see here you see white in the lung which right here should be black so that nail clipper destruction some airflow is that bad yeah that's how you look at x-rays with lungs it's not being very important now but in path of pathophysiology it will be you will give you give him x-ray pictures determine like hey what's kind of wrong with this lung and it's very very obvious ones but it's just nice to know what's going on okay again trachea primary secondary tertiary bronchioles bronchiolis terminal bronchiolis and then you go to aviola sacs so where does gas exchange occur gas exchange is caused in the aviola sac averyola sac right tube tube tube tube tube tube tube tube tube tube a little bit of muscle right here and then it's where gas exchange occurs so most of the lung really isn't important it's just a hollow tube to the outside world cool so here's what an inside of a of a sack looks like here are some sacks here they look like all the proteins wrapped around them got pulmonary vein and pulmonary artery going up cool okay so let's talk about some science let's talk about some things so when i say bronchodilation what's dilation mean expanding what's expanding the bronchials right bronchial constriction what's constricting cool so if something is similar so if it is actually activated by the sympathetic nervous system to open up the airways causing us to breathe easier parasympathetic cause it to contract a little bit right histamines what cells release histamines mast cells cool what do histamines do they're allergies they cause inflammation if a cell if if something's inflamed what's that mean it's big and red because of what what's red in our body look so something's inflamed it's big and red colored blood flows there if a lot of blood flow is in the bronchials right how big were the bronchials let's clear everything all right so i'll link this side yeah the bronchials are here how big are they not very big it's a lot of bug it's flown there what happens they collapse is that good no unfortunately our body doesn't know the difference it's going to do it on purpose because it's an outside source but it's not very good yes so inflammation is released when you're sick or hurts asthma who's asthma you guys have any of you guys have asthma oh you guys are all lucky darn so again bronchial bronchial nice bronchial unhappy bronchial it's red it's inflamed and it's got some mucous in it on top of that is that bronchial useless pretty much yes how would your body try fixing that issue with all that plugged up mucus you cough you try coughing it up okay well coughing things up do you cough are you inhaling or exhaling you're exhaling are you inhaling that moment in time no and that mucus could get dislodged again right so coughing isn't the best way of fixing asthma but your body is the smartest thing in the world it's going to fix the best way it knows how which means in the lung it's what it tries to do it tries to open up and cough to fix it we need to take albuterol which is the most common way asthma takes the inhaler is used a butyrole is a chemical it's going to cause bronchodilation now all the way back to beta 1 and beta 2. what's beta 2 going to affect lungs we have two lungs one heart right so butyrol is actually going to increase uh increase lung flow or lung ability because it's going to increase uh dilate bronchioles bronchodilation there is a little bit with beta one why would i also want to stimulate the heart with beta one more blood flow if the heart starts beating faster what are you going to do you're going to breathe because these two systems are connected right the circulatory system is connected because what's part of the what is what does the rights of the heart pump to the lungs right what's the left side pump too if your heart's beating faster blood's going to the lungs right if blood's in the lungs what's the lungs going to do get the blood out of there as fast as possible so if you increase heart rate you increase breathing the increased breathing increased heart rate they are connected it's very hard to do one of the other i'm not going to go in depth i don't think you guys need to just need to know that asthma is bad it's going to cause constriction and nuclear secretion because of some type of irritant so aviolis you have two types type one and type two type one called pneumocytes what does pneumo mean it means lung what does site mean so these are lung cells so long cell type one these are the ones that actually do gas exchange cool nemo site two produced thing called surfactant why is surfactant important it decreases surface tension so does air air have water in it yes or no are the lungs moist so inside these fluid filled sacs there is water what does water want to do by two beats of water they come together what happens they come together they form right water likes to form with each other so here's an light here's just one aviola the water is going to pull on each other because it wants to connect but also wants to connect with each other across the way too and you look at this what happens it's going to collapse the alveoli suck this is bad why because you can't breathe you can't exchange gas can exchange oxygen get rid of carbon dioxide so we have the surfactant which is basically a soapy material soap is a surfactant it just breaks up water tension right so we make the surfactant now the first time you're born the first breath you do it pops open your area lies and starts that's when you start producing surfactants however some infants very premature ones the last thing to be produced in our body is surfactant this being why would you start making surfactant if you're not going to be born yet right it's the lary lash enzyme protein that is made so premature infants have a higher risk of not having surfactant which can cause what to happen to their lungs the lungs can just collapse on themselves not good yeah we're not about water because water it's all good we talked about that already okay more of a sex boom okay it's just histology cool that one's done that makes sense everyone and any questions of the things i just covered that's more of lab stuff let's talk more about other stuff okay so the aviolites do they have contact with blood yes or no no there is a little little membrane between so the abla the right the area avli is separated by blood from pen it's separated from red blood cells in the bloodstream by the blood vessel itself the capillary his basement membrane and then the thing itself so it's separated by three layers all right looking at this is that thick yes or no do you want your avalanche to be thick or thin why what two gases carbon dioxide good what are some downsides to the avlis being super thin we already talked about one of them with water tension they can collapse very easily right if something gets inside of there they can burst very easily right that's why it's very that's why they are very they hurt very very very easily especially fluid starts being formed in there okay so what is diffusion from high to low or low to high right good a little bit more and then you guys ever heard of ammonia before what's pneumonia fluid in the lungs where in the lungs it's in the avo lives so when the sacs start producing fluid that's bad why can't breathe if you can't breathe what happens to you you die i keep saying this because pneumonia is a very very dangerous thing with the coronavirus most people really diet the virus itself the diet complications of pneumonia from the virus okay ammonia able is full of fluid that that sac right there it's useless until that fluid is gone so how do you fluid out you cough right sometimes i need the fluid out over time if that's not fixed this entire thing is dead great look at that lobe of the lung right there if that's all full of fluid that entire side of lung is dead it's not good that's why ammonia can kill you because it can slowly start suffocating your lung from being able to do things what's very interesting when you listen to this sometimes sometimes they're not fully full uh full of fluid so when they breathe it actually sounds like their uh lungs are cracking like rice krispies or see when you pour milk in a cereal that crackling sound so that's what the lungs sound like something like rice crackers because air is moving trying to move through the liquid causing it to almost think of a popping sound it's really interesting okay again normal lung white space a little bit of white space here not the best right this is very bad because a huge part of the lungs that is not doing that okay pleura so what's plura mean space right so the visceral air and the parietal layer what's the visceral air touch touch the lungs what's the parietal air touch everything else right so if you you have this and this you have a space in between which is the parietal space so parietal space is interesting because why do we want why do we want a big parietal space for the lungs why do we have extra parietal space there in the lungs what do you breathe in what does your lungs do they expand so we want some space where they can expand into right does it make sense cool there's a problem though that's empty space right what can fill in that empty space fluids do you want fluids pushing down in your lungs why not say for example this is full of blood because you get hit in the ribs and the ribs puncture the space now this place is forming with blood can this lung expand anymore no you also have pressure pushing down the lungs which means the lung is going to get squished can that lung breathe efficiently efficiently anymore no that's bad okay cool yep yep uh there is a little bit of fluid there and what that fluid does is it keeps the area nice and lubricated it's when when if the lungs ever tu if the visceral air ever touches the parietal layer they don't get inflamed right it's like it's a little bit of lubrication but very very few so one example is if the parietal space is punctured in causing pneumothorax which is a collapsed lung is that bad how would you fix that will cause the lung to collapse a lot of pressure is being pushed onto it so you need to figure a way of making the pressure normal again where the lung can expand normally right so normally something stuck into the lung if you cover the hole up and suck air out of the body it will usually expand back out very interesting enough kind of make some sense cool hemothorax blood so here's here's the difference we know it's hemothorax and pneumothorax what does pneumo mean air what is thorax borax is your chest cavity so what's in your chest cavity what's in your chest cavity so north orax there's air there's air pressing down on the lungs that's why i said if you suck the air out of here and close the wound up the lung will inflate back up normally a hemothorax what's hemo mean what's a thorax chest cavity so that was blood in the chest cavity that makes sense how would you fix the hemothorax just two and then we do what do you do with the chest tube so what up like this guy right here is doing fun cool okay now let's talk about what the lung does [Music] so lung has circulatory properties and respiratory properties we need to know both of them even though the rest story is not genetically done with it still comes up in play yay what law is that boyle's law so boyle's law says that pressure and volume are inversely directly uh inversely relation to each other basically if pressure goes up what does volume have to do go down and if pressure goes down what does volume have to do go up so this is how our lungs work i take a deep breath right my diaphragm expands right my chest cavity also expands so what happened to my volume in my chest it increased why is my weapons the pressure then it decreases so is the pressure inside my body less than the pressure on the outside of the air so where's it where does the air want to go no if i breathe in volumes volume is high here pressure's low air rushes in to fill in the space that's how inhalation works right exhalation is you relax everything goes back to normal pressure's equal breathe out breathing in requires effort breathing out is nice and relaxing so what that means is when you breathe in you're contracting your diaphragm so you inhale diaphragm has to move right that's contracting when you relax diaphragm gets smaller but that but it's relaxing in a way make sense so way of thinking about this is inhalation is a active process exhalation is a passive process you need to know that because it's going to come up with some diseases a little bit okay during exhalation pressure is equal or uh more inside the body than outside that's why air rates push out and wants to leave that cat just looks weird and does not look happy at all okay so basically what this is saying these this right here is saying what i was saying when you inhale diaphragm expands all the muscles in the um in the ribs they push the ribs out the chest gets bigger more volume less pressure air gets in exhalation uh diaphragm control contracts all the things go back out we push air out okay making sense what does inhalation mean breathe in it's also called inspiration so inspiration and inhalation means the same thing and they have expiration or exhalation which is just breathing out the terms can be used vice verse uh you can you can use vice versa so please know but please know the terms what they mean okay so the real story is basically thing i told you the only difference is that there's quiet breathing and there is uh loud breathing and that is a horse i believe where they're pumping air into the lungs so that's fun okay compliance so if someone is compliant what's that mean they're willing to do something right so if doctors are the word compliance it just means how willing the lung is to do something right so the lung is happy is it willing to do it is it wanting to do its job if the lung is unhappy it doesn't want to do its job what can make the lung unhappy it could be inflamed it could have pneumonia you could have the disease right all those make the compliance go down making sense cool okay um so what's going on here so what this diagram is showing is someone has someone who has emphysema someone has normal lung functions known as fibrosis so let's talk about this emphysema they're called pink puffers they're barrel chested what does that mean um so don't get there too yet i'll tell you later but if i say if i say barrel chested what's that mean with your chest it's big when does when does a normal person's chest get big during inhalation right so people with emphysema they're constantly in a stage of inhalation it makes sense means they basically can always breathe in air they're almost always breathing in air their chests are always it's always contracted that's why they can breathe in more air make sense so if you suck in more air chest gets bigger and bigger and bigger right issue is if the ch if the lungs are always almost in a state of inhalation can they contract to push air out easily no so they have a problem of breathing air out but have an easy time breathing air in that can make some sense what problems would you see in this person why are they called pink puffers is it a little oxygen in your blood yes or no yes because they can only almost breathe in they can't breathe out very well right so it's weird because their oxygen their blood has a lot of oxygen and co2 very very elevated levels of this which would be a problem later on we'll talk about right fibrosis what does fibrosis mean hardening the lungs the lungs are almost like stone almost right it's very very bad if the lungs are nice and hard can they expand and contract can they breathe well no are you bleeding are you okay okay make sure you're good that's what this lung is saying so who has the substance who has the substance air getting in the lungs would be fibrosis time getting out would be emphysema making some sense okay i don't know if a graph like this will be shown but that's what the graph is meaning okay when you're breathing in diaphragm moves up and air moves in okay here are the muscles that help all of them i doubt you need to know them but a lot of your muscles around the of the ribs help with this that make sense with that one madison you still with us cool make sure you didn't fall asleep again okay this is the one you probably want the most help with because this is all the terms of rates and volumes and compliance and stuff like that okay so first off respiratory rate it's a race if i say the word if i say the word rate what pops into your mind okay nothing then okay what should pop into your mind is time so respiratory time what's that means how many point i mean breath per minute volume do you know what volume means my chem students right is how much air is moved out right so ventilation is basically going to be how much air is moved out at a given time per breaths does that make sense that's what pulmonary ventilation is tidal volume is much error you breathe out per breath so are lungs are our lungs 100 efficient yes or no no when you breathe air in not all the air will get to the avioli sacs new gas exchange some air will be trapped in the bronchial and the trachea and the bronchials right that's referred to as dead space we don't care about it it's dead to us like my ex you guys are laughing now it's good okay aviola is we want the air to go cat that's laughing that's good so this freaky chart is going to be very helpful to us so i know it's out so i don't keep jumping back and forth so that we can just stay on this one chart and look at what these things mean okay first up tidal volume where do we talk about what title volume is tidal volume is how much air you breathe out per breath if you look it's pretty consistent through the entire thing right all these big jumps and divots that's not normal breathing then correct you look at it okay so we know that with tidal volume you only care about the normal breathing of inhalation exhalation inhalation exhalation okay next up is inspirational or inspiratories or inspiratory reserved volume what this means is how much air you can force into your lungs so it's it's the deepest breath you can get the force of any much air into your lungs as possible why is this important to look at if you're examining a patient if this number is low is that bad yes because they can't force air into their lungs should we be forcing irritable lungs at normal breathing no we should not be forcing air to lungs nor breathing right should be nice passive process are there times where during exercise we have to force air into our lungs deep breathing right so there are times where our body needs to do this as a doctor if this is super low it means the patient has a problem somewhere most likely the lungs can expand right which means some blockages occurring or dead tissues there fibrosis is a good example tuberculosis or other issues like that could occur i don't think you know i don't think you knew about tuberculosis in this class tuberculosis uh tuberculosis is a bacteria that gets into the lungs and starts making it swiss cheese it is and you start coughing you actually start coughing out lung because the lung has been broken down and again what do you what are you with something in your lung what do you do you cough it out so you actually start coughing out bits and pieces of your lungs yeah it's interesting and once you have tuberculosis you're you always have tuberculosis it comes in waves so those of you who are in 182 or microbiology endospores what are they dormant bacteria and an enclosed thing tuberculosis you can see the endospores you just can't get rid of them because they're inside the lung tissue what's the only way to get rid of it you have to go inside and cut the lung tissue out do you want to do operation in the lungs yes or no no because the lungs should repair itself no only one type of tissue can repair itself what's that one type of tissue that can regenerate the liver whatever is the only organ that can regenerate itself yep well why does the liver have to regenerate itself what's the liver do huh it filters or detoxifies our blood so if we drink copies about alcohol because it's i don't know st patrick's day weekend that poisons your liver so your liver actually kills itself to protect you so it needs to be able to regenerate itself okay now enough about that it's a little bit more over the lungs so up next instead of the exact opposite you have expiratory reserve volume and that is how much air you can force out so if that's a if that's very low is that bad as well means you can't force air out of your lungs yes it is very very bad those are the capacitors the volumes up next you have capacity well let's say you have one more residual volume and residual volume is a weird one and what residual volume is is you'll tell a patient this is how the best way to talk about residual volume is you tell patients to take do normal two normal breaths then breathe in as deep as possible then breathe out as much as possible right so right and how much ever much air is left in the lungs after that forceful breathing out is residual volume it's how much how much air is left in the lungs after trying to force all the air out does that make sense if there is residual volume there is trapped air in the lungs is that bad it could be it could not be right there always air always be trapped in lungs right if it's a lot of air trapped that's bad a little bit that's fine okay inspiration capacity inspiratory capacity is how much air they can force in their lungs after normal breath so you tell them to breathe normally and then deep breaths then exhale right that's how much air they can forcing with one deep breath it's different than the reserve volume because we reserve volume it's inhaling into the until it hurts and then stopping this is how much air you're forcing your lungs with one deep breath after normal breathing that makes sense cool and then you have functional residual capacity and this is how much air is in the lungs during normal breathing so this is the most important one you'll see in normal breathing it's the it's the curves of the tidal volume does that make sense and then total load capacity is how much air they can force in minus how much for air they can force out make sense the graph kind of make more sense in those words make more sense than they did before the entire point of this is to test for lung conditions right so the best way of looking at this is if it has inspire inspire it means breathe in expiratory breathe out right reserve volume so something if you're observing something what's that mean you're saving it right so if you're saving air you're not breathing out and trying to hold as much air as impossible right that's that's what reserve volume is you can imagine that right expiratory reserve volume so much air you can push out right it's volume capacity is something different and we have two more we have vital capacity and then total lung capacity vital capacity is just how much air you can breathe one deep breath and one exhale breath right that's vital if you if if you need air in a moment like in a crisis right as much air you can breathe in and out more quickly to save yourself that's vital air kind of makes some sense yeah madison that makes sense to you yep cool okay use those words already we use those words already kind of talked about that already okay gas laws so partial pressure which is dalton's law is saying that the pressure of air is the pressure of all the individual components by its abundance together right that's not important what's more important is henry's law and what henry law says is if i have this nice can i already cracked it open when i cracked it open what happens air goes out what henry loft says if i apply pressure in a gas with a liquid right the gas will go into the liquid if i compress gas enough it will be forced into liquid if i release the pressure what's the gas going to do it's going to leave the liquid this is very important because what's blood what's gat what's oxygen carbon dioxide so under henry's law if i force pressure into onto the blood i can force co2 and o2 into it and relax it i can force it out of it does it make sense that's why henry's law important is for breathing it's for blood and gas example is with soda okay so the big key ones for breathing are co2 o2 and nitrogen for this one weird example so co2 is very soluble in water which means if i put a little pressure on it it will go in water and dissolve in water o2 a little less so nitrogen it doesn't want to be with water at all because it's because it's a diatomic right it's non-reactive so here's do you guys think any of you guys ever gone scuba diving before you're scuba diving you have to pressurize yourself with air right because what's in there air correct is it just oxygen in there yes or no do you want to freeze straight oxygen no it's it oxygen puts all of the nitrogen a little carbon dioxide too right you want to want a mix of both but it's mainly oxygen but there is nitrogen in there so say you're in deep sea scuba diving right pressure is deeper in the bottom of the ocean at the top of the ocean bottom of the ocean right so all that pressure is pushing all the carbon dioxide and oxygen and nitrogen into my blood if i if i shoot up like a rocket too quickly what's all the gas going to do escape right which can cause a disease called benz now if i go from low low pressure to high pressure immediately i will blow up and explode hence if you go out in space your lungs blow up so does all your blood it boils immediately because of this now with scuba divers they if they accelerate too quickly nitrogen gets released too quickly which means bubbles start forming in their blood is that bad yeah bubble should not be in your blood which cause it can cause bends or decompression sickness that's why you have to kind of come up slowly over time now can you see this in other cases besides scuba diving well other cases is a patient under immense pressure airplanes so if you're in an airplane the airplane suddenly starts going down like a nosedive too quickly that's bad that's why airplanes just slowly descend and slowly ascend it makes sense but they kind of surplus city once or twice as they slowly descend right if a patient some patients are more um vulnerable to compression sickness than others depending on just how body chemistry works so someone is very very susceptible to it the pilot can actually cause depression in this a person normally doing something cool what other times can patients be under mens pressure besides flying you guys ever seen a uh sterile room before nope so you guys have not seen a cereal room before they're very interesting um you guys haven't been in an affected affected room before but basically it is a glass box which you have to walk into a room which shoots a bunch of air out at you to clean the room out so that it basically allows no of bacterial foreign bacteria inside the room it's a clean room basically the patient in the clean room is actually under more pressure than the outside and that is to keep everything inside the body outside the body so if you take the patient from the um clearing room and they throw outside real quickly they can get the depression sickness okay so pulmonary vein what's in the pulmonary what's the pulmonary vein carry oxygen or deoxygenated blood good that's why you have to think very carefully it's oxygenated pulmonary artery deoxygenated so the partial pressure of oxygen inside the pulmonary vein is super high does that make sense because it's carrying oxygenated blood where it's the heart pulmonary artery to 50 50. does that make sense cool so here's white gap here's why gaston exchange small distance there's a gradient gas molecules are actually liquid soluble and the lung is a giant surface area so if i were to take one of your lungs to base two lungs it's about as large as a tennis court if i unravel it has as much surface area which is very interesting same thing with the intestines if i unravel it's about the size of a football field so you have all that surface area inside your body which i think is very interesting okay so first things first deoxygenated blood high oxygen low oxygen deoxygenated blood low so when that deoxygenated blood comes up to the lungs right what's going to want to go into the blood oxygen right because it's going to diffusion high to low right so all the oxygen in the aviolites you know shoot and shoot into the blood right and then if i inhale right what's a lot of things they inhaled a lot of oxygen correct so all the co2 wants to leave because the blood has a lot of co2 in it not a lot of oxygen so they kind of switch places because of diffusion does that make sense that's the bare bones so now we'll talk about with the body if i think about my thumb right does my thumb have a lot of oxygen to it compared to my lungs yes or no no so when the blood reaches my thumb it's going to pause all the oxygen there and bring the co2 and that's help that's how the fusion works with the things does that kind of make some sense that's the primary concept of how how blood cells will load and unload co2 and oxygen all right blood cells remember this hemoglobin what's hemoglobin do carries oxygen what part of hemoglobin carrys the oxygen [Music] which part of the hemoglobin carries the oxygen is the alpha the beta or is this heme molecule it's the heme and what makes the hema iron so if i have an iron deficiency is my if i have a lot of heme in my blood no my transplant a lot of oxygen no i have anemia that's bad this is very common for vegetarians to have because it needs to be they don't eat a lot of protein a lot of protein how we make a lot of iron so that they take iron and stuff supplements okay i'm gonna press his name too okay moving on moving on i don't like this page i like this one much better now going back to my previous ones how it works is this is a tax deal well technically this is an uber i think this is an uber instead right so none of you are old enough but when you are you can celebrate st patrick's day right with your friends and when you celebrate st patrick's day what do you do you do the same package today what do most people do in st patrick's day they drink should you drink and drive did you just do this oh my god okay sure okay so that's you you should not drink and drive right you shouldn't most people do but you shouldn't so one little thing called uber or lyft right if you if you have a group of friends and one person suggests an uber they'll pay for it right hey i'm gonna hop on too because it's easier it's easier free right well two people pay for it it's cheaper than three people split the bill it's even cheaper give the fourth person in and then paying like a 20 buck a 20 buck ride to my house could now be like three bucks but i split my friends right boom so when one oxygen oxygen molecule binds to hemoglobin it makes room and it pulls more into it to be more efficient make sense the same thing is true when you force it out it can easily pop them out as well this making sense from my last analogy of it okay so if so normal oxygen levels should be between 90 95 to 100 percent if you fall below 90 blood oxygen levels you're considered hypoxia so 95 to 90 is that a big difference yes or no five so it's it's big it's not too big right i don't that's a big difference so that's what five points that's not a lot of points i dropped down to 80 and i'm already failing my lung my organs are dying right that's how you guys see your grades right this is good i know when kelsey madison see this on their test they start freaking out they're failing and then if any of you guys see this on your exams you're dying of a heart attack right pretty much body works the same way 80 or less you're just going to die not good and that's what these things measure now be lucky i had a my i i shadowed we had access to this i had an old ukrainian like nurse i had a shadow with she's like no you do old-fashioned way and i walk into a patient and then do the pressure and some people are very easy old people are pain in the butt to get blood pressure from because their skin is just so thin press too hard you're going to leave a bruise so it's very very hard so these things are a lifesaver use them as much as possible use technology okay so what this means is when oxygen is high in the blood and low in the tissues they swap if oxygen is ever low in the blood and high in the tissues is that bad yeah because you're pulling oxygen from the tissues into the blood to the fusion so when you're low on oxygen it's how organ failure occurs one because you're pulling any excess oxygen in the organs into the blood and then the organs can't get extra blood extra oxygen sorry that's why it's bad so it technically is a weird spiral here's what can affect hemoglobin i don't know why that's a ghost slash vampire that makes no sense okay so when the ph goes down and when ph goes down more acidic or less acidic so the ph goes down oxygen hops on the chemo a little bit easier now basically for this chapter if ph goes down means high co2 co2 is co2 is an acid so if you if you have hot if you have low ph in your blood sorry low ph in your blood right it means you have high co2 in your body all right that will affect hemoglobin because if you have a lot of co2 and not if you have if you have a lot of co2 not a lot of oxygen gas exchange will occur easier if you have high ph what's that mean basic so you have low you have low co2 means high uh high ph right which means you're saturated with oxygen are you going to give up oxygen easier yes or no no oxygens want to stay in the blood right it's not going to want to leave the blood okay with temperature if you are warmer oxygen's easier easier easily pop on and off which makes sense right because it temperature increases gas molecules move around easier right if your body is for some reason 10 degrees celsius which is almost freezing which is going to kill you right uh not good but you're not gonna exchange any oxygen because basically you're dead making some sense so high temps low ph hemoglobin is more efficient at low ph sorry high ph and low temperature hemoglobin is inefficient so when ph temperatures are opposite of each other it base ups each other it affects the effectiveness of hemoglobin making sense cool if your blood is above 7.6 it's considered alkalosis if it's less than seven point two except acidosis some point four is what we want it to be cool carbon dioxide cells converted it's also considered carbonic acid that's why you consider an acid okay the bohr effect there are two effects you guys need to know the bohr effect and then we'll talk about the hollow reflection like that so there's an h the bohr effect what this means is the higher amount of co2 in the body the more likely you are to take oxygen in because carbonic anhydrase will catalyze uh co2 into carbonic acid then carbonic acid then shoots it off as co2 here we go for example let's just say that's my thumb i'm i've been moving right it's going to give the blood it's blood it's co2 when the blood gives up its oxygen right they exchange each other well co2 plus is carbonic anhydrase will make carbonic acid that carbonic acid then sticks into the blood making it more acidic it makes sense that's how blood carries co2 around as it carries it in an acidic form as carbonic acid when you get to the lungs carbonic acid then breaks up to co2 and water we kick up the co2 and bring in oxygen does this make sense yes or no i think you're giving this weird look what's up okay so how does hemoglobin carry oxygen with iron right the heme group does heme work with co2 yes or no no it doesn't so we have to have some other way of making blood carry co2 it does that by taking the co2 and turning it into a larger molecule so it could trap it inside itself so step one right here this right here is considered a tissue right think of anything in the body that's not the lungs right so frank's on my thumbs my fingers my hands my biceps whatever you want right a lot of movement means you use a lot of oxygen up to make a lot of atp right you might need a lot of co2 is a byproduct so since you have high co2 yes or no so a lot of co2 here the blood oxygenated blood a lot of co2 a little bit of co2 little right diffusion where's the co2 going to go so neil what wants to go into the blood right oxygenated blood has a lot of oxygen right so it's going to going to give oxygen up and taking co2 well because uh blood can't carry carbon dioxide right it uses an amazon called carbonic anhydrase to take the co2 and make carbonic acid as a byproduct you make bicarbonate which is a buffer so it kind of makes an acid with a buffer so it kind of resists a little bit of the change of ph that makes sense that's why the normal blood pres little blood volume or blood ph should be 7.4 right even though i'm making my blood more acidic at the same time i'm also making a buffer to counteract it does that make some sense because chemistry what is buffer doing chemistry guys resist the change in ph right good now when i go to the lungs i have a lot of co2 in my blood not a lot of my lungs right so then i convert the carbonic acid to co2 and i breathe it out and i take oxygen in does that make sense this is the bohr effect for oxygen sorry for red blood cells to carry co2 they have to convert it into carbonic acid at the same time they can make an acid they also make bicarbonate which is a base so it lowers the p it lowers the ph a little bit but keeps it stabilized because of the buffer this makes some sense okay or effect again or effect again start with this a little bit double in a little bit uh so basically if you exercise ph of your blood is going to go down why more co2 so you're going to have more acidic blood good now we're talking a little parasites so what is this word fetal which means what babies i call babies what they are they are parasites they are parasites and here's why fetal hemoglobin has more affinity to oxygen than it does to normal hemoglobin so a little bundle of joy first has to attach to your uterus by fusing with your uterus so it literally fuses the uterus and starts stealing your blood from the blood it starts stealing your oxygen so what a prey woman have they have less blood less blood sugar and less oxygen in their blood fun they're little parasites so that's how people that's how babies breathe in the womb they literally steal the oxygen from the blood of the of the parent isn't it great it's cute you have a little fishy dinosaur talk about next exam um so i guess here we'll talk about this in a little bit but yeah llamas are very very good at absorbing things i don't know we have here i like llamas because llamas are better guard dogs than dogs are with with uh barn animals because if you get a llama in a herd of sheep it will actually become part of the herd and then protect them so when she get cold the lump will actually walk up to the coldest one and warm it up they all kind of cuddle together and then it protects it and what's really good about this is it eats the same thing sheeps does you can shed it for wool just like sheep around the same time so it's very efficient it's more efficient to get a llama and alpacas than it is to get guard dogs yes i did i'm going to that's the like after can i get my doctorate and stuff and actually you can afford time off i'm going to have tons of llamas and tons of goats and tons of that sheep the last thing's going to get because sheeps are hard to take care of because they are smart but dumb animals goats are great the problem with goats you need a lot of room because they have super hyperactive okay boom okay that is 15 now we're going to 16. okay what's up it is to keep the ph from going too too low so bicarbonate is a buffer all right bicarbonate same thing as baking soda so your body actually produces bacon soda very interesting so it keeps the ass the carbon uh carbonic acid from becoming too dangerous in the blood so keeps everything nice and normal chloride they switch yeah so chlorine is going to kind of counteract it so you have chlorine and bicarbonate in the blood so when chlorine binds to a hydrogen what do you make hcl strong or weak that's going to re that's going to lower ph even more right so if you have if your blood ever gets your ph gets too high your body will start it's making us a a hydrochloric acid to counteract it kind of what's going on there okay but very rare what okay go um oh we all do we do have to talk about dgg don't we uh i kind of skipped it because we're gonna mention that with uh because it's kind of weird to have it right here at dgg where's dg dpg dpg we're talking about with um the brain and stuff like that um so what's glycolysis glycolysis guys to make what glucose but red blood cells they're zombies what are they missing so red blood cells when they're born they're a nice actual like a spherical circle and when they graduate blood school we take the scooper and we scoop out the brain and the heart so this nice buying like there's a nice curve so when red blood cells perform glycolysis right they can only do glycolysis so what's going to build up what's going to build up sugar which they're going to use because they need normal functions make proteins and stuff right but as a byproduct glycolysis what do you make what's the end goal oh it's what's the last thing you making glycolysis cycle huh you don't remember anyone any guys remember oh no we don't remember what is the first step in the krebs cycle pyruvate guys make pyruvate they make pyruvate gotta run this with biochemistry make pyruvate but they don't have mitochondria right which is the krebs cycle so what's the part we're getting converted into no no acetylcholine is a second messenger it gets converted into lactic acid so they make lactic acid so what this goes on is when red blood cells make a lot of lactic acid they produce this thing called 2 2 3 dpg to kind of counteract it right basically seriously this means is red blood cells can make themselves acidic by making lactic acid if red blood cells are more acidic they can take in more oxygen does that make more sense because anyway if the ph decreases red blood cells become more tuned more efficient have more affinity for oxygen than co2 when ph increases the more affinity for co2 than oxygen does this make sense so basically this 2-3 dpg is saying is red blood cells in a way can make themselves more tuned to oxygen higher 2-3 pg means they are more tuned it means they are making more they have more lactic acid inside of them maybe what makes sense athena yeah you're saying yeah but you give me a weird confused look can i explain it a little bit differently okay lactic acid what is it what's lactic acid is it a base or is an acid it's an acid is going to increase ph or decrease ph let's go what okay i think it should increase for a second one of the conversation with you gonna decrease ph going back here oops a decreased ph makes it have a higher affinity to oxygen this two-three dpg you can notice two three diphosphate uh gly glycer 2-3-diphosphate glycerate right hey glycerate glycerate what does glycerate sound like huh sounds like pyruvate glycerate sounds like glucose to me right glycogluse right and a phosphate hey so basically what's going on is the red blood cell is making atp in a way right two three means it has diphosphate it has two phosphates right there's two phosphates diglycerate this is basically lactic acid so when lactic acid levels are high in the blood it's going to cause a decrease in ph which makes a more affinity to oxygen whoa that's where that don't wait uh sorry i misread that um yeah cool good more questions for me you didn't smell the study guide if you know what did you send me all the powerpoints at the study guide that were nice huh you didn't even study again this time yeah it's very nice the other study guide so i don't get questions to be asked it's all good because i probably have a lot of things you guys don't even know but it's fun to go over okay bohr effect was for co2 the halden effect is for oxygen hey and the lungs actually gets picked up and then it dumps it off woohoo that's pretty much it so boards and how co2 works howden's how oxygen works we already know kind of the oxygen works right we don't need to go in detail with it okay now we want to talk about this i don't want this corgis up there it's kind of weird so breathing voluntary involuntary or both it's both you can't control your breathing and you can still bring at the same time right hence why if someone ever says that drowning is the best way to die tell them they're stupid because if you try forcing yourself to drown your body is going to start gasping for air and you will violently fight ever seen movies if someone dies like like suffocate someone that's not how it's very hard to suffocate someone because the body will use all its strength it can to remove something so it can breathe it will fight itself to survive right you go into fight or flight mode adrenaline starts pumping people can lift cars when full of adrenaline i'm pretty sure you can punch and push something off of you it's very very hard to suffocate someone right so once we see a movie someone puts a pell over someone not heart it's very very hard to do that only would really work with old people so there if you have ideas go ahead so the two areas of the brain that are going to help with breathing are the pons and the medulla oblongata going back to 200 sorry 201 or 210 what's the pawns control rhythm or depth guys remember so pawns can control rhythm modula oblongata controls depth how i remember this is i see i always say medulla oblongata with a deeper voice so i know it has a depth to it medulla oblongata right pons is going to control rhythm which means it controls how fast or how slow you breathe modular control is how much air you inhale or exhale cool so dual obligate i don't like something what don't you dare tell me that's the exact opposite well apparently i'm wrong and google was wrong but do all of that sets the pace apparently stupid google okay i'm gonna do a lot of guys into the pace i am wrong so what do i got is gonna set the pace stupid they technically work together they do the same thing hey i hate the brain stem it's the right hate that's the dumbest part of the brain to me makes no sense okay so dorsal respiratory group drg it's only going to cause breathing inhalation so you know it's quiet and forced breathing what's quiet breathing normal breathing what's forced breathing gasping or if you can hear the person you sit to breathe that's not good so if you guys you luckily guys haven't done this yet because you haven't taken exams in person but i always got unlucky and sat next to the person who was gasping for breath during an exam it's very annoying also with my luck every time i fly i always sit next to a person who's terrified of flying and it's it's like they just start freaking out and it causes me to freak out because i don't they're gonna do it has worked every single time i've flown i've always sat next to someone who like has almost like a mental breakdown while flying which is very bad because i'm already a big guy in a small area next guy who's freaking out who's invading my space one person was like freaking out so much they literally started elbowing in the face because they were trying to freak out because they went off the plane as the plane was ascending so yeah it was fun also i was like i like to get window seats because i like to look at the window even though it's less room for me but i can't open the window because they freak out when they see how big this uh sky is i like the look down i love the feel i love the feeling of looking down that weird pit in your stomach i like that feeling other people don't so um oh fun fact real quick make it uh see you guys attention uh that pit in your stomach that's a natural response if you go run up to an edge of a building you can't force yourself to jump off if you try running off the building you literally will stop your brain stops you from continuing onwards try it with a guard rail with a guardrail right try try running right your brain will cause you to stop and look over the edge before you continue onwards it's a normal response you should have well well cliff jumping you can you can overreact while your brain things right but you with cliff jumping you usually have to look over the edge first to clarify you just can't just run over and just jump over a random edge right you can't do that and if you do force self to do that people have died of heart attacks it's happened before people have jumped off like that friends have kidnapped them and like took him on the helicopter ride and pushed them off at that light they were skydiving and they jumped off the table like that far and hit the ground and they died of heart attacks they thought they were falling because the brain doesn't know the heart doesn't know your body's stupid okay back to this fun fact for shane you learn how to kill people that's my forensic science degree so dorsal respiratory group so its dorsal is in the back of the front back of the front back of the medulla ventral is going to be in the front this is going to uh be respiratory uh sorry inhalation and exhalation but only with force breathing so this is where you start gasping for errors when that area gets lit up so quiet breathing inhalation it's usually breathing for two seconds breathe out for three seconds that's going to be your drg if you start gasping for air drg stimulates vg uh vrg which then causes you to start gasping for air and breathing faster pawns apparently it's the depth of it and you have two centers a i'm not going to practice like can i say that word i don't know apenostic i think aponustic center right which tells the drg to work drg is just normal breathing right so apenostic works with drg so that way when you breathe quietly it's not it's not you're not gasping for breath as breathing normally it's a it's normal inhalation exhalation all right the numer pneumotax center stops the apenistic center so basically can i get my mouse back please there we go this guy stops this guy from occurring so that way this controls making sure you breathe normally so now you're just gasping for breath so if a patient is just sitting there and is just breathing at a normal pace but is doing this something's wrong with this center of the brain and it's around the brain stem usually something bad happened to that person because the brain stems very very hard to hurt why is that the base of the neck how many injuries happen back here not a lot of injuries happen to base the spine or base of the spinal cord base of the brain stem okay so you think about it the optimistic center is inhibitor and that inhibits the inhibitor cool okay so what cranial nerves are these guys right here nine and ten so what's you guys at least know what 10 is right what's what's cranial number 10 vagus or vegas right everyone loves vegas so the vagus nerve is going which can going to control a lot of our breathing because it's a lot of the parasympathetic function right so if you mention cranial nerves especially number 10 that's going to mean you're going to decrease breathing cool um what's really interesting is you have stretch receptors in the muscles around your ribs why would you have stretch receptors there also in your diaphragm why would you have stretch receptors in there breathing if i could breathe in enough air right so you try breathing a lot of air it starts hurting it's because you're acting these stretch receptors saying hey you breathe you breathe enough exhale this air don't keep on breathing in make sense and that's why the stretch receptors go activate cranial nerve number 10 which then tells the lungs to chill out which forces you to breathe okay so chemoreceptors what do chemoreceptors measure what what chemicals cool mainly actually oxygen chemical carbon dioxide for this exam we're about focusing more on oxygen because oxygen is a bit more important than co2 right so if chemo receptors are activated um you're going to start breathing um start gasping for air and you can see that because each one is saying it's going to be stimulated by a change in o2 or ph okay boom why would they be connected to our corduroy arteries where the quartering what do the cor chord uh cortical arteries go to cortical coracle arteries go you're correct first time goes the brain all right what's your brain want good blood or bad blood good blood that's what goes on there that makes some sense okay okay almost done with the lungs thank god a lot of the lungs are it's repetition so hypercapnemia this means you have too much co2 in your blood is your blood to be acidic or basic low ph or high ph low ph you're good that's why i asked this question so everybody's ever heard of hyperventilation hyperventilation is what you guys do during exams right start panicking start gasping for air ever heard of hypoventilation it's the exact opposite no don't breathe so i experienced hyperventilation well i've seen more hyperventil hypoventilation hyperventilation when i worked with cadavers and gave tourists to cadavers to people what happens is people lock their legs and stop breathing if you lock your leg to stop breathing you pass out so hypoventilation can lead to passing out which means they're not breathing hyperventilation means you're start right you start boom start breathing out all your co2 and bring a lot of oxygen is that bad balance right you want a nice balance between co2 and oxygen if you if your body if your human receptors detect too much or too little co2 they're until your lungs either breathe less or breathe more okay so hyperventilation can cause numbiness it's uh numbness and tingling in the hands the feet the lips lightheadedness dizziness headaches chest pains flexor spasms of the hands and feet and slurred speech and sometimes fainting which i think is hilarious because if you experience these symptoms what do you do more you hyperventilate hyperventilation is a weird cycle because when you start hyperventilating you start feeling the sympathetic apprehensive links are freaking out even more which causes more hyperventilation okay this makes sense yes or no what's up athena you got a word here ask me a question what what's up well yes so if um if co2 is high right what's that what does that mean if co2 is high is the person breathing yes or no no so how do you know the co2 out of the body you're going to increase pace and increase depth right you're going to try forcing as much oxygen into the system as possible to counteract that does it make sense yes yes yes yes exactly with those ones just stop think about i you want you want you want high oxygen low co2 normally in a given state you won't be one but in the same measurement um in your exam though if it mentions low or high or something it means you're out of balance so we're not going to give you we're not gonna throw numbers at you guys okay emphysema also called copd so these are pink puffers right can i talk about i'll talk about talk about this later talk about now the back this dinosaur creature could freak out i don't know why i'll talk about in a little bit okay the availa sacs they can't compress so they're always inflated so you see these gigantic holes in the lungs it's going to cause the lung to breathe in more air right but can't breathe it out because you can't force the ox co2 out of the lungs so it makes sense as much as i hate the dinosaur these are the best pictures look up online looking for diseases because it tell either learn from the pictures or the words so this person has a barrel chest which means their chest cavity is almost always bigger and more like always inflating right because when you breathe in people's chest is chest get bigger correct okay up next really their lips are purse their lips actually inflate in a very pink color which is really weird emphysema has been caused by what not nicotine it's smoking smoking smoking's bad nicotine depending on things so the ribs are like just when you bruise it's kind of weird right it is it's exaggerated but when you breathe normally your lips don't flare up so if you look at someone breathing if their lips flare up when they purse it they're sucking in more air trying to breathe it out too it's really weird okay any of these words let's see thin appearance so it looks super thin i.e my grandpa because he has this if you're using your skeleton about your your rip your uh intercostal muscles to initiate breathing that's bad it's the diaphragm that you do 95 on the job intercostal muscles help a little bit right people's emphysema they're using a lot of their intercostal muscles right so what they're what they're what are they going to complain of chest pain because if you're working on muscle you don't normally work out right it's going to get inflamed for the first time there you go barrel chested they they have this they have they have a quick inhale and this huge exhale so mostly they're signing a lot other things that's interesting oh here is actually kind of cool so if you can walk with this person but like with a uh for the things called you put the ear to check heart rate if you check the back of the lung and you tap on it it sounds like a it sounds hollow which is really interesting because the air is full of lungs thus it's actually hollow very interesting you'll probably need all this know all this i just like talking about the diseases so if you have emphysema means they're going to have giant ela sacs and they can breathe in easily but breathe out hard why this old man right here carol chested looks too much like my grandpa scary okay so perfect person never smoked in their life hey if you smoked and then stop smoking you can actually get lung function back the problem is even even if you're old and you stop smoking you'll get lung function back that's kind of cool isn't it smoking bad get bronchitis what's bronch what's that mean what's the word bronch what pops into the word bronc bronchioles what's what's itis mean so and what's inflamed the bronchioles and what's chronic mean long-term or forever this is long-term inflammation the bronchials not good so you're asking why is it not good and why they show this picture right here look at the lungs do you see a little white specks in them remember that pictures showed the lung was nice and dark little white tiny little specks right that's mucus there's a lot of mucus filling up the lungs it's not gigantic it's not a big problem right with this person but hey if those mucus if the mucus gets further and further into the lungs what can it cause if mucus gets into the aviola sacs pneumonia is ammonia dangerous yes so bronchitis can lead to that lung cancer very very very very dangerous one third of all cancer deaths is lung cancer so squamous cell carcinoma so basically the bronchial will start becoming uh start getting tumors and very cancerous that bad because what's a tumor okay so here's my analogy cancer is just your cell having a temper tantrum so you guys ever babysit kids before what do kids not want to do at night go to sleep so what do they start doing temper tantrum right they don't start listening to any of the rules cancer is when cells don't stop multiplying they start doing weird random functions making weird proteins and they don't want to listen to apoptosis so they continue growing they start making rare proteins and they don't want to die right so what's going on is you start growing this massive tumor or massive growth do you want a massive growth in your lungs and your bronchials why not can't breathe right it's a blockage it's a blockage random thing right there that's bad again smoking can cause cancer lengths are there okay the most common is going to be squamous the least common but most dangerous is called oat cell that's what this picture right here is showing normally it might cause little tiny bumps oat cell causes like oats you guys ever seen oats before like horse feed like they're massive they have to feed horse right these massive growths in the lungs very very bad because they can metastasize easily which means they turn dangerous and start causing blockage yeah look at all this right here that's useless that's useless very very bad okay any more questions in the lungs for me most likely most of the tests will be on lung stuff respiratory system doesn't that look because digestion is easy because what it's it's very simple watch it's very straightforward we can finish digestive in like a couple seconds i thought i was scared because i thought i was it wasn't recording for a second like oh god no but i am cool so here's all your digestive system first off digestive starts where mouth cool then it goes where and the esophagus then goes where then it goes where then it goes where then it goes where you poop it out so digestive system internal external external it's weird if i took a piece of yarn and i ate it in this gigantic yarn ball right it would pass through my entire system right and still be connected to the yarn outside that doesn't cross any barriers right so your entire digestive system is considered an external organ system same thing with the lungs and same thing with what other system skin true most about reproductive organs that are also considered external organs because there is no membrane you have to cross that makes sense so first up energy ingestion which means you eat food enter mouth next up mechanical processing which means you chew what's chewing culves mastication now if you're in a party full of drunk people and start talking about mastication it's hilarious because they don't know where you they think you're saying uh other word besides mastication very fun word to say i like that word okay digestion means what breaking down am i absorbing food with digestion no secretion what are you secreting enzymes need to help with what digestion absorption is absorbing things lastly excretion please tell me none of you guys do this especially this one like what is going on like i can understand maybe this one or something like popping your back or stretching your arms but like no that's weird when would you have room to do this like this one right here this person's in pain i can see that like you're in pain you're leaning over like he really has to go but like if i ever saw someone do this i would just never try that person ever again i don't know why okay mastication you're going to crunch and eat your food [Music] what jaw muscle sorry first off what bone causes mastication good job what bone is this mandible's the only move part of your skull right good so your mandible and what muscles cause your jaw to move what mass yeah master right mastication master so it's a master muscles so they're going to help chew cool that's severe glands we have three key ones we have sub mandibular so what's sub mean the mandible where's the mandible located right so back here it's the biggest one because it does the most things it is seventy percent of the work then you have well technically it's not it's not the biggest one because right here these are technically bigger depending on the person um but could ever i had this guy was huge for some reason but said mandibular you're uh parthar can't say words petroids cyborgine parathroid para paratha there we go parotid saturated glands and then you have your sublingual where what's that mean below the tongue good so this guy right here will do a lot of the enzymes same thing with the uh periods sublingual is being a lot of lubrication basically first up parietals they're going to make amulets you need to amulets does what does any lace do carbohydrate carbs what do carbs get broken down into sugar good job you do have to know the duct unfortunately the stenson duct is for amylase the reason being what happens to the stenson duck is okay when's the stunt the stenson duck is blocked what's going to happen you can secrete it you just can't get rid of it can't empty it the sunset duck is where everything's drained into that's bad because where's all the excess saliva going to go in your mouth excess saliva is bad sublingual it's going to make a buffer and kind of a lubricant mainly basically i would mainly know the lubricant and then the revis read this revit i don't know some weird person made this one up huh rivenness yeah she said that we don't need to know the ducks okay then you don't even know ducks thank you for telling me to double the ducks then so what do you need ducks okay never mind then i was i would be a mean teacher because mandibular you're going to make this thing right here called glycoproteins mucous what is that that's the lubricant mainly it's going to be the main lubricant for glycoproteins and more amulets hey what does saliva help break down most of carbs because amylase for parietals and for some mandibular so what slave has been going to help with is analyse why how important is sugar in our body very important so once we start breaking that stuff down immediately does it make sense that's why i think a piece of bread put your mouth it actually starts dissolving in your mouth you keep it in your mouth long enough it actually will break down fully it's a weird experiment dr wiring would do in front of the class he gave me a cracker and told me to a saltine cracker told me to chew on it without swallowing it it literally gets smaller and smaller your mouth the longer it's in your mouth it's disgusting because it starts turning into time in your mouth yeah it's weird you don't think about it when food food the food you swallow it's really weird so saliva is mainly water this baby's weird i don't like it look at him he's not happy b what i love babies i love babies well that's when they're inside the womb and it's not my kid i love other people's kids i love toddlers more than babies because you actually talk and make callers do things babies are just gonna cry and poop and pee and do nothing they're cute i love them but i know my brain's going i can't kill that thing because it's cute adorable i have to protect it brain chemistry it's what it is it's again it's a parasite it's causing you to not want to kill it but parasites do there's literally a parasite that infects crabs which makes it care for the parasite egg sac like it's its own egg sac yeah yeah it's a parasite this is all part of evolution so we don't kill them because in reality babies are super annoying aren't they no you don't think so when a baby cries what's your first reaction make the baby stop crying right you don't punch the baby you hear the voice on the baby make it stop crying that is evolution making you oh no member species is dying or is hurt figure out fix it out what's your question what what is yeah yes it does a little bit okay it's full of everything else though hey really mention it here why would you have antibodies in your mouth bacteria why would your bacteria be inside your mouth you're eating food or you have this thing these things put things in their mouth all the time right again i'll bring it back to there makes you guys laugh so first functions fun ways to lubricate your mouth why because dry mouth sucks if your mouth is dry you try eating food what happens if i eat a tortilla chip my mouth is dry it's gonna start cutting my mouth right so it makes it uh makes it really hard also it moistens the food in my mouth makes it easier to chew so again like a tortilla chip makes it less hard makes it more soggy fun it then has chemicals that break down the food also it does is when saliva starts hitting your stomach it tells it to start going that makes sense so technically digestion doesn't start in your mouth but in reality it starts with your eyes you can start making start salivating before you eat food because you have to right because you want your mouth nice and wet before you eat food ha ha eyes in pavlov's dog which is a conditioned response so when you see the burger burger or the chick-fil-a sandwich or whatever food you find a feeling you start salivating salivation is it part of sympathetic parasitic para why rest and digest so most of the time we're talking about a nervous system with digestion what nervousness we're talking about parasympathetic if your sympathetic gets activated during digestion you stop hence why if you eat food and exercise immediately after eating what do you do you vomit because your body's like no not right now we're running for our life because exercise is scary okay so i know you guys are in high school but people could do this it's called leaking if you press on your sublingual salary glands you can shoot saliva out um snakes can do this with a parietal glands but that's why they make venom kind of cool i think this is disgusting though this is cool because yeah because um only guys will do this i've never seen a girl do this before i've only seen guys do it girls can do it but it's disgusting and guys are disgusting i'm a guy i know can't you accidentally do it you can yes you can actually do if you press down your tongue hard enough yes you can accidentally do it okay so halitosis is bad breath so you can clinically be diagnosed with bad breath look at these beautiful things right here this is why i'll never be a dentist i could be the mouth is interesting to me but it's the fact that also the same thing i couldn't be a a foot doctor a podiatrist because 95 of people don't take care of their mouth and don't take care of their feet so if you were if you're a dentist do people like dentists do you guys like going to the dentist you're weird both you have free health care and you come from so it's easier for you it's a lot of money but also you're the dentist you don't like it so when you people go to the dentist they go over the worst case ever so people's teeth look like this imagine digging around with there bad right same thing with podiatrists when do you go see a foot doctor when your foot's messed up right you start seeing weird gangrious or uh diabetic cases of it very weird okay um so what causes bad breath is bacteria growth is there inside the saliva or inside the tooth cavity you have worse breath in the morning morning breath because your mouth is dry if you start making saliva the antibacterial and the saliva will start killing all the excess bacteria and your breath might get a nice and clean might be cleaner if you eat garlic or onions the protein that makes garlic and onions smell actually is to get absorbed into your blood and then into your lungs and then you breathe it out very interesting cool hence it also goes in your blood and your sweat glands because when you start eating garlic and onions you start letting it out too eat a eat a clove of garlic and then start working out you actually can smell garlic from your sled yeah it's weird welcome to my italian grandpa when i was younger you would eat cloves of garlic legit just random cloves of garlic you would just eat it it was weird i like garlic but like not a clove by itself you could peel it and eat it that's no it's weird okay so we have paste maker and then paste setter so pacemakers for what organ paste setters for all the digestives this pacesetter causes a motion called peristalsis this motion is very hard for students to understand but basically the top closes and it moves the thing down slowly you can feel this sometimes in your stomach you can kind of feel the food moving you can feel part of someone kind of constricting and moving the food down slowly this is peristalsis movement the reason your digestive system does this is this is very passive because it just does it once and it goes all the way down moves the food boom when food is all this nice blob and kind it's called a bolus don't know why just is okay so peristaltic uh thing happens in the esophagus the stomach the small and the large intestine the larger testing is a bit different instead of being a nice smooth pushing down motion it's more of a circular motion because it starts cutting up the kind makes sense hence why you poop it's not one single giant log it's in bits and pieces sometimes that makes sense cool be weird um it depends on where it's located usually bolus is going to be in the esophagus before it gets to the stomach after something comes kind make sense or no yeah okay esophagus pretty much same thing as trachea only difference is it's got these things called sphincters what's a sphincter it's a door it's closed right what's the most common sphincter you guys know about you look at everything everybody look at a cat's butt you should see a sphincter the anus is a sphincter right it is a closed thing that can open yes sphincters all for the digestive system why what food doesn't go back out that's one reason also it's so we can set we can process food certain food at a given time right because does food come back out of the mouth sometimes yeah so speakers aren't perfect right they're not they help a lot but you're correct it does it's it's to prevent some backflow and it's to prevent it's for the processed food as it goes down okay so peristalsis is very interesting there are two waves primary wave which you show right here which is basically the top contracts and it slowly contracts the bottom and it slowly pushes the entire thing down there is a secondary wave and what the secondary wave is after it contracts it kind of relaxes a bit and then it contracts again that secondary wave of motion helps get food it gets blocked food gets blocked pretty easily if your throat is dry right has everyone's ever seen thick water before as you guys what thick water is guessing what thick water is so thick water is awesome yes old people have it so thick water is water that's thick yes i know it's cool it's gross don't drink it i've done it on there thick water it's thick water first off old people their salvar glands are less efficient which means their mouth is drier and since the since that's occurred also their muscles are weaker because there's old so a lot of the motion just move things in their mouth is hard so swelling is very hard function for them so it's easier for them to swallow a thick thing like this because when you swallow a little bit of thick water it's almost it kind of pulls more of it down with it very interesting don't drink it it's like jello or try it i don't know you might like it i guess i don't know yeah yay so swallowing also referred to as dilution can't be issued voluntarily can you swallow involuntarily no everybody ever get a dog ever like put a pill in someone's mouth and they see people like this you can cause someone to swallow if there's something in your mouth you will swallow you spit it out or swallow there's two options right if you massage the throat it will cause it to go down the tongue pushes back right and the swelling occurs everything else is out of your control that makes sense cool you have three phases bucal pharyngeal and then esophageal so the buccal phase is right when you push it back with your tongue so what happens here is the soft palate closes why does your soft palate close what's the soft palate do does it go up food should not go through your nose make sense when you vomit you you're forcing all the stuff in your stomach out through a lot of pressure right that's when you throw up it also goes through your nose as well because you actually are doing it so quickly it bypasses your soft palate also body's dumb your soft palate only closes when you're swallowing not what's when it comes back up yeah that's why it also comes out your nose so your soft palate closes so food can't go up into your sinuses and your nose next up what's anything that's first thing that's if it's the only thing going on right there it technically closes your soft palate and it's ready to go down next up pharyngeal epiglottis closes passes your epiglottis now it's in your esophagus it gets pushed down that's pretty much it that makes sense cool can you eat and breathe at the same time yes or no no what takes priority eating and breathing breathing this is why when you try eating while talking you would choke easier because your epiglottis doesn't know what to do okay and then finally the bolus enters your stomach yay epiglottis closes the tube you have an uppel an upper esophageal sphincter and a lower esophageal sphincter can you physically control these sphincters yes or no it's only once there's there's like three spins in the body you can control one of them is your anus you can physically control your anus good because that you get you stop yourself from pooping or you can stop yourself pooping mid pooping or before pooping it's weird talk about pooping a little bit okay but you any other speakers you can't control i got any questions of that one what's up what um the bladder is one and there's i think one more and it's a weird one it's um i forget where but it's around your rectum too it's one leading to your rectum but most time you can't control your sphincters okay heartburn what's heartburn acid goes where up where your esophagus what are some causes of heartburn you guys ever get heartburn before no you're lucky good what can cause heartburn eating too much why would eating too much cause heartburn inside your stomach right now stomach acid so they eat a lot of food right kind of like throwing rocks in a pond water goes higher higher and higher so the more food i have more stomach acid i need to make the more the acid moves up if the acid starts going past this lower esophageal sphincter in esophagus it burns it nothing that can cause it eating spicy food because eating spicy food actually causes you to make more stomach acid which then that roll goes up last way of doing it is if you eat and then lay down take a nap immediately afterwards because you're laying down it's easier to get the stop gel speaker than sitting up make sense okay i don't know why this guy looks like hitler to me doesn't he i just noticed that it just looks like hitler i got a mustache right there it's a shadow it looks like hitler which makes this even worse oh no that's bad okay heartburn good thing or bad thing yeah you got my joke now didn't you yeah right so look at the picture with the the spire there we go you got it now cap so what type of tissue is found in your in your esophagus try to fight spammers what type of tissue is found inside your stomach what simple columnar with what type of other modified cells goblet cells they have goblet cells make mucus right the reason you have goblet cells inside your stomach is to fight against stomach acid your body is dumb but also kind of smart if you keep on getting heartburn over and over and over and over and over again what happens your esophagus goes i'm done it starts turning the esophagus into stomach acid into stomach tissue that's called metaplasia you guys have heard of this word before plus morphosis in it metamorphosis means meta means changing in something so metaplasia means changing of of cells into something else so once a cell turns into different type of cell or tissue one tissue turns into a tissue that makes sense here's an issue though your esophagus is your esophagus is simple column certified columnar are for a reason if tissues start changing higher risk of cancer can occur when you have chronic heartburn it leads to something called barrett's esophagus or barrel barrels barrett's esophageal cancer or referred to as gerd before if you start burning your esophagus it starts becoming less esophagus esophagus it's so very very interesting okay segmentation what's segmentation mean you guys know food food food you're slowly segmenting the food and pushing it down slowly right sparrow salsas my bad that's peristalsis segmentation happens in your large intestine it starts breaking it down to segments why would you want to do that this happens your large intestine also in your small intestine absorption right increase surface area so i start someone throwing amazon's atom has a higher chance of activating interacting with these particles right hence also why your poop is weird it's contractions of random ways see this like this contracts here contracts here it breaks up the food in random ways cool so yep so technically anytime the peristalsis it is a motor neuron it's just involuntary motor neurons so what is going on here this is a stomach so you can see the stomach has what what's this big red thing right here muscle so can the stomach expand and contract yeah the sun can also kind of do some mechanical breakdown itself as well not very well but it can and that's what's trying to say is that there is these nerve plexuses that causing muscle contraction and muscle movement going on they break down way too much but basically your muscles can contract and cause things to occur yeah here's what's up with some hormones um a lot of these you don't have to know this picture's a really bad picture that shows a lot of them what all of them all but two okay these ones these ones are here so you know everything else then okay well these ones should make sense emilyn sounds like what else mla so what's it going to break down gastrin makes gas so you have stomach gas right it's going to help make stomach acid that's gastrointestinal girlin i think that's how you say it is going to help make hunger this tells you you're hungry the hunger hormone so when you start getting a rumbling in your stomach right that's that hormone telling you guys to eat secretion tells just tell your pancreas to start doing what secreting things right secretion tells other things to start secreting gip starts speaking uh interaction not interaction well bad word diamond spell uh we'll talk about that one a little bit mulcher and also talk about and then we'll talk about this one a little bit too okay it's all about in pancreas it helps it helps to create other things too it's going to make the pancreas start working to do things because pancreas creates two specific hormones besides insulin and glucagon because insulin and glucagon are those going to be internal or extra endocrine or exocrine insulin is it go does it go into your blood or into your stomach someone said it insulin it's is it in your blood or in your stomach it's in your blood which means is it on the outside or the inside of the body it's endocrine it's a hormone when the pancreas starts releasing something like amylase or like some protein ace right that's considered exocrine all these digestive organs all these digestive hormones are exocrine because technically they're secreting it into an outside source because you're someone's outside your body that makes sense do you think we have to know which ones are endocrine and nexus so far i'll tell you i'll tell you which one they come up but so far the ones i'm seeing up here are going to their endocrine or insulin and glucagon the rest are going to be exocrine actually this one right here might also be endocrine as well because you have still your brain you're hungry so how do you guys think you say this how do you think how do you think you say this word peritoneum welcome to the newest organ discovering the body peritoneum is an organ now you have parietal and visceral so again what's visceral mean parietal outside source you don't see these in the cadavers we remove the pair of perineum for a reason if you cut me open right now you'll see a sap containing all of my die all my digestive organs and my kidneys it separates the digestive organs from the rest of my body the digestive organs in the kidneys why why do i want my digestive organs and my kidneys to interact with the rest of my body what's inside your large intestine what's cellular testing guys poop your colon there's poop do you want poop inside your blood do you want poop touching your lungs and heart do you want urine touching your lungs and heart the peritoneum sac kits all the disgusting organs and keeps them away from all the good organs does that make sense that's how that works and also yeah what's up which one this one here um this is basically going to be the nerves that tells the intestines what to do the reason it's special is because the uh intestines are autonomic organs that are constantly going off at a given time does it make sense that's why they're special you better say mastication at dinner madison and talk about how food passes through okay what's up athena um yep why glossophjorgeal what's that what's that cranial nerve do that's the back two thirds of the mouth why is that important for diet for digestion you swallow that moves the tongue upwards that pushes the food down your esophageal and then vagus nerve is everything else that's parasympathetic does that make sense that's why it's so stupid that's why it says jupiter nerves okay you leaving too it's all good i'll sit in the video later okay um what's this right here so lumen what's a lemon inside of something right not a blood vessel any type of tube in the body so let's say i have a bunch of glucose molecules in there what are you what do you want your blood cells on this on the muco layer out here or the submucolar closer to the lumen where do you want them the arteries and capillaries and all that stuff where do you want them closer to the lumen or farther away from the lumen why if red bull if what's if blood supply is closer to the lumen can absorb things easier that's why it's important that they're in the sub mucol layer so that it can absorb things easier that makes sense that's why ready cat um does the city guide talk about the short reflexes and long long reflex of the digestive system at all or no okay okay so what the short reflexes are is basically going to be i eat food that causes the top of my larynx the top of my socks my esophagus to contract right which causes the next part to contract because the next part you could track these are short distances that cause certain reflexes make sense so these are very very very very very close together reflexes that occur for example when food enters my duodenum my first part of my small intestine or a contraction there is only going to affect those one things right long term or high these are when i start squeezing out enzymes and all this other stuff ahead of time does that make sense so short term is like things that happen now longer even these long term large scale things yes cns is involved yep you also can cause large peristaltic movements right so when would you need a big big large scale parasol stick movement you think it's blocked off start coughing right or you just squeeze something out of something you try to force yourself to pass bowel movements right you for you physically force yourself to contract there you go okay stomach more anatomy stuff but you could be asked large curve little curve you have to know these parts though cardia up here how iron or heartburn is the cardia of the stomach has to be attached that's why it's called heartburn because you're burning that you're burning the cardium of the heart fundus gonna be around this part of the law this part of the stomach the body main part of it and the pyloric side i would mainly know the cardia the body the pyloric part the fundus a little bit but the pyloric part is the most important part why is that why is the end of the stomach the most part part of the stomach yep because the pyloric side has this pyloric sphincter which leads into the duodenum or do a denim make some sense okay ooh okay so if you look at a stomach it actually looks like this so you guys ever you ever guys ever ever eat calcium before cow stomach before moonudo yep it's actually pretty good as long as you don't know what it is it's good the only part with menudo is it's chewy because it's stomach but it's really really good as long as you don't know what it is same with haggis you guys ever had haggis before it's stomach and it's uh sheep intestines filled with like spices and stuff yeah i like eating weird food but the problem is i like eating weird food and i know it's weird not weird food i mean because if you know what it is type of thing right if you don't know what is it's good and it has to be good because people eat it i mean like cow tongue's probably really good i would just eat cow tongue if i didn't know what it was i mean i can't just go cook a grilled couch and eat it that would just gross me out i mean i couldn't on a dare but consciously no okay stomach has four functions we store ingested food we help break down the food we start jumping chemicals and we produce intrinsic factors did i mention absorption at all does the stomach absorb food yes or no no stomach does not absorb food all the stomach is a giant full of acid okay so the two big parts the stomach are going to be three and four so what chemical helps break down a lot of the stuff in the stomach what chemical what what stomach acid made out of like gastrin hdl hydrochloric acid stomach acid that's the main acid gonna break things down right we're also gonna make pepsin which is also gonna help break down protein good intrinsic factor what's intrinsic factor what's interesting to use for guys last exam some blood last exam was blood wasn't it returned trace factor transit factor helps me intrinsic factor is vitamin b12 and vitamin b12 was what makes red blood cells you don't have enough vitamin b12 you can't make red blood cells you start making precious anemia vegans have preschemia because they need to eat protein to get it from protein so this is what's going on that's what's very important it helps make vitamin b12 now do you need something to survive yes or no no you can live without your stomach you just can't eat big food you will be eat little food okay so we have two types of majors we have technically three cells in the uh in the stomach and those are parietal cells g cells and chief cells we also these things called d cells but those work in conjunction with g cells okay so parental cells release what hcl and a little bit of intrinsic factor if you don't have intrinsic factor red blood cells die so parietal cells make the hydrochloric acid what do chief cells make they make pepsinogen what's the gin part mean what well yeah but what's gin what does gen mean in latin like genesis beginning right so this is the beginning of pepsin so pepsin is inactive until it comes in contact with hydrochloric acid hydrochloric acid becomes pepsin which sounds like what what does pepsin sound like pepsi if you have access to cheap meat and have a can of pepsi get the bowl put up put a bowl of cheap meat dump the pepsi on it come back a week or two later it actually breaks it apart yeah they used pepsi and coke to clean the roadways from like crime scenes you can use pepsico to clean away blood and stuff and you drink that stuff that's it's interesting so pepsinogen or pepsin helps break down protein so what is where does protein starts getting breaking down into in your stomach right so you don't start breaking up protein in your mouth it starts being broken down into the stomach area okay g cells produce gastrin gastrin stimulates parietal cells it gets the gases going gas hydrochloric acid d cells are going to make somatostatin it's metastatin is what huh growth growth inhibitor hormone so when you're growing you have to eat a lot of food if you're not growing you have to eat a lot of food if you're not growing you still do yes but you eat less food all right so amount of satin is going to cause you to stop growing unless you need less calories so that you start you inhibit gastrins this makes sense okay so phases of gastric secretion it's affiliate gastric and intestinal and then it breaks apart right there for some reason uh so weird we're on we are on 19th on at 20. cool cephalic phase this is when you see spell taste or think of food you start salivating all that saliva starts going down to your stomach right yes what's up oh purple pill yeah i know okay hydrophoric acid stronger weak so what's that mean so it's 100 right so hydrochloric acid becomes this plus this what is this guy right here called what's a charged hydrogen called a proton i pump protons into my stomach into my parietal cells to make hydrochloric acid right so hydrochloric acid is made broken apart because it reacts instantly right and then it's recycled back into the parietal cells and pump back out does that make sense so what these purple pro ppi protein inhibitor pumps do they stop you from being able to pump those back out into the stomach effectively doing what if i can't push if i can't push out hydrochloric acid i'm on parietal cells can i make can i make stomach acid effectively what happens i stop my digestive happening why would you want to stop digestion if you upset stomach right if i have a stomach ulcer or a heartburn i can stop the acid being formed right because if you have heartburn it means you already have acid all the way up to your cardiac sphincter right do you need any more acid no so you can stop the acid from coming back out temporarily that makes sense yep it basically stops hydrochloric acid from coming out of parietal cells you stop bleeding good okay all good cool okay if you have more questions let me know because i mean if they're being mentioned on the on the study guide they're probably important so feel like a cephalic phase so you start do you start like i said elevating this is going to cause your stomach to go hey food's coming right because again your body's dumb if you think about food your stomach starts grumbling because it wants food it's already it's already making the stomach acid right so it's going to start making uh the parietal cells start releasing hydrochloric acid pepsinogenic disrespect cells and then mucol cells start making what mucus to protect itself from hydrochloric acid so your stomach is ready to receive the food that makes sense this is caused by you give me a word look emily you're good i know okay you give me like a weird weird look okay why is it like that excuse me or whatever okay this is directed by your cns kind of weird to think about right why is it strict why you seeing this cranial nerves what cranial nerve biggest it's a cranial nerve which means it's part of your cns good job gastric this is when food is inside the stomach you start breaking it down num num nummy start breaking down the food it's entering your stomach party time happening inching enough what causes the sensation being full do you know first off why can i not right oh there you go cool caught the sensation of feeling full comes from stretch reflexes of the stomach so the stomach expands enough you feel full that makes sense that's why you can eat like you could be eating food and then you just take one more bite and then you feel you feel you're gonna throw up right at that one bite right if it takes time for that signal to reach your brain that's why you're supposed to eat a little wait a little bit eat a bit more wait a little bit instead of gorging yourself on food really quickly because that's what causes people to feel that bloated sensation you should not feel bloated from eating a normal food meal either you ate too quickly or eat too much if you feel bloated intestinal phase where's the food going now in the into the intestines cool after several hours of mixing how long does food stay in the stomach for two to four hours so your food food stays inside for two to four hours that's kind of cool i think so so if you ate lunch uh at four o'clock your food you're still your food is now just now entering your small intestine cool going on here as food is leaving what's to happen here is your chief cells and parietal cells are going to turn off because do you need to continue making hydrochloric acid if your stomach's become empty in a couple seconds no and what's going on here cck gip and secretin are going to turn those off we'll talk about cck gip and secretin is a little bit but those are going to turn off those things okay digest in the stomach the stomach can hold up to a liter of liter and a half of food so it's a lot of food the stomach can break down carbohydrates amylase did i mention amylase from the hormones the stomach can make yes or no so where's the amylase come from it comes with your saliva so this food you still ate is covered in your saliva as it goes into your stomach so that's good there i didn't mention this a little bit but there is a little bit of lip base there what's lip base do breaks down fats but most of your fat going to happen in your small intestine there's a reason why a little bit so stomach acid or some ph your stomach's about two which is very very low pepsin increase activity at lower phs um go yeah most of it's absorbed in the small intestine okay ulcers so if some reason uh mu cells aren't producing mucus hydrochloric acid will eat the lighting of the cell the flooding of the stomach right which forms an ulcer what do ulcers do they bleed so stomach their someone has a lot of blood in it right so if you poop and your stool is a deep dark red it means you probably have a problem in your stomach if you poop and the blood is nice and bright a problem in your large intestine reason being if you leave blood out for a long time what happens to it darker or lighter darker that's why that's why if you if you have really dark like dark like uh like burgundy red poop most likely have a stomach ulcer nice so depending on listen where the holster is located it could be a peptic ulcer it could be a duodenum ulcer depending on where it's located if it's ulcer do a denim or duodenum there peptic ulcer or more in the stomach they're nasty cat small intestine three parts which part's the biggest do a denim vegetable ilium ilium is the biggest alien is 16 to 20 feet long this is the reason why do a denim has one purpose what's the purpose of do a denim do you guys know no okay well let's talk about that then cat huh good it raises ph the whole function to do a denim is to raise ph what's what's what's the function that do it uh other uh jugenim ah 18 hour days no work well jujuno what's part of the jujuno what's the function of it that's where all the amazons start being released what's part of the ilium that's where all the absorption is going to take place that's why it needs to be the longest because all the absorption takes place there okay small system is very vascular why absorption don't use this on cadavers it's kind of cool it's not as clear it's not a see-through because the cameras are kind of disgusting but you can see the capillaries inside of there very very cool cat interstitial glands so they're going to secrete into the stomach what's the purpose of the lie that's microvilli what's between villa and microvilli what yes so villi are these long hair like projectiles like these big long ones and on these long vli if they're tiny hair like projectiles those are microvilli they're connected to each other makes sense cat what's the person microvilli what why do you want to increase surface area in the stomach all right small intestine you're right okay the do a dental glands so it's called the bruner's gland this is gonna help lo sorry raise ph as it enters the small intestine okay um here's the phone oh what's so weird i don't know what way to set up okay cool we talk about this and then we go okay sure intestinal glands antropidase it's a brush border enzyme what's that mean you guys know talk about a little bit enterprise peptide sr entero peptidase is also going to activate the pancreatic enzymes enteroendocrine cells hey endocrine cells they're more hormonal based that make some sense yeah burp or enzymes they're going to help break up those sugars those complicated sugars so we're going to help break down disatcharize and try saturated into monosaturates so like maltose sucrose and lactose are complicated sugars that break down to sorry maltese sucrase and lactase breakdown to maltose glucose and suturos and lactose glucose okay hydrolyze what's this mean break with water water salt okay so if i have maltose or complex sugar and i break it up with water i make simple sugar if i have a protein i break it with water i make amino acids if i break up a lipid with water i make fatty acids and glycerol i guess just showing that we're breaking up the starch potato and to making sugar i guess i i don't like this picture especially since the controversy mr potato heads the thing sorry potato head it's it i just i think it's hilarious the controversy i mean i don't know why he needs a gender when i had mr potato head i would make his eyes the i would make his arms the eyes and his ears then uh would make him a weird mod like like a weird creature it wasn't even human it was it was a weird like uh eyes well arms for eyes person okay take about five hours for food to probably pass your sp into your small food from your uh to your small intestines why do you want it to take so long absorption i'll keep saying this because guess what it's important pancreas it's exocrine which means it releases digestive organs and endocrine which releases hormones inside the digestive system test are we care about the endocrine or the exocrine ones the exocrine ones good okay the pancreas attaches to the duodenum so all it's gonna release its hormones uh no hormones sorry it's enzymes very very quickly okay pancreatic amylase what do you think that helps break down whoa where's it come from wow we broke it down so if you see the word pancreatic amylase you know it keeps the pancreas and amylase pancreatic lipase helps break down what fats it helps break down fats but fats are a problem who here uses the bars of soap in the shower now you guys use bars of soap in the shower you guys use bars of soap when washing your hands at all has ever used a bar of soap before in your life at hotels okay why why do bars of soap suck okay that's one thing when you try grabbing your hands wet slippery why is it slippery because it's made out of fat you know old old soaps we got like whale fat right and sheep fat so the fat in our body acts like that so when the enzymes try attacking the soap it just kind of slips out of it it works a little bit like a little bit studs in a bar of soap but not a lot so we need a way to make the soap hard we'll talk about that we talk about the gallbladder nuclease what do you think that helps break down nucleic acids hey nucleic acids are what help make up what what are nucleic acids dna and rna which so name them what yeah what what are the acids what are they what are the building blocks of those adenine guanine cyan thynine good uracil neurocellulose that's helpful uh protate protaste is gonna help break down that peptidase peptides um yeah pro enzymes are enzymes that are activated by a condition so technically pepsinogen is considered a pro-enzyme because it has to be activated by a hydrochloric acid hey gallbladder here we talk about it the gallbladder is going to help emulsify fats that was weird to help with emulsification of fats which basically means it makes the fat makes fats nice and hard and solid so the enzymes can break it apart does that make sense otherwise they kind of slip out of the enzyme's grasp like a bar so that's what's going on here okay bile the only colored part of your cadaver should be the bile part it's nice and green because bile is what color green good it is stored in gold butter but it's made in the liver so do you need your gallbladder to survive no and my theory is that it's a useless organ that should be removed immediately because it's going to make gallstones hey look it right here gallstones the words coal means gallbladder and this right here just means stone cholesterol clefus i say cholithosis gallstones now gallstones can be your goldstone can be completely blacked up like this guy go back to this guy or little tiny parts because gallstones hardened fat right and part of the gallbladder enzyme right the bile is fat so it can technically harden itself that's what causes the stones to accumulate just go straight to the digest system from the liver right now if you if you're not digesting food right you're making bile it's just your liver you can't store it so it just releases it so i mean it means if you if your gallbladder is removed you can't eat your you can't eat a lot of fatty foods because it upsets your stomach more but it's on the end of the world what's interesting your poop starts floating more because your poop's full of fat food which is interesting okay um yay gold bladder stones i hate them okay can you have i had them no i've only had kidney stones um i'm genetically disposed to have kidney stones and gallbladder stones so i'm just waiting yeah my my jeans are stuck cap forgot the stupid image i love this image no it's not he's useless this can kill you he's trying but he's killing people sure he made him great this is why you're the type of people who put your like your kid drew like a crappy house you put it onto the refrigerator don't you yeah i wouldn't immediately take it out when he's not looking he's talking yeah i want kids yeah i want parasites because i can teach them to be i can train them to be different i'm going to train them yeah you train huh no it's not but i'll train the parasite either way okay yeah you got trained kids get like a little clicker make them do things did you go play fetch yeah i will yeah oh i'm not teaching that no i'll teach them like how to count cards and stuff at a young age because blackjack's a really good way of learning how to count yes it is you count to 21 it's just addition so you could teach kindergarten how to do how to play blackjack and then you teach you how to gamble which should try to lose boom and they teach them never to gamble um so purchase a puritus is an itching sensation that can occur in the gallbladder because the gallstone is kind of blocked off but it's not fully blocked off so you have this weird sensation in your stomach like you have to itch it constantly yeah gold bladder's weird okay he's cute you have one rupture secretin is released when acidic chyme comes and arrives in the duodenum so this is going to cause a secretion of buffers secretion is also going to cause your stomach to stop producing acid why has twofold it it acts as a buffer to the incoming stomach acid and also makes stomach stop making stomach acid why because you already died you're you you digest the food in your stomach right do you need to keep making stomach acid no so your stomach goes oh secret is being released i'm done i'm gonna take a nap basically right and then wiring put a picture of this guy up because this guy was nate has his name was secretary clinton i guess yeah jakku secretary is a french table tennis player which i can't believe that's an olympic sport you guys know that right yeah we we suck at it north korea is amazing at it okay coal so close psychokinin psycho clinic brain network right now call cycloplaning so cck sorry how i memorize it is cck again coal means gallbladder cytokinin basically this is going to be stuff from the gallbladder released earned two the duodenum this is what's going to cause the emulsification of the fats from the from the bile so cck is file write that down your notes you know that cap cck basically is bile it has a weird side effect where it actually causes the pancreas to start releasing more hormones because the pain the gallbladder pancreas are both connected to duodenum we the duodenum right so if the pancreas uh senses that cck is around it releases its hormone right if the gallbladder senses that the cc that the pancreas is hormones it releases its hormones right they kind of look out for each other and like if one sense of the one they send up to they both need to work yeah uh yeah oh right here so why does eating salad suck you love salad as a snack as a meal so you just eat the lettuce right lettuce eat the vegetables right nothing inside of it just a salad what do you eat with it why why because it has what in it you have to put you have to put stuff with the salads make it feel fully you could sit there with a bat like carrots and lettuce you can eat tons and tons of it right it doesn't feel fulling to you right it's when you eat the what you you when you eat it with the dressing or the meat or anything like the other ranch that has fat in it that makes you feel full it is fat that feeds us fat and protein make sense [Music] so cck causes it to release it boom gastric inhibitory peptide what to do this is going to cause the cause insulin to be released so ip gip causes it to um do this so sorry should i say this first gip gastric sounds like what it sounds like gas stream gastrin inhibiting peptide so what's the first function of gip to inhibit what gastrin what's gastrin do it tells parietal cells to make what hcl so you have secretin telling parietal cells to stop it you have gip telling gastric cells to tell parietal cells to stop it right a side effect is that gip tells glucose to be released what does glucose do raise or lower blood sugar why why don't yeah exactly so why does this why do you want this occur wait sorry sorry sorry no i messed up nice ah sorry it's been a long day for me gip tells your pancreas to release insulin why why you just ate you're now absorbing food so when is your blood sugar the highest when you immediately start absorbing food now when you eat it's it's it's nine hours after you consume that food right there it's gonna digest in your stomach then we get into your small intestine so it literally has to when when glucose starts entering your bloodstream is when blood sugar is the highest should use about nine hours after eating as your sugar is the highest cool nice tons of messages that's great okay gastrin we were gastrin [Music] um yeah yeah well gas stream is g cells okay moving on boom boom boom boom there you go okay up next you should be in the jejunum right no maybe i don't like how this thing is broken up okay fat free food sucks why no well kind of different way now you see this you see this in sugar sugar-free food same kind of you guys every sugar-free gummy bears before cause exact same problems and it caused lots and lots of loose stool yeah yeah sure a lot of sugar-free stuff things that make sure things things sugar-free causes loose stool as well because you can't break it down it's basically cholesterol-free things the longest time we were told that fat was bad is fat bad is sugar bad sugar is more dangerous than fat because what could sugar cause diabetes fat doesn't cause diabetes sugar does okay yay my favorite organ cat liver does everything it breaks down carbohydrates it breaks down lipids it breaks down amino acids it reduces waste it stores some vitamins it stores some minerals and it cleans up from drugs so basically what's the liver do it does the things that the saliva does does the thing the stomach does does it think pancreas does and it does the thing the gallbladder does it does everything that makes sense that's why i love it because it's gonna do everything so it is the largest blood reservoir in the body why because it breaks down the blood unless we get billy rubin and we get billy verde from cool it also receives 25 of all the blood and the gigantic organ so what does it do uh pathogen uh pathocytosis and antigen presents it for presentation basically it will read the cells inside of it and kill it makes plasma proteins albumins globulins clotting proteins remove corn excess hormones remove excess antibodies and remove toxins and also makes bile very very important healthy liver what's a fatty liver huh it's covered in fat what's cirrhosis liver scarring so scar tissue what about scarcity we always remember scar tissue last semester has no function scar tissue its own cell so if i if i take a heart cell and i cut it and it scars over it's not a heart selling more just scar tissue so cirrhosis is scarring the liver so what happens is is if i scar my liver with abuse of drugs and stuff like that it ceases to lose all this function i just told you and is that dangerous because it does everything very very very very important okay i don't know why we skipped the everything else i guess we're just going to assume the jejunum and the ilium are just going to help absorb everything with these proteins because we literally are just skipping those watches to doing them where is the testament about what about the rest of the small intestine you guys on the oh yes you guys don't know about those okay sure okay a large intestine those were two is what has an ascending a transverse a descending and a sigmoidal function cool luck of those colon pictures nice healthy whoa that's not healthy what is this could be cancer what is this thing it's a little nodule that good when a gigantic piece of time comes and pushes against that fans to be painful what about this thing right here this one right here i think is a good i think it's good it might be a little bit too red it might be a little irritated that's pretty good that one's normal one it looks a little inflamed compared to the color this nice white one right here it's a bit red but it could be the coloring of it but it looks normal okay large intestines the main function of the large intestine is to reabsorb all water so saliva stomach acid all those enzymes everything has to be lubricated so all the online our nice fun time is super super liquidy is your poop normally liquidy no what's consistency poop it's pretty hard right kinda right you guys never never guys never okay nevermind you guys need to put gloves on and go touch animal scat yes you can learn a lot about animals based off its scat talk about this in a little bit large intestines help reabsorb water 90 of all the water in our body is via the largest test in the kidneys if you do not re-absorb the water when you put water out what happens to you diarrhea can diarrhea kill you yes yeah dehydration so that's how you can die because you're not reabsorbing water from your poop that's how important your large intestine is constipation you're stuck you can't poop because it's literally blocking something because it's too thick how do you fix constipation fiber or stool softener or water so you take still software when you're constipated or a laxative that should help it out cool so less than ten percent less than so mainly ninety percent of the job of the large system is to absorb all the water there is a little bit we're trying absorbing all the leftover nutrients but there should be almost no nutrients in the chyme and the large intestine right because here you reabsorb bile put it back in the liver do we like to recycle any excess vitamins like to re-absorb the uh um we have to re-absorb that what's going on here vitamins produced by bacteria what what vitamins are produced by bacteria you guys know vitamin k good job and then river becomes hugo billions which is just basically going to be what makes your poop brown okay gut flora vitamin k b there you go so you are mainly bacteria you are a host for bacteria bacteria cells outnumber your own normal u cells like millions to one is it a very interesting study where the bacteria in your large intestine in your stomach and your small and your intestine actually dictate the food you want because you're trying to appease that bacteria scientists have actually found a way to clear bacteria out and there's some bacteria that love sugar so that either a lot of that you're going to start craving sugary food if you start having one that create a lot of meat you start creating protein as food so there might be a way in the future where you can actually control your gut bacteria to help with dieting yeah it's fun it's interesting vitamin k does what you guys need to know blood clotting b7 helps our blood sugar b5 is going to help do steroids and some hormones and neurotransmitters okay um sometimes your some of the some of the bilirubin is not fully dumped into your digestive system and then goes into your urine and you put you pee it out otherwise you make stryctobiliogens which gives the feces its brown and shallow color because it came from billy rubin what does billy reuben come from billy verde what does billy verde come from the breakdown of what cell red blood cells in the spleen so your poop is brown and yellow because you're breaking down your blood cells also while your pee is a very yellow very very dark yellowish color as well i think that's interesting hey same process i'm not going to cover it because i already covered it let's see guys when we cover this you guys want me to or no yes or no cool ammonia that's bad um idols and stocktalls are going to be nitrogen containing compounds and nitrogen's a very smelly compound that's why your poop smells hydrogen sulfide sulfur is also very smelly thing too it smells like rotten food as well but that's that so this is why feces is high in nitrogen and high in sulfur that's why we find it disgusting because that stuff is very very dangerous to us as humans that's why we find poop usually uh repulsive um there we go uh sometimes we can't digest some carbohydrates bacteria feed on it and they produce gas so when you're farting you're just poop you're just farting letting out uh bacterial gas yay i think that's adorable yay farts no i don't i don't know why um sulfur and nitrogen are flammable so yes you can technically shoot out yeah don't do that you'll come if you because if you're a doctor in the er you're going to see patients who have burnt anuses because guys have tried doing this again guys or girls guys are going to do this because they're disgusting and they are dumb sometimes again i work i i shattered an er you see this it's stupid it's hilarious but stupid okay appendix so what's the fun what's the function appendix you guys the teachers tell you every year it changes do you say it's important this year or no okay and then what your function said it's a vestigial organ which means it had a purpose at one time we're still doing research we don't know what it's for right some theories include it holds a bunch of extra gut bacteria that that when if we like vomit or take an antibiotic it can cause it to grow back out so we don't care all our gut bacteria some people think that it helped us when we started when we were had we had more of a like a grass-based diet or a high fiber based like a cellulose-based diet from plants to help break down that issue now is the appendix does what mainly it blows up appendix can rupture here's your appendix if that fills up with fecal matter explodes why because it's so full of poop that it can't expand how does it happen it's essentially a large intestine so when you kind of when you when you're when your poop's being moved it can get kind of get pushed into there there's a sphincter on it poop's supposed to be in there we know poop's supposed to be in there we just don't know why yeah appendicitis is inflammation of the appendices for some reason you have to remove it um why do you not want your pendants to explode yes why what's what's inside the appendix who poop is what gross do you want all that gross knucky yucky poop all over your internal organs no because it can lead to sepsis which is basically infections of multiple organs is that it no got 22 all right yay poop now more poop get so gastric reflexes gastro reef and gastro and gastric unit reflexes move materials of time you eat into the duodenum peristalsis movements length of colon segmentation basically causes it to break apart small chunks as you can see here poop is not one solid thing it's broken up in different pieces right it'd be interesting if poop was one gigantic long thing it'd be very interesting but it's not it's broken up okay again it's that it's increased surface area it's a reason so your rectal chamber here is empty usually why if poop enters here what feeling do you get you need to go right and then slowly what's going to happen that poop's going to pop out of that little hole right there and it's going to come out or you suck it back in you guys could control that sphincter didn't mention that but yes usually once um poop uh enters the stigma to colon or rectum you are going to poop there we go defecation so what this is saying is it is voluntary and involuntary the lower parts are voluntary the upper part is involuntary that make sense because you can clench your butthole you can't clench your sigmoid portland colon so short reflex long reflex so simulation of parasympathetic motor neurons in the blah blah blah spinal cord stimulates the blah blah blah blah increase postosses at the enlarged intestine blah blah blah basically it means is if you eat food right what's going to happen is it's going to move food out of your large intestine why when you eat why do you have to go poop afterwards you need to make room the thing you just ate so if you eat it causes you to poop because you need to make room short reflex is hey there's poop in here i'm going to poop that makes sense long reflexes are going to cause long-term issues short reflexes do short little things defecation this actually is a real chart you guys should memorize so you guys need to start looking at your poop if they are like little turtle pellets not good it means you have problems and you need to eat more fiber number one two and three are normal to uh not normal they're a little bit four is the best kind i know that two is you need you're dehydrated because there's too much cracking involved that's very painful to pass three and four are fine this might have a bit too much fat this is getting too liquidy so yay yeah type one and two contacts are constipated so fun times what's diarrhea loose watery stool cool um common causes is you're sick your body gets rid of it or you can get cholera cholera is a big cause of diarrhea okay ta-da any questions it's only 9 30 sex you guys have questions for me this is my favorite unit because it's all about poop because you guys usually are disgusted by it next thing that's my least favorite you guys start asking me weird questions i don't know if you guys will huh look after urinary yeah well some people ask me weird questions about the kidneys which is fine because i like the kidneys", "52YgiOzx3xA": "[Music] [Music] so again today we're going through revelation uh chapter six so if you have it open we'll start reading now i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard one of the four living creatures saying with a voice like thunder come and see and i looked and behold a white horse he who sat on it had a bow and a crown was given to him and he went out conquering and to conquer when he opened the second seal i heard the second living creature saying come and see another horse fiery red went out and it was granted to the one who sat on it to take peace from the earth and that people would kill one another and there there was given to him a great sword when he opened the third seal i heard a third living creature say come and see so i looked and behold a black horse and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand and i heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying a quart of wheat for a daenery and three quarts of barley for a daenery and do not harm the oil and the wine when you open the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying come and see so i looked and behold a pale horse and the name of him who sat on it was death and hades followed with him and power was given to them over fourth of the earth to kill with a sword with hunger with death and by the beasts of the earth when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held and he cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true until you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth then a white robe was given to each of them and it was said to them that they should rest a little bit longer until both the number of their fellow servants and their brethren who would be killed as they were was completed i looked and when he opened the sixth seal and behold there was a great earthquake and the sun became black a sackcloth of hair and the moon became like blood and the stars of heaven fell to the earth as a fig tree drops its late figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind then the sky receded as a scroll when it is rolled up and every mountain and island was moved out of place and the kings of the earth the great men the rich men the commanders the mighty men every slave and every free man hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and the rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come who will be able to stand that's some pretty heavy stuff so as we said before and keep this in mind i showed this chart in the 70th week at this point we are in heaven the church is raptured out okay so everything i'm about to go through we're not here we're in heaven at this time that these events are taking place looking down right and said last couple weeks we talked about how the scroll that's being talked about is really the title d to the earth and only christ qualified to break the seals and reclaim the title deed to the earth what we're about to read here is the beginning of setting things right of reclaiming as you remember i talked about the one of the responsibilities of the kinsmen redeemer we talked about that in ruth and christ is our kinsmen redeemer is to avenge uh the wrongs against those he's redeeming the land for so that's what christ is doing here right so we 69th week there's an interval we're starting revelation 6 through 19 is daniel's 70 of the week we talked about at length last week and it's a lot of confusion with this uh the wrath of god starts at verse six it doesn't start halfway through with the time of jacob's trouble that's the great tribulation that's the climax of this whole period of time the 70th week of daniel a lot of people believe were raptured halfway through before the great tribulation well no god's wrath is being poured out as we're about to see right out of the gates right so that's a misinterpretation i believe is scripture so let's go through this uh but i want you to consider a couple key points this is important um jesus started his earthly ministry by quoting scripture and we've gone over this before i'll go through this very quick you you know you all know the verse luke 4 8 through 20. jesus was in the tabernacle starting his ministry he was handed the scroll of isaiah he opened up and started reading in luke it records this in luke 4 18-20 listen to what he says the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty of to the captives and recover sight to the blind to set at liberty those who are oppressed to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and then he stops he closed the book gave it back to the attendant and sat down in the eyes of all who heard him say this was fixed on him they were astonished right now if you know your bible you'll realize that jesus was quoting prophetic scripture regarding himself from isaiah 61 verses 1 through 2. if you really know your bible it will dawn on you that jesus stopped mid-sentence right when he finished there when he said to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord that's only half of that verse if you know the verse which is isaiah 61 2. the end of that sentence is and the day of vengeance of our god the reason he closed it up is because that hadn't come yet this verse talks about his first coming and his second right well leads up to his second so to he was there at that time first time to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord he's coming again at the end of the tribulation and that's talking about what leads up to that daniel's 70th week or the tribulation is the day of vengeance of our god so if you think about jesus began his earthly ministry by stopping mid-sins of isaiah 61 2 now here in revelation 6 at the breaking of the seals jesus will start the second half so to speak of his ministry by finishing that verse and the day of vengeance of our god mark that in your mind because i'm going to get back to that important concept in a minute here one note on this verse have you bought into the old saying god hates sin but he loves the sinner that's actually a lie to distort your perception of sin god does hate sin absolutely but god also hates the unrepentant sinner the modern church focuses on jesus love so much that people have the idea that you can embrace sin and god will still love you unconditionally really then let me ask you something on the day of vengeance of the lord is god killing sin or sinners when jesus returns to earth seeking vengeance on those who killed the saints is his wrath going to be poured out on sin or the sinners here's a couple verses modern churches conveniently never read there's quite a few of them but there's just two psalm 5 4 through 6 for you are not a god who takes pleasure in wickedness nor shall evil dwell with you the boastful shall not stand in your sight you hate all workers of iniquity you shall destroy those who speak falsehood the lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man not the deceit but the men psalm and again there's some of these i'm just speaking to psalm 11 5 the lord tests the righteous but the wicked and the one who loves violence his god's soul hates not the violence the man god it's a tough subject to go through and i want to make i'm going to go through this so you have clarity of what i'm saying here okay god puts his name above all else right that's the third commandment don't take the name of the lord in vain right and that's just not using his name as a swear word that's doing anything that would tarnish his holy name right psalm 138 2 talks about he puts his name above all else right if justice for sin and evil wasn't served his name would be tarnished most people think god is all about love that's what the modern church preaches but that's only part of the story it's two sides of a coin god is a hundred percent love not fifty but a hundred but he's also a hundred percent justice he's both together right jesus uh if he let that justice slide out his love for you he wouldn't be holy and that would tarnish his name right he can't be in the presence of sin his sin and the people that do his sin would be uh consumed by his fire if they stood in his presence right so jesus or god loves you so much he paid for your sins so justice would be served and you could spend eternity with them right he loves you so much that's one side of the coin that he gave his life on the cross through jesus christ to pay your sin debt in full not a little bit but in full so therefore the other side of the coin justice can be served right and that keeps his name holy if you don't accept that payment then his holiness trumps his love for you and you will incur his wrath and his judgment he hates people who mock him his standard for holiness and his gift of salvation because by doing so you are mocking his holy name which he puts above everything else right and that won't stand it will not stand so don't go around embracing sin thinking god gave me a get out of jail free card he loves me so much he'll turn a blind eye he won't absolutely will not as we're about to see right if you want to know how far along as a christian if you are a christian if you want to know how far along you are in your christian walk ask yourself a question how much do i hate sin and that will tell you exactly how far along you are the closer you get to god the more you will hate sin and your sin especially your sin you'll struggle with it right we all sin saved or unsaved we sin right we sin but god if you're saved because your sin death's been paid he doesn't see your sin he sees the blood of his son from the cross so you are sinless in his eyes even though you still sent because it's been paid for don't get confused with that okay um the church needs to wake up and start preaching about how jesus is a god of justice as well as love they need to start warning people how much god hates sin and the sinner right those who embrace sin without repentance right when they do so they mock god and god shall not be mocked time is short his day of wrath which we're going to look at today is coming very very soon fortunately those who do repent and accept jesus christ as their savior are not appointed to the dare wrath which we're going to be reading about right in the upcoming weeks first thessalonians 5 9 psalm 2 hebrews 10 26-31 all refer to that right we are kept from not through that hour but from that hour we're taken out that's where we're raptured prior to what we're about to read today and that's important we are in heaven during the seals the trumpets the thunderings the bold judgments perhaps god wants us to see things from his perspective when we're up there looking down at the earth and see the abject evil we see the world through god's eyes at that point perhaps most tribulation rapture mid-tribulation rapture believers or pre-bold judgment believers will tell you that we are kept from the wrath of god because we are raptured before the bold judgments right the great tribulation the climax right but what they don't realize we are on earth up until that point there's a lot of wrath being poured out before the bowl judgments right uh and when we get to the sixth seal we will see why that makes absolutely no sense that mindset when the subject concern it's interesting when the co if you notice here when the subject concerns heaven the elders do the speaking when it concerns earth the living creatures speak which is interesting so i ran across this i went through a lot of studies john walvoord had a really cool observation if you go through the book of revelation you'll notice something very interesting there's a distinct pattern the scripture goes back and forth and back and forth and back and forth between earth and heaven and right and it's very i'll send this slide out to you if you want to email it to you but it's very interesting and you'll notice if you count them how many times take a wild guess is earth mentioned and haven't mentioned seven times this is a pattern it's one of about 10 million in the bible that shows this bible isn't just willy-nilly put together by men trying to keep a journal right in their seeking search for god the bible is a supernatural book written by god using men to transcribe right and we know that's true because of the patterns all throughout the bible they're consistent right and this is yet another one of those patterns that proves god wrote this book right it wasn't just thrown together and uh it's just very very fascinating to me it's amazing the deeper you get into the word of god the more amazing it becomes right but this also shows something else that's incredibly important this shows that god is in control totally in control or else you wouldn't have this pattern right and as we go forward we're going to see some pretty frightening things but always remember god is in control all the time 24 7. here's another interesting thing as we go through these four groups here the uh we start with the seals the seven seals and the seven trumpets we'll briefly talk about the seven thunderings which are kind of mentioned and then end up with a climactic bowl judgments which there are seven and they're kind of trying to think of a concept against this a across because what happens is if you go through each of those starting with the seals we're going to go through six seals and there's going to be a pause right and then the seventh seal will contain the next group right of trumpets you'll start with one and it goes through when we get to the sixth trumpet there's a pause and then the seventh trumpet will contain you know everything it goes like that so one is nestled into the other which is nestled into the other right so it's like these uh what are these russian dolls or whatever they used to call them what are they nesting dolls it's kind of that concept so starting at the end with the bowls are nestled into the thundering you know back up so if you think about it the scroll that jesus is undoing here contains everything right all the way through is one's nestled into the other which is an interesting concept and you'll see that again it's a sign of pattern that god wrote the book and there's a specific pattern he follows and we'll get to that more later today we're only going through one through six because there's like i said a pause and then we'll uh go to seven the week after so keep that in mind as we go through again not random events all planned out and organized so with that uh let's look at verse one verse one said now i saw when the lamb opened one of its seals and i heard one of the four living creatures sing with a voice like thunder saying come and see and i looked and behold a white horse he was sat on it had a bow notice there's no arrow he had a bow and a crown was given to him and he went out conquering and to conquer so um this opening part's uh probably one of dee's favorite parts because it's all about horses and uh so it's talking about the four horsemen which are very famous in uh literature uh so famous that it's famous in literature it's used as an idiom so horses throughout the bible if you'll notice like back in kings joel nahum zechariah and when i'm about to read jeremiah most often are related to judgment right so if we look at jeremiah 46 9-10 it says this come up o horses and rage o'chariots and let the mighty men come forth the ethiopians and the libyans who handled the shield and the lydians who handle and bend the bow and then 46 says this 46 10 says this for this is the day this is old testament of the lord god of hosts a day of vengeance that he may avenge himself in his adversaries the sword notice it's a sword shall devour it shall be satiated with and made drunk with their blood so a sword is an idiom of what the word of god right put on the full armor of god wield the sword which is the word of god right so you notice here jesus is always carrying a sword the other people have like bow and arrows but he has a sword but notice that this person that's riding here is not wielding a sword or an arrow for that matter but a bow so this is clearly not jesus a lot of people think this is jesus just because he's on a white horse clearly it can't be he's up in heaven sending the horses out right he's not the one on the horse so who is this person on the horse we have some clues first of all he's not carrying uh a sword right uh some note that the fact that he has a bow but no arrows indicate that he will conquer by peace and not by death which is interesting uh the word bo and this is really provocative if you think about it the word bo here there's different words for bo used in the bible the original language the word bo here in the original language is the exact same word that was used uh in genesis 9 13 with noah when god gave him put a rainbow in the sky as a sign of his everlasting covenant right so it can be thought of as a covenant right so think about that in context he came with a covenant not a bow and arrow as most people interpret it it can be interpreted that he came with a covenant which is interesting if you look at daniel 8 25 it says this and through his policy talking about the antichrist and through his policy also he caused shall cause craft to prosper in his hand and he shall magnify himself in his heart and by peace shall destroy many he shall also stand up against the prince of princes who is christ daniel 9 27 this is the interesting part and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and ablation to cease so it's talking about the again what opens up things um is we're taken out of here and then a piece packed with many uh covenant with many nations including israel obviously is enforced or made better by the antichrist right and that's kind of what it's talking about here so this leads me to believe that the opening horse the opening after jesus breaks the seal is this event where this peace covenant well how close are we to that happening we're very close trump just had some peace covenants last year right just haven't been enacted yet or enforced right so with that it starts to become clear who this is sitting on the horse also notice that he's wearing a crown again there are two types of crowns mentioned in the bible this is stefanos which is a victor's crown it's kind of like at the olympics you're given a crown for winning the event right we're going to get crowns in heaven right uh but those aren't permanent things they're just temporary crowns signifying victory right temporary victory um there's another type of crown though and that's a diadem or diadema which is a crown of a sovereign reigning monarch or king that implies a permanency to it right so those are the two types of crown in the english unfortunately our language is not as specific as the original so we just say crown and you don't know which one we're talking about in the original language here it refers to stefanos or a victor's crown not a crown of deity and that's important to think about so it's a temporary crown of victory over the earth in this case remember jesus is the one breaking the seals and sending out the horses he's not riding on them right so obviously i think the writer in this case this first horse is the antichrist there are many references to the antichrist in the bible i'll just go through a couple of them here old testament there's 33 of them seed of the serpent in genesis right out of the gate he's referred to the idol shepherd zechariah the little horn several times in daniel the prince which shall come we read about that last week and he's coming right here right in the new testament illusions there's 13 of them he's the lawless one in second thessalonians the man of sin son of perdition and the antichrist or swato christ false christ in other words in john it's interesting that john who wrote the book of revelation never actually uses the word antichrist anywhere in the book which is interesting his characteristics and this is very very interesting think about this what are the characteristics of this guy that comes down the antichrist which begins the 70th week of daniel he's a shrewd politician says in daniel he's a persuasive order right he's a financial genius and he's a unifying religious leader and it says that quite a few times throughout zachariah thessalonians uh revelation isaiah now think about this for a minute think about what is being set up right now before our eyes it's a new world order right a one world government a one world economic system and a one world religion it would take someone with all the skills that's being talked about here alluding the antichrist to run that system would it not again a one world leader one world government one world religion and a one world currency which is part of that so everything that's talked about here that we see being set up before our eyes is talked about here so how close are we to this person coming down and taking over that saw this um the pope francis calls for new world order after the pandemic says pope francis insists a new uh book insists in a new book things will never be the same in a post-pandemic world calling instead for the establishment of a new world order most people think the pope is an awesome candidate for the uh don't use awesome in a positive way an appropriate candidate for the false prophet which helps convince people to follow the antichrist he's on the scene now and what is he saying he's advocating the system which the antichrist will take over so i think he fits the bill pretty nicely of whether he is or not i don't know but he sure fits the bill of the false prophet it's it's just so amazing if you understand the bible and look around and you really understand what's happening everything we're about to read here is being set up before our very eyes so we have to be very very close to his return verse three this is the second seal which is conflict on earth when he opened the second seal i heard the second living creature saying come and see verse four another horse fiery red went out and it was granted to the one who sat on it to take peace from the earth and that people should kill one another and there was given to him a great sword so the writer of the first horse the antichrist enforces or makes better a peace covenant that won't be worldwide but in israel and stuff right now the second writer comes and brings war notice that he unlike the first writer is given a great sword and it was granted to him it was granted to him underlying that to take peace from the earth so who is giving him and granting him these things who's giving him the sword who's granted him the ability to use it it's god right again who's in control god's in control right he only allows things to occur uh at his will right he's the one sending him third seal scarcity on earth that's uh verse five when he opened the third seal i heard the living creature say come and see so i looked and behold a black horse and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand black is often throughout the bible like in lamentations jeremiah and other places refer to famine right during these times of famine food was often rationed out by weight the jewish people says that i ate by you know weight type of thing that's what they're referring to so finances resources to buy the food was very so thin they had to weigh it out and measure it out right thus the reference is scales being used black obviously also means death verse six and i heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying a quart of wheat for dinari and three quarts of barley for dinard and do not harm the oil and the wine so essentially what is being described here is it will take a day's wages just to buy bread to eat right just enough to get by there will be nothing left over to buy luxuries or non-essentials there will be plenty of food right don't hurt the oil the wine there'll be plenty there for the elites but for most people the vast majority they won't have enough money to buy anything other than enough to get by right if you study uh famines throughout history you will find something disturbing you'll find that most famines were not caused by natural disasters drought or locusts that's the way we commonly think of droughts right they were caused by the government either to do has to do with mishandling of the economy or more often than not by purposely manipulating the economy to destroy the population's wealth thus giving them control over the population who becomes dependent slaves to the leaders which is exactly the outcome that the leaders wanted and if you don't believe me check this out do some research on the fed and where did the fed come from when was it created look at jekyll island and do research on that some very evil bankers um in conjunction with a handful of evil senators and the president at the time got together in a back door on the island and came up with this plan to create the federal reserve the federal is not federal and it's not a reserve it's just called that to fool people it's got nothing to do with the us government right but in 1913 look at the chart here a dollar was worth a dollar when it was created through the years through fdr r's executive order making it illegal to hold a gold coin brenton woods established the dollar as the world's reserve in 44 nixon closed out the gold window which was the end of brenton woods beginning of the modern day fiat currency system allowing them to just print as much money as they want notice throughout the years how it slowly declined right now that dollar back in 1913 that was worth a dollar because of the government and the evil people in the government and the bankers on the world stage and locally have reduced it down so that same dollar is now only worth five cents why are they doing that is so they can eat and live high in the hog and have control over you and me the bible tells us not to be indebted to a bank a deep pointed that out last week at her meeting and she's right this is why you become a slave which is what they want right you remember in the 1930s this is uh from germany this article um the great reset is real it's happening now and will lead to devastation worse much worse than the weimar republic a german economist has warned if you remember what was going on with there you can take a wheelbarrow full of cash just to buy some bread kind of like what the bible's talking about right and he says the great reset which is everybody clamoring for for the new world order will cause a crash worse than back in 1919. ross childs to the most richest families in the history of man and evil men like george soros here have been doing this same thing for centuries playing one country's economy against the other crashing one and making millions for themselves in fact soros almost broke the bank of england right playing these games he's an economic terrorist is what he is and there are some countries which like myanmar has publicly said he's a terrorist and there's an arrest warrant they seized all his accounts we should have been doing this years ago um if you understand source i won't get into him now understand how he's corrupting our economy our judicial system he's a terrorist and it's all about financial gain for himself his goal state of goal is to destroy this country he stated that it's on film that's his lifelong dream is to destroy the country how's he going to do it militarily no he's going to do it with the economy going to crash it it's interesting that what we are seeing happening around the world is setting up what these seals are describing the great reset the new world order most leaders in the world are pushing for where the economy will be crashed and a new digital currency run by the government of course will take over or a social credit system like china has right now will be implemented in either case most will be financial slaves to the leaders you were given crumbs while they feast exactly what i just got through reading out of the bible how close are we folks speaking of famines side note there's a different kind of famine that has already begun especially in america and amos 8 talks about it behold the days are coming says the lord god that i will send a famine on the land not a famine of bread nor thirst for water but of hearing the words of the lord there's so much going on right now we'll get to that in a prophecy update with laws about hate speech and stuff they it's coming they want to shut down the truth of god's word from being spoken right in some countries like in canada pastors just arrested for other things but most people don't realize there's no i think cleveland or somewhere in ohio this was years ago uh a pastor was um arrested for hate speech because he's reading scripture right out of the bible about homosexuality and the only reason they didn't convict him is because there was no precedent set so they had to let him go there's about to be a precedent set where if i read right out of the bible i could go to prison right that's happening in america right now it's interesting thing about famines if you think about look at venezuela what went on there if someone is truly starving and hungry they will eat about anything right in the past during the sieges on jerusalem they ate their own children right terrific look in venezuela they ate their own pets they were dumpster dining right they were so hungry they were willing to eat about anything well you can relate that to uh starving spiritually most there's so many people that are so thirsty for the true word of god but don't know where to find it and christians aren't out there telling them it right barna said only two percent of christians witness shocking so they're so hungry that they're willing to consume anything out there spiritually speaking reincarnation rituals some of these you know not to rip on any i mean pick any of them you want if you look at mormonism with special undergarments they're required to wear it's crazy the stuff that people believe and it's creeping into the church false doctrine it's creeping in church because men and women haven't been taught the truth they're not into the bible so they don't know what they're being fed and what they're consuming is not actually god's word but they're hungry right that's why it's so important for us men and women of christ to get out and share the gospel share the truth right give them the true meat of god's word right we become here in opulent america churches aren't feasting on the meat of god's word which is readily available instead they are consuming heretical trash the modern church in america is filled with spiritual dumpster diners exactly as amos predicted but off my soapbox on to verse seven the fourth seal widespread death on earth verse seven when he opened the four seal i heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying come and see verse eight so i looked and behold a pale horse and the name of him who sat on it was death and hades followed with them and power was given to them again it was given to them to over a fourth of the earth to kill with a sword with hunger and death and by the beasts of the earth how many austin how many what's the population world right now it's it's like seven billion or eight or what is it seven and a half so think about what this thing like a quarter of the world's population that's between one and two billion people are going to die this isn't the bold judgments we're talking about this just the seals this is just the beginning it's interesting if you think about it again the word beasts here people think of four-league-legged beasts but that isn't necessarily if you look at the original language what it's referring to the most dangerous beasts are not four-legged animals as we think of it they are microscopic organisms you can read them as plagues or pestilence right biological weapons covet is an example of a biological weapon on a smaller scale that was unleashed it was manufactured people chris what are you talking about that's just naturally from bats really then how could it be patent there's a patent on covid whether you know it or not look it up you can't patent by law things that occur naturally you can't patent those so how is it they were able to get a patent on this think about it covet is a example of a biological weapon on a smaller scale i believe that much more deadly ones are coming in fact if you read do research from the rothschilds what their step-by-step plan is cova is just phase one they have much more deadly viruses coming right and they're setting you up your body they're weakening your body your dna by these vaccinations i believe it's just me do your own research come to your own conclusions uh but research tells us that's what's happening so people aren't dying right now a lot are but what's coming is going to be the big thing when they unleash these other bio weapons it's going to trigger what's now in your body body the messengers right uh to the protein which tell the protein what to do what to attack within your body those are going to be triggered to for those proteins to attack the entire body in mass and you'll be dead within a couple days right um that would certainly explain the mass deaths described by revelation they don't have to go nuclear honest they can just spread bio weapons you you could do chem trails and you don't know um how it's going to happen right so anyway i could spend a whole hour in that but uh the fifth seal on verse nine when you opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of god the word of god is also named for who it's jesus right so you could read that i saw under the altars the souls of those who had been slain for christ and for the testimony which they held verse 10 and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true until you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth and jesus said i love them too much i wouldn't hurt them no that's not what he said do you know where the word does anyone know where the word martyr actually comes from where they got that word it's interesting the greek word for witness is martus which is where we get the word martyr think about that for a while how did martyr go from being a word referring to someone who witnesses to a word referring to someone who was killed for witnessing we are really clueless here in america how many millions have given their lives sharing the gospel so frequent overseas they have no problem connecting that it's understandable oh of course it's the same thing synonymous witnessing and being killed are one in the same thing most of the world has no problem understanding that but here in america tough go making that connection that transition and meaning is a powerful testimony of the love that men and women have had throughout the centuries for christ they willingly die for him right so here the martyred saints are crying out those who went out and witnessed for god's justice to take place verse 11 then a white robe was given to each of them and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer until both the number of their fellow servants and their brethren who would be killed as they were were completed so they are told to be patient that justice is coming god keeps his promises right but be patient it's not quite here yet the sixth seal this is interesting um cosmic disturbances revelation 6 12 says i looked when he opened the sixth seal and behold there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became like blood and the stars of heaven fell to the earth as a fig tree drops its lake figs when it's shaken by a mighty wind verse 14 and then the sky receded as a scroll when it is rolled up and every mountain and island was moved out of place wow good times there what is going on here well there are three views that people have i read a lot of commentaries um one combines mine kind of combines all three perhaps there's the natural the cosmic and the man-made you could view it as natural either a series of massive volcanic eruptions and earthquakes like they've been predicting at yellowstone most people don't realize i think there's three if i remember correctly three the biggest earthquakes in the world of volcanoes i should say in the world one of them is yellowstone here in the u.s it's interesting where they're strategically placed on the planet but everything i've read yellowstone is getting ready to blow i've heard that for years um but if it did it's so massive the earthquake will be so big um that it will rip the us apart but it will also send ash it will bury over half the continent or have ash on it some parts will be buried feet deep right the ones closer to the center right there are three massive it's interesting there are three massive earthquakes in revelation which kind of correspond to the three massive volcanoes that i read about from science blogs and which is interesting this is the first of three revelation 11 and 16 being the other two so if yellowstone blew it would wipe out instantly kill a lot of people in america and canada and it would send ash far into the atmosphere causing the sun to be initially blacked out in some places in other places it would cause the sun and moon to look like blood if you remember because of the wildfires in california last year how beautiful the sunsets were i mean night after night they were like screaming bright red the sun was it was just beautiful it's kind of like what it's talking about here stars falling to earth could be angels is something but again i i look at it more literally i think it would be like meteors coming down and verse 14 is interesting the sky receded as a scroll when it was rolled up what does that mean it could be something cosmic or a rather simple man-made event chuck misser and others have in-depth studies on the cosmic view of this and they point out the space is not empty as most think it has mass outer space is not just empty like you know in a vacuum it has actual mass the bible refers to the heavens being stretched out right over a dozen times in the bible so it's got to have mass to do that right but again you have to think about god lives in dimensions we don't live in we think in four dimensions or three and a half time you can only go forward you can't go back so it's the half so but he's in 12 right so isaiah says that space can be torn psalm says space can be worn out like a garment hebrew says space can be shaken peter says it can be burnt up and here in revelation says it can be split apart it's tough to understand but again that's because we're thinking in 4d instead of 12d on the other hand have you ever watched a nuclear bomb go off you have it you need to watch it it's very cool it's very interesting because when the mushroom goes up you know kind of what it looks like have you ever seen a picture of one it looks like a mushroom so when it goes up you notice that the outer edge rolls up underneath so it looks like the sky is being rolled up so this may be talking about massive nuclear war and keep in mind most people when they think of nuclear bombs they think of hiroshima and stuff hiroshima is like nothing it's like a peashooter compared to what they have now they have bonds now that two bombs would blow up the whole world they're that powerful right we've never seen them actually used so it could be referring to that um so i don't know what it's referring to exactly but whatever it's referring to it's huge and i think of it more literally than figurally but that's just me so verse 15 and the kings of the earth the great men the rich men the commanders the mighty men every slave and every free man hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks and the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb whose wrath it's jesus wrath verse 17 for the great day of his wrath is come who will be able to stand i mentioned a few weeks ago if you want to do an awesome study study joshua it parallels the book of revelation in amazing ways and it actually mentions in there the same scenario where they hide in the caves and they ask for the caves to fall on them exact same thing so it's a very cool study so you should check it out it's prophetic it's a modeling thing it's very cool now remember what i mentioned before regarding those who believe that we are raptured mid-tribulation or pre-wrath or bold judgments i've got a good friend two good friends that think this way can't wait to talk to them next week they believe when the new testament says we are kept from god's wrath it refers to the bold judgments right so we are still here on earth in that scenario during the seals and the trumpets because wrath hasn't come yet according to them well apparently they haven't read these three verses listen to what the kings the great men the rich men every slave and every free man had to say fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne from the la wrath wrath of the lamb for the great day of wrath has come has been past tense now it is going to it's come it's here now right during the seals and who is able to stand uh this is uh this uh at the beginning of daniel 70 this is at the beginning of daniel's 70th week not at the climatic end of the bold judgments i hate to keep hammering this but it's important because you're going to run into a lot of people that don't believe were raptured before daniel's 70th week their mid-trib or pre-bold judgments these verses are perfect to spring on them and ask them how do you explain this verse then these verses in that context so again i'm saying that to give you encouragement satan's one going to want to put doubt in your mind saying these are very nasty things most people aren't even aware of them because most churches don't go through the book of revelation but if they read it they get very very worried and afraid for them and their families are we going to go through this and satan's going to play upon that they're going to send people in the mid-tribbers in your life who probably go to your same church and say well you haven't read that no no you go through the first part and you know and you're gonna freak out um do not freak out god's in control he promises that he'd keep us from that time period but we are not appointed as i read earlier to wrath okay so keep that in mind you should be encouraged by that also encourage the fact that if you understand what we just got through talking about that we're going to be out here before that happens that's going to happen very very very soon right so next week we'll look at the ceiling of the 144 000 jews a very very if you have any jobs witness friends invite them to come on over and we'll straighten them out next week so uh or send them to my house i'll i'll handle it ahead of time so anyway uh this will give you information so if you do have a friend and they're lost like we were all lost at one time right it's important that we share the truth with them so next week should help you out in that process you can better witness to your jehovah's witness friends and share the truth with them while we still have time so with that let's pray father is some very very very heavy stuff here people have no clue including most christians what really is coming and what's coming gives us an idea or a sense of how much you really hate sin how you put your holiness above all else and what a chasm there is between sinful man and your holiness for you to do something like this tells us how holy you are and how sinful we are and father we just thank you when we think about that and we understand how much you hate sin and sinners who mock you who don't accept your gift when we understand that we just if we are born again and we have a relationship with you and again it's not the smells and the bells it's not the relationship it's not the goofy things that most the world embrace and consume it's about the relationship we have with you and it's because of that relationship that we just fall down on our knees and we praise you and we rejoice in the fact that you loved us so much that you would sacrifice yourself through the form of jesus christ on the cross to pay for that sin debt so that we could spend eternity with you that you will take us out of here before your day of wrath so we won't have to be here and experience this father we just thank you and praise you and there are no words to express how awesome you are and how much we love you father father i pray that you will bring men and women who are lost who are feasting or dumpster dining spiritually or don't know the truth they're not chewing on your word the meat of the truth of your word they're caught up dining on uh garbage fast food spiritually or their dumpster dining they're just totally lost bring them into our lives so that we can share the truth with them while there's still time that we can be a powerful witness to glorify your name so they will not have to go through what we are reading about here father we just thank you that you are going to bless us that way that you're going to send people in our lives i know if we ask you will respond if it's in accordance with your word so i know i trust that this week you will bring people into the lives of every person sitting here today and give them an opportunity to share the gospel with them to change their eternal destinies and we just thank you that you would use us in that manner to glorify your name and it's in your holy name we ask you we thank you we", "3mbBbFH9fAg": "(\"Black Hole Sun\" by Soundgarden) \u266a In my eyes \u266a \u266a Indisposed

"4d8xl-DuuYU": "hello my name is Rick Latrobe I would Paul Davis restoration of Greater Charleston South Carolina today I'd like to talk to you about smoke and soot cleaning after a fire smoke and soot settle nearly every surface of the structure it's affected it's on the ceilings the walls the floor and all of the furniture in between and one of the most important things that we have to do when we're restoring a home that's been damaged by fire is to get rid of the smoke odor but in order to get rid of the smoke odor first we have to make sure that the structures been properly cleaned one of the tools we have a Paula Davis restoration to clean structure is called a chem sponge now the chem sponges name is a little deceptive because while it is a sponge it actually contains no chemicals the chemists made up a vulcanized rubber and has tiny pores that actually wipe away the soot and smoke as it's wiped across the surface now most people would look around in a fire see the smoke of soot on the walls and furniture it immediately grab a rag and some cleaner and start wiping away well why this may seem natural it actually could be counterproductive using a wet cleaning agent can actually smear the soot and calls it the set or stain becoming very difficult to restore later that's where the chem sponge comes in the chem sponges is a dry cleaning method you do not wet the sponge you simply wipe it across the affected surface and it cleans a certain smoke in its path as the technician prepares to clean an affected room they'll typically work from the ceiling down this ensures that no smoke or soot gets distributed on the areas that have been previously cleaned as he prepares to clean the ceiling he'll put the chem sponge on the end of an extension pole he'll make passes across the ceiling overlapping each one slightly to ensure proper cleaning after the ceilings complete in a move to the walls using the same method it's also important to note that the Kemp spuds can be used to clean some types of contents it's very important to do some research however because all furniture and contents are not acceptable to chem sponge cleaning as the sponge is used you'll notice that the smoke and soot get trapped in those little pores as this happens you can actually remove layers of the chem sponge so that more of the sponge could be used after the entire sponge is used up you can simply discard it with regular household waste the Kemp sponge is only one of the tools that we have here at Paula Davis restoration to help us ensure we give you a professional finish on any type restoration project you may have if you have questions about the chem sponge technology or any other restoration related question we welcome you to give us a call you

pot lid thermal gloves the fire extinguisher sand powdered sugar baking soda a glass container coleman's lantern fuel and a lighter to start with measure out five grams of baking soda and twenty grams of powdered sugar really any one to four ratio will work now take these and mix them really well I did it in a freezer bag just to make it easier now take the metal pan and put a large mound of sand right in the center when measuring out 150 milliliters of Colemans lantern fuel let's go over some safety involved always use a secondary glass container when working with flammable liquids and keep your primary container far away from any source of heat or ignition if something happens in your secondary container catches fire you can easily put it out by smothering it put the pot lid however if the primary container catches fire it can melt creating a huge fire and injuring people close to it at this point pour your Coleman's lantern fuel onto the mound of sand and then place the sugar baking soda mixture in the very center of the mount double check that you have your fire extinguisher close and then light the fuel [Music] you'll start to see the white powder turn black and then after a few minutes it'll start to grow taller and taller [Music] the way this works is that as the baking soda and sugar decompose carbon dioxide gas gets trapped inside pockets of the black carbon and it continues to grow taller and taller and taller many of the experimental procedures you find online say that you can use 91% isopropyl alcohol for this experiment I however wasn't able to get the 91% isopropyl alcohol to create a long snake it might have something to do with the type of sand I was using or the humidity in the air thanks for watching bearded Science Guy if you enjoyed this

everyone my name is Joe Chemeketa aka taco from the doylestown branch I'm creating this video today to talk to you about so it's fun just also known as dry sponges and more specifically when is the best time to use them first using a wet cleaning method so it sponges are a great tool to have in the toolbox but they may not be appropriate for every fire or cleaning job switz punches are most effective when cleaning a dry site a dry suit is the remnants of a high heat fire or a fire that has burned mostly natural materials such as wood paper cotton wool etc or the material left behind after a puff back is also classified as a dry suit the effective materials will also play a part and whether or not a suit sponge is the most effective method so sponges are ideal for flat porous surfaces such as unfinished wood masonry drywall plaster or paper as well as low gloss painted surfaces such as flat a mat or a semi-gloss painted surface the next cleaning method like to talk to you about is wet washing wet washing is the use of clean honest light wall wash degrees soft but in effect atomic just to name a few sometimes they can be used mixed with a odor counteracting such as 99 or rather or counteracting wet wash methods are maybe better suited for cleaning furniture fixtures high-gloss painted surfaces paneling countertops tile and other non-porous surfaces or when so it is considered a wet suit a wet suit is the result of a low heat fire or a fire that burns mostly synthetic and/or plastic materials this is highlighted by a wet or oily substance left on the surfaces wet washing is also better for protein fires such as burnt meat flesh or burnt poultry many jobs will require different cleaning methods in different rooms based on the materials and how far they are from the source is not in common to require multiple cleaning methods for a single material or a single room examples of this are dry sponging a flat wall while wet washing the trim and outlet covers or dry sponging and unfinished wood surface followed by a wet wash and then use of any capsule open regardless of the cleaning method used every job should be pre cleaned with a HEPA vacuum a HEPA vacuum is used to remove any loose soot particles and to reduce the amount of soot that goes airborne during the cleaning process failure to perform this that may cause some soot to go airborne and settle later reinfecting the area making a look as if we did not do our due but do a good job cleaning this will also cut down on labor costs and consumables making the job more profitable thank you all for your time I hope this video is informative [Music]", "FtvvqsR0XrA": "- Hey, everyone it's Barry here. Welcome to My Virgin Kitchen. I hope you are well. Uh, today (laughs) All right, don't judge me, Homer. If you didn't know when I was growing up, I was into science. But I didn't really get\nit and I still don't. I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed. I'm kinda like Homer\nhere, but I do my best. I'm muddling my way through life, okay with the help of you guys. And I really wanted to do like a kitchen, foodie, science base because there's so many things you can do in experiments with food. So, despite my lack of knowledge\nof science and chemicals anything like that the fact that I only\nreally know two sciences one being Dr. Sissens, who is\nmy science teacher at school a bit of a legend, a little like Superman. The other one being Doc Brown from Back to the Future who of course is not\nactually really a person a real thing. I wanna try and like learn and have a bit of a laugh but we're gonna do a\ndangerous one to kick it off and hopefully you guys\nlike this as a playlist. Sometimes you'll get me on my own sometimes you'll get a\nguest, maybe an expert and other times maybe some\nfun more kid-friendly ones like with Phoebe, who has a\nparticular interest in science. But I wanted her out of the way today because this is a little bit dangerous. But to really get into that scientist zone I need to dress like a scientist. Right, mate? This is my botched\nscientist Doc Brown kit. All right, doctor's outfit. I think it's just the coat thing. It's quite cheap, so maybe I\ndidn't get the stethoscope too. Yep, wig. Some marigold washing-up gloves. And glasses, because I find\nthat anyone who wears glasses it instantly makes you\n6% more intelligent. Right, let's put this stuff on. 100% polyester, all right. That's quality. Also, you need a pen, don't you whenever you're a scientist. Just because, you carry pens? (laughs) Oh my gosh. (laughs) I'm instantly Doc Brown. One point twenty-one gigawatts! Biggest fear right now I tend to get a lot of\ndelivery, it's a Friday today I tend to get a lot of\ndeliveries on a Friday. There is actually someone there. (doorbell rings)\n(dog barks) Well, it was the plumber. Well, I got the wig off but answering the door\nwith the lab coat on was a little bit weird. Alright it's insanely hot in this thing. That's better isn't it? Yes! And the annoying this is now\nlike I can't unlock my phone to do any Snapchats and stuff. I don't know about you but I'm ready to make a sugar snake. Let's talk about it. So then class, all joking aside. This is actually quite dangerous. First thing we're gonna\nneed is a pot of sand. Many people have sent me a\nlink to this experiment before so it will get dangerous. This pot of sand will hopefully absorb or prevent the flames,\nya know, spreading, okay? Scientific terms, spreading. And this is actual sand from my hometown and if you're interested on my behind the scenes\nchannel the Barry's, I actually showed you me\ncollecting that, you know. If you wanna really delve\ninto that part of my life you're more than welcome. It's a separate channel. You're also gonna need some lighter fluid. Now this was on \u00a31.99. The minimum spend in the\nshop was five pounds. I never carry cash. So if you're gonna try\nand rob me, don't bother. I had to spend over\nfive pounds, which I did because I also bought\na lighter thing, okay and a tray because I think it's important\nto sit this in a tray. That's what we're gonna do. Now where the food comes in. This is some castor sugar, and also we need bicarbonate of soda. So the first thing we're\ngonna do is mix these together to become one, Spice\nGirls experiment style. I got sent these scales\nfor mini food, right? But they're also gonna help us right away. High tech stuff. Yes. We need 10 grammes of bicarbonate of soda. I feel like in this plate it's gonna be using bicarbonate\nof soda quite a lot. It does some crazy things. And if you know if any experiments that you think I should try let me know in the comments\nbox down below, please. Right at 40 grammes of sugar. Which is a surprisingly large amount! Woo. Just thought of a really\nbad Doc Brown joke. What would Doc Brown say if he\nwent on holiday to Scotland? Great Scot, land. Sorry, it's the wig. Alright, brought in a spoon. Just mingling this together. There we go! We're ready. Are you? (sharp exhales) Seriously though, it might\nseem like we're having fun here but this bit is actually quite dangerous. We have got ourselves a\nlighter, with a nice long reach. Okay? You take the lighter fluid and we pretty much, from what I could see give it a good old coating. It needs to sort of do a layer all along the top of the sand. Well the video that someone sent me the sand was one colour. And by the time they\nsaid, \"Add lighter fluid.\" it was pretty much like the whole sand was one colour, like this. So. You know. This is why it's like don't try this at home sort of stylie. I've no idea how hot this is gonna get. If the smoke alarm's gonna go off? I don't know. What I do know is I've just done a\nlittle dribble on the side which I'm gonna wipe off. Cuz that's not cool. Just dab that off. Instantly wanted to dab\nthen, ain't doing that. That smells dangerous. We're now gonna take our\ncombined sugar and sodium mixture and put it in the middle. Start to sort of pile it. Bringing out my inner sand\ncastle expertise right now. I think the more central we can keep it we might get it under a bit more control. This smells a lot right now. So that's on there. Um, please don't do this unless you're supervised by an adult and like me, you've got a fire blanket and a massive jug of\nwater just to one side. We're gonna light this now, okay? I feel kinda like a weird hybrid between Doc, from Back to the Future and Garth, from Wayne's World, right now. Um, the confusion of Garth,\nthe confidence of Doc. (bright classical music) Oh my God. It's fizzing. I'm getting the lighter out of the way. Oh my God. It's doing it. That's some serious smoke right there. It does take a while, in the video I saw to really get going. In the mean time, I'm gonna\nopen the window over there so my fire alarm doesn't go off. (fire crackles)\n(bright classical music) So weird! (bright classical music) It's really warm. It's nice, kinda like I got\nmy own little fire going. Toast some marshmallows. So the video I saw online, it kinda like made one big snake. But I'm making kind\nlike a little plant pot. I'm really worried\nthere's gonna like, soot on the ceiling. Oh what a feeling! When\nthe soot's on the ceiling. (bright classical music) Science. Obviously, I don't know\nwhy this is happening. I want you guys to tell me\ndown below why it is happening. Okay? That's how we learn. I don't learn in research,\nyou guys can help me out. I gotta keep this wig a fair ways away. (bright classical music) (laughs) Every time I think\nthe flame's easing off it's not. I gotta let this completely stop. We survived guys. It's a giant mix of like a\nlog, that's black and grey with coal. You got like, really. I'm just trying-- oh my gosh, it's still-- I just saw-- My wig! (laughs) Lemme bring you closer to it. Look. Look at that! That's so weird! Wow! And obviously the ways\nthat you do the pile I'd imagine you get different\nangles and shapes on it. But I wanted to show you\nthe way it was bending which is why I turned\nit round a little bit. But, wow! Look at that for a Tinder profile. Hi, I'd like to meet\nsomeone, I'm quite lonely. He got his eyes there, his nose-- ugh! (laughs) That was actually\nthe next thing I was gonna do. And good thing is, my\nceiling didn't get dirty. Sit it back in there. And with an old knife. (laughs) Look, oh my gosh. Is it gonna be hot? Look! Take away science. Wow! That is actually really,\nreally cool but look. It just, I can (laughs)\nI can put my finger in. It's very soft and delicate. It's actually cooled down quite quickly. Don't really wanna inhale this too much. But please, only do this with extreme many, many adult supervision. I'm a highly trained professional. (loud crunching) Oh my God look. It's just air in it! It's a sugary soda log. I'm pretty impressed\nwith that first attempt at kitchen science. Well, shiver me timbers I feel like I should've done that voice through the whole of the video. Retrospectively thinking,\nno, I'm glad I didn't. This is looking awesome! So what a great start to the\nkitchen science playlist.

(coughs)", "VHfuFY-K_IQ": "[Music] okay so I have an awesome idea but in order to make that awesome idea happen I need to make some black powder let me explain so I literally called every gun store in town trying to find someone who's got some black powder and as it turns out nobody sells true black powder anymore like you can still get it but it's hard to get we don't have it anywhere around here and in order to buy it off the Internet the shipping would have been outrageous so we're gonna get all the stuff and things we need and we're gonna make our own black powder so in order to make black powder we're gonna need three things we need some potassium nitrate you can buy this anywhere at your local lawn and garden center it's sold as stump remover just make sure you check the label and find the one that says 100% potassium nitrate you'll also need a little bit of sulfur now this you can buy online it's actually sold in chunks at least the place where I bought it from so have a look around you can you can get a little bit of sulfur it's not too bad and we're not gonna need that much in order to make a little bit of gunpowder that we're gonna make today the other item we'll need is some charcoal now charcoal is pretty readily available but you don't want to use the charcoal briquets I would recommend getting some hobby charcoal it's actually sold at art centers you can get charcoal that's made for drawing with and you can grind that up [Music] now since I'm using 40 grams of potassium nitrate that works out to be about 8 grams of charcoal and we'll also need about 5.3 grams of sulfur now I'm just using a screen here that I have that fits over my beaker and grinding that across the screen that produces rather fine particles of charcoal and in this case we want that we actually want our charcoal to be rather small it's also the reason why I'm gonna have to grind up this potassium nitrate and the sulfur so I'm gonna grind some potassium nitrate we'll get that all taken care of then we have to grind the soul bird now you'll notice there's a lot less loafer I actually had to do some math in order to figure out how much of this we need so I put the ratios in the description for you and you can see them here okay now that we have everything ground up we're going to mix it all now the charcoal is pretty fine and we have to be careful with that we're actually going to stir really slowly just so that we don't make a mess because we don't want to be breathing that charcoal dust it's pretty bad I think it gives you the black lung I don't know I could be wrong oh it's all coming together so beautifully look at that we have a very nice fine mixture of a black powder which is exactly what we're going for it's 75% potassium nitrate 10% sulfur and 15% charcoal all mixed up very thoroughly and I think now it should be about time to go test it out so now we got black powder let's see if it burns [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] alright guys I would definitely call that a win we were able to make some good gunpowder or black powder in this case it's very very dark it's very black in color so not only does it look good it burns pretty good too but all said and done I think this is a very successful week we did pretty good on making some black powder so I hope you guys enjoyed it I had some fun and learned a lot along the way it was pretty interesting to learn about the history of gunpowder it's it's been around for centuries we actually used it back in the 10th century over in China was where it was first discovered they used it to make fire arrows which it's pretty cool but it wasn't until about the 1800s or so that we started calling a black powder and black powder was used of course not only in war for guns and that sort of thing but also for cannons which is a little bit piratey which I like so I hope you guys enjoyed it stay tuned because I've got something crazy coming up that we're gonna do using some black powder or something super fun that I've been planning for a while but I've been waiting til I get to a hundred subscribers I'm not quite there yet I haven't posted that video which means you guys need to share this one or pick your favorite video and share that I would really appreciate it it helps me out a lot and I thank you so much for your support you guys have been amazing we're almost to a hundred and when we get there we're gonna do something really fun with this black powder so thanks for coming by thanks for watching I appreciate you guys and if it's your first time here make sure you hit that little subscribe button over there in the corner beside from that I'll catch you guys next time [Music]", "t-O-Qdh7VvQ": "E=mc^2, the most famous equation in the world,\ndescribes the fact that anything with mass possesses a huge amount of energy, in principle\n\u2013 like, a 5kg cat has enough energy in its mass to power the entire country of Norway\nfor a year \u2013 if only the energy could somehow be fully extracted from the cat. But it turns out that efficiently extracting\nenergy from mass is a very hard thing to do. Anti-matter is, of course, the most efficient\nway of extracting energy from mass since, if you collide a cat with a cat made of anti-matter,\n100% of the mass of the cat and anti-cat will be converted into energy (powering Norway\nfor 2 years). But the universe has almost no naturally-occurring\nanti-matter, so it\u2019s not a practical choice for generating energy, since you\u2019d first\nhave to use a lot of energy to make a large mass of antimatter. Since we can't use antimatter, there are basically\nthree options left to us: chemical reactions, nuclear reactions, and gravitational reactions\n- aka stuff getting pulled together by gravity, like matter falling into black holes. Chemical reactions, for example, are so bad\nat extracting energy from mass that we don\u2019t even think about what they\u2019re doing as converting\nmass to energy (even though it is). As an illustration, reacting a balloon of\nhydrogen and oxygen gases creates a nice big explosion, but the end-products of the reaction\nonly weigh half a nanogram less than the initial reactants , which amounts to a measly 0.00000001%\nefficiency of converting mass into energy. At that rate, you\u2019d need ten billion cats\nto power Norway for a year. Nuclear reactions are a lot more efficient,\nbut still pretty bad on an absolute scale: splitting uranium-235 into krypton and barium\nconverts only about 0.08% of the uranium\u2019s mass into energy, and fusing hydrogen into\nhelium like in the sun converts about 0.7% of the hydrogen\u2019s mass into energy. At that rate you\u2019d need 150 cats to power\nNorway for a year. This where black holes come in \u2013 they\u2019re\nabout as good as it gets in our universe for extracting energy from mass. Which may sound weird, because, as you\u2019ve\nprobably heard, nothing can escape black holes \u2013 once inside. But the efficiency of black holes comes from\nwhat stuff does while falling towards them, before passing the no-turning-back point of\nthe event horizon. Anything that falls in a gravitational field\nspeeds up, gaining kinetic energy, and if it then crashes into something it can convert\nthat kinetic energy into heat. That heat can then radiate away as infrared\nradiation, slightly decreasing the mass of the object. For planets and stars, this conversion of\nmass into energy is pretty pathetic: an object falling to the surface of the earth releases\nonly about one billionth of its mass as energy. That\u2019s basically as bad as a chemical reaction! But black holes have something special going\nfor them: they are stupendouslysmall. A black hole with the mass of the earth would\nbe about 2 cm across, providing way farther for an object to fall \u2013 and since gravity\ngets stronger and stronger the closer you are to an object, objects falling into black\nholes get accelerated to ridiculous speeds. Specifically, an object falling all the way\nto the event horizon of a black hole will have kinetic energy equivalent to converting\nroughly half of its half of its E=mc2 mass energy mass. However, if the object continues to fall into\nthe black hole, all of that energy will be stuck inside the black hole. The way to actually convert mass into energy\nthat goes out into the universe is to have the object slowly spiral into the black hole,\ncrashing into other stuff, heating up, radiating that energy away thereby losing mass and speed,\nslowing down more, spiraling to a yet lower orbit, and so on, all the way down to the\ninnermost possible orbit. And this is exactly what accretion disks around\nblack holes do! So how good are they at converting mass to\nenergy? Well, for a non-rotating black hole, the innermost\npossible circular orbit is actually 3 times farther out than the event horizon, and in\norder to spiral in to that point an object has to convert around 6% of its mass into\nenergy radiated away to the outside universe. After that point if it loses any more energy\nit\u2019ll plunge down into the black hole, after which no more energy can be extracted. But at this 6% rate, you\u2019d only need to\nthrow 17 cats into a black hole to power Norway for a year. Compared to the 0.00000001% efficiency of\nchemical reactions and the 0.7% efficiency of nuclear reactions, 6% for a non-rotating\nblack hole may seem pretty good. But rotating black holes are even better,\nbecause of how they bend spacetime. They literally \u201cdrag\u201d things orbiting\nthem in the direction of their rotation, which means the innermost possible orbit can be\nmuch closer to the black hole (as long as you\u2019re rotating along with the black hole). The details depend on how fast the black hole\nis rotating, but for a very quickly rotating black hole the innermost possible orbit coincides\nwith the event horizon! And the event horizon itself is half as big\nas for a non-rotating black hole. Combined together, this means that matter\nfalling into rotating black holes can convert as much as 42% of its mass into energy. Or equivalently, you\u2019d only need 2 and a\nhalf inspiralling cats to power Norway for a year. So, if you really want to convert the mass\nof an object into energy, don\u2019t bother with chemical reactions, or nuclear fission, or\nnuclear fusion: throw it into a rapidly rotating black hole. If you\u2019re wondering how I calculated the\nefficiencies of converting mass to energy, you can just divide the energy any reaction\nreleases by the mass energy of the things involved \u2013 for example, when radium radioactively\ndecays into radon and helium it releases 6.6 MeV of energy, and the mass energy of a single\nneutron or proton is about 940MeV, so I\u2019ll leave it to you to figure out how efficient\nalpha decay is at converting mass to energy!

The guy is insane, but in a genius way. - I just feel happy right now. - It makes me reminisce \nback to when I was in middle school. Back when I had no responsibilities\nand all I did was listen to MCR. \u266a (industrial music) \u266a - (Finebros) So this was a selection \nof songs from My Chemical Romance, who were super popular back in the 2000's. Overall, what did you think of their music? - I really liked it. - Some of it was a little bit dark. The visuals, I think, \nis the most interesting part. - It's just a little heavier \nthan I listen to, but I know The Black Parade. That's, like, the staple. - I love their music. I used to listen to that style religiously. - It speaks to me on a spiritual level. - I love the lyrics \n'cause it's all so poetic and it tells a story, especially\nwith The Black Parade album. It's like a complete rock opera. Every song is talking \nabout the concept of death. - (Finebros) We're covering them \nnow because their album, The Black Parade, \nwas released back in 2006, making this the 10th anniversary\nof that album. - No way! - Yeah, that sound about right, yeah. - Wow. That's only ten year old. - I feel old. I'm an adult. I pay taxes. That's wild. - (Finebros) What does the song\nWelcome to the Black Parade and The Black Parade album mean to you\nand what memories does it give you? - It gives me total memories. The Black Parade was the go-to album\nfor everybody at that age. - I remember My Chemical Romance\nbeing the epitome of emo rock. - I remember I was just laying in my bed, looking at the ceiling like, \"Oh my god.\" It speaks to me in ways \nthat most music doesn't. - I get really emotional \nlistening to that song. I think I was going through \nsome sort of bullying at the time and (sniffling) that song \njust really gave me the strength. It honestly just inspired me to, \nyou know, stay true to myself and be who I am made to be. - (Finebros) So the band \nstayed together for about 12 years, but eventually broke up in 2013. But not too long ago, \nthe band's account tweeted out a vague promo video \nthat ended with the date 9/23/16. - Yeah, everyone was like, \"Tour?\nOr get back together?\" - It was all over my Twitter feed and stuff. It's like the second coming of Jesus. - (Finebros) A day later, \nthey said the promo was only for the upcoming \n10th anniversary addition of The Black Parade album,\nwhich devastated many of the fans who thought they might be \ngetting back together. What do you think about that? - That's just messing with peoples' hearts. - That's a huge tease. That's like bringing out \na pepperoni and being like, \"You'll get the pizza eventually.\" - That's not cool, My Chemical Romance. Don't go in that direction. - That'd be so [bleep] disappointing. I'd be so pissed. - I think it's clever marketing. We're gonna pretend \nlike we're getting back together so people will tune in \nand check us out again, but then we're just not. - I was pissed. They had to know \nthat by tweeting this out, especially with how vague it is,\nthat people would take it as a \"we got something\nin the books for you!\" - (Finebros) So even though\nthey've been broken up for several years now, they still have \nthis very committed fan base that continues to follow\nthe band to this day. Why do you think they've\nmaintained such a huge following? - I think it must've just made \na really good impression on people. - Just 'cause they love their music. I mean, music really never dies. - If you really fall \nin love with the music, or the band and group, \nthey're pretty much immortal to you. - People don't want \nto let go of their past. Like, I still listen to stuff \nway back from the '90s. - They were obviously \na very emotional band, so there's probably a lot of people\nthat were going through stuff in high school and junior high\nand they used My Chemical Romance to sort of get away. - Before My Chem, \nthere wasn't really a band that spoke to the emo community as much, as widespread as they did. But then My Chem came along,\nand they're like, \"Be emo with us. We're gonna write songs \nabout what you're going through.\" - (Finebros) So finally, \nwhat do you think is the legacy of My Chemical Romance\nand The Black Parade? - I mean, I think it's gonna \ncontinue on for a pretty long time. I think that that's gonna \ntrail along as a staple in early 2000's music. - They were one of the last people\nthat produced quality music in that genre. - You know when our parents are like, \n\"Ah, ACDC, Led Zeppelin, they're the best.\" People are gonna be like, \"Back in my day,\nwe had The Black Parade.\" They'll be one of the classics, for sure. - It's not very often that \nyou're gonna find a modern day band that's going to have \na song or songs or album that is gonna last forever. I wasn't around for The Beatles, \nbut I still know-- you could play one note \nof The Beatles song and I'm like, \"Ah, that's Day Tripper.\" I bet you that's what our kids \nare gonna do with The Black Parade. - Thanks for watching \nthis episode of College Kids React. - Subscribe!

guys wanna party up and when I do this Easter egg with two players three players or four players all the steps are the same and I guess let's get this started so you know you need to get the stats and everything like that you want to make sure all those are upgraded and also you want to make sure all the six generators are on and now you need to actually feed soul boxes now you can actually do this as soon as you start up origins like you can do this before upgrading the staffs or after that it does not matter but I will show you each and every single steps so you need to feed soul box then there are four full boxes around the map if you're playing origins or origins remaster once again it does not matter so there are four soul boxes on you need about twenty to thirty kills and you want to make sure that you are timing this correctly because if the robot actually steps on it it's going to reset so that is that so there are four boxes one can be around generator number five near stem enough so this is the one and once again like I said like you want to make sure you want to time this correctly if the if you got about 19 tails and you're missing just one kill just one zombie kill and that zombies not spawning in and the next thing you know boy oh boy the robot steps on it it's going to completely reset so I just want to make sure about that so that is the the first whole box the next is going to be around the excavation site it's going to be in the middle once again this is going to be in the robot pathway which kind of sucks at the same time but it's kind of what it is so that's that so that is the number to it and the next one is going to be around the excavation I should say the generator number for near Juggernog so that is the third one right here once again you want to get twenty kills and the last one is going to be around the church generator number six where we are right here and once again it's going to be in the robot pathway so these are the full boxes you can do this as soon as you start up origins that is the worst step and once you do that you can now go ahead to the church area to the generator number six and you can now pick up your Thunder face so once you got that the next step is to actually get the tablet from generator number two tank station it's going to be on the table right here you want to pick up this tablet and you want to make your way to the generator number six inside the church and you want to put this in water and you want to base that [ __ ] up and you need to get about twenty melee kills now keep in mind those melee kills can be with your Thunder face like I showed you how to get this on their face so that is going to make it ten times easy for you to actually get those melee kills but you can actually kill zombies with your zombie shield that counts as a melee kill and you can also kill zombies bid your upgraded staff so that can be another thing but you also need to actually fill up soul boxes and get the Thunder fest because we need to actually complete that step so make sure you got that and make sure you do this so 20 kills twenty melee kills and after that you want to pick this bad boy up you will see the color will change it will be more white as soon as that is cleaned up and everything like that so you want to pick this up anybody make your way back to the generator number two tank station and put it back on the table now here's the catch you do not want to walk on mud so that's a complete no-no you don't want to walk on mud because that will reset the process and you would have to actually base that tablet once again and that is kind of like that it's going to be really really frustrating depending on what round you're on so that is that so in order to avoid make sure you are jumping and you make sure you are walking on the on the wood and follow this path right here that I'm showing you in the gameplay so it's going to lead you exactly to the tank station to the to the table right here's the one if you actually get to the generator number two tank station place your tablet on the table right here and now you need to once again get 20 kills in order to acquire the airstrike so once you get a couple of melee kills you will see there's a airstrike that will be available on the table right here take that up and that is that and now we're on to the next step which is to actually get the Maxis drone once again you can actually get the Maxis drone as soon as you spawn in and as soon as you spawn in you know that there is a brain in the spawn room so that is one part for the Maxis drone so that is Max's brain pick that up and the next part is the body part of the the Maxis drone and there are three locations where the body part of the Maxis drone can spawn in so it can either spawn in between the path old Church and generator number five or Church and generator number four it's going to be on this path right here this is the tank path so it's going to be right here these are the two locations or it can be inside the ice tunnel which is going to be once again near generator number six so that is that that's the second part and the last part is going to be the rotor and that can spawn inside the excavation site it's going to be near the pack punch right here or it will be down there near the where the gramophone spawns and it's going to be around this area or it can be by the mule kick so these are all the parts and simply go ahead and build up your Maxis drone now we're on to the next step which is to actually place your stuff inside the robot head and the only way you can actually get inside the robot head is to actually see what foot is lit up and if you see there's a foot lit up you can shoot that and you need to be in the robot pathway and he will step on you and then you will be entered in the robot now there are three steps that you need to actually put inside the robot head there is no like you have to do this in any order you can do this in any order you would like to but it needs to be specific so the the eye step needs to be inside the church our robot so there will be a robot that will come around the church area it will step around the generator number six around the church area so the eye step is going to go there the wind step is going to go in the middle robot head and the Lightning set is going to go inside the robot that actually steps on around the starting room so that is that and once you got all of that now you need to actually press a red button when you are inside the robot because you need to actually launch your airstrike that we picked up from the table by doing that tablet stuff now the best way to do this step is to actually be inside the middle robot head and you will see there's a red button so simply just be close to it and once you are inside the robot head and if you're staying in for too long you will hear that there is going to be a countdown that will go off and that will actually kick you once I reaches zero so once the countdown reaches one you want to actually hold square X or F on that red button and now you're actually going to get kicked out of that middle robot head and you will just going to fall down and what you want to do is you want to come up to this area and you want to throw up your ear strike exactly right here and that will make that bunker just blow up and you'll see that there will be a lot of Panthers that will spawn and simply just kill all of them and now what you want to do is make sure you deploy your maxes on the one that we have built earlier and that will go down and that will just like get the part that you need so that is that and now the next step is to actually get zombie blood now you can actually make your own zombie blood with the ISTEP and everything like that but once you get the zombie blood make sure you look up in the sky and you will see there will be an airplane that will be circling around and that will be kind of lit up and that will have like a yellow light on it you want to simply shoot that plane down and you will see the pilot will fall down and he will always do the clockwise around the escalation side so simply go in counterclockwise make sure you take that son of a gun down and he will drop the Maxis drone and you want to pick that Maxis drone up and now you need to actually go down to the escalation side and there will be couple of like no zombies or zombies with like white color around their wrists and everything like that and now you need to actually punch those zombies you need to get melee kills with the Thunder fizz about like you need to get about 20 kills so that is that and now we're on to the last step which is to actually place all your staffs down in a guard toss so simply make your way over to the crazy place place all your staff down in here and now you need to get about 100 kill you can get hundred kills with your guns it does not need to be melee kills but you need to get hundred kills in total and once you get 100 kills you will see the Gateway to Agartha will be open up there will be a portal and you simply want to fly your max is drawn into that portal and boom here you go you got your Easter Egg done if you have found this video quick and informative give it a like subscribe for more and check out some other videos on the channel and I'll see you guys very freaking soon you", "hLH6uMGbhUk": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video and today's video if you couldn't tell from the title this is going to be a return of the top five strains of the current year you know if you guys have been the og of this channel you guys know that top five strains of each year has been a staple of my channel I haven't actually done one this year which is pretty crazy because I used to do these every year and it's already like July of this year and I haven't done in 2019 one yet so I figure you know let's give the people what they want I don't know if people want this but I know some of you guys really appreciate the top five strong restraints of the current year so yeah let's get it to it I am actually gonna pack some of this sativa in the morning pack this before we start this video but let's just hurry this up you know so hopefully you guys are having an awesome morning so far it is 11 a.m. it is I believe a Tuesday and yeah just planning on getting some videos done before I have to go to work so if you guys didn't see this wax already this is that you'll rip or wax you might have seen it already it's the Dairy Queen that still got some very very nice stuff in the morning to hit it is a sativa as well so have your joints ready and we're gonna start this pretty soon and just think effective real before I start this video I'd like to say that I have none of these strains on hand this is just me purely reading an article just like my other videos so if you're disappointed I am sorry I do have other wheat videos that you can check out where I smoked and all that good stuff I mean I did do it here right now I'm gonna take the handle plug and play for you guys so after we got that hit out of the way it is still cloudy air here guys so the website I found this on it's not my typical website that I usually go to Herb Kohl was one of them but this website is called marijuana break calm and how we call their stuff in the bottom description below thank you marijuana break for having an awesome article for us for me to read and for us to read all of us you know I'm saying as usual you got to start from the bottom of the list you know those a so let's just get that to you okay so with number five we got strawberry banana guys the marijuana stream that tastes like dessert I've actually had strawberry banana before fairly recent too and yeah it does smell exactly like strawberries and it tastes exactly like strawberry so that being on there is point like I'm honestly surprised I actually tried one of these strains on here but it says this is an indica dominant hybrid cross with banana cut strawberry bubblegum it is a mainstay on the Haight I'm strongly strains on earth list and has been selected three years in a row on at least one phenotype of the strain by green wolf LA and Green Country rebellion average THC levels 31.6 to this is number of five guys on the list that is crazy so it says up to 32% it is an expert only bud that packs a serious punch okay so I the strawberry banana that I've tried was not nowhere near that percentage it was like 23 I believe but it was like outdoor so for like them to have 23% outdoor stuff like I can only imagine what indoors gonna look like so enough with that we go to number four which is white Tahoe cookie so I've actually tried this before I bought some that PCF it's like a year or two ago and it was a coincidence because I remember I tried it and then I did a list and on that list was that on if like the literally said that this year this string was like highest THC and I gotta say why Tahoe cookies is pretty fire like if you haven't tried already you should try I think it's the white and ghost uh cookies right I believe yeah it's crossed with the white gross calories and Tahoe oh geez so the name of the hybrid became obvious to the creator why Tahoe cookies has become extremely popular on the west coast and it clocks in at about 27 percent THC pretty good at man it is an indica dominant string roughly about 70% indica and one of the most aesthetically pleasing marijuana strings on the ground like mine look fire I'll tell you that right now like I'm not sure if it's indoor/outdoor but it'll look fire I'll tell you that right now it says the in terms of vector will be shocked at how quickly why tell clearly starts to take its take hits hey take hit the senses within minutes you should feel euphoric and your mind should be filled with great ideas because the screen is fantastic for creativity so definitely recommend it for you know before you start editing before you start your creative process smoke some like cookies you know there's other stuff in here but I'll give it to you for the article to read notes and got number three it's Irish cream okay so this is actually one that I haven't heard of yet or haven't even tried it but just pretty crazy like but usually these top top five strains I usually only try like one or like none you know two or any two out of three that's pretty funny good this training is a real McCoy this is yet another case of selectively breeding to yield an exceptionally popular Irish cream is an indica developed by mighty Irish seeds they cross bred real McCoy and cookies and cream and the result was the stream that clocks in at an average of 27 so the same average so there's probably some matter of testing 2:30 that's like 25 and then just average this like 27 which is fairly high I would say if you smooth this string with the belief that will taste like Bailey's though you're in for a disappointment as it offers classic dank weed flavors instead you'll find this bud offers the taste of fresh herbs and pine and while it doesn't taste quite like the sweet cream string it is nonetheless a pleasant experience I'm guessing this is also an indica dominant Irina says it's extremely potent and makes it ideal for treating anxiety stress depression and even clinic pain there's a little bit more here but you just going to leave that for you to read and I don't want to read too much of this number 2 we got is ken-dog okay I've tried that I think so many people here have tried Kamboj ken-dog has been like I don't know how old the strain is specifically but I've been hearing about Kim nog for years now and I've tried it for years now and it says right here the pungent marijuana strain can be thought previously held the record for highest THC content when it clocked it at 32 point one three percent so can done let me know your comments on ken-dog I'm pretty sure a majority of you if not majority of you at least some of you have tried Kindle let me know your comments the previous the previous one who held the record you know I'm saying kevdog it says it is one of the most mysterious drains as it little is known about its genetics or history however rumor has it that ken-dog is across a bowtie and never the police the police subpoena whatever its ancestral lineage it should not go without saying that catalog is not for the new me it is an indica dominant hybrid you guys seen the theme for all these dreams I feel like from chains to be pump nowadays they have to be like indica you know like City bizarre good but like even will yield as much like THC in my opinion like don't quote me am I'm probably wrong I don't know but that's why I've seen the notice like when they're potent they're either a hybrid or in you know they're not really just pure sativa then again I don't know what I'm like I don't know if that's true or not is that indica dominant hybrid 55% is known renown for its pungent scent which carries more than a hint of diesel in fact the string is used to create Sour Diesel another one of the world's most popular strains okay so this is actually pretty old then because Sour Diesel is pretty [ __ ] old so if chem Todd made Sour Diesel Ken dogs even older Sour Diesel so this is probably like over 20 years old let me know incomes below you know I'm saying so last but not least we got number one let's just see what this is godfather oh gee guys and uh I have heard of this I've seen at my local dispensary but I've never tried it if I do know of his existence I did not know those number one let me know if you guys encountered such a strain like I like I said I've encountered it I didn't fight I just remember a lot of people mentioning it Satan those [ __ ] fire it was like the greatest street name ever tried hoping strongest [ __ ] and it says it runs it about the highest report it was 34 percent which is [ __ ] absurd that is truly crazy and it's it really is crazy because like weed over 25% it's just crazy to me already you know it really is like this little nugget has 25% of THC and this just 34 is that it was cultivated by California herbal remedies and is believed to be a cross of cherry pie oh gee cush and granddaddy herb see now now you know why it's called Godfather Ho Chi the granddaddy you know granddaddy Godfather then we got the OG Kush and then the cherry pie probably just adds a little fruit zest to it I don't [ __ ] know with the information in him there is no surprise that to learn that Godfather og is often referred to as the dawn of all constrains even the typical strain should have TC of over 25 Wow and you just throw in its 25 percent THC I don't know if that's what they mean by then but that's pretty crazy of course strengthening nothing without quality and godfather LG has done has absolutely no shortage of quality says this strain has one high Times Cannabis Cup our best into the string in the past and when you smoke the but it will hit you like an incredible Surrey full height that super results in a whole body euphoria users tend to feel calm and happy with the euphoric effects boozing over mine and by god father OG provides you with the feeling of total relaxation and could ever render you a mobile or couch lock for the abdomens such is its potency Wow so those are the strays top 5 best strongest strains of 2019 so far hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I know I haven't done one of these in a while so I'm a bit rusty you know and uh I know some people especially the people that don't know my channel they just are watching a random video on my channel they're not there's no weed oh these clone a weed or just all these nitpick stuff and I'm probably gonna get an epic for this you know fer addressing those you know I feel like if I address those in the video then I won't have to do so in the comments but yes if you guys enjoyed this video I appreciate the [ __ ] out of you and I'll see you guys the next one peace out [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "6hSdJyVzv0c": "[Music] the toreador black is a pneumatically operated suction spray gun that attaches to most air compressors even smaller ones with the discharge rate of at least 270 per minute or 75 to 90 psi this can be achieved using compressors with a reservoir of as little as 13 gallons your air compressor must be rated at 5.5 CFM or higher the compressed air driven suction feet gun rotates spirally during the operation that loosens dirt particles with extremely high power guided by a ball bearing design to clean faster and much more efficiently with a tornado cleaning action the toner door black dispenses air soap and water under high pressure to quickly loosen dirt and grime with even less cleaning product compared to the toreador classic we'll be using the optional toner door black brush attachment to clean certain areas around the vehicle this attachment will help agitate and loosen dirt while dispensing products to make your entire process quicker and easier the toreador black features additional improvements over the toreador classic like it's reduced air consumption and noise output levels despite having twice as much power as the classic this improved design paired with sealed ball bearings inside the rotation set means there is less wear on the plastic elements increasing the lifespan of this tool the toreador black comes standard with an air regulator so you're now able to change the working pressure directly on the tool and also to accurately regulate the quantity of chemicals you use to prepare your toreador black pour two to three ounces of a low foaming cleaner into the quart jar we recommend using our toreador interior super soap for this as it's formulated to be used for this exact application once you pour in a few ounces of product simply fill the rest of the jar up with water and your toreador black is ready to use after you've mixed your solution in the jar turn the liquid air valve to the upright position to deliver cleaning solution holding the cleaning nozzle one to three inches from the area to be cleaned fully depress the trigger down and move overlapping motion over the area the torn or black cleaning gun releases a fine mist of cleaning solution that does not over saturate surfaces turn the dial down to shut off the water and use the compressed air to dry the cleaned area it's that simple for any more information on the toreador

your maze are often hard to look amazing because you got to put dressing and all these little cracks and crevices and a lot of newer cars are plastic like this one plastic covers over the spark plugs valve covers plastic intake manifolds plastic fan shroud all this dust plastic and you have to get it into the cracks and crevices that sometimes a spray can't do that so I got our black on black now black on blacks like my favorite thing to use on engine base because it sprays on easy it gives a nice fresh look and it gets in all those cracks and crevices that a normal spray or cream can't do so I'm burning pressure wash this engine bay but it still looks really faint it has a lot of miles on it in the heat tends to discolor the plastic so I'm gonna take a little bit of black on black and show you how I can make this engine may look fresh again I'll start with the valve cover black are actually easy to use because all you do is you start spraying it everywhere okay you don't need to use a lot you use it just like you would spray paint but it's not paint it's actually a dressing in a in a spray aerosol form so you know what if the valve cover is already starting to look good so let's do the rest of the valve cover too you can see how it goes from black it's all faded over here but it looks black and fresh on this side so let's start doing the rest of the valve cover now I gently spray it all over the valve cover spray it over you can take manifold and the intake manifold cover as well I'll go over to the line take manifold on this side you'll notice that the black on black gets right down into the cracks that's what a lot of people really love about it that's what I like about this product too makes it very versatile it's handle this part right here let's go all out on it for the airbox now I'm working very hard to get it all deep into the cracks and crevices all the hoses everywhere let's try and get this fancy on to now I can give it on this break ABS unit and I can also get it back here on top of these cabin filter cases right here this is a good example this part right here this rubber piece looks really faded we make it block quickly and easily using walking walk look at the fire wall I like this product because it gets hoses and things to so down here's a lot of thing at these hoses makes an electrical products great makes every part of my engine bay looks amazing this is great for plastic rubber vinyl works on all parts interior and exterior and keeps it looking great so now that I've done that I'm gonna take a microfiber towel this is a pink microfiber towel that I took from the showroom and I'm gonna gently wipe any excess off the top of the plastic and you'll notice it took away that greasy look and left a nice natural dry to the touch look somebody the same thing with the valve cover all the black on black needs is a minute to soak into the plastic and give a great look and it's giving that original BMW look we'll say I just bought it this car is pretty old but with just a few squeeze of the black on black and a quick wipe with a microfiber towel you can have any engine bay looking great makes the plastics look well cared for and it makes it look new a lot of mechanics often say they'd rather work on a clean engine bay because it keeps their hands cleaner it makes it easier to find leaks across the engine and it's just an all-around better look there's something I like to call pride of ownership and that's a how will you take care of your car after owning it a lot of people don't care for the engine bay but I always like to make sure to take my time on engine bay I really like a clean fresh engine this last part right here if there's any little areas that you missed you can always go back and spray really quick there's some dry spots in the back you want to get now our engine bay just looks great so now we've got a nice clean engine bu look at the beginning it started all faded nasty the color of the plastic was discolored I started turning gray now all we did was shoot a few sprays and black-on-black on the surface and it made it dry to the touch and it's gonna keep our engine looking great so if you need a way to detail your engine keep it looking fresh you can check out our website our Facebook subscribe to our YouTube channels and you can always find black on black on chemicalguys.com [Music]",

one. - \u266a (rock intro) \u266a - (FBE) So today, we're gonna\nhave you read some lyrics from top songs\nall by one current artist and have you tell us\nthe meaning and what you think, then you'll get to listen\nto the songs you read and tell us your thoughts.\n- Good. - Oh, I love this.\nOkay, great. - Okay, let's do it.\nI'm curious. - I love, love analyzing lyrics. - I like that.\nYou've introduced me to some great new artists. - \"Well, I'll choose the life\nI've taken, never mind the friends I'm making.\" - \"And the beauty that\nI'm faking let me live my life like this.\" It all rhymes. - Almost sounds like some\nkind of wise guru talking. (laughs) - They're not being really\nthemselves, but this is the way they wanna be to be able\nto survive and live the way they want to live, so yeah.\nFake it 'til you make it, I guess. - \"Never mind the friends\nI'm making.\" I guess may be a reference\nto a lot of the artificial friends you make when you're successful. - \"What will it take to show you\nthat it's not the life it seems? I'm not okay.\" - \"I've told you time\nand time again, you sing the words but don't\nknow what it means.\" Obviously, talking to someone that\nis probably not getting them. - Some people look at him\nand think \"Oh, you should be happy. You got fame. You got money.\"\nBut inside you may not be happy. - \"To be a joke, and look,\nanother line without a hook. I held you close as\nwe both shook.\" - \"For the first time,\ntake a good hard look.\" Now that's the way Smokey\nused to write, now. You know, rhymes. - The hook is what you remember.\nThat's what they put in a song, so \"another line without a hook,\"\nso it's just something there. It's not even of any importance. - \"I held you close\nas we both shook.\" Is that sexual? - You're thinking of me as a joke?\nI'm serious what's in my heart here. For the last time, why don't you\ntake a look at me and see who I am?\nThat's my interpretation. - So, they were close\nand now they're not and he's telling her\ntake a last look, 'cause this is probably it.\nIt's over. - \"When I was a young boy,\nmy father took me into the city to see\na marching band.\" - \"He said 'Son, when you grow up,\nwould you be the savior of the broken, the beaten,\nand the damned?'\" That's beautiful. - That's a father taking his son\nin tow, and trying to expose him to the world\nand educate him and maybe inspire him. - Are you gonna be a leader\nin the world? Are you gonna represent\nthose that need representation, that need a voice? - I'm just wondering if he\nlived a life of privilege and maybe his father's\njust telling him-- or just basically telling him\nthat, like Jesus being the savior, you know we have to take care\nof the poor. - \"Son, when you grow up\nwould you be the savior?\" Meaning that he missed the boat.\nThat he was not the savior. - \"We'll carry on.\nWe'll carry on. And thought you're dead and gone,\nbelieve me. Your memory will carry on.\" - It's about someone losing\nsomeone very close, a son perhaps.\nThat lyric comes very close to home. - This has to be a person\nthat has made an effect on their life, a positive one,\nbecause you're not gonna remember someone you don't care about. - It's just the reassurance\nthat whatever your mission was to make a difference in the world,\nthat in your name, we will continue the fight. - \"Your memory will carry on,\"\nso they're going to keep the tradition of what the father\nor the grandfather was doing. - That's pretty sad.\nSo that's about losing someone and I would get kind of emotional\nwhen I talk about it, 'cause being my age,\nI've lost a lot of people in my life that I really love. - \"'Oh let me tell you\n'bout the sad man.' Shut up and let me see\nyour jazz hands.\" - \"Remember when you were\na mad man. Thought you was Batman.\nAnd hit the party with a gas can? Kiss me, you animal!\"\nOkay. Those are interesting lyrics. - That's the best kind of lyric.\nWhen you can picture the lyric in your mind. - \"Shut up and let me see\nyour jazz hands.\" Well, sometimes that means\njust perform when you're not really feeling it. - When he says \"Remember\nwhen you were a mad man.\" maybe he's talking about\nhow this musician's life used to be,\nhow intense his life was. - A gas can.\nI'm not sure about that. I don't know if that's\nsomeone that is sniffing something to get high.\nI don't know about the \"kiss me.\"\nI guess they're all excited about it, I don't know.\n(laughs) Maybe it's a turn on. - \"You run the company.\n[bleep] like a Kennedy.\" - \"I think we'd rather be burning\nyour information. Let's blow an artery.\nEat plastic surgery. Keep your apology.\nGive us more detonation.\" (laughs)\nOh man, what is going through this guy's head? - \"[bleep] like a Kennedy.\"\nis you're powerful. You can take advantage of people\nbecause you have power. - \"Let's blow an artery.\"\nYeah, I can get that. Hey, let's live with gusto.\nGet as many plastic surgeries as we want to. - Someone here's living\nover the top or beyond what they can handle,\nmentally or physically. - Just living life high on the hog,\nreally, just living it up and he's like \"Keep your apology.\"\nThey're really not sorry that's the way they're living. - Lyrics are poetry and I may not\nget the way this is presented, but obviously I did get something\nfrom the lyrics. It definitely makes its point. - (FBE) Any idea whose lyrics\nyou've been reading? - I have no idea. - Not a clue. - Maybe somebody like Jay-Z? - (FBE) So, these were lyrics\nto songs from My Chemical Romance's\nrepertoire. - What?\nNever heard of them. - That's the name of them,\nMy Chemical Romance. Uh, well, okay. - (FBE) So, My Chemical Romance's\ngenre has been classified as alternative rock\nor punk rock. - Right. - (FBE) Some have controversially\ncategorized the band as emo, but lead vocalist\nGerard Way hates that term calling it garbage.\nHe says the band is heavily influenced by Queen,\nIron Maiden, The Smiths, and many more.\n- Wow. Well, I think they have\nsome great lyrics. - I'd have to hear the actual--\nwhen I hear the music. When you're throwing Queen\nout there, you better be good. - Okay, and I love Queen.\nThe lyrics were always very direct and interesting. - (FBE) Let's go ahead\nand play you the songs you read. - Yeah, I'm really curious now. - \u266a Well I'll choose the life\nI've taken \u266a \u266a Never mind the friends\nI'm making \u266a \u266a and the beauty \u266a\n- Definitely rock. - \u266a Live my life like this \u266a\n- (laughs) Pretty wild. - Yeah, it's a little punkish,\nthe rock, for me. - It's not the kind of music\nyou want to get up and dance to. I'm not used to mosh pits. - I could see them out throwing\ntheir hair around and bopping their heads,\nyou know, up and down. - Their lyrics get--\nif they have a meaning, they get lost in all the\nrancor and the ruckus of the music. - Comparing the lyrics\nof some of-- that we just reviewed,\nif it's presented in that type of music,\nI would never pick up on it, never hear it. - \u266a What will it take to show you\nthat it's not the life it seems? \u266a \u266a I've told you time\nand time again \u266a \u266a You sing the words \u266a\n- That's not as crazy. - \u266a What it means\nto be a joke and look \u266a \u266a Another line without a hook\nI held you close as we both shook \u266a \u266a For the last time\ntake a good hard look \u266a - I can understand those lyrics\nmuch better. - They're definitely not for me.\nAnd it wasn't written for me. - I bet some of these could\nactually be a much better song if you put them down to just\na basic folk guitar, just a single artist\nkind of thing. They may wanna try that sometime. - \u266a When I was a young boy \u266a \u266a My father took me into... \u266a\n- I like that. - \u266a ...The city\nto see a marching band \u266a - I can hear the Queen influences\non this one. - You can turn that up\na little bit. Unless they're gonna change\nup real quick and go into that ratatat thing in about two seconds. - \u266a And the damned \u266a \u266a We'll carry on \u266a \u266a We'll carry on \u266a\n- The beginning had such potential. - Now, they had a good thing going,\nyou know, you can pick it up a little bit, but you don't have to\ngo from zero to sixty in eight seconds. - I still like it. - I love the beginning.\nThat lyrical, sort of melancholy. - Of all them that you just played,\nI like this one and I can hear it's more\nthe rock and roll that I have listened to. - This song actually is\nnot as heavy into it and I get a chance\nhear the lyrics. - \u266a Oh let me tell you\n'bout the sad man \u266a \u266a Shut up and let me\nsee your jazz hands \u266a - Yeah, more head banging. - I kinda like this one. - Very good workout song.\n(laughs) - \u266a You run the company\n(na na na na) \u266a - (singing along) Na, na, na. - This is interesting.\n- \u266a Burning your information \u266a - Not something I'd ever listen to. - Yeah, it's not so bad.\nI'm tapping my foot. You can't see it,\nbut I'm tapping my foot right now. - I like that \"na na na\" hook.\nI like that (singing) na, na, na, na.\nI like that. I like that one. - If there's poetry\nor if there's a meaning in the lyrics,\nthat should take precedence and not rush through them\nreally quickly. - It's just too monotonous.\nI don't like being screamed at in person, so I don't want\nto be screamed at when I'm trying to relax\nand listen to music. - Pretty interesting\nand I could hear the influences like you\ntalked about some of the other groups of the past.\nYeah, are they doing really well? - (FBE) Yeah.\n- Good. I could see why. - Thanks for watching this episode\non the React Channel. - Don't miss out.\nSubscribe! - Bye guys and carry on. - Hey guys, I'm Katie,\na React Channel producer. Thank you so much for your\ncomments for My Chemical Romance. Now let me know down in the comments\nwhat the elders should listen to next.\nThanks guys, bye!", "lbNF8k-gFeY": "hey everybody today I'm going to be showing you how to make dry water now water is wet because it can wet things but the problem with trying to dry out water is that once you dry it you don't have any water left but today I'm going to be showing you how to actually make water that is dry but still water now this water is a liquid a liquid means that it takes the form of its container and it has a consistent volume unlike a gas where it's always changing the volume you can compress it really easily but the water here is a liquid so it conforms to its container has a definite volume whereas this sound here even though it may seem kind of liquid like we can all agree that this is a solid because it's just tiny little pieces of bigger rocks and it doesn't quite conform to its container as you can see I can kind of stack it up on one side of the container here so it doesn't fully conform to the container because it's not a liquid it's a solid and another thing is the sand doesn't get my hand wet because it doesn't stick to me because it doesn't fill in all the tiny little crevices of my glove here and so it doesn't get my hand wet so the goal today is to try to make this water here more like this sand here so the only difference between this sand and this water here is that these are tiny little molecules and these are giant granules of sand comparatively so what if we could somehow make these tiny little droplets of water that all stay separate like these grains of sand here and so that's what I'm going to do today is I'm gonna try to separate this water into tiny little granules that stay separate and don't come back together so that in the end you have sand like particles of water which are actually more solid like than liquid like so you have dry water okay now have you ever tried to separate water into tiny little droplets and not have them recombine well let's try in a blender and see what happens okay Blendtec show us your magic [Music] okay well that didn't work so you can see all my little droplets that I tried to separate even though they were getting hit by those blades and separated into tiny little micro particles they all just combined back together because of the surface tension of the water it just pulled them back together the droplets were all attracted to each other and they formed one big droplet again so I'm gonna have to do something to try to keep those tiny little droplets separate and in order to do that I'm going to be using this really cool stuff called fumed silica okay now fume silica is really neat stuff it has an extremely low density it's made from quartz and that they liquefy in an extremely hot plasma arc and then it condenses into these tiny little nano or micro droplets and it condenses and forms this powder but it's a very very fine powder [Music] so it has an extremely low density and also they can make it very hydrophobic okay for example let's see how much fifty milliliters of this weighs [Music] so that's about 1.9 grams per 50 milliliters okay for comparison here's 1.9 grams of salt so this is the weight of salt that equals 50 milliliters worth of the fumed silica here so you can see how much less dense the fume silica is okay so here's my water that I'm going to turn into dry water put this in then put some of my fused silica in let's out a little bit more water to it [Music] okay this is weird now here's our dry water so weird look at this [Music] so it feels like it should be wet but it's not it almost looks like whipped cream but it's completely dry my hands are not getting wet at all now here's our water look at this that is the coolest thing ever see how it doesn't even get me wet or sticky at all this is so weird it's like this in-between between a powder and a liquid because it has these characteristics of a powder like this looks like I'm playing with maybe baking powder or something but then it also has these liquid properties see how it kind of splashes this is actually called dry water and it can be up to 95% water depending on how fluid like you want it so this dry water is basically just a water air emulsion and it's actually used in industry what they use it for is to sequester gases so because this dry water is actually tiny little droplets of water you can actually dissolve a lot of gas into it and so it's a way to transport dangerous gases so if you have explosive gases that you don't want to have in a large compressed cylinder or something you can dissolve it into the water into the dry water here and it's easy to transport and it's not an explosive risk it can actually even be used for a carbon capture method because it can easily absorb co2 into it and so you can capture the co2 from the atmosphere and contain it in your dry water which is actually a really interesting application because it can actually hold more co2 than regular water by itself okay so let's put some of this on my slide here and see what it looks like under the microscope so you can see under the microscope now this colloidal mixture of this powder and water here and depending on how much liquid you put in you can get it to be more powder like or more liquid like which is really cool [Music] [Music] see how it kind of jiggles like jello it looks like it's just like baking powder flour or something but it has the mass of water okay there we go so 28 grams 450 milliliters now so it's now 15 times more dense than the powder was before that's because it's now filled in with water now if this were a hundred percent water now it should weigh around 50 grams so that means it's about as half as dense as water right now that's because the tiny little droplets of water are surrounded by this hydrophobic fume silica and so it makes it so that there's air in between so there's a lot of trapped air in between here that makes it a lot less dense and I also have an exciting announcement to make my wife and I have gathered up all of our favorite experiments from my channel once that we thought that you could easily do at home and we put them in book form so you can now purchase your very own action lab experiment book it has 30 experiments in it it's a really cool book because I feel like anybody from younger age to older age would have fun doing the experiments in the book because they're not your typical chemistry lab experiments or physics lab experiments that you've seen before so you can purchase it at the link in my description you can get it at Amazon or Barnes & Noble so head over there now and check out the action lab experiment book and thanks for watching another episode of the action lab I hope you enjoyed it if you did don't forget to hit the subscribe button and remember to hit the bell also you won't be notified with my latest videos coming out unless you hit the bell now and head

machine a easter egg guy this is the most easy concise just simple easter egg guide that i can make for this map with everything included this is the entire map everything you need to know is included in this video we just got first in the world for the easter egg today which i am so so excited about and i'm excited for you guys to get your first completion as well so without further ado let's get into step one so the first step is to get your free diet weapon and from there on you can go on to upgrading it but in order to go ahead and get this free die weapon you do have to actually turn on the power and build the pack and punch machine in the dark ether now once you do both of these things in the next following rounds there's going to be this radioactive zombie that spawns you obviously kill him the first time he splits into two different parts you kill the first part and then the second part that you actually kill he is going to drop a golden key card this is a special item that is going to go into your inventory and stay there for the rest of the game you're going to pick up that key card and once you have that key card you can immediately go down to the weapons lab now once you are in the weapons lab you're gonna go ahead and go up to this drawer that is blinking with the red light is going to allow you to insert that key card and once you do that you'll be able to pull out that die remote control now this remote control is actually going to allow you to activate a die that is stuck inside of knocked around total inside of this door and it's basically going to act as a mini trap and you have to get a certain number of kills in here so to do this as best as possible again try to get power on as as early round as possible build pack a bunch as early as possible kill that thing as early as possible train up a bunch of zombies turn on this trap and as you can see it will start sucking up those zombies into that die shockwave gun now once it has actually absorbed enough souls i keep in mind this is kind of dangerous it won't absorb every single soul that walks by but whenever it does actually absorb enough make sure you go over and you're going to be able to remote control it again to discharge it and it's going to blow that door straight off of there and there's going to be a skeleton in there holding the die shock wave the base rarity of this gun just the straight up wonder weapon that you can also get out of the box but this is how you get it for free so now that you have it for free you can go ahead and start upgrading it after getting your free die shockwave you need to get started on two of the four wonder weapon upgrade quest because they are required for a later step in the easter egg and you can do them immediately the other two you're gonna have to wait a little bit for but we will do that when the time comes so the first one is very very easy first step to upgrade the first one is to just shoot the wooden box off the top of nocturnal tone it will fall down and reveal a empty flask now you need to get one of the boss zombies to shoot you and hit this mushroom on the tree so just stand right next to this mushroom on the tree if done correctly the zombie will shoot it you will hear a character quote in your radio talking about how there's a weird interaction or a weird chemical compound that is being formed there and if you've done that correctly you can place the vial that you just picked up underneath and it will start collecting the stuff dripping off of this chemical reaction to the glowing purple mushroom and after a little bit of time i just killed my zombie i didn't have to in the round i didn't have to do anything like that i just killed the boss zombie picked up the key card from them and you can run over and pick up that full flask and that is the entire upgrade complete for the first one head down to the uh the med bay melt the chains off of this little box and you will have your first of four upgrades this is the first of four that you will need for a later step of the easter egg and it can be done right away and really really help you out with a lot of the steps so i recommend doing it first now now that you have your first upgrade you can go ahead and work on the second one again this doesn't have to be in this exact order you can do this upgrade first if you would like to but go ahead get the base version of the die shock wave again and go over and use the suction technique to pull this vial this empty canister off of the wall and you're going to go ahead and take it down to where deadshot daiquiri is and you're going to place it into this little corner when you place it in that corner it is now ready to absorb the gas so you need to have a play hound jump at you and then when it's in that corner you need to go ahead and kill it and this canister will absorb all of the gas from this plague hound and you can go ahead and pick it up off the wall and take it over to the spawn area and it will allow you to get your second wonder weapon upgrade again a very very easy one you just need to have that playhound spawn put it right there and then you can just shoot it with any weapon it will explode and melt all the vines off of there and uh you will be able to grab your second wonder weapon upgrade super super easy and let's get on to the first step of the actual easter egg now so for the first step you need to go ahead and enter into the dark ether and whenever you enter into the dark ether after building packet punch in one of the three following locations there will be a part that spawns these parts spawn one at a time one after another and you might have to go back into the dark ether multiple times by killing more zombies and progressing more rounds to get another portal to spawn but this is the second spawn location right here the first one is by the crash site the second one is right here next to power you're gonna go ahead and pick that one up or if it didn't spawn there it will be all the way over in spawn right here glowing they're super super easy to see but again these parts will only spawn one at a time and after picking it up you might run out of time in the dark ether or it might directly send you out so just keep on looking for him until you get all three and once you get all three you're gonna go back to the normal mode and you're gonna build on this buildable table the ether scope and this is gonna allow you to progress to the second step of the easter egg which we are going to get into right now so for step number two you need to kill some more zombies progress the rounds until you get another dark ether portal enter into the dark ether and then go to the computer and collect the diary on the second floor right above speed cola when you collect this tire you're gonna go directly underneath and the etherscope is gonna allow you to summon this ghost you're gonna give him his diary so you need it hold square wants to summon him hold square a second time to give him his diary and he will start talking it'll be like a little mini cut scene you'll still have to survive you don't have to stand next to him or anything like that and once he finishes talking he will disappear now at this point you need to go back into the dark ether again or if you have enough time you can do two and one go it just kind of depends you basically just need to keep going back into the dark ether and then go to the second spectral location which is right here in the trial room so go ahead and same exact thing summon him with the first click give him mr the second click and he will go through another speech now at this point you need to go back into the dark ether again once his speech is completed and you will go ahead and head down to right where you actually built the ether scope and there will be another spot for him to actually be summoned and then you need to do the same exact thing give him his diary it will be kind of like a little finicky thing that you have to find the spot where you can actually give it to him but you can give him his diary he will go through a third and final speech and then you will now have the computer password because basically for each one of these speeches he is writing one letter onto the diary so head over to the computer you will now have the password and you will enter it into the computer and you will get a bunch of character quotes and everything like that telling you that the passwords are received and you're ready to go on to the next step after you enter in the password on the computer it makes the other two upgrades available for the wonder weapon which you need to do immediately the first of which will spawn a specialty portal this is the only portal that this will work in underneath the pack-a-punch area this portal only spawns here for the wonder weapon upgrade if you enter through a normal dark ether portal it will not work you need to enter into the correct portal bunch so enter through that portal and if you have entered through the correct portal you will see this glowing crystal that you can actually suck up and get a supercharged die shots so once you do that head right next to where you actually just entered through that portal and you're gonna shoot this little case on the side and one of the three lights will actually light up once you do that you can go ahead and head back out onto the surface head to the top of noctur on tone and sure enough you can supercharge your die just like that so go ahead and shoot that box once again that is two out of the three lights on and at this point i actually ran out of time and teleported beam back into the normal world and again just get more kills go through rounds and eventually that portal will spawn back in usually it's not very long at all so very next round i went back in i sucked up that one little crystal on the side and this is my third supercharged shot you don't have to do this all in one go you don't have to do it in one portal entry but obviously you can if you are fast enough so suck it up shoot it at that box if you shoot all three of them into there you will get the dye electro bolt which will be the electric upgrade for the die a super super cool one and one that is very very powerful but without further ado let's go ahead and move on to the next upgrade for the fourth and final upgrade you need to take each one of the fast travel systems in the dark ether once there's one underneath right next to this fuse box that i'm shooting which is the thing you need to do after you take all three of these fast travel systems there is one in on tone that leads to the wonder weapon room and there is one in that pond area if i had kept running past the portal but once you get that portal to spawn in right there once you have taken all three fast travel systems that portal will spawn in in that exact spot and once that portal spawns in you need to go ahead and grab the fuse from that spot you'll be able to grab the fuse early if you'd like to but this will only spawn if you get the portal from the pond area and again to do that go through each one of the fast travel systems once this will spawn in if you have done that any of you have entered through the correct portal it's kind of hard to do because you have to kind of time it properly but once that portal spawns there you know you are good to go and that you can go in put the laser cutter in there insert the fuse and you will be able to get the fire upgrade and once you have the fire upgrade you are on to the next step the computer will say that it now needs more power and you need to have all four wonder weapons built at this point you can have one player do this if you're doing solo or you can have each player holding one of the wonder weapons but each one of these four things reacts to one of the wonder weapons and will actually move and flip up and go into a different position after being shot with the wonder weapon so once again get all four wonder weapons shoot the correct dial it will move up to the top and once you do this it will be ready for the next step in the easter egg so as you can see after the fourth one goes i get a character quote and then we are moving on to going back into the dark ether once again so find that ether portal kill the zombies to open it back up if it's not there and head back into the ether and then at the top floor right next to where you shot this thing there will be another little cut scene that you can watch here and it will tell the story of two soldiers and how they stole this item now your job is to get this item back and i'll show you guys how to do that right now so after you finish these characters cut scene you will actually be exited out from the dark ether automatically and there will be a dark ether wrench sitting where they were just speaking so go ahead and pick up that dark ether wrench and you're gonna head over to the spawn where there's going to be an option to bang on the tank in the spawn so you're gonna go ahead and do that multiple times until a zombie pops out of the little hatch now once this zombie pops out of the hatch you can kill them with whatever weapon you want to it doesn't matter what weapon and then after that you need to go over to the crafting table and craft a semtex and you need to stick this sim text to the very top of the tank lid just says so and just as you see me do and the tank if done correctly will fire a bullet at the tree in which this little item that they stole has been hiding in run over to where this tank shot this item out of the tree pick up the item and a ton of dogs will spawn in so be careful during this part because you're kind of defenseless when you're actually carrying this thing but you're gonna carry it back down to where you actually picked up the dark ether wrench right above speed cola and you're gonna insert it into this machine and it will actually tell you that it is now awaiting a subject you will get some quotes about it needing a subject to actually be processed and worked and this is where you need to wait for one of the radioactive boss zombies to spawn in so after a round or two the boss zombie will spawn it took about two rounds in our game for him to spawn it's just kind of on a cycle when he spawns and when he does it but whenever he does you need to lead him over to this room and you need to go ahead and kill his first form so he splits into the two halves you can do this anywhere on the map but we found it was much much easier if we just split both of his hats directly over where he actually needs to be so once his halves actually walk underneath this they will be automatically sucked up into this machine and then every single player on your team needs to head to this little observation room and if every single player is in there you'll get the option to turn on the computer and he will basically be reformed into one person that can speak he's a human being again and he will tell you that he is scared and uh it's he's in pain all that stuff and he will actually run away into the power room and all the lights will shut off in the power room just a side note as soon as the doors open a ton of dogs and a ton of boss zombies will spawn so just run away kill them all at your own pace don't stay in this room like we did just get out of there kill them at your own pace and then you're on to the next step so now we are on to the last step and forewarning this step is no going back after you do this step you are going to the boss fight whether you are ready or not so buy perks before doing this get ready get pack-a-punched weapons get your wonder weapons everything like that ready to go and then once you are ready go into the dark ether mode and when you are in the dark ether mode go to the corner of noctur untoten you will get more storyline about this guy talking and then after exiting the dark ether it will kick you back out and you will be able to pick up this family photo now whenever you pick up this photo you are going to the boss fight no going back you are going so let's talk about the boss fight and how to beat it so once you pick up this picture that he drops you'll be instantly teleported to the pack punch room and locked in here he will now be friendly he will be a blue health bar signifying he will not hurt you and then he will say he wants to shut down the particle accelerator now at this point the boss fight begins this boss fight consists of a few zombie spawns a few dog spawns a few heavy zombie spawns and a ton of boss zombies you get tons of red megaton bombers which again haven't really been important in this easter egg they're just there to kill you and there's a lot of them and not only that in this boss fight but they can split into megaton bombers so you get i mean it is a lot a lot of boss zombies and here is my number one tip everybody who has a wonder weapon should be just killing boss zombies these things will overrun you very very quickly if you're not taking them out quickly so just spray them lay into them literally do not take your finger off the trigger until every single one of them is dead because every single time you kill a boss zombie it drops ammo so you not only have a hugely powerful wonder weapon that's not even a word hugely powerful wonder weapon you need to go ahead and use your ammo sparingly because you pick up more ammo for it just by killing the bosses so you want to chain your ammo from boss to bust boss running over where you kill them and then if you actually run out of ammo you can actually buy more for 10 000 points on the bottom floor there's an ammo wall by which will basically allow you to fill up your ammo for your wonder weapon basically three of your players need to be doing this realistically three of your players need to be absolutely just killing boss zombies and then one player needs to be protecting the guy as he's doing three different locations there are three different spots he will run to each one you need to protect him in that spot make sure you don't let him take too much damage he will stop what he's doing and i'm pretty sure if you let him get hit too much you will actually fail the boss fight and you will lose so make sure you're protecting him make sure you're killing the bosses as quickly as possible everyone with a wonder weapon should be focusing him and uh that is basically the boss fight you'll do this three different times the screen will go white it's very easy if you keep control of the bosses and once this is done the facility will start to break apart so here is the route that i will tell you to take that i took it is a super super easy one you have a 1 minute and 30 second timer to actually get to the helicopter before you basically lose i think you just insta die but the main thing you need to know about this is don't panic just avoid the electricity beams kill the zombies throw monkeys if you have them use your ether shrouds using any field upgrades that you can and avoid the electricity because again if you step inside of it you will die instantly only one player in your squad needs to survive all the way to the chopper it's really really easy take your time avoid the electricity beams the chopper will land once you get close and you hold square and you have completed the easter egg unfortunately there is no cutscene for this easter egg which is a little disappointing but hopefully for dlc one we definitely get one and i i just have such high hopes for this game because this is by far the most fun it's ever been just to kill zombies just to play the game i absolutely love this map and i cannot wait for more really cool exit scene as you fly on out and that is it for the easter egg i hope you guys have enjoyed if you have please leave a like subscribe for more content because we got a lot more coming and i will see you guys in the next video bye-bye", "yn4HMRPKslo": "have you seen Russ develop on objects made from iron what is this rust

can see some of the soot that it picks up you can see right there that that's an accumulation of soot that otherwise wouldn't have been cleaned if we didn't know that it was there so typically in this situation we'll first go around the room and look at okay what is it that has been affected and kind of tap here and see if it has sit based on where the fire had started and fire had started right here and then spread out over in this area so it's pretty obvious where it is but the method of dry sponging is especially good when we have hard surfaces that have really intricate details on them another area that dry sponging is really critical in is we are dealing with upholstery in a lot of cases you won't even see the sediment that is settled on the upholstery so what we do is we take a dry sponge and white areas and you see here that there's definitely sediment so we will go ahead and flag this to be properly cleaned and deodorize so that we can put that back in the back", "BYqJ65ls08c": "okay today I'm going to be showing you some cool experiments with burning sugar and I'm gonna show you how a sh can actually help things burn so normally when you burn things it turns into carbon dioxide and water but when you burn sugar and not enough oxygen gets to the sugar you can produce just plain old carbon and due to this effect you can get something that's called a sugar snake so watch what happens when you burn sugar mixed with baking soda okay so this powder I have here is just called hexamethylene tetramine and it's just a solid fuel it just burns when you light it so this doesn't really have anything to do with the reaction it's just to burn the sugar and then what I have in here is sugar and baking soda mixed together so let's watch what happens when I light it on fire so I have a little divot in the center so the sugar can be surrounded by the fuel okay let's see what happens when I light it on fire three two one you're gonna do anything ok so what's happening here is that the sugar is partially burning creating carbon and the baking soda is breaking down into carbon dioxide and there's also liquid sugar in there because it's hot and so the carbon is getting mixed with the liquid sugar and the carbon dioxide is expanding and so that's pushing up all the carbon and then the liquid sugar hardens and it's creating this solid black snake that comes out of it okay let's see two of them at the same time these are starting to look like the horns of Satan or something it's crazy how long they're getting so because this is just carbon and melted sugar what do you think it tastes like yeah it just tastes like ashes okay so we see that sugar can burn with some help from some solid fuel or liquid fuel but can you burn sugar just all on its own will it just burn and light on fire okay so sugar by itself doesn't really burn it just melts so even though sugar has a lot of energy it doesn't really burn because the oxidation or reaction of sugar with oxygen is actually pretty slow so you need something of a catalyst and there's a number of catalysts that you could use to burn sugar but watch what happens when I burn some paper and then put the ash on the sugar paper on the other hand oxidizes very quickly and what we're left with after burning the paper is just ash but in these ash there's metal carbonates and there's even some carbonic acid and these salts and oxides can actually do a special thing for burning they can act as a catalyst now let's see what happens if I mix this ash with sugar so now this is just plain sugar mixed with ashes from burn paper now let's see if it lights on fire there it goes see now it's actually burning so the sugar is on fire just because I added ashes to it so that's really interesting adding burn things to sugar can make it burn better so unlike our previous experiment we didn't have to add any solid fuel to this because the sugar just acts as fuel is with itself so if you want your fire to burn better just add ashes to it hey everybody thanks for watching another episode remember I have now released the very first action lab subscription box so if you haven't subscribed yet head over

loading the muzzle loader it is important to make sure that it is not already loaded to avoid double loading this can be accomplished by loading in a primer and firing the gun at a target first you need to load 250 grain pellets into the gun without touching them as do oils and other residue on your hands can cause a decrease in performance you can do this by using a pipe cleaner to thread through the pellets and then dropping them into the barrel next comes the bullet this muzzleloader requires 50 caliber power belt bullets simply put this into the end of the barrel now you need the loading rod and brass head and handle notice that one out of the route is flat while the other is slightly rounded screw the handle into place on the flat end and then screw in the brass head on the rounded one now place the completed loading rod into the barrel and place the butt of the gun firmly on the ground to give you a steady base for loading then push down on the loading rod until it stops notice the line edged into the side of the rod tap down until this line reaches the inside edge of the barrel next comes the primer just take one out of the box open the trigger assembly as shown and then place the primer in the small opening at the back of the barrel now close it in when you were ready to fire pull the hammer back be sure to choose a target that is in a safe direction

the tank fires are contained but there are still concerns about smoke and debris Marci Gonzalez is on the scene there in Deer Park with the latest good morning Marcie good morning Rodney has such a huge relief for so many here that that fire that was raging here since Sunday is finally out but as you mentioned a lot of concerns here about the chemicals that burned going up in that huge plume of smoke that was just hanging over this area for days people really concerned about the potential health impacts some people were finding huge pieces of debris in their yards others are already reporting some issues like dizziness and itchy eyes officials here say they have been monitoring the air quality since all of this started they say the air quality has stayed at safe levels but schools are closed again today as a precaution and I can tell you right now firefighters are still out here they are spraying down these tanks with foam and with water trying to make sure this fire

coffee expert or guru but I do like a really good cup of coffee and the Chemex is great for that and let's be honest it's also really beautiful in design many videos online will show you how to brew in a chemically process weights and measures and volumes and if you want to go that route that's great but I find that after a little trial and error you can definitely simplify the process and still brew a really great cup of coffee so let's dive in alright this will be a quick video just on brewing your coffee but if you want more tips on filters or what size Chemex to purchase or how to clean it make sure to click the link below to the full blog post to get started fill your kettle with filtered water and bring it to a boil [Music] while that's happening grind your coffee beans now you can grind your beans as needed for each brew or you can do what I do and that's grind enough beans for a couple of brews grind on a medium to medium coarse consistency with a burr grinder if possible [Music] I store my ground coffee beans in an airtight container and if you've watched my pantry organization video then you know how much I love these wax jars when it comes to filters I use Chemex is square natural filters and while these may look confusing just keep them folded and open it up so that there's three layers on one side the side with three layers is what's going to sit against the pour spout then grab your water and thoroughly rinse your filter so it's all wet this process also pre warms your Chemex and when this is done just dump the water out [Music] how much coffee you'd like to add is really a personal preference based on how strong or weak you like your coffee but Chemex recommends one heaping tablespoon per five ounce cup of coffee so with an eighth cup Chemex that's about eight tablespoons if you're going for a full container on your first pour you want to fully saturate the coffee grounds so that they can expand and bloom give it about 30 to 45 seconds for this to happen [Music] then you'll do your second pour and just pour in a slow circular fashion until the water reaches just below the top of the Chemex if you're brewing a full container as this water starts to drain down just continue adding more water on top until you've emptied your kettle or reach just below the would handle for the six eight and ten cup Chemex the little button on the outside represents halfway full [Music] and that's it when you're done remove the coffee grounds and enjoy your fresh cup of coffee [Music] thanks guys for watching I hope you liked this video and if

Thanks for joining us on The King of Random. Batteries are everywhere and we use them in all sorts of stuff, and a lot of the time they come with warnings saying to make sure you dispose of them properly, and how they can be dangerous if you misuse them.   Well today, we are going to take this group of batteries and we're gonna run them through a series of destruction tests to see what happens if you stab them, cut them open, smash them, or even burn them So let's get started. Not too long ago I tried using a nail to slightly dent a battery to help balance a homo-polar motor. Well now I'm gonna see what happens if I take a nail and drive it as far as I can into the battery; not just denting it on the top. Ooh, it's leaking something already. There is liquid coming out of this battery. Well, that's a good start. Let's keep driving the nail and see what keeps happening. I'll be honest. I didn't really think that the nail was gonna be able to drive this far into the battery. That is pretty much all the way through it, and it's still leaking. We've got this liquid leaking out, which I believe is potassium hydroxide, which is supposed to be fairly irritating if you get it on your skin, so try and avoid touching this stuff. Our battery is also getting pretty warm. I'm gonna hit it with this little laser thermometer. 120 Fahrenheit. The battery is getting quite hot now. As a comparison, if I take a scan of a block of metal next to it That's at 65. The battery is at 135 still heating up pretty warm to the touch 36 I'm just gonna stand back a little bit and let it go and see if anything keeps happening to it as it warms up like this See if I can take an accurate measurement from this far away showing 145 now Well if I get closer it's showing 166 let me try and pull the nail out There's a battery with a hole in it, I think it's cooling down a little bit now feels kind of oily Not like really oily, but a little oily all right well I'm gonna try that exact same thing, but I'm gonna drive the nail in from the other side More oozing liquid Going in a weird angle here see if I can straighten this out. Oh and since there's a hole I can now go all the way through my thermometer is showing that it's up to a hundred degrees Fahrenheit Watch it just climbing in temperature our other battery got up to 166 on here and now we're only hitting 116, so it's definitely warm, but it's not as hot as the other one Now I've driven a nail through either end of the battery I think it's only fair that I try and drive one right through the side Its warming up again just hit a hundred degrees Fahrenheit. Ooo something just made a fizzle noise. It's a liquid inside the battery is spurting out onto the nail. It's occasionally making a hissing sound past 130 Fahrenheit 140, More hissing and bubbling Seems to be Hovering right around 150 now and once again We have a battery with a hole running right through it Holding it still for a couple seconds. It really does start to heat up in the hand well I would say that being stabbed with a nail is definitely not good for batteries Now since it should be a fun way to destroy it and I want a good look at what's inside I'm gonna take a hacksaw and cut this C cell battery down in half lengthwise (Sawing noises) There's our black liquid oozing out All right, I've got there's a black paste just all over the blade of the hacksaw now turn this upside down Cutting through it from the other side I think I've got it Mmm. Gross well, I've got a gooey paste here and a Slightly less gooey paste here Smells a little bit like ammonia This paste looks like it's full of little metal flecks. I need to do some research and find out. What is inside a battery This rod is coming from the negative terminal so this rod clearly goes down into this silvery paste You know about about the consistency of toothpaste. I'd say maybe a little bit thinner it's like really really compacted dirt kind of texture metal shell There you go guys a c cell battery probably a little bit difficult to fit inside your remote-control car at this point Our next method of destruction might not be quite so eventful, but I've always wondered what would happen if you just took two 9-volt batteries and Plug them into each other and just let them sit. I'm sure you're not supposed to do that Let's find out why? All right, those are now providing feedback into each other now. I'm just gonna check with the thermometer What temperature they're getting to? I'll see if they are warming up a little bit of time 75. Some part of the battery is a lot warm. That's measuring 85 There's different temperatures different parts parts of it at about 80 right now other parts are over 90 Oh Over a hundred Fahrenheit now. That's interesting one of our batteries is considerably warmer than the other This battery is only measuring at about 85 right now. This battery is measuring in at about a hundred and five Serious the gloves do insulate a little bit So it's hard to tell for sure But I think this one does feel warmer thats warm enough to cook a steak if you like it rare Next up. We've got a 20 ton shop press So we're gonna see what happens if we put a couple different types of battery under that and just squish 'em We've made contact now the squishing begins well that circle might just bite right into the battery We've got some stuff oozing out good amount of stuff oozing out on the back all right I think that's about as flat this jack is gonna get it It's pretty squished It actually bounced back a little bit after being squished Definitely see some of the innards of it Now I've got a C cell battery under here, let's squish that down and see what happens It's definitely deforming sideways, so I'm pretty sure it's just gonna pop out in a second Or, it's just gonna burst and squirt liquid really far. That was exciting Wow. It really is like toothpaste being squeezed out. It is obliterated; quite, completely obliterated. This squished C cell battery is probably just as broken as the one we cut in half. That really just oozed out there kind of like toothpaste at one point that was fun now for our next type of destruction I'm gonna try hitting a few different types of batteries with a blowtorch I've got our 9-volt battery a normal double a battery and then I also have a lithium Double-a battery which does contain lithium and should burn very brightly and possibly with interesting colors We'll see if it actually burns through to the lithium well enough to ignite it Not sure if it'll work or not as you can see I'm also now wearing a jacket and that's just for protection in case something Burns or shoots hot liquid at me. I just want a little bit more protection. I'm gonna start out with the 9-volt. I am nervous doing this holding it this close to me. Alright, I was a little too nervous just holding that battery like that so I've now got the system set up so I can just set the torch on the battery and then safely back away. Let's give a shot. Got a little glowing orange spot. The bottom seems nice and hot, but it doesn't actually look like it's doing too much. Certainly some flames coming out of it. Boozing out the back it just seems like the whole batteries kind of on fire Alright let's turn that off for a bit. That's some interesting colors right there. Sort of a bright, glowing smoke for a second. That was interesting and we got these smaller piles inside. I didn't think this type of battery worked like that. I think each of these is a one and a half volt battery, and there's six of them, which gives us our 9-volt battery power Let's try it with our other types of battery and see what happens. Well it's peeling away the wrapper on the battery pretty instantly. It's starting to leak pretty quick Much faster reaction than the last one that's for sure. It smells awful too. Timber! Let's try our lithium battery Once again, the outside gets destroyed immediately. Woah! I think it lit. Okay! And now it's. . .  no now it lit. Now it lit. That's amazing! That's fantastic! What even just happened? Look how pink that it is. It was just. . .  it's magenta colored. It's not a normal fire color. There's still something melting on the back. I don't know what liquid that is that's boiling and bubbling there. Now I just have like this glowing orange, I don't know it it's like glossy on the outside. Inside these lithium batteries there actually is a strip of lithium metal, and we're gonna see if we can take that out. That's what's causing the bright magenta flames. There we go that whole thing so there you have just coils of metal strips inside there, and one of those strips is lithium. This whole wad of. . . There we go. This one I believe is not our lithium I don't know exactly what metal it is probably aluminum, then here inside our plastic. That is a strip of lithium metal very lightweight like More than aluminum. It feels like. This feels super, super light. Also tears very easily, it's really soft. You can see how easily it wrinkles and everything. This is, this feels thicker than aluminum foil. But it's at least as soft. Maybe softer all right. Let's light this little piece of it off You can see how magenta those flames are and then when it really ignites it gets very bright That's melting into our fire brick if I can put another piece of it on top of it Yep Really bright kind of hurts to look at it so bright And it's like the the smoke is being lit up by the heat of it or something. That's pretty crazy There you have it We just destroyed a whole bunch of batteries in a whole bunch of ways. We stabbed, cut, smashed, and burned our batteries to see what happens. I can't say I really recommend doing this because then you don't have your batteries anymore. Although burning the lithium batteries did look pretty cool. We found that inside the batteries was a silvery paste and a black clay-like substance. Cutting the battery in half really let us see the insides pretty well. A nail driven through a battery caused a lot of leakage and I'm sure the batteries don't work at all anymore. And lighting the batteries on fire had different effects based on what type of battery they were. Regular batteries just sort of burned up and maybe oozed out some of their liquid and the lithium battery is popped and then burned a Bright magenta color this really satisfied a lot of curiosity I've had since I was a child and was told that you had to make sure you don't use damaged or dented batteries because it could cause problems. well now, I've seen some of those problems that can happen if you take them to an extreme. I've really enjoyed this random destruction of these batteries. I hope you had a good time Thanks for joining us for this video, and we'll see you in the next one. Talk to then.

body and the soul yes some people have a spherical bromance they do so today we're going to train some like My Chemical Romance there you go and basically give it our best shot you know they've did they release a new album recently I just reformed having this new album yet okay that was what I meant to say either way let's find some guitars so I'm gonna be rate horror and I'm gonna be frank Piero I believe who says that there you go ray Toro I released from my to the best of my knowledge Ray uses Gibson Marshall that's this kind of combo classic so immediately I found this because it was just floating there beautifully next to us this is the Epiphone this is just a Les Paul Custom Prayer basically sweets Ayyappa phone so it's crafted in China I believe this one's made in China it didn't actually say I think yeah I think it's probably made in China because it's 499 pounds so that's one third of my budget blown on the guitar coil splits double humbucker later Les Paul Kristin so you can't really stray far in man there you go I'm also gonna get a Les Paul said Frank Iero he plays a white one but obviously we wouldn't use a guitar just for color this is a Epiphone limited edition Les Paul Custom light and alpine white why is yours an extra 20 work 30 pounds how much is yours for no no nice 5 to 9 I think wines a little bit more of an expensive color is it got the same loves the same pickguard same pickups the same switch same head start mine's accustomed Pro roses are cooked some lights we've just been reliably informed to the lights of this guitar means it's light literally means it's lighter there you go chambered and this one is heavier so this is what your arms yeah let me not go swimming let's be this yeah this is good this is good here let's try this one now we're in the world of amplification specifically Marshall yes indeed as I mentioned before ray Toro plays Gibson Marshall they did the origin stuff the 20 watt which would which would be good for I guess a few reasons we would need pedals to push it okay this guitar is 499 pounds a lot of budget players I'm thinking of getting the Silver Jubilee this is the 25 25 see because it's 800 so I'll give you 200 quid left pedals which considering I just want that kind of the riff either yeah I actually think I'm gonna do that because I think this and this are gonna sound really good amazing I'm going to choose an orange trembled 30 they do yes they're about 900 pounds and I just happen to have one in the video room Frank Iero plays orange and left balls but the tremolo doesn't really have a like a lot of gain in it no it doesn't so he also uses a Blues driver okay and a swollen pickle I believe that's a very good point I don't think I can afford both those rate orders as well green Reiner in green rhino I think I might just have to take a gamble and go with just the Blues driver see ya okay I've really screwed it to be at least of looking like yeah I've got 70 quid which is about the price of a bass driver a bruise driver's row driver here nothing at the price of a blue driver so I'm gonna take it spun and see if it'll work I won't need the green Rhino cuz it was actually what is used but they don't have any in stock because it's just been Black Friday and everything was bought so I've really struggled to find something similar because it's a very specific style pedal however a reliable source from Denmark told me that you can get the team medic from thorpey which is an active EQ boost which is very different but because it's such a powerful EQ and it has a boost I think that'll probably serve a similar purpose okey doke and a tiny spring on a tiny moon and then I'm pretty much I think I'm maybe 12 quid over budget Carl let's go see what sounds like alright [Music] and we're back in the video room we are in this emotional adventure to sound like My Chemical Romance it's a really PC way of saying the emo which was a genre of music back in the day but I think nowadays it's not quite a nice thing to say about a certain style the emo kid was in his prime so yeah emotional Punk emotional punk rock there you go how about that yeah that works it does but also I mean fair play to them I haven't listened to my chemical romance in a very long time yeah but great production Greg guitar sounds great song right in what's not to love yeah that's it I mean I think we we must have been at school when they came on so yeah definitely I remember us going out my first girlfriend at the time right we listened to in her car that's another one of those bands from that era of skating in big at school and just having fun in the summer holidays and I remember like that's the young teenage years yeah yeah that's what reminds me of yes so if you are our age reminisce with us yes if you're not just listen to my chemical romance and pretend do it [Music] [Music] so obviously I'm trying to do ray Toro as my main rig so to be honest I'm pretty sure for these rigs they are pretty great and we were just saying before how great while I was saying really how great is to play riffs with two Les Paul rigs yes just great fun I mean this is obvious isn't it it's an Epiphone Les Paul Custom Pro sorry it's basically like the Gibson Les Paul Custom but it's the epitome version made in China it's identical to Matt's over there except Matt's is much lighter this is big black and chunky and I guess Matt's is thin and white and kind of slips in and out of the hand without you really noticing because of the difference in weight so yeah obviously it's a great guitar I think it's the vintage voice and the co pickups and it's got a couple corn splits as well nice that's running straight into the team medic from thorpey effects which I've just been switched on to right now it's basically an EQ active EQ and a boost and it really works wonders on fire it's the it's nine-day with off and on it's just it is so good yeah Marshall this is the Silver Jubilee 25 25 C and it's a great amplifier it's kind of your it I feel like it's the halfway house amp between you classic Marshalls and your modern Marshalls in terms of its tones yeah you know what I mean yeah because the overdrive is still closer to it like a jcm800 but it feels more modern you've used it many times we have one more 12 it's a nice deep cabinet as well so you get a nice mild low end and I've run it on just the same sound from start to finish I didn't use the term City I've got this just in case using the tiny spring we didn't use it and does that have reverb inbuilt no okay so it's kind of nice to have that if you want to just a little bit spring reverb you know 40 quid whatever anyway this is the sound of the guitar straight into the Jubilee [Music] so it's very martially very bright very intense for turn this on here we go [Music] so that's immediately thicker it's time the high end all that kind of stuff but then you got this switch which turns on the boost [Music] sounds great that is awesome that's a great sound that is really awesome not as awesome Castle Oh God [Music] so that's unto me then this is the epiphone les paul custom light li te and that means it's basically really light what's nice is that I have a Les Paul at home it's the last of all classic from like 2003 or something and it you often see that you're often like fighting to keep on your lap I'm heavy area but this is really nice really well-balanced really nice acoustic sound in this classic white lovely again made in China this one's a little bit more expensive if you pay for that I guess that extra craftsmanship that goes into 30 quid more removing the material yeah so you actually get more guitar literally for less money yeah unless guitar for more money it's funny how that works in it but it depends whether you like big black and chunky or you like light and white who knows my guitar runs directly into this which is the BD 2 from boss it's the Blues driver and this is something that Frank Iero I hope I'm pronouncing your name correctly if you're watching you probably not but I hope you pronounce your name correctly even if you're not watching so Frank Iero actually uses one of these so that is their levels really high the games really low kind of that tube screamer and push saying ish I have a slight hunched gone I think he uses that because that is the same pedal at Billie Joe Armstrong has used his entire career it could be and green they've been around way before My Chemical Romance and I feel like those I feel like he's been inspiration there and I wouldn't sign your guy's influenced by slash and Brian May and Brian May yeah I think we'll the classic rockers yeah anyway through the Blues driver into this and I had a change of amp because the tram Lord was not getting me anywhere near what I needed so this is a rocker 15 terror these are about five hundred fifty quid and that's running into this which is Pete's purple one by twelve cabinet which it's got a cream back in it and these are 400 quid so my amp would cost me a bit 50 quid extra it says 950 in total but I'm about I think I'm about 15 20 quid over budget doesn't do bad yeah yeah you literally just I think that's probably 75 yeah and the fact that that's a bit lighter and more expensive exactly so born or anyway it sounds like this straight into the amplifier you know what I find interesting about orange compared to Marshall gone it's like Marshall gives you from mid upwards and then the orange gives you from base to mid is even the sounds we've got going which is a great combo yeah I mean yeah they are quite I find the quite monthly yeah a lot of time so something in front of it sir liven up a bit yeah that sounds to me like a wide-open really grunty British amplifier that's why it's a great it's a great great sound so I'm pretty pleased with how it turned out to be honest yeah three nice simple bits gear same for you yeah three sounds yeah both well under budget like put it this way if you're in the market for something semi well I say semi-professional easily you could use this on professional job sure in all fairness I think if fired my rigs concerned I would have loved something like this when I was younger probably when I was young enough to listen to my Chemical Romance yes [Music] [Music] no shortage of volume tone feel playability all the rest of it and tears and tears I'm really impressed with this particular rig sir and me too thumb is only two nice one well that's not how I think we did did we sound like my Chemical Romance yeah let us know also who else you'd like us to sound like yes we will link all this gear into this description box and I'd be more a bit and I've been that there's been sound like on Anderson's TV ciao goodbye for now you", "Oge5jlaAaME": "hey what's up guys welcome to another episode of pan the organizer so what is the best tire dressing so on today's episode we're gonna find out what's the best tire shine I have a selection of my favorite tire dressings that I'm going to be presenting and discussing I'm also going to be giving you some pro tips on how to properly apply your tire dressing and maximizing its durability and gloss and also we're gonna test four of my favorite ones in this part one and see how easy they are to apply we're gonna look at the final gloss and shine and we're also gonna make a long-term durability test to find out which one is the best one so without further ado let's go ahead and start this show so hey guys I'm pan welcome to the show I hope you're having a great day so today you're going to find out which is the best tire dressing or tire shine as some of you guys might call them so I have a selection of eight of my favorite tire dressings that are part of my detailing arsenal so I'll be presenting each and every one of them by the way guys don't worry as usual like in all my videos I'll drop the links to these products in the description down below for you guys to check them out later so no stress but before we go ahead and talk about the tire dressings I want to first start by giving you a pro tip on how you can prepare your tires properly before you apply the tire dressing and this will maximize their durability and also maximize the shine and gloss so it's very important to first start by degreasing the tire so two of my favorite degreasers four tires are McGuire's super degreaser that I dilute one in four and super clean that i dilute one in three so these are very very good all-purpose degreasers and they're very good for removing any previous dressings that you have on your tires and that way you're gonna remove any of that old previous gunk entire dressing to make sure you have a fresh surface and the way you go ahead about this is very simple so you spray the product on the tire wall you wait roughly 30 seconds of dwell time and then you go ahead and scrub with a stiff bristled tire brush favorite one being this one this is the tough shine tire brush t uff now if you have a close-up so the ergonomics are perfect so you hold it very well in your hand and this is just a good width for any tire size especially for those low profile tires so you go ahead you rub the product and then you rinse away and you dry the tire very important so that way you're gonna maximize the durability and you're gonna prevent the product from slinging onto your paint as we all know we hate those black dots that fly onto your paint after you've applied tire dressings so now we move on to the tire dressings themselves so my favorite eight ones are currently in my arsenal so I'm gonna present each and every one so first of all we have pinnacle black onyx tire gel next we have ammo mud tire gel we move on to angel wax elixir now this is an exterior rubber entire restorer but I love using this as a tire dressing then we have obsessed premium tire satin finish dressing for those of you who like a satin finish they also make a glossy version we then move on to Auto finesse satin now another great product Chemical Guys VRP then we move on to a classic McGuire's endurance tire dressing now this is an either a gel form or a spray can like this one and finally a new kid on the block now this is Gian cue to tire so what are the differences well essentially you have two big categories of tire dressings so you have water-based ones and you have ones that are based at a petroleum or solvent based so essentially solvent based ones are glassy ER they give you that rich and deep wet look however they have a tendency to sling more often onto your paint so that's a compromise that you have to do however the endurance is some of the longest lasting in the bunch so they last a lot longer than water-based dressings water-based dressings which are my favorite are much easier to clean away and remove with a degreaser they don't last as long as solvent based dressings however they do give a nice matte finish in general or a nice gloss but not too glossy for those of you who like that type of finish like me and also they don't have the tendency to sling as much on the paint now there is a brand new category so a third category of Tyre dressings and Jian has created this product so it's sio2 based or silica based so this is some of the longest lasting products out there it's brand new it's a bit thicker as a product to apply so a bit more complicated to apply but gives a very wet look very deep black look great shine also it's going to repel water a lot and this is said to be one of the longest lasting ones so those are the differences so this is sio2 based silica based one example of a solvent based dressing is the Maguire's endurance tire dressing and a perfect example of a water-based dressing is Chemical Guys VRP and of course auto finesse satin and pretty much all the other ones are also water-based so what we're going to do today is we're going to test four of them so one per tire so we're gonna test G on cue two tire McGuire's endurance tire dressing Chemical Guys VRP and Auto finesse satin so what we're gonna do is obviously first I already degreased and prepped the tires so they're squeaky clean there's no previous dressing on there we're gonna use a different applicator for every single one to avoid cross-contamination so what we're gonna do is we're gonna apply one product per tire and in this part one I'm gonna talk about which is my favorite one as far as gloss the way that the product looks on the tire ease of application and in part number two I'm gonna do a long-term follow-up so in the coming weeks the vehicle is gonna be washed to go through some rain and be exposed to the environment and the elements outside and we're gonna see which one has the longest durability it's made to protect vinyl rubber and plastics so essentially that's why it's called VRP it's water-based it's dry to the touch it last super-long this is usually the one I use for my personal vehicle along with a moment tire gel because I like the finish so it's not too glossy it's not too matte so it's that perfect balance it's one of the easiest to apply and doesn't sling on the on your car's paint so another great choice now the Maguire's endurance tire dressing or tire spray is a classic in the business now it's solvent based so it has the tendency to leave maybe a bit of slinging if you don't apply properly so again always clean and dry your tire it leaves a very wet and deep black look for those of you who like that style and of course it's durability is very good hence the name endurance auto finesse satin tire creme or tire dressing is a water-based dressing and a cool thing about this one is that not only does it give a great finish but you can also select how glossy you want it by adding multiple layers so the more layers you apply the glossy er the tire will get again it's pretty much dry to the touch very easy to apply and yeah another great product by Auto finesse now a tip for its application is to of course apply it on a clean and dry tire like all of the other tire dressings but for this one if you like the wet and glossy look just apply it and let it be but if you want a matte finish 10 to 15 minutes after the application come back and wipe the excess residue with a clean microfiber towel also they recommend that you dry the surface with a heat gun or a hairdryer so that way your gonna get longer durability out of the product so guys for me the winner is Chemical Guys VRP in this shootout so far so as far as application goes it's one of the easiest to apply very quick the finish is absolutely amazing and perfect for my own tastes so it's not too glossy and not too matte it dosen't sling on the body and it'll last a decent amount of time of course stay tuned for part two work I'm gonna update you guys on the long term durability to see which one of these four lasted the longest but Chemical Guys VRP again the winner in this test for myself in the description down below if you guys use one of these tire dressings let me know which one is your champion and your favorite I'm very curious and if you have any tips on how you guys apply them let us know as well it's always nice to share with the pan the organizer family now if you want to see another video with the four other tire dressings so the obsessed tire satin finished the angel wax elixir the Amal mud tire gel and the pinnacle natural brilliance black onyx tire gel also let me know in the description down below and I'll make another video I think this is pretty cool because we're always looking to find what's the best tire dressing or the best tire shine so I hope this video was very useful to you guys if so

that blood, venom from three of the\nmost potent pit vipers here in the United States. We have a medic that is going\nto stick me with a needle and draw out these eight vials of blood. And right now I'm\nfeeling very very nervous and a little squeamish and I might pass out during this process. Okay, here we go. Giving my blood for science. (yelling) (energetic music) Today, we are at the\nReptile Discovery Center located in Deland, Florida. This serpentarium is home to several of the world's most dangerous snakes. And earlier today, I assisted in milking the\nvenom of three pit vipers that are frequently encountered in the Eastern United States. The Copperhead. Wow, that was fantastic. The Water Moccasin. Gonna go mouth down, okay. And the Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake. Whoa! That was a serious\nvenom yield right there. Normally this venom is sent to their med\ntoxin venom laboratory where it is turned into\nlife-saving antivenom. But today, we're going\nto perform an experiment unlike anything you have ever seen. Okay, crew is all set up. (sighs) All right guys, so today's experiment is\ngoing to show us what happens when snake venom mixes\ntogether with human blood. I've always been curious what happens when a snake bites you and that venom enters\ninto the bloodstream. So today, what we're gonna do is take eight vials of my blood, we're gonna create a control, and then we're going to mix\nvenom into three different vials and show you exactly what happens. I know, it seems like Coyote,\nget to the point already. I'm only prolonging this because I'm so squeamish around needles. You guys have no idea how\nnervous I am right now. I could take bullet ant stings, I can take bites from\ngiant desert centipedes, when it comes to sticking\na needle into my arm, nothing makes my skin\ncrawl more than that. We've got a medic on set with us and she is going to\nsafely draw out my blood. - [Medic] I need you to just\nkeep your arm very still. - Very still. - [Medic] Don't jerk it back. And if you feel like you're\ngonna pass out, tell me. - Okay. - [Medic] If you get lightheaded or you start to feel really hot. - Okay. I'm already hot, I'm\nsweating bullets right now. Like more nervous than I\nwas for ants, centipedes, like (grunts) worst day ever. - [Medic] Well even hotter\nthan you are right now. - Okay, yup. - [Medic] Okay are you ready? - Yes, I can be ready. - [Medic] 1, 2, 3. (yelling) - Find a happy place, find a happy place. Is this considered a lot\nof blood for one sitting? - [Medic] This is an okay amount. It's certainly not gonna harm you. - Okay. I'm gonna put the GoPro\ndown at what this is to see what's happening. I can't look with my\nown eyes, I can't bear. I can't feel my arm. Like, should I be doing\nanything with my arm? - [Medic] No. (breathing) Okay, you ready? - For what? - [Medic] I'm gonna take out the needle. (yelling) Are you ready? - Is it out? - [Medic] No. - Yeah, I'm ready. (yelling) Oh my gosh, is it gonna\nlike squirt blood if you, oh my God, look at all\nthose tubes of blood. Holy mackerel. But what we're going to do now is head down the hallway, meet up with Carl, and move to step two of this experiment. Holy cow, look at all\nof these vials of blood. That is so much Coyote that is spilled out in the name of science. Okay Carl, I am back with\neight vials of my blood. Now we're only gonna need\nfour for this experiment so I'll put these other\nfour over here as a backup. And we've got the entire\nexperiment set up. We've got three vials that contain Copperhead, Water Moccasin, and Eastern Diamondback venom. Eventually that blood is going\nto trickle down this board that we've created. But before we get there, let's talk about these venom's and why they're so potentially dangerous. - Okay, so Coyote, all\nthree of these snakes cause you to bleed, cause you to hemorrhage, and hemorrhaging is dangerous\nfor a host of reasons. Your blood doesn't clot, you're losing blood\nfrom your blood vessels, your blood corpuscles\nare being broken apart, your red blood cells are being liced, they're not carrying\noxygen to your tissues. They all cause you to hemorrhage. They do it a little differently. The mechanisms that work\ndo it a little differently, but they all cause that significant bleeding\ncoagulopathy problem. - Okay, man that is complex, but sounds very painful at the same time. Obviously a lot of pain is experienced with a bite from any one\nof these snake species. Okay, so I'm definitely going\nto put on my safety goggles for this part. I am going to open up this\nvial and expose the venom. Now, I have this one labeled Copperhead, and you'll see, I also\nhave a blunt tipped needle. The reason for that is if this was sharp and I were to accidentally prick myself, that's just like a snake fang. What you don't want to\ndo is envenomate yourself while working with venom. So, I'm gonna just, oh man, makes your hand nervous just to pick up and hold\nwhat that is right there. That is some very potent venom. Now, Carl I'm gonna need your assistance. If you can just tilt that a tiny bit until I'm able to get some venom. I think that's enough. - Yep. - That's probably more than a\nfull snake bite right there. - No question. - Okay, so there is our Copperhead venom. Woo, one down. Our next one is going to\nbe the Water Moccasin. Wow, look at that venom yield. - Gives you a sense of how\ndangerous Cottonmouths can be and part of that equation again is yield. That's three snakes of\ncourse, but even still. Here we go. Ooh, that is a toxic\nlittle mix right there. Oh, got a little drip coming. Okay, I'll just put that there. And now we are going to bring up the most potent of them all, the Eastern Diamondback. Woo, this is the big one\nright here, all right. There we go. And that right there would be enough venom to\nkill you, wouldn't it? - Probably. - Okay, so we've got our three\nsyringes of venom lined up. Thank you, Carl. Woo, this is, keeping your hand\nstudy is not an easy thing. Okay, so the first one, our green is going to be the Copperhead. Okay. There we go. Dangerous little tube right there. Okay, moving on to the Water Moccasin labeled yellow, caution Water\nMoccasins can be deadly. Definitely not a snake you\never want to trifle with in the wild. Admire these guys from\na very safe distance. Okay, there we go. That is moccasin venom\ngoing into my blood. And last but certainly not least, will be the Eastern\nDiamondback Rattlesnake. Okay, it's still a very very\ndangerous syringe right there. There's still some venom residue. Okay, here we go. That is Eastern Diamondback\nVenom going into my blood. Okay, well let's take 15 minutes. We will return and step\nthree of this experiment will tell us exactly what happens from a visual perspective when you add snake venom to human blood. But I know a lot of you\nout there have said before, Coyote, you've been bitten\nand stung by so many things, get bitten by a venomous snake. Now Carl, I want to open\nup this conversation to you to say to everybody out there watching how crazy is that notion of\nintentionally being bitten by a venomous snake. And just so we're clear guys, I'm never going to\nintentionally take on a bite, like something from a Copperhead or Water Moccasin or Rattlesnake. And tell us why this is so damaging. - Because insect stings and snake bites are very different things. And so insect venom's to a large degree evolved to cause pain and basically what they're trying to do is get you away from perhaps their nest or something of that nature. Snake venom's evolved\nto immobilize and kill the food that they eat. And so snake venom's are destructive on a whole host of different levels. So you've got blood chemistry problems, you've got neurological issues happening, you've got cardiac issues happening, a depolarization of the\nmuscle cells in your heart, you've got maybe all of these things, nephrotoxicity, miotoxicity, cytotoxicity, cardiotoxicity,\nneurotoxicity. A snake bite can be very dangerous event. In fact, it can be a lethal event and on a cellular level it's catastrophic. It's nothing to be fooled\nwith or taken lightly. There's no question about that. - Okay, it has been roughly 15 minutes that the venom has been\npercolating inside of my blood. And that was the big moment, what I'm curious about, what I know you guys\nare all curious about, what exactly happened to my\nblood with that venom inside. So the first thing that we're gonna do is put on my safety glasses. Always important to have on safety glasses when you're doing science experiments. So we've got another blunt tipped needle, that is the control. That's the blood that's in here and when I hold it up and look at it, yep that's still looks super liquidy. So what we're going to do is pull blood from each one of these vials and I'm gonna make a little streak just like that on the top\nof this plexiglass board, we're going to see what happens. Does it run down? Does it turn into jelly? We don't know, right? - It'll be interesting. - I guess we'll see. And I'm just going to try to make a nice little streak across here just like that. (yelling) What! That is some coagulation\nright there, isn't it Carl? - Can see that coagulation,\nyep, that's great. - Well, that looks like a\nzombie film right there. So Carl tell us what happened 'cause there was no venom in there yet you got these chunks of blood that just looked like they\nvomited themselves down this plexiglass plate. - When you expose blood to oxygen, it's gonna begin to clot. - Right. - And so that's what we're seeing there. - And that's healthy blood then. - Absolutely. - Healthy blood exposed to\noxygen is going to coagulate. So for the most part\nlooks like I'm healthy. So, now we're moving on to the Copperhead. That is our green vial here. And I'm just gonna give that a tilt left and right. Now like you were saying, Carl, that anticoagulant makes this look like it's a whole lot, - Very hard to say if\nwe're gonna see anything to the naked eye, but I assure you what's going\non in that tube right now, cellularly, is as we talked\nabout earlier, catastrophic. - Okay. - So let's see if we can see\nanything with the naked eye. - Here we go, Copperhead blood coming up. Wow, look at all those bubbles. I did not really see that on the control. Okay, here we go. Oh, wow, look at that. It's just dripping right out of it. I'm not even applying any\npressure yet and look at that, it's just dripping right\nout of the syringe. - Whoa, look at that. - Boy, it's certainly to the naked eye looks like it's less coagulation\ngoing on there, right? I mean to the naked eye, I mean that just ran down to where now, I saw a couple of little\nmicro maybe clots in there, but to the naked eye, I don't know about what you saw, but anyway, interesting. - That was blood running\ndown that incredibly fast. I mean just the pace at which it slid down and off the plexiglass, you can see that a lot of the blood here is still not streaking. This was, yeah. Look, you can almost see the\nmore watery consistency of it. So that's the blood cells breaking down and not being able to hold onto each other - Again to the naked eye, that's what it would look like. - Again guys, we can't stress enough how the internal aspects\nof what's happening on a micro level, that if we had a super\npowerful microscope, we'd be able to see are happening. I mean, this is just explosions of blood cells and everything breaking down apart inside. - All those little cell\nwalls are being effected. - Okay, here we go. Water Moccasin. You can see there. the blood definitely\nlooks very thin as well. Again, a whole cocktail\nof proteins and toxins that are just turning this\nblood into who knows what. I get it, oh wow. So that's having trouble\nactually sucking the blood up into there. - See a little more\nclotting in this sample. - There we go, okay. And my glasses are fogging up. I'm gonna do my best\nto keep my hand steady, but even interacting with venom and blood definitely gets your heart\nrate going that's for sure. That is my blood mixed together\nwith water moccasin venom. And again, you can see that that blood just wants to come out\nof the tip of the needle without me applying any pressure. It's just dripping out on its own. So I'm going to very slowly apply a little bit of pressure. There we go, wow, look at that. - Now there's certainly some\nclots visible in that sample. - Oh yeah. - More so than the Copperhead venom. - Yeah, that is true. Look at that, you can\njust still see all that. It looks like a worm going down to the side of the plexiglass. - But certainly the Copperhead venom appeared thinner than\nthe Cottonmouth venom in relationship to the control. Tough to say, but maybe we're seeing some anticoagulant activity there, maybe. - Okay, so here we go. I've got the Eastern Diamondback\nvenom in my blood there. Top coming back off. There we go. Syringe going in, again guys, flat tipped needles, even if I were to prick myself\nwith a needle with venom, that is just like suffering envenomation. Oh yeah, look at that. Look how thin that blood is. That pulls up way easier than the Copperhead or the Moccasin. Wow, look how watery\nthat is, that's crazy. What does human blood look\nlike once it's been envenomated with Eastern Diamondback\nRattlesnake venom? Here we go, one, two, three, oh there is a little bit\nof coagulation there. Whoa, look at that. - Some significant clotting and remember on this, Coyote, Eastern Diamondback venom, we think there are both anticoagulant and pro-coagulant activity happening. But that's interesting. - Okay, well there we have it between the control, the Copperhead, the Moccasin and the Eastern\nDiamondback Rattlesnake, visually across the board, it looks like there's quite\na bit of difference, right? Even with the control, I don't see any speckling in the blood as compared to these three. But from your expert perspective, Carl, what is it that we're really seeing here? I mean, it looks like a horror film, but it's tough to tell with the naked eye. - Yeah. So Coyote, I think we need to point out that this experiment is a\nreally crude experiment. You know, what we're seeing, we're kind of speculating a little bit and based a little bit on what we know about these given snake venom's, but this really needs to\nbe done under a microscope in a really controlled setting where we don't have this\ntime difference going on and we're not sure that the\namount of venom being used is exact to get a real sense of this. But I think it's safe to say that what's happening here, whether or not we can\nsee it with the naked eye is serious and catastrophic\ndamage on a cellular level. - And I think for everybody\nout there watching, not only did I hear you say\nthat we need to do this again, which means there will be\na sequel to this video, but that the big takeaway is the pit vipers in the United States have the potential to be very dangerous. This is not a species you would ever want to\ninteract with in the wild. And for everybody out there that's asked, Coyote, will you get\nbitten by a venomous snake? The answer is no. You guys can see that this\nis again catastrophic. If you're bitten by one of these snakes, it is a medical emergency and with all of our content, we want to encourage the\nviewers to admire these animals from a safe distance. Don't try to kill them. Don't try to catch them. Don't ever experiment with yourself to see what would happen if\nyou tangled with these things. - No question. I think that's an excellent synopsis. And hey man, are you gonna clean this up? - I will, yes. I will clean up all of the mess that I have made here in the lab. But for everybody out there watching who's wanted to see what would happen if Coyote Peterson was\nbitten by a venomous snake, there ya have it guys, my\nblood tangling with venom. I'm Coyote Peterson. Be brave, stay wild. We'll see ya on the next adventure. Every year around the world, people are bitten by venomous snakes. And it's probably accurate to say that each and every one of\nthese bites happens by accident. Some species like the Copperhead\nare likely to kill you, but a full on envenomation\nfrom a Eastern Diamondback is certain to take your life without the administration of antivenom. Carl and Mora perform thousands\nof milkings every year, risking their own lives just in case you were unfortunately bitten by one of these slithering reptiles. Yet that doesn't mean you\nshould be afraid of snakes. Almost all bites come as a result of humans trying to move, harass, or kill one of these animals. The best course of action is to always respect snakes\nfrom a safe distance, ensuring that you do not have\na catastrophic interaction. If you would like to\nlearn more about snakes and the power of their venom, make sure to visit the Reptile\nDiscovery Center's website, where you can schedule a\nsnake milking demonstration. Hey Coyote pack, if you thought milking some of North America's most\ndeadly snakes was intense, make sure to go back and watch the episode where we milked Australia's\nmost toxic snakes.

blazing", "ThbvvxnrSVs": "hello my name is John elder and I work for cast service purpose of this video is to show you how to wire a microswitch from an Ansel ottoman to our hood control package remember to follow all safe work practices including the use of PPE the first step is to turn off all sources of power to our control package remember that there are several sources of power feeding into our package you have 120 volt control circuit and three-phase power coming into your VFDs as well as load power going out from the VFDs remember once you turn off power you have to wait until the displays on the VFDs go blank before you can work in the package safely the next step is to locate c1 ar1 terminals in the control package these are the terminals where the wires from the micro switch are going to land next is to wire from terminal c1 to the common terminal on the micro switch and then from the normally closed terminal on the micro switch back to the AR one terminal this wiring configuration will make the hood package operate normally until the ansel sip system is triggered which will in turn operate the micro switch operating the switch will open the c1 a r1 circuit and put the control package into fire the last step is to restore all your power and to test the operation of the system so now I'm going to demonstrate what happens when the hood is turned off and the ansel system is activated the ances system will be activated an old trigger operating the micro switch we're gonna use our demo switch here to demonstrate this if we operate the switch what you'll notice is the exhaust fans the VFDs for the exhaust fans will start to ramp up these will continue to ramp up until they reach full speed also note that the supply v FD remains stopped during this time the hood package will remain in the fire mode as long as the ansel system is fired once the ansel system is reset it's going to return the micro switch to the normal position closing c1 and a r1 and thereby returning the hood back to normal operation or in this case the off position so now we're gonna look at it again with the hood turned on if you notice all three of my VFDs are running a forty eight Hertz my two exhaust VFDs on the left and my supply VFD on the right and my lighting relay is energized meaning my hood lights would be turned on at this point so if the ansel system gets triggered the ansel systems going to operate the micro switch and what's going to happen is your supply VFD will go to stop my exhaust VFDs will ramp up to full speed and my lighting relay will be de-energized

shut down control box and basically what it is is when you walk into a kitchen commercial kitchen and turn a switch on your make up air comes on your exhaust fan comes on your hood light comes on and in this case we're actually have the dishwasher and exhaust fan for the dishwasher and this does control box two even though it's not controlled by this one particular switch it has its own separate switch but anyway we've got all the conduits coming in from the various locations the exhaust fans make up air so on and so forth and of course the switch box but this contactor right here this one operates the the supply fan and the hood lights so in case in case there's a fire and the fire suppression system is tripped it'll open up the contacts and this contact will open up and we'll shut the power off to the exhaust fan and our I'm sorry the make up air and the lights it also has a set of auxiliary contacts in here dry contacts that will be operating the shunt trip breaker will send a hundred and twenty volts back to the shunt trip breaker which has a magnetic coil in it so when the power sent back to it it actually trips a breaker and cuts off the power to all the equipment that's underneath the hood so like the fryers or whatever that plugs in a 110 you know we've got three circuits down there and it'll trip all three circuits they're all three single pull circuits and then this is the dishwasher exhaust hood contacter basically what it is it's got a separate switch to it so that when they walk into the kitchen as well you can't run the dishwasher without the exhaust fan running and this was just the most convenient place to put it this kitchen is pretty packed so we just put it all in one control box and then this is the exhaust fan for the make up air and the purpose of this one is it's tied in directly to the switch so it will remain running at all times so it'll go back over this when this one kicks in which is the supply fan make up air and the hood lights this is the exhaust fan both those are tied in together this is the only one that will actually get shut off when the fire suppression system is activated this one doesn't matter it'll remain running there's there's no problems or issues there so if you have air conditioners anything like that if that's supplying air as your main supply your main make up air going into the kitchen and you'd have to shut down the air conditioning system as well so there's a lot lot of wiring and a lot of thought that goes into this you got your your lines your loads your control voltages you got to have a power source coming from your panel back through so that it will if the suppression system is activated it'll send the power back to the shunt rip breaker and trip that off to so this pretty cool little deal I'm working on a full video on how to wire these and how to do them and I'll put that on the website but it's gonna be a while with the holidays and everything anyway just thought I'd throw this up here and show you guys what a fire suppression control box looks like so gang questions shoot me an email thanks for watching have a great day", "114ebyzhB9Q": "hi I'm crash power and today I'm bringing you more origins content with a subscriber requested tutorial on how to get upgraded monkey bombs or the G strike tactical grenades in the call of duty zombie map origins now to get these you'll need to pick up a stone from this table in the tank station and take it to the second floor of the church hold the action button to put it in the holy water well you'll need to cleanse the stone by killing zombies in this area now if you have your Thunder fists you can just you know punch the heck out of them and every time you kill one a stream of yellow smoke goes into cleaning the stone however this is not the only way that you can clean the stone it's not a thunderpunch kill it's a melee kill you can use the melee ability on an upgraded staff or my favorite you can just bash the hell out of them with a riot shield which means you can do this step before you do any of the others you can do this before you even have your Thunder fist or an upgraded staff now after you get your stone clean you'll need to walk up to the holy water hold the action button and pick it up you can tell when it's clean because it'll change colors like this now you will have to carefully carry it back down to the tank station without stepping in the mud without getting it dirty and be careful if you do she'll get on your ass yeah you'll have to go back and hold the action button to clean it she gripes again and here we go again well I actually got to Sami Bloods you don't have to have zombie blood to do this but here's the path I take to get down there you just carefully go this way you can hop if you want to but that part there in the footstep and the one ahead of me are the two trickiest spots once you've gone this far you're pretty much home free it's hard to step in the mud so go into the tank station and walk up to the table in the back then hold the action button and you will turn the nice clean stone tablet back to the table while you're down here in the tank station you'll need to get another twenty melee kills when you do the upgraded monkey bombs will appear above the table just walk up to it hold the action button and now you have upgraded monkey bombs now be advised if you die and come back the next round you can't repeat the process to get them back however you can if you get lucky get them back out of the mystery box now you know how to get your upgraded monkey bombs go out there and blast the crap out of them if you enjoyed the video links are always appreciated if you have any questions you want me to answer be sure to ask me below this video right down there in the comments I've been more than happy to help until next time I'm crash power and thanks for watching", "wC_r3jfo4d8": "making fire using water sounds crazy right but with a little bit of knowledge of chemistry anything is possible warning do not attempt this at home for this experiment we will need two pipettes a glass beaker two smaller glass cups sodium diethyl ether

thing but now fill the cup with water now add about 5 milliliters of diethyl ether to your beaker using a pipette then add three milliliters of water as well ideally you should do this in a fume cupboard because as you can see the reaction produces a lot of toxic fumes these fumes are flammable and can be ignited using a match to produce a ball of fire you if we make the open end of the

We're getting crazy with chemical experiments, now for this video I was scrolling through the comments and I found this request from Spoon Kapeezi Who says if you mix brake fluid and chlorine the mixture will self ignite. This is an experiment You may be familiar with by now, but I think the real request is to push the experiment to the boundaries and explain What's actually taking place, now to get the chemicals we need for our experiment today I made two quick pit stops the first one was to a pool supply store to pick some of this fast dissolving shock treatment for swimming pools and the second stop was to the auto parts store to pick up some dot 3 brake fluid I'm Reading the warning label and funny enough It doesn't say anywhere on here that you can't mix with pool chlorine, does that mean we can? Well Let me show you what happens if you do, you might have noticed on the bag of pool shock chlorine it contains 73 percent calcium Hypochlorite so really high concentration of available chlorine the brake fluid is a mixture of ethylene Glycols And when you mix these two chemicals together a very interesting reaction occurs now if we snip the end off of our pool chlorine and pour out the contents you can see it's really just a Granulated white powder and if you're standing too close, it'll start to smell like a swimming pool And you might even feel it starting to sting your nostrils So here's the setup guys I just fill up this glass about half an inch full at the bottom with Pool shock chlorine And I've got our dot 3 brake fluid we're ready to pour in we're going to carefully add our brake fluid in equal proportions so that It comes just the top the chlorine then we're going to give it a little shake set it down on the top of this brick And start a timer and then get very very far away for about 2 minutes Now once these two chemicals mixed together. It doesn't really look like anything is happening. It's just sitting there. There's no smoke There's no steam It just sits there doing nothing and we're over a minute in twenty seconds now and nothing is really changed, but watch this Bangerang baby, did you see that? It'sat there for about one minute and 35 seconds, and it looked like it was doing absolutely nothing is was completely calm No smoke and then just out of nowhere boom the whole thing combusts a flame shoots up about four feet in the air and we get all this ash that bubbles up and Spews over the Edge that was an epic reaction, so let's do one more of those and then talk about what's happening Nothing like the itchy sensation of chlorine in the nostrils in the morning. It's what I do for you guys If you looked down at this, it looks like nothing is happening whatsoever. It's just sitting there. You don't see any smoke No, Heat if I feel the glass I don't even feel it warming up Ocassionally a little bubble, but I think that's just cuz of the oil sinking now, but we do want to get very far away We want to back up and just watch it patiently because the reaction is taking place watch this So we just passed a minute now since we added the brake fluid and absolutely nothing's happening. It's just sitting there it's just sitting there silently like a crocodile waiting for the kill but Something's going to happen just wait for it. It's a minute and 30 seconds Man that stuff shot right at the top I think that wasn't even bigger flaming that time that one shot up about five feet high and it was right at the 1 minute 35 second mark which is very consistent to the first test that we did So now that we verified that this reaction works. It works very consistently I reached out to my friend nurdrage for an explanation of what's taking place, and he gave me some really good insight I think we should talk about now on the warning label here It says that our brake fluid is a mixture of glycol ethers basically long Hydrocarbons very similar to oil the difference being that brake fluid has oxygen inserted every two carbons now Technically this fluid is flammable, but it's very very hard to ignite And that's why it's generally considered safe for use with your brakes Now the actual reaction taking place when the brake fluid makes contact with the pool chlorine is a free radical break down at the Polyethylene Glycol it basically breaks the Glycol down into lighter components like aldehydes now this takes time Which is why the reaction doesn't begin right away? But as the simpler aldehydes build up they start reacting with the oxygen in the pool chlorine to form water and carbon dioxide Is basically a simple combustion reaction the reaction is exothermic and produces a tremendous amount of heat to the point where it actually? Vaporizes the aldehydes and burst into flame. Yes It actually gets so hot that the brake fluid Vapors self ignite if you were to put this reaction inside of a sealed container the container would explode now Let's talk for just a second about the white vapors coming off of this reaction I've heard concerns from some people wondering that toxic chlorine gas now chlorine is very discernible It's very toxic it starts stinging your nose and your lungs Immediately with very low concentration and during all these experiments and reactions that I've tried the smell of chlorine is Negligible I actually get a stronger smell of chlorine when I'm just pouring the powder into the glass itself the white fumes we're seeing are actually broken down and vaporized brake fluid those are the flammable vapors that burst into fire as soon as the temperature - Todd now let's set up two more experiments just to see how this reacts in different scenarios one out in the open air and the other in the confined space of a soda bottle Okay, so that was a little bit surprising I thought out in the open air would actually take longer to react but actually went off in 54 seconds. That's really interesting Nice chemical residue now my friend Marcus brought up a good point Don't stir the stuff up with your fingers guys because any chemical residues can ignite and burn your skin, okay? So we've seen this reaction in a glass we've seen it in the open air our last experiment is in a plastic soda bottle I Just think I'm just going to give this one a little bit too much Much too much Just for the record that is way too much this should be fun fourth and final Here we go This one might happen a little fast Maybe not there's one minute oh wow, oh my goodness, holy heck Okay, so what was really interesting about that. It was still only about a minute and 30 seconds the same was our other reaction but the difference is the flame shot out like Rocket fuel the color of the flame itself was like a deep red or Magenta and it shot up Ridiculously high I mean it it almost looked like a rocket engine turned upside down not quite as much power of course but very very Satisfying and it was like shooting hot chlorine tablets into the air and they were raining down the back of my shirt Which is absolutely nuts. I'm actually quite surprised that took that long for the reaction to start because in a confined container I would have expected the heat to build a little bit more quickly But that was very consistent with the other reactions that we've experimented with today The thing is when it goes off in the bottle It's just a lot more violent imagine if that were capped off who have bottle bar on our hands What's really amazing to me is how deceiving this reaction is like it Just sits there nothing's happening at all and then out of nowhere Bam this huge fireball super violent reaction is you don't want to be standing anywhere near that's amazing You only get like a split-second with white vapor coming out of the bottle and then boom the whole thing ignites the bottle completely illuminates and then you see this fire stack just shooting out of the top and that right there is where it gets extremely violent the flame shoots out of Frame and starts spewing chemical into the air raining down ashes everywhere Man it goes from the stream of fire to like a blowtorch excellent seriously That's a lot of fire the other thing that you notice is the plastic bottle shrinks like the heat of the reaction shrinks the plastic and then catches in a fire where just burns away to nothing so Very intense experiment to say the least not an experiment need to try at home It's one of those things where the manufacturer says use the product only as intended for these kinds of reasons So kind of fun experiments here guys let's talk about what just happened We started off our experiment today with pool shot chlorine and dot 3 brake fluid those specific chemicals when mixed together Start an exothermic reaction that disassociates the polyethylene glycol into lighter and much more flammable Aldehyde when this exothermic reaction accelerates enough It'll eventually hit the point where the brake flew will vaporize and those flammable vapors will self ignite, and we tried three different scenarios we stuck this combination in a glass out in the open air and in a soda bottle and Surprisingly we found that the reaction in the open air went off quicker than the ones in the confined spaces Which is exactly opposite of what I would have expected So there we have a guides based on our experiments today We now have a deepened Understanding as to why mixing different chemicals together can lead to disastrous results and are often not recommended to be tried at home And of course a huge shout-out to spoon Capisi for leaving the suggestion in the first place and to all 580 of you who uploaded it go ahead and check your youtube inbox spoon or sending a 25 bucks?

The failed raid has called into question the\nMexican government's ability to contain drug violence. Nick Schifrin explores what this says about\nthe capabilities of the United States' top ally in the fight against illegal narcotics. NICK SCHIFRIN: The descent into chaos played\nout on social media. A phalanx of Mexican security forces deploy\nto a neighborhood controlled by the powerful locally based drug cartel and capture their\ntarget, Ovidio Guzman Lopez, who now runs the family business built by his father, known\nas El Chapo, Mexico's most infamous drug lord, now in a U.S. prison. But then the cartel called in the cavalry. With music blaring and phones filming, gunmen\nwith machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades raced to the rescue. They deployed a .50-caliber machine gun that's\nso heavy, it's attached to the back of a truck. And the mayhem began. For more than four hours, cartel militia members\nand Mexican soldiers fought in the streets and paralyzed Culiacan. The violence left vehicles burning and dead\nbodies in the middle of the city in the middle of the day. For residents, it was absolutely terrifying. They fled for their lives, this woman carrying\nher baby in her arms. And on a nearby road, a father shields his\ndaughter. \"Daddy, can we get up?\" she asks. \"No, my love,\" he says. This level of violence is stunning even in\na country known for violence, and it's never happened in this city. Here in the capital of Sinaloa state, the\nSinaloa cartel, long led by El Chapo even when on the run from Mexican and U.S. authorities,\ncontrolled the city and kept the peace. And as residents searched for safety and the\ngun battles mounted, the cartel took soldiers hostage. And that's when the government released the\nkingpin they'd captured, having achieved nothing, except for the death of eight people. Today, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez\nObrador defended the decision to retreat. ANDRES MANUEL LOPEZ OBRADOR, Mexican President\n(through translator): The capture of one delinquent cannot be worth more than the lives of people. DENISE DRESSER, Political Analyst: I think\nwhat happened in Culiacan was a big mistake for the Lopez Obrador administration on all\nfronts, tactical, strategic. It evidences the contradictions of his efforts\nto pacify the country. NICK SCHIFRIN: Denise Dresser is a Mexican\npolitical analyst. She calls the operation a copy of Lopez Obrador's\npredecessors. In 2006, newly elected president Felipe Calderon\nofficially declared war against the cartels. Armed forces began conducting deadly raids. They publicized their spoils, parading kingpins\nand weapons and showing off contraband. The operations weakened the cartels, but also\nset them against each other and increased overall violence. In 2014, 43 students went missing after they\ncommandeered a school bus to get to a protest. Every anniversary, demonstrators call to end\nthe violence, and that frustration helped get Lopez Obrador elected. He promised to be different. ANDRES MANUEL LOPEZ OBRADOR (through translator):\nYou can't fight violence with violence. You can't put out fire with fire. You can't fight evil with evil. DENISE DRESSER: Hugs and not bullets, he says. And what happened yesterday simply shows that\nthe Mexican state and his Mexican government in particular are failing at their mission\nto pacify the country. He is simply reproducing the failed strategy\nof his predecessors, which was to go after drug kingpins with the hope that that would\ndismantle cartels. And all it produces is further violence. NICK SCHIFRIN: Soldiers launched the raid\nwith no arrest warrant and apparently no plan for extraction. And by failing to achieve their objective,\nthe cartels become stronger, Dresser argues. DENISE DRESSER: The more that the Lopez Obrador\nadministration proceeds with these ill-conceived attempts to seize drug kingpins and then backs\naway, it's sending the message to cartels that they can basically do what they want. NICK SCHIFRIN: Today in Culiacan, they saluted\nthe caskets of slain officers, and police families grieved for the husbands and fathers\nwho'd been killed. But they were also angry. They shouted down the local governor, saying\nhe had sent their family members to the slaughterhouse. He vowed their deaths wouldn't be in vain. But, today, the kingpin is free, and the cartel\nstill runs the city, just as it did yesterday. For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Nick Schifrin.", "9uu0DMKWSpY": "y'all got any more them rotaries yo grouse throw me everything you got I'm the slaughter these bastards welcome back to Washington DC this city where political parties don't matter anymore because laws don't exist and everybody's wrapped liberal Wow what noise was that by the way did you fart with your mouth no that's called once hooker monster kid so hard to slurp out and with the collapse of organized governments it's finally time for the most oppressed group of people on earth to rise up and take the rightful position of power what is up and I cannot stress this enough my gamers and what did we do with all this newfound power thrusts into the hands of a few division agents and 32 rotary grenade launchers you freedom-loving piece of [ __ ] for I continue yelling at an unreasonable and nearly unwatchable volume a quick thank you to Ubisoft for sponsoring this video and you can pick up the division 2 via the link below alright main objective of this whole crusade through DC m32 grenade launcher it was our one true desire and I don't feel the need to explain why but I will anyway what's the phrase yes there's nothing stronger than love except three - grenade launcher nothing stronger than love except an M 32 rotary grenade launcher yes like that chicken like the driver's side or the passenger side seat yeah there's nothing stronger than love except a 1032 rotary grenade launcher cos [ __ ] you at everyone near you know my favorite one is Paterson fire a warning shot sir this isn't him 32 grenade launcher I have potato potato just fire a Paterson unfortunately it wasn't immediately available to us because with a beta being a mix of early game and late game we were gonna have to play some intro missions to land god I want it so bad I just don't have access to it yet give me your m32 rotary grenade launcher you dumb bill from a broader perspective we not only wanted the m32 but all of the neato [ __ ] that was available in the end game because I loved the progression system but in the early games you have bare-bones equipment like a busted-ass easier aka Oh bro I got the strap keep it small easy horizontal yeah once you just oppose that to the end game and the sheer amount of radical attachments is you can slap on even your sidearm it's terrific yet terrifying how do you have that many attachments on a camel I got the extended mag I got the suppressor I got the laser sight I got the top ACOG I got a quad rail key mod hyper fire I can fry an egg on that [ __ ] thankfully we have plenty of tools available to help us purge through the patties the first of which a high tech phenom and Fairford that almost vamps flama if you don't get the Camelot sir what the [ __ ] is wrong with you you can't do wield Camelot shoes I would totally want to do that BBQ me son Oh Oh God your mortal flames cannot hurt me I mean technically it's a chemical launcher and you ignite said chemicals to purge heretics and flame but come on you got the idea and I don't know how to say launch in German ich wei\u00df nice yes that are what I'm looking for my god the inferno in here don't disturb them we gotta we gotta hurry up you ready yep okay go Oh God oh those pipes oh it hit the barrel see that's what I'm looking for a hit that dude and he got a whole lot of 762 in the face before he burn to death yo check out my chem launcher shoot the gas shoot the gas yeah so in the early stages fire was the ultimate time-saver like is the VIP you're rescuing being lazy and taking too long to get up Elinor I got some bad news it's about to get real hot in here Elinor Oh diplomat launcher was the natural solution and it got even better once you realize that you could wombo-combo it with the other launcher types by foaming bad guys in place before you purge them in flames perfect timing oh there it is baby [Applause] it wasn't the only useful tool that I could use to inflict maximum pain on the enemy because the sniper turret also deadly admittedly a little tricky to deploy when you're so used to hitting up your cat launcher until the sniper turret your desktop yeah yeah oh [ __ ] is everything will fire bedroom poked your head up you know you know oh there that's how you do it sorry it took me a second to figure it out okay so I so like I see somebody right and then I target them rcxd watch me get it an angry boy oh babe oh there it is yo deed that's how it's done oh I finally figured out how to do it this makes so much sense now however once I did get a grasp of the mechanics it was like having my very own robotic Lee Harvey Oswald ready to go at a moment's notice right so this is I'm gonna throw that joint right there you should stop completely I'm and fire and rats okay good body alright alright let me hit that that girl all the way can I hit her across the way no way no oh my god I can she's so far away it's the Eye of Sauron check this joint out right now alright so I hold that right there sniped Snipes there you go boom boom baby and all what help Oh be the triple take yeah oh my god that turret is so good so plenty of toys to make running the gauntlet of early missions a breeze but that's where things between grouse and I diverged because I upgraded my character with extra armor plates which can be swapped out in a neato way for renewed protection I got a sappy plate and cover me cover me cover me cover me sappy plate wall grouse was just upgrading his character to be a horror that always smashed that ma [ __ ] loot all button and is the definition of over encumbered why do I always see you hitting loot all on everything cuz I just steal [ __ ] you're gonna get you're gonna get you're gonna get to a point where you're too heavy Asia you're too heavy you need to lose some weight garance he starts like picking out sappy plates he gets rid of all of his water half of his having cheese balls and energy drinks and whey protein it was bad I let's go listen here buddy just because I have to use my slots for that should be used for my plates for additional food storage I got happy with turkey thigh in here you're thinking Oh what if I get shot how I protect myself well I'm protecting myself against hunger in the field you ever think of that one agent you realize that your only Kevlar plate on your chest right that you're taking out right now listen buddy I was in Fallujah I need these cheese balls I do four tours in the sandbox you shut your mouth somebody questions you on it why are you taking out your sappy plate can you eat Kevlar No can you eat cheese ball yes reencounter try to carb up and after I gave grouse an expert lesson on tear gas I'm just gonna sit in the tear gas cuz I don't feel like moving to a new location I'm good I'm good here the American protesters Kevin Lee NiCad swooped in to join the squad in our journey to endgame and there was one rule and one rule only when they arrived and we please have a video without [ __ ] food in it for the love of God no I don't need to make this episode about food again and one please when you bring [ __ ] up like that can you provide some context and all my viewers just to say I just watched your video what the hell is mumbo sauce sauce is the blood of DC and I'm pretty sure this glass simple to prove I'm gonna reload and check another mag let's see we managed to make it to the end game which apparently takes 30 to 40 hours in the retail game and with the sheer amount of customization available grouse look like a billion dollar super soldier after one loading screen you know I got the rails on me I got the Picatinny things you shouldn't be that excited about Picatinny rail have you ever seen a hyper fire trigger no you breathe on that [ __ ] it fires dude it's it's like a bobby pin but you can rapidly fire on this [ __ ] it's gigantic nah this is what I got what because [ __ ] you and your extended family more importantly though we finally had access to the specializations which meant survivalist grouse on an explosive crossbow and sharpshooter ecash on an armor cracking Magnum oh I made my sons on the way dawn nail them with what's your chronic with my crossbow with a controller from for tomorrow's bucket catch me I was wondering - OH oh my god keep hitting him really actual lasers was ever shooting him and of course on demolitionists in my hands on m32 rotary grenade launcher which i can only describe is the solution to your problem no matter what that problem may be okay you ready Wow what I forgot about though is how amazing the reload is because obviously I've used it before but I didn't remember how cash this reload animation is so nice I hit the wrong button you know maybe you shouldn't have the grenade launcher you know maybe I didn't ask for your opinion grass I feel like every reload animation in the game should be this fancy because who cares about tactical effectiveness when you can flex with aesthetics no no no no no no you have the irons on a pistol and you interlock two of them and you see you bracket you rack and both the same time and hopefully you don't shoot yourself and both of your like if you goof that one up you are definitely going you open both of your forearms but it looks so sick but no matter how simple or fancy your reload you're gonna need some heavy weaponry to take down the endgame baddies because I'm not sure if they were tweaked since the last time that I played them but the black tusk dwarfed the skill level of the hyenas like try to imagine your average hyena whose dude pulls up to two division age with a Glock 18 this is my town and then it still he gets a laid out okay buddy sure whatever you say then contrast' that with the average black tusk that will curb stomp you in a submission and DoubleTap your ass without hesitation or mercy that they got on the end oh my god he just busted my [ __ ] I was not a v.a.t.s in please help me he's gonna curb stop my [ __ ] if you don't help me oh my god he just double tap me double tap me in the ribs so if you like to get to tapped in the ribs by super soldiers just like me don't forget that you can hit up the division too via the link below and that is about it I would like to thank you so very much for watching one final thank you self for sponsoring this video and be sure to tune in next time when I remind you that a sappy play can also be used as a dinner plate you know what now that I think about that that's kind of depressing like I imagine a marine somewhere has probably done that before and that's even worse the more that I think about it because Kevlar blocks bullets and surface for food dinner plate surface or food but that whole blocking bullets part not too hot there chief wouldn't want to stick one of those in your plate carrier [Music] [Music]", "9W6d8GpUL3U": "with fuel at its flashpoint and the vapors combining

Here, the milk is used in a really interesting technique called milk washing, where we're actually going to curdle the milk using an acid from lemon juice. Then we're gonna strain out those curds and we'll be left with a very smooth, rich, delicious punch. Now, I know the idea of curdling milk in a cocktail just sounds gross, but stay with me. It's worth it, I promise. We're gonna make a black tea-port-milk punch, and start by taking a large glass bowl and adding 1 cup or 235 mL of whole milk. Then, in a separate glass pitcher we're gonna add 1/3 cup or about 75 mL of fresh lemon juice. Next, we need some brewed black tea. Here I'm using an English breakfast, but use your favorite black tea and we're gonna add 2 cups or about 470 mL into the pitcher. Next, we need some port, which is a rich, fortified wine. Here we're using Ruby port, and we're gonna add 2/3 cups or about 150 mL to the pitcher. Now, for our spirit we're gonna be using something called Batavia Arrack, which is a funky, molasses-based liquor from Indonesia. If you don't have this, feel free to use a light rum. Again, we're gonna add 2/3 cup or 150 mL. Next, we need some sugar; a little over 1/3 cup or 85 grams. Give that a stir to dissolve the sugar, and meanwhile this milk has just been sitting over there in the corner, not really contributing anything to society... So let's get a reaction out of it. Pour about a third of the tea mixture into the milk and give it a slow stir, and pretty soon you'll start to see the milk break into these small curdles. Let's cut to the Curdle Cam and see what's really happening here. The acidity of the lemon juice is causing the casein proteins of the milk to coagulate, And when they do this, they also pick up some of the astringent-tasting tannins of the black teas and other things that generally make the punch cloudy After we strain these out, the whey proteins of the milk will be left behind, which will give the drink a lot of body and richness. Let this rest for at least 30 minutes, although some people even let it rest for up to 24 hours. And here we can see some separation between the curds and the rest of the punch. Alright, let's get these gross curds out of there. So grab a large container and a fine mesh bag. Here, I'm using a nut milk bag, but you can also use something like a cheese cloth. Then you're gonna pour it through the cloth, and it's still gonna be a bit cloudy; here we're just trying to collect the curds into the bottom of the cloth. Pour the strained punch into a pitcher and we're gonna run it through again. Make sure to keep the curds in the bag from the first pass, and carefully pour the punch through the curds to use them as another filter. And then finally, run it once or twice through a coffee filter to just collect any of the last remaining bits of cloudiness Then we're gonna transfer it to a sealable bottle, and just look at how beautiful that punch is. Remember, this was almost black from the tea and the port, and with the tannins stripped away, this almost looks more like a ros\u00e9. Store this in the fridge, and it pretty much will never go bad. When you're ready to serve, grab a rocks glass, throw in a big ol' ice cube... Aaand we're gonna have to slow this down a bit. When serving clarified milk punch, it would be wrong to use any ice besides perfectly-clear ice. I'll put a link in the description on how to make that. You want that cube to basically disappear into the drink. Now, is this necessary? No, but it does look pretty sexy. Alright, I'm getting thirsty. Let's give this a taste. Cheers! ...And wow, the flavor here is unbelievable: The astringency you normally get from tea is completely gone, and you're left with this full-bodied, rich strength that is dangerously smooth. I highly recommend it! Thanks for watching, guys!

Cheers!", "9dNb1-xSgXI": "[Music] [Music] YouTube what is up its your boy knowledge from gamers little playground so call of duty ghosts' has this new thing called map specific killstreaks and what it is is that on these certain maps that have them you can cut you can get them on care packages and calling these killstreaks that only apply to those maps so the way to get them is you pick up these the field orders which are these these little blue suitcases that you see after somebody die as you pick them up and they'll tell you to accomplish like a mini mission like the little sub mission there'll be something like kill somebody from the back go one person on the prone killed three people with non kill Street kills it's a variety of things I mean it could be anything but if you complete them you get a care package and when you throw it down most of the time it'll be something like a UAV or I mean a SATCOM or a sentry gun IMS something like that but on these specific maps sometimes you'll get this big kill streak and you'll see the symbol it's a grim reaper which is the symbol and the game for the Kem strike which is like the nuclear Moab so you call them in and it's just like any other kill streak and there's four different ones on four different maps so we're gonna show you every single one so the first and best in my opinion is strike zone probably the smallest map in the game in the most fast pace is my favorite map got the field order called it in and what do you get you get a Kem strike the nuke itself so you call it in as you can see the whole map changes his environment it becomes like a destroyed nuclear holocaust type of type of environment so it's really cool it almost becomes like a brand new man more open and a lot more mobile also if any of you wondered we also have called in another Kem strike just to see if you can call into in one game which you can so in case you were wondering you can call multiple Kem strikes Kem strikes in one game the second one is on Warhawk on this map when you get it you get motor fire and what that is you call it in as you'll see is just motor fire from the sky falling down on enemies this one's really really powerful actually this is probably the second best one you guarantee to get yourself I leave at least five or six kills if people are running around and this is a really strong kill streak I wish actually you could get this one as like a regular kill streak because this is way better than the coup streaks that are in there right now the third one is called sabotage on sovereign on this one there's a big explosion in the middle of the map and then after that gas starts to leak into the map but it's non-lethal gas but if you're in the range of the explosion you'll die it changes the way you play the map the gas that comes in is not lethal but it does cover cover up the map so I think it's pretty cool and the last one is on whiteout and this one's called satellite crash so this one actually we tried this several times in it you get it pretty fast like I think the randomness is is like it's a higher chance of getting it on this map because we tried it three different times and all three times we got it in the first field order the other ones you have to maybe to get five six field orders to get it so it's just it's just seems like maybe this one's easier and it makes sense because this one is not lethal at all this one is called satellite crash so when you call it in its taste probably like 30 seconds and you'll see like a meteor falling from the sky which is a satellite and it's crashing down and so into the ground and as you can see it crashes right here into the snow if you stand near the satellite your your UAV your radar gets all messed up like if it's countered but other than that nothing nothing else happened and uh give special thanks to all our Ryan and fallen 166 for helping me do this yeah those are all the mass specific kill streaks we try to get on every map and these are the only ones that we can get them on if we miss any let us know in the comments and we'll update this video and other than that enjoy in peace you enjoyed this vid make

another BMW video but I guess this could apply to basically any vehicle we are going to be cleaning spark plugs so I just took my spark plugs out on my BMW 328i s with an e36 engine and here is what's the ignition coils look like it's pretty self-explanatory to get tone just take off the cover and then there you can expose them so I inspected my spark plugs and found that they were a little fouled and they had a lot of gunk on them they had quite a bit of the electrode tip left which tells me that states they are pretty new I'm not sure when they were put in this car was inherited for my wife here at around 230,000 miles and I put about 10,000 miles on it so just checking out the spark plugs here and when we pull it out you can see that they're going to be pretty fouled so there could be a couple reasons why your spark plugs are fouled and the electrode isn't really worn down I guess the primary reason would be your air fuel ratio mixture you might have be having a fuel rich or fuel lean mixture a fuel rich mixture would probably mean you're not getting enough air into your engine your air filter is probably clogged or your mass airflow sensor might not be reading the airflow correctly and a fuel lean mixture could probably mean that you have a leak somewhere in your air intake it could be anywhere between your mass airflow sensor and your at the end of your air intake manifold just check all the boots on the air intake check all the gaskets check all the seals your idle air control system check that I'm going to come out here with a series of videos that shows different things that I checked and Replace just to be sure that my air intake was getting the proper air flow so I guess first off back here to the sparkplug cleaning we are spraying down with some carb cleaner spray down get some of the junk off make sure you apply liberally it's alright you can't add too much so once you finish spraying just inspect and see that there's maybe still some build up if you want you can get a rag or a piece of sandpaper and start scraping it off or just spray a couple more times I use the rag I didn't want to scrape up the spark plug since it is kind of a new looking spark plug you could always change your spark plug just in case if you're not sure if the spark plugs good or not you could always do a spark test on it but I didn't go that route bark plugs really aren't that expensive I guess here for the BMW then it might be a little more expensive than the $5 cheap ones with a double prong here but I decided just to clean them and another option you can do to clean them you can get a blow torch and just burn off from the carbon you see that nice bright colored flame coming off it's just some of the build-up carbon junk just burning off you can see the change in color starting to get a little charred there be careful because it could get pretty hot don't touch it with your fingers so now I'm going to show you some before and after photos here's B before with quite a bit of carbon buildup and then here's the about in between I guess after the carb cleaner spray and as I'm burning off the carbon and here's basically as I'm finishing finishing up using the blowtorch and see it clean some of it off so well I guess when you're done inspect it if you want to clean it perfectly and make it much brand new as you can you could always get a piece of sandpaper I guess and just scrape it down to the bare minimum but not really sure how that's going to compromise the sparkplug but anyway I guess when you're all done go ahead and put it back in make sure you don't over tighten your spark plug because bad things can happen I'm going to happen so once you're all done put it all back together make sure you have the ignition coil push down all the way to snap onto the spark plug and the ignition coil connector is connected BMW makes it pretty easy and you can't possibly have the connector loose because of that little silver clip there so go ahead and go down the line and clean all your spark plugs whether you have a v4 or v6 or v8 let's go ahead and clean them all keep them all uniform so as I was mentioning before if you are having this problem maybe check all of your air intake connections see if there's anything anything having extra air come by or leak and as I said before I'm going to be putting together some videos of various spots that I checked and replaced and tried to seal up some air intake leaks and if you want to be a part of that just go ahead and subscribe down there below leave this video a like let's see if we can get 20 likes on this video and go ahead into the comment section and see give me your best tips on how you clean your spark plugs and what you do to keep your BMW in top shape thanks for

start don't know what the term is for that amount of energy that it takes to get the gas stove to light activation energy activation energy that's correct what I have here is a standard Bunsen burner and a candle if I turn on the gas to the Bunsen burner and strike a flint above it it'll light right away and then it keeps burning without the spark now can I use the same spark to light the candle now why is that because there's no gas for it to ignite now I can light the candle with a lighter but notice that if I quickly put the flame there it won't light it takes a second or two for me to continue to have the flame on the wick for it to ignite so what do you think is happening during that time that the flame is in contact with the wick the wax is melting and melted wax a phrase who knows what the three states of matter are solid liquid and gas what state of matter is the wax solid so if I blow out the candle and then quickly light it it lights more quickly than the first time what's the difference you had a liquid wax right it wanders away right so why do you think it took less time when there was liquid wax to light the flame than when there was just the solid wax is it took less entity to turn this how it wax to liquid wax correct because the liquid wax is already there so one other thing we can do with the flame is if I blow it out you remember we got that white smoke before I can relight the candle getting the match to touch the wick", "s58JuIoXS7s": "hello everybody Joe Classen here with wild revelation outdoors over the past many months I've done quite a few videos about live-edge woodworking and chainsaw lumber millennium and a common question that many folks have in regard to those topics is how to properly season or dry wood that you've cut before you can start working with it now there are two main ways to do this you can either dry your wood with a kiln which most people don't have access to or you can air dry it in this video I'll be sharing a relatively fast easy process that works great for air drying out your lumber for upcoming projects as well as a few tips for accelerating the process so let's get started after getting your lumber cut out in the woods and brought back home the first thing I do is trim or break away any soft rotting our bug damaged bark on the outside of the wood with a large chisel or the backside of a hammer and the next step is to get the wood cleaned up as best as you can I use a stiff bristled brush to sweep away all the loose bark dirt and sawdust and then I go over each board on both sides with a shop vac to finish things off now if there's evidence of insect activity in a particular piece of wood as a precautionary measure mile spray the board down with plain old white vinegar which acts as a natural insecticide and which also won't discolor or damage your wood so after all the wood is cleaned up I'll give the ends of each board or slab a good coat of wood grain end sealer such as anchor seal now you can use plain latex paint for this purpose as well which I used to do quite a bit in the past but I found that a product such as anchor seal works much better as far as preventing the wood from cracking checkering are splitting as it begins to dry out now something else I do is put some end sealer on any areas of wood that might have a slight crack already or what looks like the beginning of a crack so after applying the end sealer and letting it dry I stack the wood up in a dry well-ventilated place which for me is the corner of the garage on my wood rack or outside under a covered porch for the bigger pieces now it's very very important to promote and maintain good airflow between each piece of wood as well as the area that you're drying it in and to do that you'll need to put stickers as they're called are small planks of wood in between each slab or each plank of lumber I typically use sticks that are around one to two inches thick and place anywhere from two to four stickers in a uniform fashion in between each piece of wood depending on how long it is it's also important to make sure you use the same size stickers for each piece of wood to help prevent warping while it dries and as a final measure of precaution to help keep the wood from warping while at Ages I place heavy objects such as these old weights on top of each wood stack again in a balanced uniform fashion so after all that it's a matter of letting nature take its course and dry out the wood as a rule of thumb it typically takes a year of drying time for each inch of wood thickness now it may seem like it will be forever until you can finally start working with the wood you've cut and processed and no doubt it can be very hard to be patient during the drying process there are however ways to greatly accelerate this process and one way that's worked great for me is simply to run a box fan on your stack of wood while it's drying I keep a fan going on medium speed year-round in my wood drawing area and I position it so that it creates a constant flow of air all around the entire drying area which again greatly reduces the overall time it takes for the wood to dry out and season properly using this particular process I'm usually able to dry out a one to one and a half inch thick piece of wood in a matter of months instead of waiting years now a big question that folks have in regard to this process is how do you know exactly when your wood is dried out and ready to be put to use one of the most accurate ways to do this which I highly recommend is using a moisture meter keep checking the moisture level of your wood until it stabilizes and hold steady at the lowest number or a level that you can get it for several weeks or months in a row now there's really no magic number to look for as it will depend upon where you live how thick the wood is what kind of what it is and so on again the key is for that number or that level to stabilize so once you get that level down as low as you can get it for an extended period of time that's probably as low as it's gonna go thus your wood is ready to be used now again keep in mind this is gonna take several months to even several years depending on how thick the wood is and the environment in which you're drying it so you're gonna have to be patient one way or the other so I hope this video helps and if

like this and then slip it underneath your full Popkin so that it looks like it was already opened and then carefully pierce a hole in the side of your Popkin and empty it to about a third of the way empty then you can crush the can to show your audience that it's empty or you could lay it on its side and come across it to do your magic trick maybe at a family gathering or event so what you want to do is put your thumb on the hole that you created and that's going to hold in the pressure and then you shake the can and as you shake the can the carb the pressure builds from the carbonation and makes the crush can uncrushed and then you slip the paper away and open it up and everybody will be amazed what you'll need for this are three cups that you cannot see through scissors a diaper and some water then you take your diaper and cut it in half to rip it open and get all the super absorbent polymers inside the diaper and then put those into your cup and they will soak up the water and tada no water comes out your friends will be amazed smart ink wake up and draw a circle and go to sleep and wake up and make the circle a square yeah fill it in that's a nice square okay go to sleep wake up dance around what you'll need for this is ferrofluid I'll include a link to where to get that below magnets and a sheet of laminated paper we used an old activity sheet that we have had in the schoolroom all you do is pour a little bit of your ferrofluid on the paper and then move the magnet underneath and because your food is magnetic it makes the ink look like it's coming alive what you'll need for this is some water lemonade kool-aid packet sugar and a couple cups magic wand optional and then inside of your sugar Cup just include the kool-aid pepper as well do not do this unless you have adult supervision but what you're going to need is a bowl salt a candle and 70 or 50% rubbing alcohol and then you're going to pour the rubbing alcohol into the bowl and add salt now what the salt will do is make the money burn orange if you don't add salt the flame will burn blue and a quick side note I am using my hands to make this more safe you could use tongs you soak your money completely you make sure it's completely soaked and again use tongs not your fingers the water is the first to be heated at its boiling point then vaporized by the heat of the combustion from the burning alcohol there we go what you'll need is a couple pencils in a plastic bag and of course some water how does this work well the plastic bag is made of polymers and polymers are a long chain of molecules but when you poke through the plastic you're stepping between the long strands of molecules which creates an airtight seal around the pencil keeping all the water inside everything down and will cook down good job ready take it'll pop in do not try this without adult supervision what you'll need is a balloon a match and a candle and then a little bit of water so the secret is you put a little bit of water in the balloon before you blow it up this happens because the water is conducting heat away from the surface of the balloon as the water closest to the flame heats up it begins to rise and the cooler water replaces it at the bottom of the balloon what you'll need is a straw and a potato a couple straws if you want your friends to try it you might want to start by asking your friends if they can pierce a drinking straw through a potato they will find that they cannot do it unless they know the secret the secret is you put your thumb over top of the over the end of the drinking straw and what that does is it traps air inside of the drinking straw and when you trap air inside the straw the air molecules compress and give the straw strength so you can pierce it right through that potato all you need for this is a piece of PVC pipe and some Christmas tinsel take three to six strands of tinsel and tie them together on each end about six inches apart and then you cut off the excess on the end and when you rub the pipe in your hair or give it a static charge you're giving it a negative static charge the orb is at first attracted to the pipe because it has a positive charge but as soon as the arm touches the pipe it picks up a negative charge and since the pipe is negative and the tinsel orb is now negative they repel away from each other and it makes the orb levitate can I do it with my fingers what you'll need for this is a finger some dish soap water pepper and a plate after you put some water on your plate shake some pepper on your water and then here's where the secret comes in put a little bit of dish soap on your finger and then as soon as you touch it you're lowering the surface tension of the water by adding the soap pretty cool science

of things that can hurt you, or that are particularly interesting. They just crawl around and you might step on them occasionally, but there are certain types of beetles that have a really famous defense mechanism that actually can hurt you. They are called bombardier beetles and they defend themselves by detonating explosions inside of their bodies and spraying out hot, nasty chemicals; so hot it is the temperature of boiling water. And so I study these beetles to understand a) how they have these explosions happen inside their bodies, and b) are there things we can learn from that. Previously people have looked at this by taking images of the outside of the beetle using high-speed photography to watch the pulses fly through the air. Whereas we are looking at the inside of the beetle using cutting-edge synchrotron radiation to visualize the spray being formed inside the beetle. So that allows us to see how these pulses, instead of coming out as a continuous stream, comes out as a series of pulses. And what we find is a part of the explosion chamber actually deforms during the explosion and when it does so it cuts off the flow of reactants into the explosion chamber. And so, that causing the explosion to temporarily start, or stop. Bombardier beetles are one of the most famous examples of chemical defense in nature and people have been trying to understand how they produce these hot sprays for a very long time, and they've been trying to understand how these beetles have evolved. And our work really shows that something as complicated as a pulse jet spray can emerge from very simple modifications. You know, these softening of a particular part of the reaction chamber can produce a huge change in the type of spray. If you look at these beetles relatives it comes out as a gentle mist whereas in this case it comes out as a pulsed jet.", "gFPF33J0hr0": "over 3,800 bucks on sorts really I'm gonna call Mike and get him down here to take a look at these this is a catwalk trust me the reality television show Pawn Stars has become a pop-culture phenomenon the show follows a family as they run and operate their pawn shop gold and silver pot in Las Vegas Nevada the employees of the shop are some of the most memorable characters on television more specifically employee Chumlee has definitely been a fan favorite and has made his way into the hearts of loyal fans of the show unfortunately that ride might be coming to an end keep watching to find out why Austin Lee Russell better known as Chumlee was born in Henderson Nevada not far from where he would eventually work in fine fame the nickname Chumlee came to be when a friend's dad said that he looked like a walrus in the cartoon show Tennessee tuxedo when he became friends with Cory big Hoss Harrison as a child his fate was sealed they didn't get their start together at gold and silver though Rick Harrison Cory's dad actually purchased a Quiznos franchise at the - ran together when he turned 21 Chumlee became an employee at the Harrisons pawn shop before he was making deals Chumlee worked behind the counter writing tickets cleaning and testing items and the five years before the show existed Chumlee learned from the Harrison family the tricks of making a great deal trick that he didn't use so often himself by the time the show began shooting Chumlee was working the counter as a salesman he did not have the best start though Corey has publicly talked about a situation where a man came into the shop to sell a stand-up bass Chumlee leaned the bass against the wall and left it there by the time Chumlee came back the bass had fallen and broken into a million pieces Chumlee collected the fragments in a box when the man returned the shop had to pay him $20,000 because the bass turned out to be rare the man had originally pawned it for only 700 so that created a major loss for the shop Chumlee often comes across as the butt of the joke on the show he was constantly making bad deals and being talked down to by the other cast members specifically Rick Harrison and the old man Chumlee was seen as the village idiot and was often berated for his incompetence he notoriously made bad deals and would be chewed out by Rick although he did often fumble when trying to make a deal his sweet spot and expertise lies with pinball machines in an early episode in season two Chumley actually negotiated a great deal for a pinball machine worth a lot money once the show took off and Chumlee became a breakout star he decided to open up a side business selling novelty merchandise that he had created to make his business thrive he ended up selling half of his business to Rick Harrison for $155,000 in order to meet the needs of his orders his side business was so popular due to Chumley's popularity on the show and speaking of the popularity of the show did you know that the stars don't actually work the counter when they're not being filmed fans flocked to the pawn shop to take pictures and get autographs so the shows put the kibosh on the stars actually working Chumlee doesn't just make deals with collectors on the show he actually is a collector he owns around 200 pairs of shoes and collects pokemon cards as well known for his heavy physique Chumlee decided to make a change in 2013 and was able to drop 75 pounds in one year by exercising and eating a healthy diet the weight loss was inspired by his dad's death at age 54 due to pancreatic cancer another perk of losing all that weight was being able to ride a hoverboard that he had purchased in an earlier season of the show the limit was 250 pounds and Chumlee wasn't able to ride it until he had lost some weight so everything seemed to be heading in the right direction for Chumlee he was on a successful show making a good amount of money and able to spend time doing the things that he loved but that right direction was about to take a heart left in March 2016 Chumley's house was raided during an investigation into sexual assault charges while the police were searching Chumley's house they came across crystal meth cocaine marijuana xanax and several guns the amount of drugs found in his home made it pretty clear that he was dealing drugs on the side following the raid Chumlee was arrested he was released on bond but was to appear in court a few days later in May 2016 he was charged with 20 felony accounts including weapon and drug possession Chumbley pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm a felony weapons charge and attempted drug possession these charges came with a sentence of three years probation and counseling because the felony charge was later dismissed Chumlee is still able to appear on the show a convicted felon by order of the network cannot appear on television so he dodged that bullet by striking a deal and pleading guilty fun fact there was also something less but very notable found in Chumley's house a chum chum room that's right complete with a dance pole 2018 saw Chumley getting engaged in Instagram model Olivia radmann the two met in 2016 and became friends eventually becoming serious she was also a student at UNLV but now studies at USC be causing the couple to live apart until she finishes while the distant is hard Chumley is excited to start his life with olivia in 2019 Chumley put his Vegas party house up for sale he wasn't able to sell it right away it had to cut the price several times before finally selling for 1 point 3 7 5 million dollars he also underwent gastric sleeve surgery and was able to drop 114 pounds it goes without saying that there might be many reasons fans will see less of Chumley going forward so what happens now to Pawn Stars with one of its most beloved stars having so much legal trouble will the show go on many fans were certain that Chumley would immediately be axed after all of his shenanigans however there didn't seem to be an end in sight although rumors swirled around the internet speculated Chumley put the rumor to bed when he confronted Rick Harrison in a video he posted to his Instagram page in the video Chumley tells Rick there's a rumor that I got fired - which Rick responds you didn't get fired Chumlee continues by asking Rick if he wishes he could fire him - which Rick latrise sometimes but I love you do you think Chumlee should have gotten the axe after his trouble with the law or do you agree that the Harrisons were right in keeping him on board whichever way you slice it Chumlee remains a pawn star so

welcome back to my channel and if you're new welcome I hope to earn your subscription today I am back here with the icon and the Crashers and a whole bunch of gold or some of which might be a very high-grade gold or we're hoping and I'm gonna have a day playing around crushing rocks extracting gold and evaluating some samples to see if I got any new great claims to go check out also have some information about the future of the icon and the crushers and well should be a good day I hope you enjoy I hope you enjoy well enough if you're new to subscribe enjoy [Music] now before I get started let's talk about the icon I 150 centrifugal or gravity concentrator here Dave at 911 lend me this actually gave it to me to use for a year he wanted me to evaluate it get it out there show it to the world show it was show the world what it can do unfortunately a year is up in fact he left it with me for a year and a half so he needs to you know get his money back out of it because it's an expensive machine for sure and he needs to sell it off as a used piece of equipment so I am NOT going to get to play with it much longer that's why I'm here today to run a few of my samples and tomorrow I actually have two potential buyers coming to check it out and test it and see if it works so the icon will be going away very shortly for me thanks Dave for giving me the opportunity to do this for a year year and a half I love the machine works great but it's time is up so one last day let's use it and get what we can out of it [Applause] so to get ready I have to fill the tailings pond here it is filling now I have it set up so that the discharge goes into this bin first and then spills off of the tailings pond so all the crush all the tailings actually get captured in the bin here and then it's just served water going back into the tailings pond I'll pick this up with the Bobcat later bury it dump it do whatever I need to with the tailings to get rid of them properly or I might reprocess some and see what I missed but I don't know any help filling fun I also have to charge the battery for the big generator it's missing a moment it's over being charged by the little generator because for some reason it went dead and there's no pulse start on that beast it needs the battery so it's charging over the little generator right now guess I should hook up the plumbing - hmm I'll do that well straight well the battery's charging now if you want to know the particulars about how the icon actually works I have many many videos that explain it out there one that's just all about how it works and what all components do I'll leave a link here in this video to that one if you want to know how it works but it's a great little machine that uses a centrifuge to separate gold from non gold from everything else and it works great for such a little machine and reattaching the battery chokes on fuels on generator started nicely let's plug in the distribution box here we go all three things plug in the three machines the icon the draw crusher and the impact milk and I think we're ready to go Oh waters not ready yet everything's working let's do this now let's look at the first sample we got here now I've been sitting on this stuff for months without crushing it don't know why but this comes from my olala claim up by the gondola copper mine but it's this particular quartz vein it's supposed to have a little bit of gold value in it so I took a bucket of this one and a bucket of debris right beside it I took a video of that with my wife if you haven't seen that go back and look up I'll put a link or something at the end of this video of where we got this stuff from and crush this down we crush it together even though it's two separate spots there's side by side crush it together and see if it's got a gold value in it now I'm really hoping the fact that it's all wet doesn't affect it through the draw crusher I think it'll be fun I don't think it'll gum up in any way it's not very much between that and this it's less than a bucketful so it won't take too long to see if there's any gold in that quartz vein [Applause] and look who decided to show up just in time just about to fire up the icon got it all clean all up and running is just about turned on and run the first load or lala material blue-chip material and I got a friend coming over with some stuff from his mind perfect I brought coffee nice to bring me coffee [Music] [Music] so I can't really talk will I do this does the generator now there is so loud but things are just coming through real nicely we're gonna be through this bucket in no time everything is working perfectly and it should all be coming out for all perfect there we go Brogan so we managed to jam the impact mill they're just plugged up the great sodads taken apart to clear off the great he does I'm gonna pan out the first 10 minutes of run here and see what was in the first bucket there's what she looks like before I pan that's what looks like in a pan now this allow a mine we have here has lots of history the sunrise mine just below mine ran a lot back in the day and they got a lot of gold back in the day now I'm right above the sunrise on the gun Cola which is more of a copper mine than a gold mine but some of the court seems have still showed some nice gold values as well so we're hoping we're hoping this scene does when I start feeding the second bucket through it's mostly just you know top soil mixed with rocks and stuff I probably fed the fine material too fast for the impact meal to deal with or possibly there's a bit too much you know organics yes the bio material in there that just plugged up that grate not too many sulfides in this material which makes it easy to pan let's hope it doesn't mean that there's no gold though the which there wasn't one on the outside here's what we're looking like now with just the sulfides left behind just the blacks and okay let's see what she shows hey can I do this backwards for the camera maybe oh one piece of gold OOP there she goes one nice piece right there really chunky yeah she's full from the goop and another little one and another one get little pieces here these little ones that are down at the end probably can't be picked up on camera just because they're so small I'll throw a microscope picture of them at the end though so you can see the hardrock gold we are all done this run the water pressure down mean one off and we're in [Applause] well let's see what this holds so most of the second bucket here came from the second pole that we dug out of the Nina was digging out of but they are side by side Ian basically the same seam so this will tell us if there's much if anything in that seam like I tell us which the two pits it came from but I'm not too concerned about that right there's the material the heavies that are left behind plus a few big rocks but you see it's just you know all metallics in there lots of sulfides lots of heavies let's hope there's metallics as in gold that's some fine stuff in there yeah we've got a lot of fine stuff in that second run can we pick this separate gonna need the close-up camera for that that second part of the run had lots and lots of fine gold the big chunk flip floated back there not floor they just moved back gonna take this home clean it up really well take a good shot with the close-up camera so you can see what all is there so the racket dad was making back there he's looking for a valve to adjust the water flow in the upper crushers he doesn't seem to find the quite the right valve we need but we want to adjust how much water is going up top so that the impact mill isn't acting like a big water pump and pumping so much water and it has just the right amount coming in from the top so that's what he's looking for in all of our bins of extra pieces you got it okay well I think I'm gonna do the blue-chip run separate from this one so that I can go home and show you all of this stuff in this video here all this beautiful hardrock gold that we got from the olala claim Alex Annette oh Allah so I am gonna make two videos here one for the olala one for the blue-chip and of course my buddy steve is coming out with his high-grade gold ore that he has to see how well the icon will recover it and that is happening later today so I'll take a video of that as well we'll have all sorts of icon videos coming to you but right now we're gonna call it quits on this one I'm gonna go home and show you the gold houki let's have a really close look at this there's some of the black sands and here we go this is under the microscope mega magnification but look at that gold isn't that hardrock gold Purdy love how coarse and rough that stuff is you can see some of the pieces of quartz and some piece of black sand and magnetite and whatnot in there with it beautiful hardrock gold so I walked over to the canyon to sign off because well we need some beautiful scenery in this video as well as good gold I hope you all enjoy this if you liked watching this prospecting this gold mining I have hundreds of videos on YouTube check them all out if

There was as a\ncivilian Learjet-- NARRATOR: News of\na rogue Learjet, flying hundreds of\nmiles off course, has captivated the nation. PRESS SECRETARY: The FAA began\ntracking aircraft in distress. The president was made aware of\nthis situation, this morning, in a meeting with his\neconomic advisors. [PHONE RINGING]  Benzon, here. NARRATOR: Experts\nat the National Transportation Safety\nBoard are notified of the escalating emergency.  Get me a map. OK. ROBERT BENZON: Once the air\ntraffic control system realized that the aircraft had\ngone rogue, so to speak, the next step is to\ntry to figure out why. It's either being hijacked\nor else has malfunctioned, the crew has been\nincapacitated somehow. NARRATOR: Controllers scramble\nF-16 fighters to track down the wayward Learjet. Jim Tidball has come up with\na rough calculation of where the plane will run out of fuel.  My best guess is South\nDakota, possibly North Dakota. I can't say more than that.  Let's hope he's right.  With any luck, they\nwon't hit anything. NARRATOR: In the air,\nthe F-16 pilots have caught up with the rogue plane. The windows of the aircraft\nprovide an ominous clue.  No movement and the\nwindow's covered in frost. NARRATOR: The Learjet\nis now a ghost plane.  Can we narrow down\nthe crash site anymore? NARRATOR: With no hope for\nthe passengers and crew, the only focus now is on where\nthe plane will come down. According to calculations,\nthe jet is almost out of fuel. At 10 minutes past\n12:00, it happens. The Learjet carrying Payne\nStewart and five other people is falling from the sky.  They're going down. They're going down.  Where's it going to hit? NARRATOR: The F-16\nattempts to follow, but the plane disappears\ninto the clouds. It drops below the radar.  [INAUDIBLE],, I've\ngot a crash site.

snow burning videos where the snow turns black when you burn it and i wanted to try it myself because what better way to see if something's true or not than by doing it yourself so i've got this cup here we're going to use it to collect some snow that hasn't been disturbed actually so we're gonna go right here get the way get the top off grab some got a bunch i'm gonna keep it in view so you guys can see that i'm not doing anything to it we're gonna take it into my room i have to open the door so hold on okay now some facts about alaska snow is that alaska snow is very dry it's very cold um i don't know if that makes much of a difference but they say it's the air in the snow that prevents it from melting according to the people disputing the videos on youtube about the snow dry snow would probably have more air in it than wet snow had to open the door and if that's the case in this snow should definitely melt slower if air makes it melt slower so excuse the mess behind all this um here's the lighter we're going to use to see if the snow turns black now first we're not going to change it we're not going to put it into a ball or an ice cube or anything like that we're just going to try and uh melt it and see if it turns black like the snow on the other videos so here we go let me kind of get into focus as you can see the snow is not turning black but it is melting and it's melting very quickly no blackness i don't smell anything but i'm not directly over the lighter i don't smell any chemicals it doesn't smell like anything okay so there we go snow is melting there's no there's no blackness that's just shadow from the water shadow okay so what they did in the videos is they made snowballs so i'm gonna try and make a snowball alaska snow is really hard to make a snowball with i know my hands are ugly because they're freezing cold okay so there's our snowball there's our mess you also get to see how fast the snow melts it's probably 70 something degrees in my room so let's melt this and see what happens as you can see there's no there's no black like on the videos of the snow down south nothing and the snow's melting it's it's definitely melting it's leaving water uh it's not really i don't i can't tell this dripping i have to hold this camera so i can't hold the snowball but it's melting as you can see it's just melting as is the snow on my table now i guess as far as air goes there's not really a runoff i guess the snow is absorbing its own water but still it's not turning black not once has it turned black at all and you can see that it's melting i'm about to run out of battery so i don't know if it's going to last until this snowball melts completely but we'll see nope i still don't smell anything weird there's nothing in the air i don't smell anything except for the lighter fluid my thumb is kind of hot what do you expect the snow's melting it's basically gone drastic change no black at all snowman desk has melted as you can see it's melting turning to slush keep on melting the snow i don't see any blackness i don't know why the snow down south turns black i'm not saying that it does have chemicals in it and i'm not saying that it doesn't but it's definitely not like the snow here in alaska so you guys can look at this and you can determine what it means to you but i just got this snow from outside and it's normal look at there's a huge difference there's water everywhere and i have a big mess so you go no black nothing nada so i don't know what that means guys but like i said it's definitely not like the snow that are on those other youtube videos so challenge done you figure it out", "fLA9Vark-TI": "this is nature at its most cruel and weird in Australia Bren askwith has just squirted this spider

inside the spider the one bursting out of the spider belongs to the nematode family it's called Amer Mithun and it's a type of endo parasite a parasite that lives inside another creatures body so yes before disgustingly bursting out of the spider this creature was disgustingly eating the spiders insides would gets inside the spider when the spider either eats the worm eggs or eats some other animal but it's eaten with the worm eggs the eggs then hatch inside the spider and the worm begins to feed these parasites don't just eat indiscriminately they eat in a very specific order keeping the spider alive as long as possible this will carry on for anywhere between 7 days and 3 months and the spider starts to show the effects of this it will become slow and sluggish lose its appetite and eventually near the end it will start drinking a lot of water this makes sense because the parasite wants the spider to keep going to the water because the parasites going to lay its eggs in the water in the case of the spider it was sprayed with bug spray so the spider died and so the worm had to emerge early spot is not the only animals that suffer from these kind of endoparasites is a whole

And you\u2019ve more than likely experienced\na chem addiction, which can be frustrating because of the negative aspects of going through\nwithdrawal. But what if you wanted to experience all the\npain. Can You Beat Fallout 4 While Addicted To Every\nChem In The Game? Because every SPECIAL stat would be affected\nwhen experiencing withdrawal from a dozen different substances at once, I named myself\nDoug the Drug Slug, set every SPECIAL Stat to 4, and raced to the Vault. Now that the end of the world is upon us,\nI can explain a little about this run. The thing about it is, there\u2019s no real way\nto do it without console commands. The point is to be addicted to everything\nfor as long as possible. You could scavenge the world for chems and\nalcohol, but how are you gonna get them? If you find a location you\u2019ll get experience,\nbut Intelligence determines the number of experience points you get for everything and\nIntelligence would be impacted by the addiction, you\u2019d be getting too many experience points. And that applies to the rest as well, Endurance\nfor taking damage, Agility for sprinting, I could go on and on. For that reason, and because adding the addiction\nvia a console command doesn\u2019t work properly, I know, I tried, I went with the foolproof\noption that involves cheating. After escaping Vault 111 without attacking\nany of the Radroaches, I\u2019ll get to why in a minute, I used a console command to give\nme 100 of every chem that gives a different addiction. Including all the various types of alcohol,\nthere are at least 25 different chems in Fallout 4, but there are only 12 kinds of addictions\nyou can get. Jet, Ultra Jet, and Jet Fuel all give you\nthe same Jet addiction, there\u2019s no reason to use them all. So, I went through every chem, used enough\nto become addicted to them all, the amount varied from chem to chem, I drank all the\nvodka to be as true to life as possible, then, because I\u2019m a ing maniac, I used the rest\nof all the other chems as well. No real reason to, it was a waste of time,\nbut I still clicked the mouse at least 1000 times just to say I used them all. Then, to remove all benefits of the chems,\nsuch as increased Strength from Buffout, I used another command to speed up the game\nuntil all the good parts of the chems had drained from orifices. After becoming addicted to everything in the\ngame, these are the negative side effects I\u2019m dealing with. SPECIAL Stats are at 1 or 2 which really sucks,\nbut the big ing problem is the -20 Damage Resistance. Now, here\u2019s where everything\u2019s gonna get\ncrazy. I didn\u2019t think this idea was interesting\nenough on it\u2019s own, which is why I added another challenge on top of the addiction\nthing. I thought for a while about what to do. Maybe only use a Gamma Gun, Intelligence being\nso low would lock you out of the perks that increase radiation damage. Or maybe use the Broadsider, a portable cannon\nwould be fun. In the end, I went with a.. not great option. Some of you are gonna hate me for this\u2026 Creation Club Weapons and Armor only. Yeah, that\u2019s what I did. Now, of course, to get a lot of those items,\nyou\u2019ve gotta break out your parent\u2019s credit card and spend $40. Then you become irrationally frustrated when\nyou see that almost everything it obtained by completing a quest. I, because I\u2019m stupid and didn\u2019t read\nanything before blindly making a purchase, assumed it would be like the DLC weapons in\nNew Vegas, you\u2019d start with them. Nope. You do at least start with the Doom Marine\narmor which is stupidly strong for someone at level 1. And because of that, I cranked the difficulty\nup to Very Hard and set off for Fens Way station to track down what remains of Wally Mack. This quest would net me a Classic 10mm Pistol,\na Tunnel Snakes outfit, and a legendary 10mm Pistol. That is, if you can get into the station without\nbeing nagasaki\u2019d by green suicidal monster or torn apart by bullets fired from their\nfriends. Turns out that even the Doom armor isn\u2019t\nenough to offset the issues stemming from Endurance being at 1, Damage Resistance being\naround the same level as my IQ, the game being set on Very Hard. But I was determined. Like an uncomfortable social situation, if\nI can\u2019t handle the topic, I\u2019ll just run away. Remember what I said about \u201cCreation Club\nWeapon Only\u201d, well, that idea didn\u2019t last as long as I would\u2019ve liked. I had to kill the BloatFlies and Ghouls inside\nthe Fens Way station to get deeper inside to find Wally Mack. I say \u201chad\u201d, but looking back, I could\u2019ve\nran past them until I found a Classic 10mm Pistol, there were a few of them out and about,\nbut I didn\u2019t do that. I\u2019d use what I had on me to complete the\nquest. Then I found a Classic Pistol and used it. Now completing that quest, oh my goodness\nwhat nightmare that was. Wally Mack might\u2019ve been the toughest thing\nI\u2019ve faced in a Fallout game since William Black in the Nuka World video. Th Classic 10mm Pistol that did 28 damage\nper shot did ing nothing against Wally. And he was so powerful that he killed me in\none hit when I had like 40% of my health left. And then I saw that he could open doors, which\ncrushed my idea of doing the world\u2019s greatest knock-knock joke where I open the door and\nblast his ing skull with a shotgun. Even after I shifted the difficulty setting\nto Very Easy, Wally Mack was still by no stretch of the imagination a pushover. But upon dying, he dropped Ultimatum, a unique\nClassic 10mm Pistol that does 50 points of Radiation damage on top of the 28 damage from\nthe bullet part of the bullet. Finally, I had some proper weapons and armor\nand the real Fallout 4 could begin. I set the game to Normal, the pony had left\nthe station (I don\u2019t think I used that right), and spent like 15 theoretical minutes of thinking\nabout what to do next. I figured the safest course of action was\nto head to the closest Creation Club quest, which happened to be the one offering up a\ntriplet set of Alien weapons. I got distracted by helping out Paladin Danse\ndefend his daddy\u2019s land and expunging a brainwashed stain on the community, did you\nnotice what I did there? I used Missile Launcher. Nevermind where I got it, I killed a weirdo\nfor it. The Missile Launcher isn\u2019t a Creation Club\nweapon, so why\u2019d I use it? I actually don\u2019t know. Let me just say it this way, I wasn\u2019t exactly\nall there in the head when I started this. And it wasn\u2019t alcohol, if that tells you\nanything. I was more absorbed into the screen than I\nwould\u2019ve been otherwise and that clouded my vision. Not long after dealing with the Cultists and\nspending multiple lives and limbs on this one Raider Survivalist, I decided to ignore\nthe Creation Club Only part of this challenge. I pretty much wasted $40 on Bethesda Bucks\nto buy things I would\u2019ve never in a million years purchase without doing it as some part\nof a challenge. I wanted another Creation Club item to somewhat\nmake it worth it, so I entered Hubris Comics next and this was the closest Fallout 4\u2019s\never come to being a survival horror game. At least a dozen Feral Ghouls that do staggering\namounts of damage and only about 20 shotgun shells left. Time consuming as stressful as hell, but at\nleast I got to receive some of that stress on this legendary Ghoul who\u2019s kneecaps I\nstored some buckshot in. From there I realized that quest wasn\u2019t\nover and the effort on my part wouldn\u2019t be worth the Skyrim Sword and Helmet I\u2019d\nget from it, so I left the comic shop, arrived at Diamond City, broke down some garbage back\nat home to upgrade my weapons a bit, used the Alien Blaster to eradicate a family of\nGunners, and got the mother of all armors: the\u2026 uh, large eastern hemisphere country\nprominent in the Fallout universe Stealth Armor, see I didn\u2019t say it, Mickey please\nput the gun down. With the armor that let me become Danny Phantom\nupon crouching down, I returned to Sanctuary to power-level myself a bit by once again\ncreating the world of fences, bought items from Arturo, and ventured out to Gunners Plaza\nto get my hands on one more weapon: a real deal Gauss Rifle. And to put the Stealth Armor to the test. It\u2019s pretty good. It\u2019s certainly no replacement for a Stealth\nBoy, but it\u2019s solid as actual armor and does help you remain hidden provided you\u2019re\nfar away enough from whatever\u2019s trying to turn your head into a stepped on jelly donut. With the latest addition to my collection,\nI was ready to get the location of Nick Valentine from Ellie in Diamond City\u2019s Home For Disheveled\nSynths, enter Park Street Station, and lay waste to the Triggermen inside. Thanks to a few perks I\u2019d obtained as a\nparting gift from the fences, I was now finding more ammo in containers and pistols did 40%\nmore damage which, along with a difficulty setting of probably Normal, made the Triggermen\na threat if they landed their shots on you, but very dead if you kill them first. Dino died, Nick was rescued, more Triggermen\nwere killed, and I used Jet and Psycho to get the upper hand on Skinny Malone and his\non-fire friends. The big upside to being addicted to everything\nis that you can use drugs without consequence. After the positive effects wear off, you\u2019re\nback where you started. The Stealth Suit and this being a Bethesda\ngame made it easy to pick the key to Kellogg\u2019s house out of the Mayor, find some clues, show\nthem to blue, and be off to Fort Hagen. The synths inside were more of a threat than\nthey usually are, you can\u2019t just ignore them for a second while you loot a body or\nanything like that. The Striders especially had to be dealt with\nboth carefully and with a big ing gun. As for Kellogg, I wasn\u2019t taking any chances. I laid down half a dozen of my explosive babies\nto sacrifice, bopped Kellogg on the noodle with a bullet, put his Synths to sleep, got\nthe sentient worm crawling around in the McDonald\u2019s Play Place inside his head, entered his memories\nfor myself, and began heading for Virgil in the Glowing Sea. The -20 Damage Resistance showed itself once\nmore with the Bloatflies that harassed me in Radiation Land. But on the plus side, the quest to get the\nBFG9000 is on the way to your objective. I blasted Mercy with a triple charged Gauss\nRifle shot, obtained the BFG, and tested it on a Deathclaw. I guess the Fat Man being better makes sense,\nBethesda wouldn\u2019t want to suggest that something from an outside universe is better than something\nthat exists in Fallout, but this is complete nonsense, the BFG can kill any non-boss Demon\nin Doom with a single shot. The Fat Man is a cap gun by comparison. Rant aside, Virgil instructed me to track\ndown a Courser in Greentech Geriatrics. The Gunners inside were even worse than the\nSynths. A pair of Gunners is more than enough to overpower\nyou to the point of unconsciousness, this is a kids game nobody dies. That guy\u2019s head is fine (1:31:00). On the Courser, I noticed that the BFG does\nhave a significant advantage over the Fat Man, you can fire it much faster even if it\ndoes take up like 1/3 of your screen when you fire it. Doctor Amari, unable to decode the Courser\nChip, told me to track down the Railroad. I tracked them down alright, then I exterminated\nthem. My Charisma skill was far too low to pass\nthe check and I didn\u2019t feel like doing the Switchboard quest, so I just killed them all\nand decoded the Chip myself. Virgil scribbled his autograph down on a bed\nsheet for me, and I entered Concord to rescue Preston and his stupid friends. I waited to do this now for a very specific\nreason, I forgot about it. I was going to do it earlier but I got caught\nup in other things, but that actually worked out in my favor. For one thing, the Raiders inside are the\nweakest and most pathetic wanna-be group of murderers you\u2019ll find anywhere outside of\nmy apartment. The 2nd thing is that the Brotherhood of Steel\nhave long since arrived in the Commonwealth, and Concord is one of the places they\u2019ll\npatrol. There are 2 Brotherhood Knights and a handful\nof lower level peasants out and about, ready to take on the Deathclaw. I couldn\u2019t grab the mini-gun, though, even\nwith the Power Armor. I\u2019ve never been that weak and flaccid in\nmy life, kinda embarrassing. It\u2019s a shame I\u2019ve got some amount of self\nrespect and won\u2019t promote so-called \u201cmedicine\u201d from quack doctors for a few thousand dollars. This was the perfect opportunity for a segue\nto an ad. Back in Sanctuary, I finally emptied my pockets\nof room temperature tomatoes, those have been in there since that Commie Wacker video. If there\u2019s anything I\u2019m willing to feed\nto Mama Murphy, it\u2019s year old balls of mold. I went ahead and cleared out Corvega Assembly\nPlant for a settlement to get the Minutemen to build the Transporter. The Brotherhood would require me to go to\nArc-Jet and wipe out the Super Mutants at Fort Strong before they help me and the Railroad\nare dead, as they should be. Before too long, I was inside the Institute\nand something weird happened. At some point in previous adventures I turned\nmyself into a woman, which would explain the feminine frame, but I just attributed that\nto the armor. If you\u2019re wondering how I didn\u2019t hear\nthe womanly moans as bullets ripped through her body on multiple occasions, it\u2019s because\nI could hear nothing from this game, I was listening to other things, mainly YouTubers\ncomplaining about other YouTubers being upset with one reviewer disagreeing with another\none regarding one little detail of The Last of Us 2. What they were upset about specifically is\nthat this logo on the official Naughty Dog Twitter is not centered properly, the word\n\u201cThe\u201d should be to the left. For once, I agree with the gamers on this\none. This is lazy game design at it\u2019s worst. You don\u2019t see this kind of amateurish garbage\nin Meow Motors. Back in the game, I decided to side with the\nInstitute. The Brotherhood is boring and the Minutemen,\nI don\u2019t remember who I sided with last time but I think it was them. And the Railroad are still dead. In the middle of meeting the various Institute\nleaders, I snagged Virgil\u2019s syrum after leaving a wall of triggered explosives for\nthe Assaultron guarding the thing, returned it to Virgil, met up with X6-88 to secure\nthe rogue synth at Libertalia. Aside from the two times I got close range\npower ed by a Fat Man, it wasn\u2019t anything extraordinarily difficult. The next task was to intercept a third of\na bakers dozen of synths being held for relocation beneath Bunker Hill. This is probably the kind of gameplay the\naverage gamer would be after in Fallout 4, at least with my handgun. Railroad Heavies take a considerable amount\nof bullets to kill and can send your mind into the nether if you\u2019re not careful. The BFG9000 turned out to be the kind of super-powered\nenergy weapon you shouldn\u2019t play with in the house unless you want to vaporize all\nyour siblings. The Synths were safely decommissioned for\nbrutal reprogramming as punishment for escaping the life that was forced upon them by people\nplaying God, I handled all the remaining enemy forces who were playing possum outside, met\nFather on the rooftop of CIT Ruins, attended the Directorate meeting, he announced that\nhe\u2019s finally dying, and Mass Fusion began. Then I accidentally killed myself and had\nso sit through the meeting again, my bemusement was expressed in-game, Allie and I teleported\nto Mass Fusion, and I hated everything about this. If I wasn\u2019t so stubborn, I\u2019d have knocked\nthe difficulty back down to Normal from Hard, but I was determined to do this right. The Brotherhood Knights live up to the impressiveness\nof their name. It took a combination of the BFG and Alien\nAtomatizer to take down one of them. Even the Scribe Initiates and Aspirants were\nnothing to sneeze at as loudly as you possibly can. Had it not been for the Stealth Armor and\nthe Stealth Boys I had, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to get through this quest on Hard\nwhile still being addicted to everything in the world. The trio of Brotherhood soldiers attacking\nyou as soon as the elevator stops plummeting are easily capable of killing you in a matter\nof seconds. They\u2019re so powerful that the act of running\nfrom a doorway to the elevator is enough time for them to kill you from across the room. Stimpaks didn\u2019t heal enough at this point\nin the game. Luckily, I had a few Nuka-Cola Quantums that\nheel 400 hit points each. Chug one and your entire body will be so numb\nthat you can withstand some pain for a few seconds while it heals you. As for the robots in the lab, I planned for\nthem as best I could. I left both a Cryo Mine and a Fragmentation\nMine on the porch of each Assaultron, retrieved the Beryllium Agitator, and used the BFG to\nquickly drain most of the health from the Sentry Bot before finishing it off with the\nUltimatum. The Assaultrons lost about 1/3 their health\nfrom the mines and were capable of withstanding multiple shots from the BFG just like their\nwheelchair elephant man cousin did moments ago. The Gauss Rifle triple shot, some luck, and\nhiding behind an object to block their path carried me through the battle, I returned\nto Father, stocked up Charisma enhancing clothing from Diamond City, lured the Gunners outside\nthe house to the nearby Robot farm to let them fight it out. The Gunners unsurprisingly came out on top,\nI dispatched of them, convinced the lunatic locked in the bathroom to join the Institute,\nsent my final warning to Big Bird to stop ing with my deliveries, installed the thing\nin the radiation thing, met with the Directorate, and the end of the line began. Actually it just finished but the end of the\ngame is beginning. The assault on the Brotherhood of Steel\u2019s\nairport is at hand. Before that, I had a few stops to make. The first was Sanctuary to add a Suppressor\nto my 10mm Pistol and a better receiver on the sniper rifle that I hadn\u2019t used because\nit doesn\u2019t have three perks that make it do 60% more damage like the Ultimatum does. Then I went ahead and checked back on Virgil\nto whom I\u2019d give the serum some time ago, thinking he would reward me with a gun, because\nhe does, but only if you kill him or steal it. I didn\u2019t do that. Instead, I returned to the Airport via fast-travel,\nwas annihilated in record time, traveled to a nearby location instead, pressed sneakily\ntowards the Airport and managed to go from Hidden and invisible to detected and in-danger\nin a matter of seconds. Let me tell you, this was horrible. The game setting and firepower of the Brotherhood\nmade a frontal assault a pipe dream, even a Fat Man didn\u2019t kill the Brotherhood Knight\nin one shot which was unfortunate as it was my last nuke. I had to use a Stealth Boy to sneak around\nthe outskirts of the building, approach the base under their noses, then run for my life\ninside the airport and quickly deal with the Soldiers inside. I chucked a grenade at one of the generators,\nhad to use another Nuka Cola Quantum to survive the run to the elevator to reach and destroy\nthe 2nd generator, took out the third with a rifle, and retreated towards Liberty Prime. All three Synth Relay Grenades were deployed\nat once and I instantly got killed by Knight Cripple then lost progress from a lack of\nsaving and, despite all the patience in the smallest world possible, I set the difficulty\nto Normal. All the Knights and other nonsense were just\ntoo much for me to handle. I didn\u2019t want to deal with it. The synths did their job and protected me\nand the virus while it injected itself into Liberty Prime, Ingram was sent to the wheelchair\naccessible apartment complex in the sky, I used every high powered weapon at my disposal\nto reign down hell from the sky on all the Brotherhood forces attempting to stop me,\nswitched over to the Missile Launcher for convenience not long later, the Virus successfully\nhijacked Liberty Prime, in my blind firing of explosive weapons I took out one too many\nSynths and they all became hostile, I got teleported to safety, watched the blimp crash\ninto the airport, watched my father die, and I beat Fallout 4 While Addicted To Every Chem\nin the game.", "eJXL0IrbtqE": "In this video we are going to look at exothermic and endothermic reactions. So what are they [how] are they different? What about their energy levels in the next couple of minutes you'll know everything you need to get started An exothermic reaction gives off energy to the [surroundings] like this fire giving off heat Whereas an endothermic reaction takes in energy from its surroundings like this pool melting snowman taking in the heat just remember Exo means external so giving out an Endo means internal so taking in let's start by having a quick look Because exothermic reactions transfer energy to the surroundings, [and] this energy is usually heat energy They cause the surroundings to heat up. Just like a bonfire keeping everyone warm Other examples of exothermic reactions are the neutralization reactions between acids and alkalis? the reactions between water and calcium oxide and respiration It is easy to detect exothermic reactions. Just get your thermometer and see if the temperature increases Watch the hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide solution being mixed and see how the fellow meter increases most chemical reactions are exothermic Because heat is given our physical processes can also be endothermic or exothermic When something freezes it goes from liquid to solid Bonds need to be made for this to happen and to make bonds you need to do some work Thus energy is given out and freezing is exothermic Similarly when condensation happens because a gas is going to liquid Again [bonds] need to be made and so energy is given out so freezing and condensation are both exothermic Because in exothermic reactions energy is given out [to] the surroundings This means that energy of the reactants is higher and the energy of [the] products hence the energy curve For the exothermic reactions will look like this now [let's] have a look at endothermic reactions. These are less common Remember that endothermic reactions take in energy from the surroundings Again as with exothermic reactions the energy being transferred is usually [heat] So in endothermic reactions the surroundings usually get colder Again, we can detect endothermic reactions with a thermometer because the temperature would get colder some examples of endothermic reactions are electrolysis the reaction between sodium Carbonate and ethanoic acid and photosynthesis Endothermic reactions can also be seen in physical processes where something melts it goes from a solid to a liquid For this to happen bonds need to be broken and to break bonds energy to be put in like our melting snowman Boiling is also endothermic because energy needs to be put in to break the bonds for the liquid to turn to gas because in endothermic reactions energy is added to the reaction the energy of the products is higher than the energy of the reactants and So the energy curve looks like this, so there you have exothermic and endothermic reactions all you need to remember is that exothermic reactions give out energy and endothermic reactions take in energy both can be detected with a thermometer in Exothermic reactions the surroundings get hotter and in endothermic reactions the surroundings get colder exothermic reactions start with more energy and end with less while endothermic reactions start with less energy and end with more Freezing and condensation are exothermic because bonds need to be made which gives out energy Melting and boiling are endothermic because bonds are broken which requires additional energy think of the [snowman] again and finally Exothermic reactions are more common", "8iyu7OwnxR8": "FUEL FROM THE TRUCK LEAKED INTO THE ROADSIDE SEWERS.
