review and I've got Josh the owner of coach masters here to talk all about it and how you can even win your own Awards and what judges look for alright let's check it out today we're really excited to bring you an award-winning live rosin from cush masters in Boulder Colorado this punch-drunk is a nice combination of Bermuda punch and Mac otherwise known as miracle alien cookies - phenomenal strains that they blended together in the lab to make an entirely better creation it took home first place at the Brewster's 7/10 showdown this year and when you open the jar you can immediately tell why it caught the judges attention fruit all kinds of terpenes that are really evocative of a fruit market in South America come at you it's almost hard to tell which ones you're smelling because it's a mixture of pineapple paya maybe even watermelon looking at the consistency it's this gorgeous shiny butter mixed with sugar and you can tell that the terpenes have even started to separate ever so slightly at room temperature this strain isn't the highest in potency testing at around 74 percent THC but that's okay because it more than makes up for it and the smell and the aromas and the flavors that come along with it which we would argue are more important in most cases anyway hey everyone welcome back to solvent let's review this is Eric today we've got a really special episode got Josh from cush masters and some award-winning live rosin just to come first place at the rooster show down in the category so super excited Josh thanks for coming on the show yeah thanks for having me it's a awesome here yeah I tell me a little bit about cush masters so cush masters was a bridge anole founded in 2015 we did contract processing for you know quite a few different people in the industry and all within Colorado and then we expanded our brand outreach around 2017 and you know we're focused on connoisseur extracts and making sure that people are outputting the best quality inputs and outputs for you know come overall concentrates because it's a huge new part of and wave of the industry so we wanted to make sure that people were properly educated as they Deb as they consume as well as make sure it's some good stuff nice so you guys have been at this a little while how long have you guys been making browsing for we've been making rosin since about 2015 yeah so just so everyone knows Josh is also one of the co-owners here at pure pressure and one of the people responsible for really seeing big-time value in solvent lists a long time ago when people were making it with hair straighteners and really josh was the one that came up with the idea of how do I come up with a better press so that I can make this more viable so yeah I mean coach masters was born and you know we found and definitely a necessary need in the market for a high quality you know versatile rosin press you know what we were using just wasn't cutting it and we wanted to make sure that we could put out the best concentrates you know the same way that you know starting material creates quality extracts you know it also comes down to the machinery and the repeatability of that machinery and so you know went out and you know built the press and you know peer pressure is what it is today which is a huge blessing and it's great you know it's amazing to see everybody utilizing that technology and you know it's only getting better yeah so tell everyone a little bit about what goes into making award-winning rosin so the strain we've got today is punch-drunk which is a cross between Mac and Bermuda punch and what is Mac stand for Mac is just a strain that was bred and is it miracle alien cookies is that what we're calling cookies yeah well yeah so tell everyone a little bit more about the strain and kind of what went into this yeah so I mean both strains you know we're grown separately as their own strain and what we ended up doing they each have their own unique profile so you know each their own terpene profile their own you know necessarily bud structure features that type of stuff and trichome head structures which all take into account when you're utilizing and going in for water extraction okay because that was the first process of getting this final product right here mmm that we're about to consume here shortly so that was obviously ice water hash washed pressed when you guys were doing this is this a cross between one strain that's the punch-drunk or is it two strains have been blended together purposefully it was two strains that were blended together you know purposefully okay I'm within the Brent within the lab itself okay so they were grown separately uh-huh and then we decided the two profiles uh would create an amazing you know over what we hoped would be an amazing you know extract you know sometimes they're hit and miss you know sometimes it's harder to sell concentrate when it's a blend like that so you really have to be careful on how you mix these terpene profiles and you know don't make a flavor or something like that that somebody won't enjoy sure okay so there's there's there's some risk involved that's when you're taking a blended we're these strains wash together yes okay so you put it all together washed it and then pressed it because I've definitely heard of some companies and places where they'll wash one or the other and then they'll actually mix the heads after they've been dried but you is there a reason that you prefer that method because it's all you know one cohesive product within the bubble hash itself okay you know when you end up working with bubble hash and depending if you're in a cold room or not you know you end up getting you know those greasy patties bubble hashed a little bit harder to work with so when you have those two flavor profiles within that bud form and it's also where you're gonna have your highest terpene within those genetics itself so you know that's gonna come out in your flavors and stuff you know some are gonna be more dominant than others which is also why you got to be very careful on which ones you mix together got it so for example probably some of the gas your OGS are gonna really overpower certain blends for example exactly okay you know like even on the fruity side as well you know you're gonna end up with certain like tangerines and stuff like that to just overpower everything within extracts so your clementines and your tangerine they're gonna take over that you're making absolutely so another question I know that probably a lot of people watching are really interested in hearing about is when you're picking strains to wash well ones that are really gonna dump and be worth the time and energy to do it can you tell ahead of time like how do you know what's gonna work do you test it like what's your process there yeah I mean that's one of the you know common ash questions I think within the industry and it's you know a very challenging part of deciding on what material to choose from mm-hmm is working with the right growers I'm working with people who are open to feedback and not stuck in their ways I'll start in the garden right yes yeah definitely start in the garden you have to have a good product to work with okay and so really developing those relationships and making sure not only are they handling the products properly while they're growing it so they're not damaging the heads but also well they're packaging it up for delivery to you you know take for an example you know you just cropped all your buds and you're going into freeze them well you have a bunch of bagged stacked on top of each other that aren't necessarily frozen yet so you're gonna wait think about what that's doing to a trichome head you know it's just extremely delicate very delicate right you touch a trichome head usually you know it will explode all right yeah cool so super super interesting stuff when it comes down to actually making something that wins an award like this I mean what goes into that what are the judges looking for and in your experience having entered a couple cups and competitions and having won awards across a couple categories yeah what advice can you give for other people out there who are trying to win their own hardware here yeah I mean I think knowing your competition is really important looking at past competition sure results are also very important looking at those profiles of those strains that have won past Awards within those categories within that award so knowing what the judge is won mm-hmm and you know some competitions allow you to enter more than one per category yeah and so what that allows you to do you know normally if we enter a you know let's just say the 7 10 showdown for example which is the one that we won right here um we were allowed to enter up to 3 into whatever category we wanted we entered one into you know some of the stuff and then we entered 2 into some of the categories as well okay what are some other categories you guys are working with um just tool it around which we took first home first place home as well nice you know we did pens ok those live rosin fans of those live resin pen who live resin panel yeah and then some disposable live resin pens you know just both types of hardware okay and then we also entered wax shatter and crystalline which is diamonds so it sounds like it's probably not a bad idea to enter as many categories as your lab is able to if possible absolutely I mean your material and your products also got to be there um you know you don't want to enter something you don't think you have a valid chance of winning you know because they are very costly as well to you know be entering multiple things into multiple categories which is why we normally stay to one entry but if it's a category that you never know what the judges could be looking for or it's a newer category let's say for example rosin you know you can go with like you know like you're saying earlier the more oh gee you know dominant you know and that judge panel might be you know more of a G type of flavor profiles or the more that fruity type of profile so it gives you kind of wide range to fall within the category of the judges as well gotcha so you guys entered more than one into the Robin category is that we're saying yes we entered two into the rosin category for this strain specifically since this is what we're reviewing today the punch-drunk but if you could guess what why do you think that this one one what about this strain you know before we sample it here in a second like what's special about punch-drunk you know ever since it came out of the machine I mean even all you just knew it it was a beautiful color the clarity the smell in aroma that we are achieving off of that rosin even as its sat in the jars changing consistencies we you know just everybody in the lab kind of gradually went to it it was kind of like a natural thing and like you know we have our solvent list room which is you know separated but you know obviously with high terpenes and rosin extraction and stuff like that you can you know smell them through the doors sometimes yeah and so people are coming in and solving this room the day that we were doing this extraction and you know obviously things like that get picked up by the techniques or the texts that are working that day right when we were talking about entering this competition it was a no-brainer for us this is the one that we thought would do it but we also entered more of an OG dominant profile as well so this one's definitely on the fruitier side yeah given given the name and cross that you're describing together okay cool so let's take a look at this obviously in the video you guys are already gonna check out some sweet macros also really like this package design school got some gold foil on it yeah that's nice thank you can I can tell why people are picking that up on the shelf yeah so here's our little glass jar I'm gonna take a little sniff here so yeah it's really strong yeah like surprisingly strong when you open it I've been to you know labs all over the place done a lot of this and and this one it's just I mean it'll stink up this entire room yeah absolutely no question you're like I'm really trying to dial in it's got you know definitely the tropical fruit I mean some people if I was gonna guess it be some kind of like banana II papaya sort of smell it's hard to nestle made this one so unique you know like knowing kids put their direct finger on it it hits so many different peoples you know wants in a concentrate which was really exciting to see and it was just off to smell alone which can also give you indications yeah of what ward winning concentrates and stuff that you know could be good as other products as well so extremely stable consistency this has been sitting out today for a little while at room temperature most of the time a lot of these strains are gonna be kept in a freezer or fridge during the day and then this however you can just tell that this is really buttery its sugared up just a tiny tiny bit it's almost glistening here in the jar I mean it kind of feels like somebody brought some giant fruit bowl into the room here that we're just smelling on set natural terpenes sweat even at room temperature you know that those terpenes start to rise and separate from the actual rosin itself you know and like I was saying earlier you know the jar itself was you know so potent within the lab that every chunk up the whole place it just stinks up the entire room I mean I can't even imagine we got a graham right here you know we're talking how much were you guys pressing at a time I mean we were pressing around 80 to 120 grams at a time so before we try it because I'm really fixing to I mean I don't know how much longer I can talk about this before we give this a shot but consistency is one of the biggest things when it comes to winning awards is what you've said in the past and what we've heard from some of our other brand allies and some of our other customers can you speak to the consistency aspect especially of rosin specifically and how that matters yeah so consistency in your final product is probably one of the most important things you know especially being a lab or somebody who isn't selling it directly to that customer being on the wholesale side of that equation you know what that does is it allows you to you know no matter who's grabbing that gram within the dispensary um you know it's that gonna end up staying that consistency so making sure that you know you manipulate your material in a way before it hits the shelves so that it stays that consistency whether you're going for shatter or wax or butter or sugar or you know micro diamonds you know some Jam tech like all of those different things and consistencies those are all done within the lab so making sure that as you give it to your packagers that you have a consistent product that you're selling as a consistent product it's nice and stable yeah it's ready to go it's not changing on it so that the judges and someone who is you know buying this off the shelf is you know they're they're getting what they're seeing on the Instagram absolutely you know and that's probably one of the most important things you know for me is being able to provide the industry a consistent product awesome so cush masters is located in Boulder Colorado proud to have them here in the state so we smoke out of a couple different things on one of our previous episodes with Roz and Ryan sometimes we've got a nail we've had episodes where we're putting honey on toast today we've got a puff coke what's setting are we gonna what what do you recommend I call it low for me anything that you're smoking I like to go at a lower temperature so half frozen in general nice low temp always yeah cuz you're gonna be able to get those terpene profiles better and you know if you burn terpenes too and you have too high of a terpene rich product you can actually you know full heart right harsh yeah so you know I really like to enjoy these high quality yeah it's almost like a fine wine right we're not having our dabs medium well today okay we're we're gonna do this proper so all right let's give it a shot you want to load me up absolutely cool [Music] that's strong what are the what are the potency results on this one um so this one we got the box right here so yeah take a peek Matt just like as I'm sitting here it that that fruit that I was smelling in the jar just kind of working its way back might not like toward the back of my tongue you know sometimes certain concentrates they have like a little bit of an after flavor but man with these premium hash robins but I mean super clean and you can tell you know no throat irritation whatsoever there I mean granted I'm not someone who's taken the world's biggest abs but that's one of the biggest things for me is just it's clean I'm not coughing my brains out right now you know I can actually sit here and really let this soak in and I can enjoy it and it's just like I mean that is just really tasty stuff I mean it feels like I'm down in Central America at a fruit stand trying to pick out what pineapple or banana or you know pie I'd like to have and that's the stuff you have to hit and those profiles that you really need to you know what it's like what sounds good to you you know and it's almost like that uh technicians you know responsibilities as materials coming in to identify identify and try and work through those rows in order to achieve those high yields those flavor profile combinations all of those things to create phenomenal concentrates yeah because sometimes you know and why sometimes we do do mixes is because for run size totals for lab optimization you know sometimes you know one girl only grew you know let's say 4,000 grams of this strain and so you know we have a eight thousand twelve thousand gram capacity per run frame we go bring them together if they fit together and they mesh to go there you know why not and you know stay at full optimization yeah so I mean the the sum of parts greater than the individuals here big-time especially for this one good stuff yeah I mean the profile there is just comes together so smooth and so elegantly and like the actual almost like fruit like flavor that it gives it's like you know almost like smoothie yeah so now that we've been sitting here for a minute and I'm starting to like really feel it this is a review after all this one's really nice I'm finding that it's really relaxing it's got a pretty calming quality you know it's gonna be a it's almost like a little bit of a head huh definitely definitely a little behind the eyes in this particular one I don't get that with a lot of strains yeah but it's not overwhelming you know I wear some head high as can be you know and like it's kind of just like step back in the couch you know beat still you know not I'm here I feel lucid exactly but I'm also a lot more relaxed and I was a couple minutes ago and you know that's what we really try and hit within you know concentrates because it is such a representation of the plant and what its capabilities are yeah and you know people out there gonna experience it different ways but I can see why the judges were really pumped up about this one it is it is pretty clear once you get a chance to try it absolutely absolutely you can find us you know pretty much you can go to coach masters calm we have a map on there you know few of our local stores you know throughout the Denver metro area you know pig and whistle Northern Lights you know star bud so check the website the website you know pretty much a good majority of Colorado stores and make sure to follow these guys on Instagram they got great content its cush dot masters is that right yep awesome very final thing for we wrap up our show here for the day the award that you won that was with the rooster right yeah is the rooster they have two competitions that they do for twenty and seven time yep the two kind of holidays of our industry and 710 being oil spelled backwards and 420 I mean who knows the real jet that came up but you know it's it's cool to see them embrace the industry and actually the companies within that industry it's really awesome to be able to do recognized for your hard work I feel like that is just unanimous in other industries that's the land here it brings a lot of legitimacy to the table check out coach masters if you're in Colorado they you can get tickets to the rooster events when they come around so make sure to give them a shout out they're really fun last one we went to a temple nightclub down in Denver we all had a great time so thanks for coming on the show thank you all right thanks for tuning in guys that was some really great product so to get more solvent list reviews make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel right here below check out the rest of the episodes and all of our great solving this videos thanks for tuning in yeah [Music]", "N3vDm9HXWOU": "welcome back to turkey eyes in today's episode we're going to be pressing one ounce of fresh frozen full plan ice water hash we get big yields using the directional flow method as well as show you how I butter the rosin after being pressed [Music] let's go over the items we're going to be using during this week's episode we're going to need parchment paper any brand will do I always go with the unbleached version pressing bags I ordered these online in a custom size to fit my pressing plates perfectly allowing me to maximize the amount that can be pressed at a single time as for micron science I go with the 37 micron because I mainly deal with ice water hash or teeth if you're going to be pressing flour but with ninety micron and I always remember to double bag your product a couple Dobb tools and a set of tweezers lastly obviously the material I'll be pressing you already know from the title we're going to be doing a single press of one ounce the material I'll be pressing is fresh frozen ice water hash this was from one of my previous grows it's a blend of green crack barber bud and Harley Quinn bx4 this is also material that's been freeze-dried I'll be doing a video shortly covering how I made the ice water hash and using my freeze dryer so be sure to hit that subscribe button you can notified when that gets posted as you can see the material is getting pretty sticky once it comes out of the fridge making it very difficult to talk the pressing baked properly [Music] using one of my job tools I packed though ice-water house down into the bag as evenly as possible my hand I give it a good pre-press evening out the material as best as I can at this point the ice water hash has already become warm and it's very sticky not allowing it to be moved around much in the bag [Music] for today's press we're going to be utilizing the directional flow method a benefit of using it is that it allows you to watch the flow during the press you can see the flow from start to finish allowing you to adjust the variables accordingly this becomes very helpful at all stages as you're about to see I forgot to double bag my material which resulted in my bag being unfolded squishing out the ice water hash out the one end this became noticeable immediately allowing me to stop the press right away unfortunately I forgot to record me collecting the material and just putting a second bag over the other [Music] [Music] I stopped the first pressed short not noticing the flow of the rosin still happening [Music] I then folded the pressing bag in half and did a second press giving additional amount of yield [Music] letting the freshly pressed live hash rasa sit for a few minutes allow it to cool carving the rosin eyelet cooler temperature helps with a collection of it using a long-handled dab tool makes the collection of the rosin very easy since the second press was very short I'm going to collect all the rosin together after collecting it all into one patty I like to put it into a glass jar it's process butters the rosin to texture I find more appealing [Music] I simply put the glass shard in between the two plates with the lid tightly screwed on and let it sit for about one hour at 150 degrees Fahrenheit then I open the jar stir the rose and whip it around mix it up place it back in between the plates I had a hundred degrees Fahrenheit for ten hours after the ten hours I collect the rosin out of the jar and place it into a storage container if you enjoyed this video don't forget to hit that like button [Music]", "kfmzOQLahqg": "[Music] and watch it [Music] what's up DD see Scott it real and gum a friend Levi from low temp plates on the line what's up brother man I'm doing good but you know me man first off Levi always supports a DGC was that the 7-10 concentration celebration appreciate your brother yeah absolutely thanks so much for having us out we we really love being there yeah yeah okay so Levi is gonna be my source I've talked it to naazy I've talked to a few people and you're gonna be my source for a freeze dryer or at least you're gonna be my information source right now because I'm a little bit confused what I'm thinking about is I got this greenhouse coming down count aloud 1015 pounds whatever the hell we get from it different strains and I want to make some something good out of them something a little bit better than just shatter I was thinking about the laws man I can't have 15 pounds right but I can take 15 pounds and wash it down to I don't know a few ounces or a half a pound or something like that that would be legally okay no yeah yeah correct yeah I mean as long as you're lifting your your your legal jurisdictions whatever local jurisdictions that you have yeah that can definitely help cut down your total weight now if I'm thinking about it because I am a little bit of a public figure if the cops were watching me and listening to what I said if I was blasting this all with butane is that technically illegal or am I able to do that yeah yeah by far technically illegal yeah okay okay so that's where the rosin press comes in so if I wanted to play by the rules I could press you press this match pressing twelve or fifteen pounds of flour seems a little ridiculous and I'm kind of setting you up for the softball because we don't press flour correct well so you can for a simplicity sake right it's you know for commercial operations is a very easy skewer to throw on on the shelves for home users who just shop at dispensaries it's really nice just because you can go grab some flour I'm from a hair straightener stepping on a hair straightener all the way up mm presses so oh yeah you can but it is quite a bit of work if you're talking 15 pounds or whatever it is then yes yeah yeah you would much prefer pressing the hash equivalent of that it's not alive too big big key to sink your pressing flour you're pressing dried cured flour not like fresh frozen flour so that's what I wanted to get into so the difference remaking shatter and making live or live rosin is that everything has to stay cold right everything has to be frozen so we're gonna harvest it wet we're gonna instantly freeze it and then we're going to wash it in and then once we freeze it we can take our time take out some you know half pound at a time wash it in bubble bags or a bubble machine and that's where I'm a little bit confused so I've got my sifted water hash that comes out of the bubble machine how do I keep that life yeah so the best thing that you can do is as soon as you've washed it is to you've got two options the old-school way would be to freeze it and then microplane it and what you're trying to achieve there is a long-term slow dry so that can range from four to about seven days within a humidity and temperature control room okay so you've got a microplane what you explained micro planning yeah so micro micro planning it would just be freezing the bubble hash that you take out of your bags right and then at when it's frozen you're taking essentially like a grater a sifter and you're sifting it up on to a lot of people use cardboard but what you're doing is that you're trying to break it up into small pieces so it can air dry over a slow period of time on within this time you know you do experience a little bit of oxidization right they start to see things get a little bit darker versus using a free char and that gets me into the second option which would be just slapping it in a freeze dryer and that process pretty much she you pull a deep freeze on the product ranging from you can adjust your times anywhere from about seven to ten hours and that matters seven to ten hours I mean I can't freeze it for a month so you you can't actually freeze it for however long you really wish okay but the the freezer ours they are a little and they're a little bit on the pricier side yeah so it's not something that I would want to run over a long term unless you have to you know so a more conventional freezer would be a little bit more suited if you want to freeze for freeze that hash specifically for you know 24 hours or a week or whatever it is before you can actually do your full freeze drying process all right then yeah that makes sense all right so we got to the where I've got the bubble and I'm putting it in the freeze dryer now so now I just I leave it for what a day a week yeah so you've got essentially two times that on the freeze dryer that are important to you there's there's a free cycle and a dry cycle so the first part of the freeze dryer is to deep freeze the entire product right so seven hours for most product is is plenty depending on what you want to do guy so let's say seven hours there and then there is a dry cycle at the end which there is a vacuum pump and it pulls vacuum on the chamber and then there are trays within the freeze dryer that warm up slightly to allow for the tip furnace for the moisture to evaporate out of the product out of your wet hash and then it pulls a vacuum and it cycles through that so and we're not talking about we're not talking about evaporation here this is sublimation we're going directly from liquid solid to a gas and going away and what evaporation is solid to the liquid gonna do it yes mmm-hmm interesting and it'll take chemistry yeah then so you're just opening up that drain valve and whatever moisture you collected that has been sucked into the they'll just drains out so that is the water from your from your hash all right so then the last step after and how long how long does it take to do that how long do I collect into the drive yeah the dry cycle is usually around 10 to 12 hours okay longer if you've got a large freeze dryer and you're burning it up with a ton of hash if you've got full trains yeah you can easily turn that into 24 hours or so okay okay so then I want to get to the last step because you've given me the whole process I really appreciate you taking the time to do this but the last step is we gotta press it in a rosin press and this is to make you know super high-quality live or awesome am I wrong is that the last step and we just immediately take it out of the freeze dryer and do that or how's that work correct so you know depending on what kind of micron bags you're using ranging from 70 to 90 maybe up to a hundred micron okay first it could actually be full milk so if that's what you prefer you can pull those those microns out for full no and those will typically it's only your first wash that they'll be that they'll be full milk but everything else it can be squished into inter hash frozen just like you mentioned and how many washes do you do out of a bubble teas and bubble bags and the bubble later mmm machine yeah it depends on how much agitation you're getting with with washing machines are getting quite a bit more agitation right 10 or 15 minutes and you can run up to about five washes if you want but at the end at those fourth and fifth maybe even six washes if you're just trying to get everything out they're gonna be the lower quality more contaminated product and you're gonna receive less yield per wash what I'm what type of yield like on a total throughout the six washes you do on like a half pound what type of yields would be looking at so pretty much what most people like to refer to is just to rosin percentage yield so let's say and this is all fresh frozen so good yields would be considered like three to five percent range to rosin off with fresh frozen weight so you just have to run the numbers off that so if it's no 1/2 sorry what was the numbers again just let's do two pounds max is that's 900 grams what can what do we get off that yeah so you do have to remember that's not that's fresh frozen right that's only obvious that's what all the water weight still in the cannabis cheese that's not it dried at all yet so we're gonna have to give all that away and because we'd be correct so yeah if you have two pounds of fresh frozen that would be 900 grams right and let's say you got back a really good yield it's the genetics are good certain really grown you did a good extraction on it let's say to rosin you get three percent yield on that okay so that would be 90 grams yeah it would actually be 27 see why I don't do math with mana right that's why you hold on to the money all right sure all right so 27 grams out of out of okay that's not a 2 pounds of fresh frozen I mean but 2 pounds of fresh frozen Jesus that's gotta be like a half pound to a third of a pound of dried flower yeah yeah approximately they say if I'm not mistaken it's somewhere around you lose about 80% of the weight if I didn't say it I was gonna yes somewhere around eighty percent of the total way around all right all right so I'm thinking this alright so here the reason we were bullshitting is because I'm like alright so if I do this what's my investment you know what's the ROI I just went and bought a gram at the dispensary for $55 for a gram of live resin or like yeah is even live resin not life awesome I do find the rosin have a little bit more flavor I dig them a little bit more I like the consistency too it's easier to dab but um so I'm just thinking if I'm buying $50.00 grams a gram really doesn't last all that long might be cool to have a year's worth of worth of a live rosin hey you got a separate fridge I did some quick math of that 80% water weight chair go away when you dry it right if you if you dried it to that dry weight that's 15 percent of the driveway well which is 15 percent return to live hash rosin that doesn't make sense 15 percent active ingredient on some really Bank bud and and the 85 percent is no material plant material yeah definitely makes sense yeah and I mean you'd be lucky to on a large scale to get that kind of return off of dry pressing flowers and it's not going to be nearly the same quality bubble hash rosin as a rule of thumb is significantly better and quality than flower roses agree with you more Sarah tried both and there's a huge difference yeah yeah exactly all right so come on help me out what's my investment here so I need a freeze dryer first off bubble bags and the bubble later you guys sell them so we actually just started carrying bulk bags okay yeah so we really like those just for the the Frenchy full mil full mesh bags okay I really like those and they've got washing machines as well yeah so what do I got a couple hundred maybe three hundred bucks and a washing machine or some bubble bags yeah yeah you could always depending on the size so you can get down to five gallon right right to about 42 gallon bags [ __ ] as bit larger it's more material so it gets quite a bit more expensive but all in all on bags you don't even need a machine if you don't want to right let me just go with a bucket I with a spoon man my buddy used to make the a locking gank with a wooden spoon brother yeah yeah so you can you can really kick it very primitively and it doesn't take a lot of money to get started it just as you start to scale and trying to do larger and larger amounts to become more efficient that's when it starts costing a little bit extra money sure so we got so we could just end it right there if you want to buy a bubble later bubble machine and some bags or even just some bags and use a five-gallon bucket and some ice you can make really good water hash that way I will tell you the more you beat it the lesser quality is so if you're really gentle with it you can make some dank dabba bull I don't know if it's full milk but it's close whatever is not full melt you can just throw in a hair straightener thrown or press right over you impress that so you could press press that now what if we just want to go there and say hey I'm going to invest a little bit of money for quality and buy a good rosin press help me out I see him for 400 bucks tell me what the difference is between that I don't you see you don't sell no $400 presses do um so so actually how we started our business was that that smaller range I go for three to five hundred dollars just with the cage kids the plate kids at the time everybody was stepping on hair straighteners and everybody was trying to figure out how to scale so they were using the t-shirt presses in there right and then you know just growing up in Kansas and and seeing a lot of these shop presses around I figured why not adapt one of these to a rosin press so that's essentially how we started and the more recently Lucius made the more commercial setups and and higher processing and higher quality systems which are which are the V twos as of currently and so yeah you've got pressure gauges external palms you can operate them through electric means air hand you know they're open source so you choose exactly how you want to apply your force nice yep all right so so if we got a rising press what's it gonna cost us man for a good one yeah for for kind of a beginners home user setup that you wanna you know something that's portable all american-made lifetime warranty I mean the thing is bulletproof it's you know it's gonna last you a lifetime sure how many times is that so up to 20 tons which is 40,000 pounds of force so more force than you ever need but it's nice to have in your back pocket if you ever you know stacking multiple chips and doing a final extraction right what do we press that what's what's the force we press it yeah for the the force for flowers you're looking anywhere from about 1,500 to 2,500 plate and PS I got and platon psi is something that that it takes a small equation to get there but the formulas on our website if you just want to check that out but yeah that's how it breaks down and then for hash awesome you're looking anywhere from 800 to up to 2500 plate psi again got it so it's overkill what you what you're giving them yeah for sure alright and so what's that running come on what's that run my friend prices yeah brother come on DBC price yeah so if you're just if you want to start off with our intro systems those start at 397 that just sticks on any press in your choice this is a really good home user setup but for the more you say press you can go to harbor you're saying like a harbor freight pump or whatever I don't understand what do you mean yes yes that's the actual Harbor Freight brain okay guys so the downside of those is that they're a little bit larger so you may want to set it up and in the garage if you set it up in your living room if you have a girlfriend or wife they're not gonna like it good all right next the exercise bike man you'll be fine I'm sad that's all right so all right so right wow so this is pretty cool so I got a few hundred bucks in the bowl bags for 400 bucks I can get a press so so you telling me a home press yep yep and then if you want to go with something that's a lot more portable you're about ten inches tall you can just throw a bottle jack in those and they're really portable so if you're if you're hopping around from buddies houses to sessions or whatever on it you know you can tote that around with you those start around $1,000 that's shipping and taxes include all right so I'm thinking abut for under a G if I wanted to be a starter for under a G I could start making my own rosin correct yeah yeah you can even make bubble hash rosin for the air thousand bucks yeah and then so here's the big jump man you know me man I always want to go high-end I said I don't always want to go high-end but in my cannabis I do so if I want to go live with then I've got to go with a freeze dryer right mm-hmm yeah yeah so the main advantages of the freeze dryer is to quickly dry your material right so it doesn't leave loose terpenes is that when you lose the terpenes absolutely so if you're just air drying within a room you're also beating the heads up whenever you're doing that aggressive sifting you know that the micro cleaning that I mentioned earlier right so yeah it's a it's just a much better process you're keeping it cold so hence the live rosin aspect your because all you're doing is freezing it and then and then just getting that moisture out pulling a vacuum so while it's cold never really exposed to heat and it's much quicker as well yeah all right but that's a big [ __ ] step up man we're talking another couple grand if I want to get in get into the live business right yeah I'm minimum minimum so the only company that that makes free strives for our industry is gonna be harvest right and they make products ranging from 2,000 up to about 8,000 to like that still is very very very cheap compared to all other freeze drivers on the market because they're like full-on lab great equipment is that what the deal is medical grade stuff it's yeah it's pharmaceutical grade stuffs at it you know most of those machines will start around $30,000 so harvest rights really fulfilled a nice niche in the market for people like us oh very cool very cool although starting a - jeez man damn yeah I get that I get that yeah by the way so what you we were talking about if you don't if you're just drying bubble hash or freeze drying bubble hash guru doesn't let me say drying he gets my own estate but if you just freeze trying to bubble hash you don't need a huge freeze dryer right Yeah right right and so pretty much you've got you've got three different sizes you've got the small the medium and a large been on for most people for most small grows you get away with a smaller a medium I how small is it small so the small is the actual sizes on this guy so it's around a hundred and ten pounds and you can fit approximately two to three wet pounds of bubble hash inside of it no sweat that's a [ __ ] shitload man yeah yeah I mean that dries down to two to a portion of that sure but still yeah I mean that'll fit quite a bit you know that's full trays right yeah you can never make it work all right that soon what seems legit man it seems like okay I'm gonna figure for a solution for a home solution two grand three grants I've got about 3,500 bucks if I want to be in the live business no correct yeah I mean of course you can always hair dry right but yeah you're going to lose the live aspect of the of the rosin but don't make me get my calculator out but if fifty dollars a gram a bit guru could do this one is hit but at fifty dollars a gram how long has it taken it what do you got sixty sixty grams in order to recover that ROI if you're paying fifty dollars a gram at a dispensary you make 60 grams of live live rosin a it's great it be I've got five or six different strains in there and and B I cover my three grant you know I guess a three grand investment you could cover with three grand you don't have to spend in the dispensary anymore what sort of bet you I would spend it you know a couple hundred bucks go to that dispenser every couple weeks man yeah yeah yeah and it makes sense for for home growers for quite a few home growers if you are a heavy smoker or if you're supplying your friends and family that kind of definitely helps yeah definitely if you steal your buddies live rosin and tell them that you'll pay him back yeah yeah I guess still gurus live rosin for the air you know it becomes a prop at that point I love it I love it it cool man all right so I figured some [ __ ] out I appreciate it yeah I just wanted to share with the DG see you and I were texting back and forth yesterday and I was like man let's just do this for the DGC there's some really good information there you pumped it out by the way I really appreciate it Levi right on yeah absolutely and and you know as always we're just trying to put out a lot of information just to help everybody out because I understand it is really overwhelming at first trying to get into solve those expressions so you know we're putting out educational videos on on YouTube and are on our website so you guys are always welcome to try those out they're all free right and your so shout outs oh man where's everybody find it with your YouTube but your website come on yeah so our Instagram is just low temp period plates if you just youtube us it's it's low temp industries or low template so you can find a set either and the websites just low temp - plates com nice nice I appreciate you taking the time brother yeah absolutely thanks so much for having me I really like go chat with you guys all right you're right down in Denver you might see me soon he goes out just lonely at a freeze dryer in the lobby and and you might see me soon brother yeah yeah hope to see you sure well man take it easy brother yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] we're the pill to do [Music] true medicine [Music] Oh he hates the day [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "QavXt9ntmR4": "[Music] we're live rosin history greetings greetings and welcome to the town house here in Venice give thanks to bud gasm over here for bringing us all together my name is Nick Atia of essential extracts I'm joined by Phil Salazar of soil grown solvent list we got some other family over here give thanks to everyone who's shown up and come out shown support and is here to talk to about the history of rosin we wanted to provide a little education and throw it back to some of the people that have been involved since day one that have got us to where we're at today so Phillip did you want to say a little something about yourself before we get started I'm just here to talk about the history of rosin I'm super excited about it I like where it's gone where it started and where we're pushing towards so I'm just stoked to talk about it I don't well I'm gonna break into it I love giving credit where credit's due and I'm extremely blessed to have been here from basically day one from when this term was coined basically so a lot of this started before Instagram and before Facebook we had a lot of underground forums and the forums were where a lot of us growers and hash makers gained a lot of our knowledge so there was this gentleman named confession compassion Co mph a s o n I believe yes h o n but I also you know his his name is out there freely his name is chadwick Bastardo and i really like to give credit to this gentleman because back in the day there were a few forums that that I was on along with this gentleman compassion and he was really the one who started using this term the term rosin has actually been around for centuries it's been around for a long time in the adhesive and in that world the adhesive world just for a gummy substance you know sermons to like violins yeah rosin that term has been around for a long time it really was brought into the cannabis industry when confession started utilizing a stainless steel bowl with the stainless steel spoon heating up that bowl heating up that spoon and literally mechanically pressing his bubble hash into that bowl and stirring it around and he started noticing this ring of oil on the outside of that bubble hash and he was like huh that's interesting there's this separation and so he started pulling that ring of oil with his dab or tool off of there and back then it was knife hits and he started taking that oil off and taking knife hits and noticing that there was a lot less residue and back then the term full melt clear dome FM CD was a very popular term for when we got bubble hash or water hash so good and so clean that it would bubble up and make these clear domes and basically burn to very little if not no residue it wasn't until Chadwick compassion actually started playing with this technology of utilizing hot stainless steel instruments and mechanically separating the oils from the waxes that he took this knife hit saw these clear domes and saw zero residue and I really want to say that that's where rosin started but at that time there was no way to make that technology commercialized or scalable you know a lot of people in this industry talked about how is it scalable how do you scale this technology and that's where a lot of things are going and so you know back then it was the hash makers treat rosin started spreading that term you know this is back I want to say 2005 maybe 2007 2007 I'm really bad with the actual date but this is pre dabbing you know so back then it was the hash maker that got to keep that ring of oil for themselves you know rosin really wasn't able to get out to the masses until people like this gentleman came along and I want to talk and I want him to talk to you guys about what really pushed rosin to be scalable initially what was the term that you came up with and what were you doing well I think I called it like solving this hash sha sha something like that but the way it started I was just really really into making hash and you know all my melts and stuff and smoking it and then like it got to a point where I ran solo on what I had I didn't have any more of my harvest and I got solo on my melts I was like literally trying to smoke like four star three-and-a-half star like low-quality melt hash so and I have to give thanks to you because I remember seeing a tip on your page back then where I would take Milo my like my low-grade melts and put them between parchment I'd use a hair straightener just to thin it out and it actually helped I was able to get a better dab off low quality hash and you know I got tired of that and so I'm trying to remember like exactly but fast-forwarding you know past like flattening my hash out and like just dabbing it like that getting to the point where I'm running out of my dabs so something went off in my head I remember just thinking like back okay okay going back again okay I remember I messed up doing that I pressed it too hard not in the hair straightener and I see it would be real shiny on the outside and dry in the middle and I wouldn't think anything of it I'd fold it up do it again phone I used to do that like I'd fold it up like three times so it'd be nice and like homogenized a nice good melt off of a low-quality hash you know what I mean the best you'd get off of it so light bulb goes off in my head I'm thinking back I remember that shininess I remember the dry so I didn't have a hair straightener laying there this is the longest story possible of it but didn't have a hair straightener laying there so I actually took a chunk of hash between a piece of parchment shoved it up against the email with my finger and I'd try not to burn myself or burn the paper on the side of the coil and sure enough I pulled it off and there was oil like I was hoping that would happen very little not enough to dab so I kept doing it doing it doing it took me like five ten minutes to get one dab hit it and sure enough my father-in-law family was there nothing it melted to nothing and it we were just amazed so from there it would that's where it started that's where the Hat I would say that's where the rosin for me started you know it started by a mistake that came back to me later on as an idea and I took it from there you know and so I was I was pressing hash so it all started with hash for me no screen screen wasn't any part of it at all so I was making low quality rosin still could still small contaminants in it for the most part it melted to nothing and so I ran out of all my hash and we got to a point you know we're just smoking bud so Bing light bulb and I took a bud and I did the same oh and actually when I was pressing the hash my wife had come out and she brought me a hair straightener cuz I had been using her hair curler and so she swapped that out for me so boom I get back to the out of the hash now I'm at the weed I pressed a but I think it's like 400 degrees super freakin hot so I pressed it on the parchment and crazy amount of oil came out of it like three of us got a dab off of like a little half gram bud so we were just amazed and they just went non-stop from there like nights of just pressing out eighths taking like five six hours just to press out an eighth on a hair straightener and that's where it took off and really I think that's where are all of our light bulbs turned on because we're like that's where it's scalable this guy is pressing flowers you know because before we you know us hash makers we didn't want to press the best-quality hash you know we've we got amazing quality hash and we wanted to keep it as that you know we might have started playing with a hair straightener to press it so that we could dab it but we weren't anywhere in the mindset of actually removing that waxy cuticle until I feel like flour rosin came about in that term I really want to give credit to Phil over here because I think that's what changed game for a lot of people especially on the mast level because kids all over the world had flour it was a lot harder for them to come by amazing water hash but they had flour and they had a hair straightener and that's what change game at that time is when I really believe we're pushing towards you know safe extraction you know everybody wanted to make oil we're all dabbers you know and when at a time when when solvent list was scarce and when you'd get hash and it wouldn't melt it's just a disappointment it was hard to come by six star five star even good hash to even know what it was so I lost my thought that hash split right before [Music] but yeah going back to it you know we came from somewhere and I'm just gonna give you guys a little recap right now we came from somewhere where we were watching forums of this guy named compassion taking bubble hash and pushing it on some stainless steel bowl to then playing with hair straighteners to then pressing flour itself into flour rosin and now look look where we've come you know there's been so many different advances in technology since then this man helped put out one of the very first rosin presses on the market there's been so many other rosin presses since and the technology just keeps changing and evolving and you know it's it's I think it's thanks to the education that we started the open forum education style that can fashion was pushing it on originally that we've continued that trend of really pushing education to our peers to our community and it just continues to evolve into something that I had never even imagined I grew up making bubble hash in my uncle's barn in a hot barn and now we're actually separating THC their THC a you know on a scientific level really we're seeing 99.9% THC a without the use of any chemical solvent so it's really really really come a long way pickup everyone that's involved in that movement we can talk about you know where it's going now so are you guys familiar with some of the new consistencies that we're seeing out there how many show hands out there in the crowd how many of you guys have tried rosin just rosin alright so when we first started making rosin was really when the consistency of earwax was popular in the BHO world so I'm gonna bring it back to like 2008/2009 and Pho had really just hit the market pho was called earwax back then so as us hash makers started to make water hash on a more controlled level a higher level we wanted to mimic what was happening in the BHO world so this is pre rosin but we started making hash on a higher level where the hash was coming out gold rather than brown and it was coming out smelling really like the flour that it was come from because we were controlling the variables of the water the temperature of the water our environment that we were making the hash in and that starting material we started really really paying attention to the starting material rather than using stuff at uncle's farm that had been sitting on the side of the road that he didn't want on his property because that was more weight on his property that's what we were making bubble hash out of initially up in Mendocino Humboldt County we started making bubble hash out of close trim and not just the close term mixed with all the fan leaf and everything else they were throwing away then we started making water hash out of fresh frozen material you know I think 2008-2009 was when I first did my first wash with fresh frozen material and at this point we're making water hash with whole plant fresh frozen material later on we're gonna talk about some of the amazing magicians in the crowd over here that can make fire with dry trim it's been sitting around but right now you know the pinnacle of water hash is using whole plant fresh frozen I'm jumping around a little bit here but throw it back to that 2008-2009 generation when earwax was popular we start learning a little bit more and then chatter becomes extremely popular 2009 Colorado California 2010 and Shatter is the consistency so we started wanting to recreate that consistency of shatter so we started heating up our hair straighteners a little bit hotter you know pressing in between parchment paper just our water hash at a higher temperature to create more stability more of a clear see-through shatter consistency and I think that's another one of the variables that pushed us as hash makers to find out what rosin was we wanted more stability we're trying to create these consist we were seeing in the BHO world but we weren't seeing as much stability if you just press hash at you know 200 250 degrees you're gonna see it turn into shatter but eventually you're gonna see it start to degrade turn darker butter up some of those issues and it wasn't until rosin came along and rosin the actual art of rosin is removing the rest of that waxy cuticle if you look at cannabis cannabis you know is a plant that has a lot of these shiny trichomes on the outside the crystals if you will all plants have different structures of these crystals and as hash makers and specifically rosin makers we're learning about this structure even more with every strain that we run some strains have that longer stalk with a very small head with a thick waxy cuticle and they may not run as well in water hash they may not press as well in rosin you start seeing some strains that have a thick stalk in a really bulbous head with a thin waxy cuticle and you're seeing them run better in water hash you're seeing the waxy cuticle effect the rosin less and you're seeing higher yields higher potencies and so you know moving forward we started seeing these different consistencies like shatter like the ear wax and then as we move we started seeing this sauce consistency in the butane world where we were seeing a layer of terpenes on the outside and it's pushed us rosin makers to continue this movement and to continue trying to create a higher echelon for our industry by pushing education and I think we've taught each other at this point that we can now separate THC a via different temperatures and different pressures to pull those terpenes and pull those the THC a separate that and now as we see these saucy and jammy consistencies in the BHO world we've been playing with pressure just like butane hash oil is utilizing these columns basically to pull pressure and then keep the butane and the trichomes under pressure creating separation we're now seeing the same thing in the solvent list world some are calling it rosin jam some are calling it solvent list sauce but we're seeing these consistencies now via ultimately means and rosin so rosin history just continues as we see different consistencies as we see I feel like as we see now hydrocarbon guys starting to separate delta-9 and CBG and THC v that's all with pressure and columns and temperature and so I think as we continue that might be some of what we see in the future as far as what rosin can really do you don't need a column you don't need heavy chemicals you don't need to possibly bro up blow up your neighbor's house we're seeing all of these different consistencies via solving this means thanks to rosin through the use of heat pressure and force right on I think that really kind of concludes it do we have any questions from the audience or anything else anybody think that rosin is going in another direction anybody disagree what what we talked about as far as the history of rosin it's a trip how far we've come really this started what 10 12 years ago and now it's on the commercial market heavy I just actually came from cookies in Maywood and there was a ton of different rosin brands on the shelf and it was amazing to see it started 10 years ago but I'd say realistically it took off about five years ago when when the masses started to learn and do it themselves at home and the more Minds that are able to focus and work on it and share the knowledge that they find that's why I think that's why we've quickly evolved this technique you know compared to has been around forever and it's taken so long to get to where it is but you know with the butane extraction and with everybody hands-on trying to do you know learn two new techniques and do the next best thing with solvent lists or with rosin I think that's where we're breaking through and and I think you're right we're gonna find you know all these different components we're going to be able to separate you know we're already at the point where we're separating THC and fats and terpenes so I think we're there it's pretty crazy to see some of the hydrocarbon companies switching over to solving this you know that's that's where I feel like that's when we made it you know like this education really did something we got the guys that have been known for making butane making solvent list now that's one of the cool things you know as of January 1st 2019 a lot of the new regulations came into California and it was very difficult to just set up a closed-loop system get the fire department out there go through all those regulations people are able to get to the end goal of a concentrate and a nice healthy alternative right one regulations hit and some of the first companies to come to shelf were rosin companies or solving those companies because it was a little bit easier to get manufacturing going licensing for type six via type seven was a little bit easier to push through she didn't have to deal with the fire burn nearly as much still do but a lot of factors have really really changed game I feel like when we started putting solvent list products or water hash products on the shelves in Colorado back in 2009 we were maybe 1 to 3% of the concentrate market was water hash and at this point I think we're definitely pushing 20% of the concentrates especially in places like California and Colorado so big up ourselves appreciate all the support and keep pushing education for real that's what puts the products on the shelves that are healthy that's what puts the quality on the shelves and that's what helps the consumer understand what's good well I mean the perfect example is the diamonds you know we kind of touched on it but I'll back it up a little bit just in case anybody didn't catch that one but in the hydrocarbon world right when we learned about roz in a year or two into learning really about commercializing and scaling up the creation of rosin we started seeing the butane guys make diamonds and we're like oh we got to learn we got to step up our game over here we're on shadow right now you know we're starting to make this butter and these lighter consistencies but diamonds oh how do we make this in the lab how do we compete and really you know it was all in playing with different temperatures different pressures different separations I feel like the first diamonds were not actually grown we're now seeing on the solvent side of things growing diamonds with pressure but the first diamonds to come to the industry were actually mechanically separated amorphous solids morphus solid crystalline yeah and you know I was gonna bring it up a little earlier I might have touched on the gentleman but I have too big up a man named Jeff or the cannabis Reverend this revenue because of church Jeff church cannabis Reverend was one of the first gentlemen to bring in the actual micron screen to separate the oils from the waxes or what we later found out to be a lot of that THC a you know so that bag not only contained a lot of the waxes but it also contained a lot of the THC a so eventually we learned that pressing at higher temperatures would completely remove the rest of the the terpenes and actually are a lot of the rest of the cannabinoids and at those higher temperatures we were just retaining THC a right and eventually we learned that that white powdery substance was the THC a that we are seeing some of these hydrocarbon companies put out we started testing some of those that white powdery substance and hitting anywhere from 94 to 99% THC a in our regulated licensed labs in Colorado and then we were like whoa how do we turn this white powder into what looks like the diamonds more heat and pressure so we brought the temperature right back up to around 250 degrees people do it at different temperatures but basically to melt that white powder back down into a solid form and then you can mold that that form into whatever shape you want I think when we first started doing it we were just making very very thick slabs so we started with the white powder we heated it up into these thicker slabs and we were smashing it in the lab and in our parchment paper and it was basically just making all different shapes and sizes of crystal and we started getting that tested and even with that slight temperature up crease upwards at 250 degrees we were not seeing any THC a turn into THC which was interesting and our labs were telling us that it was pure 99.9 percent THC in fact some of the labs that we were using not to put anybody on blast some of the labs that we were using for giving us test results back at one one hundred and eight point four percent THC a so we had to step back and say okay we can't put this on the shelf that doesn't make any sense you can't have over a hundred percent what's happening here and we contacted the lab they're like well we've never seen anything that high you know what's going on and we started looking at the standards and you know this is gonna be an ongoing issue in newly regulated environments but one of the standards came from res Tech and there's another standard that's put out with another company there's a few more companies that are putting out cannabis standards now but res Tech Stander's range from like ninety seven to ninety eight point nine percent their THC a standard and when we turned in our THC a sample is higher than that so we bumped the scale and I feel like they have to create some new standards at this point but we started leveling it out the lab started learning and we were mechanically separating THC a so to get back to the original question mimicking these hydrocarbon guys you know it started with the earwax we created solvent less wax now the rosin has really really given us the advantage to recreate different consistencies we're seeing in the hydrocarbon world we saw diamonds become instantly popular with butane extraction and propane extraction few other methods to create diamonds and we had to find a way so we utilized heat pressure and mechanical separation how much a did you throw away before you figured out that's the craziest thing yeah well luckily we were actually using a lot of it in other products topicals edibles and other things of that nature because we were seeing the test results in our coconut oil and other things but we just didn't put two and two together it's crazy to think back on it but yeah we definitely threw a lot away we definitely use some for purposes that we shouldn't have been using it for you know in mechanical separation I always like to talk about allocations and this is maybe something we can take a little break on but allocations are extremely important and that was one of those allocations we were throwing away something that had a lot of value another allocation I talked about is when we're especially when we're talking about butane versus solvent list I used the strain blue dream for the perfect example you get a full indoor operation of blue dream you bring it into your lab and you've got the hydrocarbon guys next door butane extract guys and they're yielding 18 to 24 percent on this blue dream you bring that same exact blue dream into the water hash lab we might be yielding three to five percent on that blue dream and originally I just started this discussion about the trichomes structure whether it has a thick waxy cuticle or a longer trichome stalk but blue dream is one of those ones that has a long stalk a very small head and a thick waxy cuticle it does not yield well in water hash and this is just an example you may find the very specific cut that does do well in water hash but for general purposes aloft in times the blue dream that we see is just not good for allocating towards water hash it's great for hydro carbon and so the same thing goes with allocations on the back end we found that that white powdery substance that we were taking away in our bags and keeping the clean clear beautiful gold rosin you know we were throwing that away as Phil mentioned and we've now learned to allocate that and utilize that THCA that we're thrown away any other questions we got lit up here so I don't all right so we're used to you know the full spectrum like 45min 160th you guys to play with like the 1/16 plus for separation because you know I I found some light goods you know find some good heads in the ones bigger heads who beat our dicks have you guys tried explored that so you're saying you know do we basically isolate the 160-180 micron and you know press that out and see the quality of that rosin and do stuff like that or separate or keep it like yeah I mean personally yeah I've actually just recently I mean it was some indoor but it was isolated 180 micron from an OG which is to me not a common thing to find for ice water hash a 180 you and it was incredible it actually put out about 91% return on the rosin so it was the most most impressive 180 I've ever seen when he talked about that return on the rosies talking about the actual trichome head being pressed into rosin and when you're talking about a 91% return that means there's barely any waxy cuticle it means you're barely losing anything you start with 5 grams and you're yielding about four point two four point five or four point six grams now I'm horrible with mass start with the gram and you know you're getting 0.9 one bag there you go but but yeah I mean for the most part a lot of strains I do I like the 180 I like the 150 I think it really depends on your methods you know gentle agitation depending on strains and knowing what you're working with the environment you're working in and controlling all your variables I think the 180 and the 150 are really good because for the most part I usually isolate everything depending on what I'm doing but I find in the end a lot of things end up just making it into the same batch because what I'll do is I'll isolate and then you know I'll press everything out and I'll separate everything by quality you know so not quality just by color but call you by terpene profile always have to dab it taste I noticed the 40 the 40 micron is usually not my favorite I like to keep that little separate because I don't know if it's more fats and lipids that are in it that's giving it a certain taste but I mean it's still great oil but to me I think keeping the 40 separated is better than keeping the 180 and the 150 separated because to me the 180 and the 150 have a high terpene profile to me those have like my favorite terms you know like if you never catch 150 or 180 those are just man lucky and to really you know summarize that it's so strained dependent you know I was actually speaking of your og cush that you'll did amazing in your 180 bag we ran some lemon cush Himalayan lemon cush it was a strain that was brought back by a soldier friend of ours that we ran in Colorado for a long time this one round that one of my growers grew wielded over two ounces of full melt in the 220 bag okay so anything's possible and to go back on what Phil said I really like to emphasize that we actually do the same thing we separate all of the microns I run a couple 220 bags we actually run a couple there and in the washing machine just to make sure we've gotten all that plant material I then run a 185 a 160 a 120 you know sometimes the hundred the 90 that you know sometimes to run a strain that we've never ran before I'll put all my bags in there I'll try and separate as many as I can because each strain each grower each medium is gonna be a little different even from one row you know you might be running the same strain in a grow house but have LEDs in one row have your HPS and another you're gonna see differences even there's differences from the top of your plant to the bottom of the plant as far as the trichome formation the amount of oils in them the size of the trichome head so we really like to especially when we're running a strain that we haven't run before is run all of those different micron sizes you can combine them in the end I can't combine them you know if you've started with only three three microns you can't separate them sorry beforehand so we like to start out with as many bags as we can see where the heads are lying and then eventually on that next run when you're running that same material from that same garden you can remove some bags you don't have to use all those bags and I think right there I think what that is in my opinion is every strain has a different head and tell you know so it's like the heads the cream and the tail is gonna be your butt end it might be it's lower quality you know but for the most part when you see the head and tail together like a full-spectrum hash oil something it's a good product but when you actually pull that tail end out of like let's just say for instance a headband we're running and that you know you can run seven eight spins you know 30-minute spins and you're still pulling and you know five spins in it was just quality but you can see it's getting darker more contaminants but then you get to the rosin and you're pressing everything out and everything's just coming out gold regardless of the hash you know and and you know it's all about the yield so you got a hundred grams of high-quality and 10 grams of just some darker oil other strains you know you'll notice regardless of the yield you might got the same yield off that strain as far as hash but it comes to pressing you know you have more wax membrane to those heads so therefore you're getting more more tail in with that head so you know you're get looking at like let's just say you get 80 grams and 30 grams of tail in because that's the darker oil yeah and that's that's more when you're looking for like when people are separating their Roslin's you know having like you know their their heads - and then just the edible grade for me I kind of I'm more of a full spec guy I kind of like to keep everything together as long I like to keep the tail end out and I think that's an important part of extraction is the head and tell regardless of what we're doing rosin ice water extraction ahead and tell it's all about knowing when to poll and what to keep separated a mature grower as anybody here ever explored with ultrasonic cleaning for washing hash like definitely actually we've yeah the question is has anybody utilized ultrasonic cleaning with hash or ultrasonic technology and we've used on actually a number of scales and people companies that I know right now are utilizing that technology in a number of ways as well I'll touch on a few things we had a company come in to our facility we were one of the first licensed facility blessed to be one of the first licensed facility in the world in Colorado and so a lot of companies from the cold brew industry from the wine industry beer industry started contacting us because we were able to do license protected R&D and an ultrasonic agitation company or cavitation company similar technology contacted us from the cold brew industry and brought in machinery into our facility and we started playing around with it unfortunately cannabis is a lot different than coffee and hops etc and we just kept having clogging issues with that machine but I saw value in it so what we did use utilize that cavitation or that ultrasonic technology not to separate the heads from the material like we initially wanted to and I still do think that there's value there and I think that there is viability and I think that you could do that but instead we ended up because it costs so much money for the machinery and to keep making these diodes bigger and these passageways bigger because the cannabis had to flow but we wanted to get an exact temperature there were a lot of variables that cost a lot millions of dollars really in R&D that this cavitation company didn't want to just keep shelling out but we ended up finding out that on a very high level turning up that cavitation device that ultrasonic device we're able to actually fully homogenize the oil into the solution so for edible products for topical products there's a lot of value in ultrasonic agitation and cavitation I still do think there's value in separating the oil via this technology if you guys aren't familiar basically ultrasonic agitation is a wave that is so intense that it can actually separate oil from wall they've used it in actually separating rivers and things of that nature on a larger scale ie cavitation but we saw this value because we started turning it up and actually breaking the trichome heads in water which would be our solution and now we have oil and water in one solution we started going back to okay how do they get oil out of water and you know we started playing with some of the technology that they're using in the oceans to get you know spills out of the oceans these polymer tubes basically that run on the bottom of the ocean that are pulling the oil out of the ocean and we played with that but we weren't seeing the yields we wanted to see I still do think that there's a lot to do there and there is a future for it so keep playing that's what it's all about I didn't get to it I didn't get there yet myself but I think one of y'all could share share share with everyone put it up on the forums throw it up on Instagram tag these guys they'll put it out there that's what it's about man that's what it's about we found each other somehow we found compassion both both of us found compassion so keep spreading knowledge for real and stick around today because I think we definitely have some more discussions a little roundtable with a few more hash makers in the building but we're gonna take a little split break I think right about now", "28LAbLGlygQ": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you you [Music]", "AORyULfIRe0": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome to another live stream i'm going to raise you up just a bit sweet so gopro updated and um my new wi-fi router is in we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just giving everybody a minute to trickle on in taking dabs we're enjoying life i haven't even taken a dab with you guys yet have i ah let's take a dab i'm gonna go in on some of this blue icy first oh let's get in there who wants to get in those guts with me we've got 31 left on this battery oh let's get in there the gopro doesn't focus well close up so you guys are gonna take what you get and be happy all right first time catching a live stream viper you caught a very good live stream for your first live stream this whole live stream i've already prepped all my parchment i prepped all my bags normally i'm not this prepped normally i still have full parchment and [ __ ] i wiped down the plates i'm ready to go baby it's waiting on you guys i mean what do you think we're about to press a half pound of hash a half pound cheers at 413 on the email okay ah that blue icy i swear on the exhale it tastes just like a blue icy it is so crazy every time it never fails what's up easy labs green ranger nashville how you doing freshly pressed what's up annie oh gee what's up hidden creek we got the whole [ __ ] family here i think i'm gonna do a live stream prank and start a live stream pressing hash with the hair straightener so we can get a million people asking oh no what happened did the press break fantastic so huh all righty all righty all righty let's swap out the battery you already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel taffy uh oh uh oh ah excuse me i felt like my nose was gonna run all over camera i didn't want that oh yeah what's up mommy my [ __ ] that'll do good that'll do oh that gets the job done i'll tell you what how you guys feeling about this prize we're at 199.7 199.7.8.9 200. 201 i'm not there and dad just [ __ ] knock me on my ass about let's get ready to remove look at that still plenty of paper towel left to clean bangers with throw that away save that puffing my man it's a good night when my boy puffin comes to visit you're pressing yourself right now huh hell yeah get it dog we are warmed up to 202 degrees let's go this is gonna be a second test press slightly lower than my normal but for some reason i'm feeling this temperature why i saw gonza say 204 and i'm like yeah yeah that's my normal i feel it but then all of a sudden my balls rumbled and spoke to me from deep within and they said no 202 now they're all right [ __ ] it the balls haven't lied yet oh what would you look at that there already me gusta come here come to daddy a little [ __ ] go what i say i knew it i felt it i felt it in my huevos rancheros oh yeah let's get messy somebody's got to make a meme out of the next big bag that squirts all over this jar so i'm feeling good about that that's a fish grab that and we're gonna move this over here i'll turn you right now 202 my [ __ ] i want to know did i get it all did i oh man that was a beautiful extraction 202 good job balls sometimes it's in your brains sometimes it's in your balls tonight it was in my balls oh check your insta i just saw you let me see let's let's see what am i checking your story i don't know maybe i jumped in at the wrong part of that conversation oh elevated uh nah there wasn't a lot on the parchment there was barely anything in here really maybe like two to three grams that was a small piece of uh that was small and that was 19 grams in there and uh [ __ ] dude not a lot left in there it's all over the [ __ ] sides of this jar is where it's at you guys want to see a big squirt huh all right let's get it gotta get off this cyber dream stuff though um all right let's get it big old fatty this one feels like a 27-30-ish somewhere in there all right let's go i don't want to listen to trap sorry i gotta get i gotta get the right music on first this is bothering me put on some good old tj hotto all right let's go i'm gonna fold this one down the center i just pinch it crease it down the center diagonal the other diagonals and that gives you kind of like a good flow right there already and then you just pinch the sides together and it's like let me check my battery here 85 percent go dude i'm all smoking one squeeze okay shout out to my man mysticalgo my official artist on sbnb records back down oh yep bomb extraction on that one let's go cross mountain ranges split cells of tomorrow it flowed so well there's like not even that much on the paper let us go yes uh let's keep this party [ __ ] going good over here peace i think i put some information in the description maybe i didn't add that i guess but 25 micron double bag from rosin inc for the uh for the bags my bad y'all i tried to put some information in there and i left out that one yo if you guys can't catch the live streams sign up for my patreon i upload them there so come to daddy um is i'm the master of my own fate i determine my own yield i grew the flowers this is the source of the single i am my own god excuse you uh is that's why i keep the ends of these parchment pieces wrap them over the parchment paper i wish i could slow this down listen listen did you [ __ ] catch it though my man [ __ ] threw it in putting him on game yo understand he let y'all know i'm putting y'all on game for free i'm gonna i'm gonna take it back one time is it too loud uh um let's go ladies and gentlemen it's time to flow i'm gonna bring you guys back some i feel like i'm not bad hold on you guys don't really need that flashlight i don't think anyways let me take it off and passed wrench squad hold it down here's a pro tip on really fat pucks make sure you leave a little extra space behind the puck so that you don't get a blowout but i can mute it that's fine didn't need that light but i'm not liking how that's lining up on the [ __ ] plates i'm gonna move it over just a tad real quick like uh is i go go go go go real big extraction what is it [ __ ] this one's really done i'm calling it now it's gonna be a dumper is nobody [ __ ] with you you know what as a kid i actually did like origami and [ __ ] you know what was better than origami paper [ __ ] planes god damn it paper planes with a [ __ ] i could fold all types of paper planes you guys when i was a kid not now you know why i can't do it now because i lost the book i didn't look that [ __ ] up read that [ __ ] in the book you know what i mean books are cool as [ __ ] you can learn how to make paper airplanes and [ __ ] who would have thought mm-hmm starting to get good at this [ __ ] so um okay well brown is foreign i until you quit this next one's gonna squirt like a [ __ ] so um okay i have that camera ready i'm gonna record this one on my phone i'm not sure how i'ma do it watch me money money all the time hey money please no worries it's only 200 degrees touch it with your [ __ ] hands that sense sorry i'm trying to align this a little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things even easier so freshen up the deck and fire up the grill summer's here and it's as close as your home yard get more done let's get it i've used this prosper [ __ ] ever you're biking like five years now i just let go of the [ __ ] bar my bad you guys the camera is on a very unsteady amount kinda i don't have the tripod leg spread out very well all right is to the place whoa the puck slit in the plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all of a sudden the handle slipped and i was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] what happened put that back on the plate for a second up a let that so hmm who's your daddy who's your daddy what a safe uh is before oh yeah good extraction i'll take it oh yeah let's power through it two more to go parchment gets added to the jar everything i want everything together mixed together equal even steven the stuff that sticks to the parchment might be different terpenes might be different different [ __ ] you know you don't want to leave it out shop from the comfort of your home at sprint.com that's not a lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating

savings on descriptions is so complex it's like getting a documentary unfortunately you just savings period not all patients eligible savings so um me yes i haven't even hit one ton of pressure you

welcome back to the cannabis sommelier i'm your host andrew friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews today we have an awesome product category it's extracts i've only had one extract on the channel i personally love extracts it's mainly what i smoke it's what i'm used to vaporizing from the legacy market something that i hold near and dear to my heart and i'm actually going to show you my live rosin and hash rosin in a coming video from my garden you get to see some of the things that i've made and some of the cannabis i produce and kind of see how i'm holding people accountable to my standard but what do we have today a really cool product uh from an awesome company out on vancouver island from good buds we've got hash rosin and you might be asking yourself andy what's hash rosin well let's take both the words break them down hash being uh seething the glandular head off of cannabis either through a dry sieve or a wet sieve being bubble hash or dry sip i believe this one comes to us from a fresh frozen bubble hash because that's what they have on market right now and what their product card is saying now rosin if you're not familiar with the terminology rosin it's actually the way you can excrete the essential oils from the cannabis flower or hash by only using heat or pressure and then you squish out those essential oils and you leave behind any contaminant that may be there giving you a beautiful dabbable product there isn't very many uh products to dab on market right now so that's why i was excited to see the good buds hash rosin come out and at a reasonable price point this is a half gram and the half gram is 40 that's what i paid for it so not too bad now i see this it was packed on may 6 2020 uh net weight half gram and it's equivalent to two grams of dried canvas not bad at all the smoke from cannabis is harmful there are 800 milligrams of active thc in a full gram of this so 400 milligrams a lot of thc a lot of terps uh all the good things that you're looking for if you are have found that you've built a big tolerance to cannabis and you've never tried an extract before like rawson shatter live resin or even just hash i definitely would recommend uh supercharging everything up you can use these products in different ways today i'm gonna use them in a dab rig because that's the best way for me to assess the flavor but enough talking about it well i think i mentioned good buds is certified organic which is cool uh good buds this is from sun grown cannabis and the company was started out the back of a sprinter van i believe uh growing cannabis and evolved into an entire licensed producer so good for the guys out there for having the business acumen to bring something like this to market and be one of the first movers pretty cool in my opinion i don't know who processed it for them but if i was to make a bet on it i think it was whistler tech here we go let's break the seal underneath this camera and we've got this big package see our cannabis seal all of our good stuff let's get in there hope you're having a wonderful day oh can i get in with my just my thumbnail there we go and then it should be a easy peasy lemon squeezy and there is what's inside of our package which is another child proof container and there is our rosin let's inspect our container no contaminant doesn't look like there's any contaminant it's a little dark but we're not raws and racist here so we're gonna try it it definitely has that crust formed on the top it's been sitting packaged for a couple months now so that's fair um but let's dig in and then we'll start smelling it very soft you can see there buttered underneath that color goes all the way through i kind of like to break this out of here but let's smell it so this is a mixed hash they say that it's a bunch of mixed ones but i know they have lord of the apes and white glucky so i assume it's a mix of those two um on the nose there's like lemon lemon bar a little bit of lemon cream yeah definitely just those confectionary kind of cakey lemon bar aromas creamy sweet cream lemon it's quite simple that's all i'm really pulling out of it at first i had a bit of an aroma skunk but that skunkiness is gone let's see if i can pull this out of there there we go we can get it out pretty easy and uh we can get a little booty shot of our grain or our half gram here so you can see how it waxed up in there you can see the sheen on now that's been opened it's sweating a little so that's pretty cool uh oh no stuck to my finger okay so now most importantly let's taste it uh if you guys aren't used to doing dabs it's a little bit of a process there are more things you are going to need a rig now there's many different options you can use an electronic rig like the g pen rom that heats up and it's you know click of a button it all turns on i have reviews of that um or you can use the traditional rig banger and a torch with a carb cap today i think i'm going to do that since this is hash rosin i want to give it the respect i'm going to put the respect on it um so let's give that a little taste test out of my elbow dyno 2014 very cool check out elbow glass this is one of his original shapes um always wanted this piece very very cool i am using i forget what kind of banger this is and then there's a ruby insert in here we're gonna use the gordo scientific cap this is a blazer big shot torch in case all those things matter to you there's a lot of pieces to this dabbing thing but again as i mentioned vaporizing essential oils is what i uh tend to do the most it's the most time consuming but it's like smoking an entire joint in one puff and that's pretty all right if you ask me so there we go got it hot enough and now we're gonna wait a minute good thing i have a timer up here or else i would completely lose this we'll put that little guy into that bottom shot while we wait for it here well let's do it up here the dino just cooling down super cool love this piece absolutely love this piece um i was really happy actually me and my wife bought it together and we got hooked up through homeless hittings at homeless headies on instagram you should definitely check out homeless headaches if you're looking to get yourself a sick rig at a great price all right that's about our dab temperature and uh cheers okay so pretty good um things that i often look for in a hash rosin uh are that it has no plant matter taste um there wasn't any plant matter taste so that is a good sign and then the motto is there's always going to be a little bit of residual in the banger so you got to waste it to taste it but we're going to want to wipe out what's left over to keep our banger nice and clear we can really get a lot of indications off of the q-tip as well see if there's any contaminant anything like that and to me it uh it melted pretty clean actually um so pretty pretty good um what did i taste though i did try their white glooky's hash and i could taste that kind of wood chippiness come through from um that hash so maybe that's one thing i did take a decent size dab so i was really trying to taste it on the palate i got um i guess a little bit that lemon bar a little bit that sweet cream i definitely got wood chips i tasted a lot of like older hash that maybe had been quite oxidized but the finish is nice and long on my palette not bad at all i think it's a good representation of where the legal market can start and what we can evolve too i think it's probably competing with a lot of things on that legacy market right now maybe not the top top end um but it's not uh it's it's it's not too bad um okay well let's break down the good buds hash rosin from top to bottom how we liked it uh so the appearance it is hash rosin uh we're not rosin racist but i would like a much lighter creamier um more stable less sweaty as soon as i open it product there are a lot of things that uh this could go through to give it a different formulation so on the appearance i guess there's no contaminant the color's rough um we'll give it 15 points i think 15 points is fair for the appearance this is definitely maybe just a year behind where it could be um the smell wasn't too loud as i mentioned it is a simple rosin it had that sweet cream lemon bar kind of buttery lemon bar i don't know not anything insane again 30 points done the taste was good the finish is definitely the best part but when i did get that little bit of wood chippiness that didn't get me too stoked it would just kind of tasted like old hash um just being an absolute hash head i knew what i was tasting um so in that case for the taste i'd like to give it 13 points could have done better didn't taste bad had a nice finish um but the pieces of it that stood out to me i could kind of feel like it might have been i don't want to say faulted but i could i could tell that it wasn't um what it could have been uh overall experience based on my knowledge of cannabis rosin everything about this um it's like a 70 product so let's give it 14 points and that's my total i bet it's about a 70 percent uh hash rosin um ways to go good starting point not overly upset at my purchase for forty dollars and let's play with it once before we go in the camera so you guys can see the butter butter see the sweat mixing up but it is quite sticky and let's give it one last smell no nothing's changed just sweet cream and lemon awesome thanks so much for watching i hope you're gonna dab some extracts i hope you're out there i hope you're gonna move into that new world have you ever dabbed before let me know below let me know if i need to do a dab tutorial or something like that and cover it a little bit more in depth i really appreciate you watching have a great day make sure to like comment share and subscribe cheers guys what's my name what's my name the cannabis somalian", "zOxoyfpTVeQ": "[Music] alright guys I'm gonna go in here I'm gonna try to get some awesome that my guy on Instagram makes Greg 17 Greg he's got the seventh in between the Greg definitely is gonna count the follow right there i'ma go up in there tried to get some of that rosin and I may get some other things too that you guys like I said we'll see in the future and we'll see what they got alright I got a couple different things here as you can see I've got a couple of pre-rolls I've got a live rosin as well which is one of the main reasons I went by jungle boys I wanted to try their live rosin batter which Greg 7/10 Greg he makes that it makes a lot of it and you can follow him on Instagram with the 7th in between the Greg and that's how I even find him on Instagram an amazing page that guy is just absolutely way ahead of anything in this industry he's more than an expert that's for sure so I had to pick up some of that you got jungle boys full mouth jungle boys rosin jungle boys and jungle boys clothing that's all their pages and of course Greg and I'll mention a couple other ones down in the description for you guys to follow first of all let's look at the prices I we got the joints right here and as you can see there are $12 a piece including the tax so I mean they're lower a dollar cheaper than the joints we got back home and that's here in LA now there bud is a little bit more expensive I have that on another video for you guys if you're buying recreational it's 26 dollars a gram so I just got some pretty rolls right here and I've already actually smoked that Topanga Canyon that was just an amazing experience right there it was like great be I see with like a hint of like almost mint and it was it was really amazing so I already smoked that one and I'm gonna probably smoke the jungle cake in the morning twenty nine percent THC 291 milligrams total their strains are really high like that though they come in and extremely high some of them do now I smoked another one out here the last time though mimosa that was only like 16 percent and it was actually one of the better strains I smoked so twenty-nine percent on that one we also have cookies and cream and this one is coming in at 27 percent 277 milligrams in that 135 percent total cannabinoids Topanga Canyon yeah that one I just smoked was nice 25 percent it's that was like a in akadama net hybrid it was a oh gee Topanga Canyon oh gee really good really good I was like a great be gassy skunky with a hint of mint almost does what I would have to say describe that like and the other thing we got is the live rosin and that is a hundred and ten dollars a gram now we don't quite have anything like this back home and of course I can't really you know compare this to back home but I had to get some of that it's a hundred and ten dollars a gram recreational and I think it was a hundred dollars a gram medical I could be wrong on that price but it was one hundred and ten dollars for me including tax recreational for for this one gram right here", "sZmL9nmBD6c": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay that's a point eight eight twenty eight is what actually the poem is gonna leave [Music] I get to these point 9 yeah that's chatter like he says I experience that every time it's to melt even do anything yep okay we got three point nine yeah do you want to get a full with point one are just a full one to do the like will so that's actually also a thing if you want to put it all together or you know and then just press okay everybody go out that's your caller yeah I think does that makes the most sense you know if that if that's the easiest certainly whatever you think [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] next time you got to try to get it funnel Minh like one yaar hmm all of it yeah I know all these guys do the same thing [Music] [Applause] get off here oh yeah so we know it's completely melted what don't gonna be yeah this one's spinning yeah no Terry but the other ones were like scraping pretty well

make it cuffing individual yeah because it's such a small in my office it's not gonna really benefit us to use a whole yeah absolutely honestly I find it to be maybe even race well with the bag I'm such small out because so much gets trapped in their horror scenes and [ __ ] there's got in there mmm both often hey thanks for joining us is a live Robin to us today with star shining a total ban against which I agree yeah a presence in high grade this is brought a resin ranch GMO so right now he's preparing the bag yeah [Music] ten little rap on it screw this heavy really productive oh this is abstaining thinking to the truth [Music] just test the speed nicely the press is still have enough in the speed of the plate clothing there we go this is dupe I'm just gonna blow out if I'm not careful he's gonna put on a wrap and a small small amount when you get in there and see this [Music] back it off a little bit there's friends gonna blow very clear [Music] oh wow yes I see I haven't went over 20 because say good job so the guys that resin ran holy God looks like water [Music] look like the light is colored like some added some lemon [Music] [Music] Wow it's done here alright gotta pull it to dance while going up so much slower right now [Music] literally smells like our friend Dimitri wait oh yeah oh whoa that's a crazy thing to transform the center that's it oh it's some lamb lamb wiggity wow you guys really you can't really even see it on the paper there are spots in the tape help me see the light are you falling on Tosh late look go eliminate some time for Hannah oh well yeah yeah totally now you can see those little squares here I figured it was worth its buy the expensive what can i yeah bamm-bamm spaghetti land no it's all right cooled off a bit now collect it up no but you just do right off the bat just take that one gram you're talking about mm-hmm put it right over yeah off these rips that's a purest of the pure 100 scale you do what I say I have to do a second pressing not focusing on very well it tried to focus on it for a second yeah it goes in and out I got to figure out what it's focused thing is the giving it doesn't have it one that you can choose but I found it and that's perfect well it's so good that you're and yeah it's just serious oh yeah that's a good view of it you sure you just saying have smellivision order oh man oh wow the odor of this Rand Paul mouth dude whoo oh no oh my baby sure of it just like that that stage Nicholas pull that off a bit a little bit simply a 50% yield I'm sorry to say oh oh there's still more yeah boom there you go that's like a dream well I'm curious because if but like it should be one third of the ratio just cuz this is gonna end up being like super small amount of diamonds who want to get a fatty amount or like an even ratio or some Island right now what bank with some some good amount so it's like a pretty deep sea some diamonds and then like even it might be less than I have a grandma last time today know why empresa nice oh there you go oh well then gold out then some ranch farmers and definitely farming that resident whether that's fire two grams that's pretty good there was what was it on the way through 70 yeah that's two point seven half that's like stir-crazy out Jesus 77% whopping their services in Wildman oh so yeah I don't know what the ratio I guess would be one still do this one again of a higher temp oh yeah turn it up right now yeah so yeah we got Graham to make the goods out of those may not be the better yet okay yeah guys so you're getting exactly you know one young put these into this much it's really easy Matt yeah it'll be all right calculated okay so I'm really anxious to fight at this stuff yeah [Music] oh gosh here's a little trick associated to one if you lock your fingers you just take the glove off your finger [Music] yeah pretty honking way back [Music] hit honestly though we don't look that much better than his hash I mean I said there's more definition Oh Barry speaking yeah now watch week watching the watch walking with the [ __ ] oh okay there was very much done with him really [ __ ] activated now the bird about ten minutes oh really right there I thought yeah yeah that's literally the most gorgeous [ __ ] time the second squish real quick here 180 degrees now Wolverton 160 oh nice all that in just one blow real oh I figured this would have to go hi yeah but maybe we should have no such is who fear why rural Oh so he said why do you whip it for consistency people are commenting hell yeah well size micron byesies I believe we're using 25 right well I'm not sure what size micron bags of the hash to use there but 25 microns 92 149 there you go I know that and then yeah my silkscreen here's 25 micron which is a little lower than you really need to go for doing hash rosin 37 is my usual but this stuff is really I just makes it really clean and then it's also double usable uh EE used as the thing that we wrap the rosin back into to make the HCA extract out of it the [ __ ] daddy so thanks and then yeah Emily and a weapon it does it just kind of kicks in the nucleation process which helps to cause it to butter or change consistencies which you need it to be in that kind of tacky ER consistency or less less messy before you can actually make it into the THC a effectively otherwise most of it was booze out of the bag this one was on with right this is what the first grand that we didn't live yet this is the second ground that you whipped on camera and writing it so you can see the difference between the two clearly this one was just whipped for it you know a little while that one it was not whipped at all looks beautiful says hell yeah focus three people in the house now yeah those look [ __ ] beautiful thank you sir sup neighbors so these guys following Instagram resin ranch extraction yeah they know what they're doing yeah this is hella dense split in the house starting yeah gotta know they're easier than love well my limiting factors are out of my hands you know if people are knowing the product and they're isolating it clean methods then most pretty much just skate by on this end serious you know thank you John 4411 thank you very much this is donated lemon start out Thank You Man that's [ __ ] awesome when life gives you lemons you squish them muhfuckas into some dank but yet so one form this is kind of a nice little squarish shape book yeah and get it butter in the form that we want to wrap it in the final bag well that's the wait until the father to do that but you can get that shape oh dude Thank You lab max flashier than that [ __ ] yeah bro just enabling this little infants of it yeah well we gonna have some lemonade oh that is that fresh hmm gonna get myself a second time remember it's still beautiful color oh wow yeah it's still clear yeah how are you playing oh my god yeah I get the time yeah yeah whoo garlic comes out in 2021 I guess forget that so what'd you guys think can unicorn swim - or just fly the thoughts was a rosin master as the rosin teenage ones are the thoughts that keep you up at night yeah I mean obviously they can breathe in outer space but so that yeah of course they can swim in cool BAM there's the second press meat usually makes it a darker color but it's still yeah it's totally fun that's the same way oh my god we ready to go try to have with that yeah as I was thinking yeah [ __ ] yeah I know if we can just shut this down now it's like make that into some tea later or something no she should be there awesome dude yo thank you a third squish light but I mean that's fearful if you want to or anything but yo thank you for this [ __ ] thing we'll do whatever so parts you come on soon cool fine y'all have a good night bhai de Cerio thank you guys for tuning it well yeah [Music]", "o6UrX9n_UWo": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys it's cliff with peer pressure here thanks for tuning in to are solving this review series we've got Roz and Ryan from olio here today we're gonna be checking out his papaya punch number four let's get to it [Music] the papaya punch number four from olio is a cross between purple punch and papaya both heavily indica dominant strains the purple punch was giving me hints of grape candy and a sweet blueberry muffin fresh out of the oven while the papaya was was on the sweet candy side of things papaya candy maybe a little hint of mango in there and it's very surprising that it was an indica dominant strain because most of the effects I was getting were what you would attribute to a sativa dominant strain and I was getting a very energetic productive and uplifting high I tribute this to the high concentration of limonene found in the string and the limonene is really what was giving me that mood elevation in euphoria the second most concentrated terpene present and this strain was Lin Ahlul and I tribute that to the relaxation and stress relief that I was getting from this hey guys it's clip peer-pressure here welcome to the solvent ice review series this is episode number two we've got rosin ryan here with olio and we're gonna be reviewing the papaya punch number four this is our jam product this is been heat cured this is pretty much the most separated of all our consistencies as far as THC a and terpene content within the rosin and we believe it's probably the most shelf-stable even if you don't put it in the fridge or anything like that it keeps flavor for a long time and it's honestly my favorite consistency that I'm smoking right now so you can leave this out and it doesn't it doesn't you know decrease in terpene value it won't dry up which some people do like but this here let me show you here sure so what's this little dab tool here so every gram of ours has kind of comes with a personal dabber it's just a little extra thing we do just select emergency dabber in case of situations for sure very nice nice touch so what can you tell me about the the strain here so this is our papaya punch number four this is we have a few different fee knows we always Fino test a few different seeds that we get it's like the most exotic fruity and most punchy almost phyno it's got an exotic note it's um it's got a little bit of that artificial grape in it from the purple punch it's probably one of my favorite strains at the moment and this is from pony seeds papaya times purple punch very nice yep this is perfect for during the day I'll run some errands after dabbing some of this stuff it's very relaxing but its clear-headed yes it's a hybrid like most things are nowadays and for me personally I know it's different for everybody but I could dab some of this and still get a lot of stuff done during the day I don't feel too body locked or anything like that I still I'm ready to go you know do my stuff for the day so got that clarity stay exactly exactly and it's so flavorful that I almost don't expect to relax feeling I'm expecting some type of anxiety yes achieve a high but it's honestly perfect mellow high for the middle of the day definitely so how do you typically go about finding a good hash string it is many different steps so first of all to grow which ones grow nice we can't get any males obviously we take out the males whatever females are left it really is dependent on how well they grow their yield in the garden then once we wash them it's gonna be based on water hash yields it's gonna be the thing that plays the most role and if we keep it or not if it does yield well a nice hash and it presses well usually we'll keep it it all depends on flavors yields we all come together smoked them we all you know put in our opinions of you know which one do you think is a little bit tastier versus if the yield if it's really worth it sometimes we'll take a tastier one even if it yields a little bit lower just because it's got that little extra that we know people will will enjoy it so for sure so what do you thoughts on fresh frozen verse washing dried and cured flour so you can wash cured I've seen it done stuff 99% of our stuff is fresh frozen almost almost all we have our own in-house garden everything is harvested fresh frozen washed within usually one to two weeks so we try to wash it as quickly as possible really keeps that terpene profile just like it was when you were smelling the plant so when you're going around you got your fingers on the nose I want that to be what the rosin tastes like yeah I went down I really do think fresh frozen you know produces that a little bit better of a quality in the end for sure yeah so yeah you talked about doing BHO extraction in the past and you know when BHO first came out people were always looking for a light golden color but it seems now that things are kind of moving more towards an almost white color and I've even heard of people pulling their plants early to even get that color do you have any comment on like that is a huge trend right now in the in the grow world as people know you can pull your plants a little bit early but you're gonna sacrifice what I believe is a little bit taste and your potency the effects from you pulling early I believe are gonna be felt people really go for that visual yeah so when people see white hash they really they get excited yeah I think people really need to try the hash more side-by-sides sometimes a darker hash will blow the lighter hash out of the water with taste with potency affect how it makes you feel so I really think people should try stuff before you know everybody eats with their eyes so to speak but but uh you really gotta get smoking yeah so what can you tell us about the terpene profiles some of the flavors that you're getting up the papaya punch number four so this number four is probably our most like exotic fruity vino of this papaya punch it's mostly papaya notes it's that exotic fruit in there and it's got a little bit of artificial grape in there from that purple punch that's definitely that's it in there I think it's probably the most well balanced of our papaya punch he knows as far as flavor goes and that consistency is honestly my favorite I like when I see large chunks and they're swimming in Terps so definitely that Jam was just it's something else that is beautiful I seriously could smell it earlier just sitting back here when it was sitting over there so I liked what you did with it for sure well what about terpenes in general their medicinal benefits I mean how do you think that plays a role into the medicinal benefits the high and whether you classify it as an indica sativa I think everybody you know takes terpenes in a little bit differently obviously some of the ones like limonene stuff like that are just known to generally give people a little bit more uplifting effects like that but as far as terpenes go it's really about finding a flavor that you enjoy in an effect that doesn't hinder your day really yeah if you smoked something that you really like but it's giving you anxiety obviously that might not be the strain for you you should find something you know with similar profiles that don't actually have that same terpene you know within the plant so if you like something fruity but you're getting horrible anxiety from lemon let's maybe try like a citrus yeah or another a strawberry banana or something like that where you know hey this tastes really good but it's not gonna cause me to freak out yeah strawberry banana is one of my favorites - it's super relaxing probably the heaviest indica of the fruity stuff that I've tried so I know a lot of people that love it definitely definitely so one thing I love about following you on instagram is that you're just always dropping knowledge helping push the community further for those of you who aren't following him on Instagram he's at a troz and Ryan check him out lots of great content out there so I feel like the first time I ever heard the term rosin jam it was from following you on Instagram can you comment did did you coin that phrase is there anything there it was kind of more of the people speaking we did a little survey and stuff we just wanted a different our selves a little bit um there was a huge craze going on at the time of people putting rosin in jars and this whole new tech that's going on and I really wanted to create a name that people think Jam they think olio but honestly it's kind of taken off we've noticed other people you know using the rosin Jam name and we really don't seem to mind we've had people in Spain posting rosin jam so I think there's a really awesome to see and it's just it's just our version of rosin sauce or you know just a just a new just a new consistency we're just trying to cone so definitely yeah consistency is everything when I'm looking for a product if typically I lean more towards the jams you know if I see something that's a little more buttery that's just not usually my flavor lots of people like the butter does it is all of reference a lot of people love the butter just for ease of dabbing people like to just dig in some people grab it with their hands and just drop a bomb right in there and just its ease of dabbing it's a preference some people don't want the rosin heat it up some people want it straight off the press and put in the fridge so we like to offer a product for everybody yeah if you want your Ross and put in the fridge we have classic coins um if you want butter we have butter if you want your stuff lightly heated we have a batter and if you want a true separation and you want your rasam to look like BHO a live resin consistency and you don't want to leave it in the fridge then the jam is for you no down so I've got a bunch of homies they nerd out on temperatures as far as pressing goes dabbing goes do you have like a perfect temperature range usually fall in when it comes to pressing and dabbing yes I do if you know if something is pretty melty I use usually stick around 180 degrees that's a nice low temp of times and stuff really vary between how much you put in the bag and what you're squishing and all that but I like 180 degrees it just really is like a nice golden you know point for me for sure yeah so what about the your actual rig or the nail have you ever played around with temperatures I have and stuff it's been a while I'm usually just a time kind of guy kind of figure out what my new nail you know Davin is I'll heat it up and kind of do a test or at 45 seconds you know on minute 30 kind of see what my nails I like a low time dab it uh I'm gonna be dabbing I like a little bit extra on the bottom I'll leave a little puddle sometimes I don't mind you're sure we'll be sure to keep it on the blue setting oh yeah yeah so when you typically take a dab how long does it take for you to feel the effects usually I'm and this is just me I usually feel the effects pretty instantly honestly me too I uh I'll take a dab of this stuff and be ready to go yeah you know it's it's pretty instant behind the eyes yeah yep do you get that with other extracts or do you think rosin high gloss hooker I think rosin in general and solvent listen general I feel throughout my body a little bit more I noticed when I dabbed BHO it's it's more of a head high uhm BHO always you know it feels a little more floaty to me uh rosin solvent list is always a little bit more body I feel a little bit more relaxation from it instantly definite so tell me a little bit about the the bubble hash side of things how are you guys washing what's the trick to getting this so it all starts in the grow so most of our stuff is it's very well taken care of throughout all of its life the veg has to be very clean the early flowering stages at the environment is a huge factor so that's all before the wash is really the plant when we take when we're harvesting no no trimmers even touch the nose they're all hold it you know by the stem cut off the nose and take little golf ball sized pieces really trying to not disrupt any trike formation that we've you know work so hard to grow so washing we use our all RO water it's all hand washed pretty much as gentle as you can wash bud they do it multiple times will wash four or five times just to ensure that all the heads are taken off it's done in a cold room it's all ROI sorrow water it's as clean as can be in there so yeah that's how you make clean Rossum's clean hash and a clean girl so you mentioned washing by hand why do you prefer that over say and automate it where I can just hit the button and it's just uh really control over you know your whole process you can stir as gently as you want you can have a machine that stirs pretty gently but just having that control that hand on it and really seeing how much you're taking off each plant and stuff like that it's that extra care that really goes into it that really just makes it that much better for sure well let's let's get to it yes you want to about here guess we'll switch on over to the blue temp there it's the lowest temperature we've got I've got a little new little guide tool too they do come in handy [Music] man that's just what I was looking for you can definitely get that sweep of pile on the front and then on the backend you've got that like earthy grape soda candy like it was it's definitely what I'm looking for I'm glad you enjoyed it man yeah I always um I always enjoy papaya but that uh that little extra little grape really adds something to it it's got like a little almost a spiciness almost to it it's just really good for sure so what are you feeling like effects wise right now what do you think I I love the relaxed feeling I get from this the clear-headedness good vibe to some music right now to there so I just love the effects just great for chilling yeah you know I've got a real calm my body's real relaxed but in my brain I've got that little tingle to it but it's still real clear yep perfect biking it's quick behind the eyes and stuff quick acting I still feel like I could you know get up and go do some stuff right now so it's perfect and it is some strong stuff dum papaya punch generally tests around 80% for us so I mean that's a pretty high THC content so sure yep the rest of it's pretty much chirps we've been getting regularly 20% turps with the jam it's probably a 5 to 8 percent increase over just having it out you know just fresh press so wow it's quite a significant difference yeah so if somebody was looking to get some of this sweet papaya grape soda candy where could they find that so yeah you can find our product pretty much all over Colorado it's in recreational and medical shops dispensaries we have a flagship dispo it's higher grade they offer recreational and medical at two different locations you're probably gonna have our your best bet you know finding some jam there but we also you know post drops all over our Instagram page at dabble leo 7:10 you can give us a follow I also have my personal page at Ross and Ryan so I usually post the flavors as soon as I make them people get a little anxious and always ask me where it's at it's gonna be about a week or two before testing and all the packaging gets ready usually about a week and usually the olio page is where you can find all the information the drops what you know pretty much where everything's going that you're looking for thanks for stopping by man really enjoy the papaya punch number four it's definitely gonna be one of my goat cheese for this summer for anybody out there is not following them on Instagram be sure to check out at Roz and Ryan always dropping knowledge about solving this extraction trying to push the industry forward and dab olio 710 that's where we got the papaya punch number four from highly recommend it I really appreciate you guys having me I always love talking hash and thanks again so much come down so after sitting on the high for a while you know I really found it interesting that I was getting a lot of sativa dominant effects or what you would think would be sativa dominant effects because they're both in economists trains that we're working with here you know we've got the papaya on one side we've got the purple punch on the other like I said both indica dominant so you would expect a sedative effect but what I found was something really uplifting and that's why I think it's the perfect Brosnan for summertime vacation because it was relaxing mentally but still energetic got a little euphoria from that so an all-around great summertime high and perfect for like I said any vacation any trip to the beach or the lake definitely be my go-to and thanks for tuning in guys be sure to
