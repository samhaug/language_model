No blue bats, no blue squirrels, or blue dogs. Even blue whales aren\u2019t that blue. Animals come in pretty much every color, but\nblue seems to be the rarest. What\u2019s cool, though, is when we do find\na blue animal, they\u2019re awesome looking. Nature doesn\u2019t do halfway with blue. To understand why this is, we\u2019re gonna journey\nthrough evolution, chemistry, and some very cool physics. But, first we\u2019re gonna need to understand\nwhy animals are any color at all, and to do that, we need to go look at some butterflies\u2026\nbecause butterflies are awesome\u2026 and if you don\u2019t think so, you\u2019re wrong This is Bob Robbins. He\u2019s curator of Lepidoptera at the National\nMuseum of Natural History in Washington D.C. Butterflies ARE awesome. Make no mistake about it. They\u2019re a group of moths that evolved to\nbe active during the day, and if you\u2019re active during the day, you have an advantage:\nYou can use light to communicate. You probably realize this, but out of all insects, butterflies display the brightest and most detailed patterns. And there\u2019s a good reason for that: The colors in butterfly wings deliver messages,\nlike \u201cI\u2019m toxic\u201d, or \u201cI\u2019m a male and this is my territory\u201d, but not all butterfly\ncolors are created equal. If we zoom way in on a butterfly wing, we\nsee the colors come from tiny scales. It\u2019s actually how moths and butterflies\nget their scientific name. Oranges, reds, yellows browns\u2026those scales\nall contain pigments, organic molecules that absorb every color except what we see. Black scales absorb all colors. Animals, from butterflies to birds to you\nand me, don\u2019t make these pigments from scratch, they\u2019re made from ingredients in our diet. You might know this thanks to flamingos: They\u2019re\nborn gray, but turn pink thanks to pigments called carotenoids in crustaceans they eat. So when it comes to these colors: You are\nwhat you eat. But not so for blue. Blue is *different* If you move the camera, you can see that the\ncolor changes as you move the camera. It does. It\u2019s like a hologram thing. This is because there\u2019s no blue pigment\nin these butterflies Wait\u2026 so they\u2019re blue, but they\u2019re not\nreally blue? That\u2019s correct! Yes. You\u2019re lying to me butterflies! These are Blue Morpho butterflies, maybe the prettiest butterflies of all. I mean\u2026 they did make it the butterfly emoji. The blue color isn\u2019t from a pigment. The blue comes from the shape of the wing\nscale itself, and when I learned how this works, it kinda blew my mind. If we zoom way in on a blue wing scale, we\nsee these little ridges. If we slice across the scale, and look closer,\nwe see those ridges are shaped like tiny Christmas trees. The arrangement of the branches is what gives\nMorpho wings their blue color. When light comes in, some bounces off the\ntop surface. But some light passes into the layer and reflects\noff the bottom surface. For most colors of light, waves reflecting\nfrom the top and bottom will be out of phase, they\u2019ll be canceled out, and that light\nis removed. But blue light has just the right wavelength:\nthe reflected light waves are in sync, and that color makes it to our eye. This hall of mirrors only lets blue light\nescape. There\u2019s even a pigment at the base that\nabsorbs stray red and green light to make the blue even more pure. That\u2019s how we get this awesome iridescent\nblue. The microscopic structure of the wing itself. All of this happens because of the way light\nbends when it moves from air into another material. So if we fill all those tiny gaps with something\nother than air, like alcohol, the blue disappears. Technically, this \u201cchanges the index of\nrefraction\u201d, but in plain English that means blue light is no longer bent the right way. The microscopic light filter is broken. Until the alcohol evaporates. And the color returns. But these butterflies live in the rainforest. You think they\u2019d lose their color any time\nthey got wet, right? Well watch this. These wing scales are made of a material that\u2019s\nnaturally water-resistant. What about this blue jay feather? If we look through it, the color completely\ndisappears. No blue pigment. Each feather bristle contains light-scattering\nmicroscopic beads, spaced so everything but blue light is canceled out. Unlike the highly-ordered structures we find\nin butterfly wings, these feather structures are more messy, like a foam, so instead of\nchanging as we move, the color\u2019s more even from every direction. Peacock tail feathers? Again it\u2019s the shape of the feather, not\npigment. But the light reflecting structures here are\nmore ordered, like a crystal, so it\u2019s brighter from certain angles. There\u2019s even a monkey\u2013WHOA let\u2019s keep\nthis PG!!\u2013even that color is made by the adding and subtracting of light waves thanks\nto structures in the skin\u2026 not pigment. And yes, even your blue eyes, are colored\nby structures, not pigments. Outside of the ocean, almost exclusively,\nthe bluest living things make their colors with microscopic structures, and each one\u2019s\na little different. No vertebrate, not a single bird or mammal\nor reptile that we know of, makes a blue pigment on its body. In fact, there\u2019s only one known butterfly\nthat has cracked the code for making a true blue pigment. Blue as a pigment in nature is incredibly\nrare. But there\u2019s one exception so far that we\nknow about, and these are over here called the olivewings. They have evolved a blue pigment. They\u2019re not very common and we don\u2019t know\nmuch about them, and I don\u2019t know of any other blue pigment. That\u2019s a really special butterfly. Why is almost all of nature\u2019s blue made\nfrom structures and not pigments like everything else? I\u2019ve asked this question to several scientists\nthat study color, and here\u2019s their best theory so far: At some point way back in time,\nbirds and butterflies evolved the ability to see blue light. But they hadn\u2019t yet evolved a way to paint\ntheir bodies that color. But if they could, it\u2019d be like going from\nearly Beatles to Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Beatles. it meant new opportunities for communicating\nand survival. Creating some blue pigment\u2013out of the blue\u2013would\nhave required inventing new chemistry, and there was no way to just add that recipe to\ntheir genes. It was much easier for evolution to change\nthe shape of their bodies, ever so slightly, at the most microscopic level, and create\nblue using physics instead. They solved a biology problem with engineering. What I love about this is these colors have\nfascinated curious people for hundreds of years. After looking at peacock feathers through\none of the first microscopes back in the 1600\u2019s Robert Hooke wrote:\n\u201cthese colours are onely fantastical ones\u201d Even Isaac Newton noticed there was something\nunusual about these blues, and scientists have been studying it ever since. Not only because the science is interesting,\nbut because it\u2019s beautiful.

birthplace of the blue Bay Shepherd this dog breed has been one of my most requested films on animal watch and today I finally get to meet them in person and also their founder the lovely Vicki Spencer of southern breeze kennels you want to see some of the blue base I would love to think we got a got a couple over here in the yard there are only a couple weeks apart got ten months all of course this is a male the larger one yeah and let me male this is a sure this is a sure tiffany is Asher's owner hello and that's promise that's a little female actually she's pretty big for a female but unfortunately Asher is so large he Dwarfs her in come here vision come see mama vision did you get to come visit did you get to come visit she says yes I love to visit I love to visit everybody and vision is actually a second-generation blue bay [Music] finally we're bringing you the blue Bay Shepherd which is my most requested video so we flown out to Florida haven't we to meet you Vicki yes and your dogs in the flesh the name Blue Bay Shepherd is that because the dogs are blue talking to a good friend of mine he said well since you live in Palm Bay why don't you just call him Blue Bay shepherds and and it was it was perfect so it was you know just you know the color the type and where I was living when I heard they're developing a shepherd hasn't been around for long so this next march in 2019 will be what seven seven years now these here are foundation animals these are German Shepherds these are not blue bass shepherds these were the first two that produced the first litter so blue box so you've got your foundation Shepherds yes and then on the other side of the breeding you have wolf dogs yes and and as these are brother and sister German Shepherds from the same litter my first two breedings were brother and sister wolf dogs so I paired her with the brother wolf dog Dillon a lot of people know Dylan and I paired him with slate Dylan's sister and they produced the first two litters of course those two litters were double first cousins it's just why I never chose to breed a puppy from this litter to a puppy from this litter then I incorporated a few more of my of my blue coat wolf dogs and you know tried to incorporate some some new lines of Shepherds I wanted to stay with I wanted to stay with the blue-coated Shepherds I did want the shorter areas I wanted the old-world style which is why they came from Europe because they should've read them well then they breed them with that with that angle and I wanted the straight backs I meant of coast guard backing the German Shepherds history we know at some point they were all stationed wolf dogs yes the original wolf dog CEOs with these two yeah they would color the eastern timber is so far that I know of with what research I've done and all my friends it's the only subspecies of wolf that's ever had a blue coat thing that's quite fascinating is some of the blue wolf dogs will actually end up going pretty much completely white but they face they face like a like a black wolf would face they get lighter and lighter and they get the silvers and the whites and stuff in them and you you can tell can't you when when wolf dogs are quite a higher content because they'll be phasing out yeah they'll be phasing out the idea with the blue based shepherds is that they look like a wall great they've got this incredible blue color but they can be in your house and there be amazing companion rate trainable confident one of my most important things that has been temperament I want to keep the wolf look as much as I can but I'll sacrifice some of the some of the look with you know more of the shepherd look for you know for that that trainability because when you hear about people getting rid of their animals they don't get rid of their animals because oh my dog's ears were just too big I just couldn't take that I had to get rid of that dog because they couldn't my dog was aggressive I couldn't handle my dog my dog was escaping all the time you know those are the reasons people get rid of hands so temperament personality character is definitely the most important but these guys are German Shepherds when I picked the shepherds there again I I didn't want ones that that had the predisposition to to want to be Guardi these guys are nine years old they've never barked at a human what sort of person would be the ideal person to have a blue base Shepherd because it's such a new breed every litter is a little different there's a point where they get a little too intense that I'm not really comfortable calling a blue base but what I really try to do is I try to match what the people are looking for with the individual pup they're going to do much better if they're with a family that does spend a lot of time with them and doesn't leave them alone a lot they do enjoy an active lifestyle even though they have you know they have a side of them that they're quite content to you know lay around and watch TV with you but they they need that outside activity the females I would say typically typically go between 70 to maybe 85 pounds some of them do get up to hundred I have a hundred pound one here and the males I would say average 85 to maybe 105 we do have a couple that's gotten up 230 after which we met earlier he's he's really big I mean he's quite tough to control on the lead you need to be strong what would be your ideal percentage we've had quite a few of the second Jen's that have embarked at 12 to 16 percent that looked very wolfy my friend couple blocks away has a litter the content should be 6 percent wolf they're not looking too young they're not looking too different from the other blue base so we're gonna see like 7 3 so we're gonna yeah we're gonna keep very close very close tabs on these pups to see just how German Shepherd E or wolfy yeah talk to me about Cogan because Kagan has his own channel yes yes he does that and that guy yeah that guy does wonders with him I mean he you know he's got a great life gherkins got a great life vision is from the same litter that Kurgan is and now kurgans got his own YouTube channel and I featured him before in one of my previous videos and I'm meeting Kai and sister look so I never realized that if you want to check out kurgans channel you can click on the information box at the top of the screen and that will take you there Kogan's got an amazing channel and you can see what it's like to actually live with the blue Bay Shepherd he goes hiking with his owner every single day and you get a wonderful insight into his life after speaking with Vicki about the origins of the breed I was delighted to be invited to meet some of the dogs who have gone into the foundation of the Blue Bay Shepherd line including submit and higher content wolf dogs Anika we're gonna go in now to visions enclosure you get to meet her mate this will be an example of breeding the blue Bay now back to a wolf dog they do have a tendency to to show some timidness but when we've crossed them with the with the shepherds that that seems to go away because there even though they have a timid it's more of a shy timid nature they're not terrified of people but they're very you know once once they earn your trust they're very affectionate and actually very gentle they're not even like to see how exuberant she is and you know she's a little rough with her loving and he's very very gentle so she's she's wolf doll she's a wolf dog yes and this is a tracker he's an AKC German Shepherd this is the original way that I did that I started with the first blue base was the wolf dog from the southern breeze blue lines to a pure German Shepherd okay [Music] Oakley is my ideal dog I've decided a wolfdog I should say she is beautiful I love her a lot of personality look how cute Slade is a wolf dog she's 63 percent she was the color of this when she was born completely solid blue and of course as she's gotten older she's 13 now as she's gotten older she phases out every year she gets lighter and lighter she's got the kind of green yellow eyes and it's been wonderful meeting you today I also love them and if you enjoyed this episode please give me a big thumbs up and subscribe to the channel by clicking that button in the bottom corner and remember to tune in every week well be bringing you

virtually impossible to dig underground when the sea retreats so these mussels and barnacles are fully exposed to the heat of the Sun literally cooking in their own shells and the seaweed simply dry to a crisp it can be a weight of many hours before the water returns throughout each month the size and strength of the tide changes the biggest tides have all happened when the gravities of the Sun and Moon pull in unison that happens immediately after the new moon and again after the full moon these are called the spring tides they reveal vast tracts of seabed that would normally be covered for these raccoons it's a chance to look for a seafood feast the mother ventures forth with her kits with the spring tide they've come further down the beats and smaller tides would normally allow searching with their extraordinarily sensitive paws they look for suitable prey with the extreme low tide they could find something special and what could be better than a Red Rock crab that is if it weren't for the risk of a painful pinch with large crabs there's no substitute for experience the mother makes an expert sketch but the kids learn fast and for those that don't begging is always worth a try all too soon the returning tide will cover the raccoons table for all invertebrates it's a welcome relief but in rough weather they are exposed to the worst of the waves so now for this tulip snail it'll be as safe to patrol the shallows in search of a meal but is it this is a rather bigger kind of snail as five kilograms in weight the giant horse conch has little to fear from any shark and it has a taste for tulips now sensing the approaching danger the snail flees but in a world of snail paces the conch is something of a Ferrari it calls for desperate measures exhausted by the effort of its last-ditch attempt the tulip snail is slowly gunned down the tide still has to rise for another hour before the big predators can feed but out on the flats the scent of dying snail wafts away on the tide it's a scent that these hermit crabs are particularly partial to it's vital that the crabs have the best possible protection from the heavy teeth of the waiting sharks and rays for that they need the shell with a perfect fit today there is new real estate on offer and competition in this housing market is fierce [Music] the action becomes even more desperate when the shell of the devoured snail is ready for release this crab simply can't wait any longer but it's a decidedly risky acquisition the risk paid off handsomely the new shell is both Lysa and stronger than the old home and it's not a moment too soon because the tide is flowing in strongly flooding the plains it's now midsummer and the sun is shining at full strength the increasing warmth is the cue for an Atlantic lobster to start on a long journey she spent the winter 250 meters down far beyond the reach of the storms but it was cold down there and now she needs to find warmer water so she's marching towards the shallows they however are a hundred and fifty kilometres away after a month of walking she finally arrives at her favorite sand bank but she's not the first here dozens of other lobsters

really friendly and kind of squishy you're doing a really good job petting it with one or two fingers on the side we don't really want to poke it right in the middle because that's its mouth oh cool oh look at this one so the last ones are really soft i wonder what this is going to feel like [Music] whoa it looks like it's closing itself up a little bit blippi it might think your food that's funny oh look at this one what's this that over there is a sea star how does it feel whoa kind of bumpy yeah bumpy and and and kind of small spikes the last couple were really soft but this one is hard those little dots are made out of the same stuff that seashells are made out of so even as though a sea star doesn't have its own sea shell it's kind of like it has little bits of a seashell wow that's pretty cool well thank you so much my pleasure bye bye i found the queen wow there's so many honeybees in here hey don't be scared of honeybees all they're trying to do is make some honey yeah have you ever had honey before yeah it's so tasty look at what it is this is the spot where you can do the bee dance are you ready to learn the bee dance i'll teach you okay in the middle here you go and do a little wiggle then you go this way flap your wings yep because we want to make some honey in the middle wiggle wiggle wiggle and then go this way flap your wings and then since you're back in

things exhibit whoa yeah do you see these oh interesting these are naked mole rats wow they're like rats but they have no fur or or hair or scales or anything like that that's why they're called naked mole rats oh and then axolotl check this out whoa see that that's an axolotl whoa so interesting kind of looks like a salamander mixed with a fish but the cool thing about axolotls are if they lose a limb like their arm then from there they can re-grow it back [Music] check out this little person or guy or girl or i don't even know but this is a turtle wow hey how are you turtle are you having a good day are you having fun yeah you sure do look like you're having fun see you later whoa it's kind of dark in here but that's okay this is a green iguana can you see it whoa it's just relaxing

like a velociraptor will you act like a velociraptor with me [Music] whoa another dinosaur oh this dinosaur that's its name right there it's really big hey look at its head hey see it kind of looks like it's wearing a helmet just like when you and i ride bicycles we wear helmets cool oh here's some more dinosaurs oh look at that one that is a triceratops do you know why they call it a triceratops yep because it has three horns on its face and head let's count them one two three all right see you later triceratops hey another dinosaur wow hey dinosaur oh this dinosaur right here was a herbivore see these plants that means it eats plants and plants only it doesn't eat meat and look at what's on its head it kind of looks like a shark fin so silly [Music] check this out whoa this is

stegosaurus whoa do you see those plates on its back that's for its defense mechanism wow hey stegosaurus [Music] so many cool dinosaurs in here whoa this dinosaur is so scary it's the king and queen

buckle up whoa you pick things before you go okay just make sure you're going at like a walking pace you're always going forwards and just keep paddling the whole time okay hands are optional whoa hands are optional here i go [Music] did you see that you would think i would fall off because it's a really thin rail but i didn't because the weight is really heavy and it's really far away from me here i go whoa look at this interesting this looks like a giant circle and this is actually called the water wheel it's kind of just like how a hamster runs in their wheel i'm gonna do the same but it's gonna grab water from the bottom and throw it up over the top ready here i go did you see that that was awesome whoa what's this whoa this is the water power station water is getting shot out on the front of this little water gun whoa whoa okay watch i'll make that spin [Music] yeah we're doing it okay whoa what's that way up there do you see that yeah that's the seattle space needle i think we should take the water power gun and try and shoot way up there here we go [Music] it's such a nice day i wanted to give them a cool break of water but it's too high up there let's go see what else there is around here [Music] whoa that's pretty fun [Music] whoa look at this area you can use these water squirters to squirt inside this clear cube all right let's see what else there is whoa look at this all right i wonder if i put this right here yeah see the water is pushing this gear around okay let's try this one [Music] both of these are going in circle the red one and the yellow one come on [Music] i love playing with water okay wow okay look in there let's go [Music] welcome come on in [Music] hey look it's a little tree house here i go hello whoa whoa look at this it's a bunch of spirals ups downs lefts and rights here we go these are so much fun the noise room come on whoa this room is a room that you can make as much noise as you want first thing i'm gonna do is yell now

go back outside here let's go to the top right up here [Music] whoa this area has a lot of colorful bricks yeah see right over here all right whoa a taller one let's count how many there are this is a lot of stories of bricks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15. 16 17 18. 18 bricks coming down that was awesome okay let's uh organize these bricks in their different colors okay okay since we made a mess we need to take the green bricks put them over here okay okay there's the green bricks and let's now take the blue bricks and put them right there [Music] awesome perfect oh hey look here's some brown bricks let's put them right here here's a red brick let's put it right there [Music] hey hey here's some more blue bricks look at this one what color is that yeah this is brown let's stack it

comprised of these one two three four five colors and those colors are green brown blue red and yellow good job let's see what other fun things they have at the pacific science center let's go do you like numbers yeah i do too what about big numbers yeah check this out this is a big number 76 million 383 [Music] 2232 whoa that's a big number but when i push this red button watch this number [Music] whoa it just went up by one see it's at three four five six seven eight every time you push this button it goes up by one so if you ever come to the pacific science center you can see what number it's at because i am going to leave it at [Music] six million three hundred eighty three thousand three hundred and twenty three wait no three hundred and twenty four [Music] oh hmm i'm just doing this puzzle of the moon okay there's one let's see okay hey there's another um yeah that looks about right perfect we're almost done look yeah this is our moon we live on planet earth and we have one moon and we call it moon wow how clever of us hey look at what it is this is a planet just like how we live on planet earth this is a planet in our solar system and this is saturn and the biggest planet in our solar system is jupiter whoa it is really big look at that come here this is a space capsule watch your step see this capsule is where astronauts can sit in and go into outer space so then they can feel the effects of gravity and they can push all these cool knobs ready [Music] yeah look i just made all those things light up whoa this is fun whoa it's like i can see planet earth all the way from out here whoa hey mom [Music] [Applause] [Music] just kidding it was just a mirror come over here i'll show you some more fun that we can have with mirrors look at this [Music] i call this the mirror dance i look silly come on [Music] this is a bubble maker all right i'm gonna lift this up nice and slow and i'm gonna blow now [Music] yeah i did it did you see that that was awesome i love making bubbles what else i love is taking a giant lever and seeing how distance way out here makes it really easy compared to to lift up this weight compared to pull down right here see watch [Music] huh interesting all right now let's move it way out here all right now i'll do it with one hand yeah did you see it look i'll lift it up [Music] oh that's pretty interesting whoa hey a cool mirror another one hey hello this is interesting see i'm upside down but in real life i'm right side up hello hey i see you whoa whoa all right let's continue on this place is so cool hey what's this this is a beach ball what's it doing here flying ball feel the power of air and motion huh interesting let's push this [Music] i wonder what happens when i plug this hole that's shooting up all the air whoa did you see that all right now i wonder what happens when i move it whoa oh look the ball is way over there ready [Music] yeah that was awesome ah yum i just hydrated my body with a lot of water because what i'm about to show you takes a lot of energy i'll show you my lance armstrong hill climb [Music] that was awesome well this is the end of this video but if you want to watch more of my videos all you have to do is search for my name will you spell my name with me b-l-i-p-p-i blippi good job special thanks to the pacific science center for making this video happen bye [Music] and today i'm at the skyline marina in anacortes washington and marinas are where boats live and today you and i are gonna learn about boats look there's one right here [Music] this is gonna be so much fun i'm steering the boat whoa this is so much fun all right i'm gonna pull back the throttle this is the throttle this is what you use to determine if you go forward or backward and this is the steering wheel you knew that whoa whoa what else is around here oh hey i wonder what this button does whoa did you hear that that's the horn let's do it again that's so much fun and what's this this is a radio hello hello can you hear me this is blippi radios are used to be able to talk to the people on the land and other boats and the navigation system this is electronic and this one is not this is actually a compass it tells you which direction you're heading wow that's so useful ooh and there's so many gauges and instruments hey and a muffin let's try some hmm so tasty all right check this out here we go let's go forward whoa whoa yeah check out the back yeah look here we go [Applause] boats are amazing pieces of machinery hey when you're in a boat and if you are 12 years or younger then you need a life jacket so let's open up this compartment and take out a life jacket this life jacket is the color orange okay let me put it on life jackets are really good to keep you safe they keep you afloat if you go in the water let me turn this around go to the back perfect make it nice and snug how do i look [Music] whoa yeah yeah another piece of equipment that boats have on them is a life ring and that's used to throw it off so then the person that's in the water oh can grab onto it and then you can pull them in here i'll go get the life ring check it out this is a life ring whoa i wonder why they call it a life ring hey i know because it saves lives and it's the shape of a ring hey so let me take it get it situated and i'm gonna act like there's someone out there that needs help so i'm gonna take the end of it okay i found it and from there i'm gonna chuck it out there really far three two one [Music] yeah did you see that and then once they grab it then you can reel them in like this okay grab on tight i'll pull you in [Music] it's like we saved someone there we go oh good job do [Music] [Music] this is a boat and it's out of the water see normally the water is up to here but it's out of the water hey and check this out over here come here [Music] whoa and do you see down there those are the propellers wow they spin around and push the water back to create thrust for the boat to go forward [Applause] whoa hey and look way up there there's some buoys whoa they're kind of like pillows and balloons so then the boat doesn't hit the dock and get hurt wow this powerboat is really cool has big engines to provide a lot of power to the boat whoa look at this boat this boat is a catamaran check it out wow kind of looks hollow in the center that's silly and then kind of like a deck in the middle whoa and how it gets power is from the wind and then it blows on the sail and then it goes whoa hey look here's another type of boat and this boat yeah it's a power boat but what it's used for is fishing wow i see a lot of fishing pole holders up there i bet they go fishing for salmon tuna crab and all of those tasty food whoa this boat is really big look how big it is [Music] i look so small next to it and this boat looks so big wow sailboats get all of their power from their sail whoa hey and what are these down here this is called a keel it keeps the boat really stable in the water so then when the wind blows a sail it doesn't fall over sailboats and boats in general look like so much fun look this is a kayak and kayaks are another type of boat interesting kayaks are powered by humans going like this with paddles and in here there's more kayaks come on whoa oh look over here here they are wow this kayak is the color red oh and back here this kayak is the color yellow oh oh this one's hidden but do you see this this kayak is the color green kayaks are really fun because you sit in them with a life jacket on yeah a life jacket hey let's try on a life jacket okay take it off the hanger all right so this is a life jacket whoa and life jackets are really useful when you're near and on the water in boats because they keep you afloat if you're in the water so then you don't have to go and sometimes if the water is really cold you might wear a wetsuit oh look at them back here see it's like their feet and then the arms and i think these are actually called dry suits because they actually keep you dry so then the water doesn't touch you oh let's see what else is around here whoa wow yeah the paddles or the kayak whoa [Applause] this is so much fun okay i'll go back this way whoa holy oh [Music] this building is so big have you ever wondered where boats get stored so then they can go inside away from the weather like the rain the wind and the ice yeah a building like this stores many many boats hey check it out [Music] oh hey doggy look this dog is being nice and safe with this life jacket on hello oh so soft so cute and so safe what a beautiful day it's been oh [Music] look do you see what i see wow yeah sea life whoa let's get a little closer and say hello hey hey how are you wow that's a seal it's just laying out in the sun feels so good i'm gonna go a little bit closer hey how are you wow it's so cute look at its big black eyes [Music] hey hello i wonder what its name is we should name it i have an idea let's name it seely hey celie alright celie have a good day bye bye i love the marina look at how big this boat is wow jeez it's so long oh hey it's so big it even has windows inside hello that's silly whoa look how tall it is hey i have an idea why don't i start at the back of the boat and then i'll step it out and count the steps to see how long it is ready one two three four five six 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16. this boat is 16 steps in length good job whoa what an amazing day it is to have this muffin on this boat let me show you around this boat whoa as you saw that was the table ooh in this area is a great place to prepare some food check it out a fridge hello fridge you can keep all your food nice and cold oh in a sink what's that doing in there so silly okay what else is around here [Music] whoa this boat is awesome check it out that's the captain hello he's steering the boat and down here is the inside of the boat come on wow this is amazing whoa it looks like a stove top right here where you can cook some food ooh a sink whoa that's a big sink some paper towels can't forget those oh a microwave oh that's convenient there's even a tv right here hey that's me oh in a bed [Music] oh what am i doing no time for sleeping oh another table i could eat tons of snacks right here nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom whoa a fuel pump that's gas and this is diesel hmm interesting hey i have something to show you come here [Music] just like how cars need gas and diesel to run on land boats also need gas or diesel and this boat right here needs gas so let's take this pump right over here and let's go fill it up [Music] whoa what a long hose hey check it out this is the gas cap of the boat so let's unscrew it okay be very careful and then put it right in there and pull the trigger did you hear that it's nice and full all right let's put the cap back on and now it's full to the top so we can have some fun in the sun that was so much fun hanging out in the water on this boat i sure do love boats and it was so beautiful out there hey i have an idea why don't we sing the blippi boat song [Music] floating down the river sailing on the

is the little hand is pointing to number eight and a big hand is pointing straight up at number 12 that means it's eight o'clock time for a morning feed for Leon the lion lions are carnivores which means they mainly eat meat shall we feed Leon some meat gobble gobble [Music] it's now 10 o'clock look the small hand is now pointing at number 10 that means it's time for the Penguins to have

breakfast [Music] it's 12 o'clock also known as midday look at that midday means that both hands are pointing at number 12 and it means we need to go and feed the tallest animal in the zoo the giraffe unlike Leon the lion who is a carnivore jenny is a herbivore meaning she only eats plants giraffes like to eat the best leaves and twigs from the top of the tree these leaves are nice and high so Jenny the giraffe gets to stretch that long neck of hers [Music] the time is now hot bus 1 look the small hand is pointing between 1 & 2 and the big hand is halfway around the clock wenting to the

seriously at risk what's up Ben and Ted was talking about throwing him out of the house at the same time hey guys hi how are you good how are you good to see you guys again look at our boy I mean he does look a lot better to me tell me have you guys been taking him out for walks and I asked Ted and Rachel for you guys to take him together how's that going we have taken him together I mean what have you noticed about the walking I noticed that he really likes it good for me personally taking the responsibility of him walking made me realize how unhealthy I am and how unhealthy he is and both of us just feel better and Ben has motivated me to continue losing weight and our talk really made me think and I've made some really good changes toward my life good now when I first met with Rachel she told me that she and Elvis gained weight together and now they're losing weight together Rachel welcomes this as a positive change in not just a source of shame to be a part of that for her man that means a lot to me Ben I gave you the homework assignment to get him playing how's that been going it's been doing really good no here we go we're going around come on Elvis you can make it around the chairs now we're gonna go back my man there you go buddy been playing with Elvis shows me that he earned his stripes as a cheerleader he was the one who asked for my help and today he showed me that he earned it he's gotten a lot more energy and he's becoming like a real cat a real cat you guys have a lot to celebrate here but I got to see him moving around I got to see him exercising a bit so here's what I want to do play captain over here Ben let's go take him for a walk come on you know right now I'm looking over at Elvis and I'm not feeling so good because the first day I was here he was in a box second day I was here he was in a box and the third day I'm here he's in a bed and thinking to myself am I ever gonna see this cab move okay let's put him down right here we'll start walking towards that way okay so I do start walking a little bit let him try to follow you go ahead come on Elvis come on all this this way buddy good come on Elvis and we're walking look at him walking man there we go very nice well look he's moving - man good boy first day I met your cat he was in a box wouldn't come out now he's walking all over yeah this is fantastic look at him nice going buddy I'm pretty psyched I think that Elvis is on his way to being healthy I mean I want to be able to leave you knowing that you feel like you guys have a roadmap to get him down to the right way do you feel confident in that I'm completely confident good man I'm proud that's great work you really you saved your cat's life so you should be proud of yourself nice going buddy seeing Elvis walk with such energy such gusto it's a beautiful thing Ben did an admirable job as a coach a cheerleader and in the end Elvis's lifesaver now there's just one more thing left to do here and here we go first time I came here Elvis weighed 21 pounds last time I was here he weighed just a little over 20 pounds guys 18 pounds congratulations Elvis is well on his way to his ideal way to 14 pounds and his weight-loss secret is no bit of magic it was all about the raw food diet exercising regularly and eating on a schedule so that his body knows what to do with that nutrition it's pretty easy but that's nothing compared to seeing the excitement the entire family felt of hearing the news I mean you can't fake that Elvis has lost 14% of his body weight that's a lot that is a lot of weight I was so excited that Elvis could do that it made me realize we can get him to that 14 pounds how are things going for you in terms of all that noise making oh he's cut it out a lot even that sleep apnea is getting better now that he's lost a little bit of weight the funny thing about it is the cat was what we fought the most about but working together it has made our family a lot closer good Elvis and I have definitely brought it to this I couldn't imagine rheometer look at this smile on your face that's a nice smile you got your boy back yeah good I've learned through this process that family's the most important thing to me and having us each be accountable to Elvis and each other has bonded us in a way that I didn't think was possible you did wonderfully all of you guys did Thank You Jackson so much he's a cat I always wanted him to be and I will talk to you guys real soon okay thank you all right take care", "5cjjKydKE18": "a clue see a goose no a clue oh you see a clue where your phone

But try and be quiet so\nyou don't scare them away. Birds come in lots of\nsizes, shapes, and colors. Some birds are small and fly really fast, some like to hang out and get warm. Other birds love swimming in the water. You can see lots of\nbirds, just by watching. A pair of binoculars helps to see the ones that are far away. I like to bring a notebook\nto draw the birds we see. Birds are my favorite thing. I hope we get to go bird\nwatching again tomorrow.

We look it up! Getting the A to Z on\nthe alphabet, here we go. You can find letters of\nthe alphabet all around us. They're on street signs\nand even doors and windows. There are uppercase letters,\nwhich are letters that are big and there are lowercase letters, which are letters that are small. Some letters have straight\nlines, like the letter T, other letters have fun, curvy\nlines, like the letter S. When you put letters together,\nyou can sound them out and make all sorts of wonderful words. - C-A-T. - [Smartie] That spells cat. - Wow, Elmo loves C. The letters of the alphabet make words. - Yeah, it's pretty A-mazing. Well, I got a word search waiting for me. I'll Z you later. - Oh, Z you later! Thank you Smartie.

'Cause I'm so excited\nabout musical instruments. - Oh, well that's perfect Smartie, because Elmo wants to learn\nall about instruments. - Well, what do we do\nto learn something new? We look it up! Searching for instruments now. Neat, an instrument is\nanything you use to make music.

Sometimes you play musical\ninstruments with a special tool, you need a bow to play a cello. There are different kinds of instruments from all over the world, Taiko drums from Japan, the didgeridoo from Australia, and if you practice a lot, you can learn to make really\ncool music with instruments. - [Elmo] Wow, cool. Oh, thanks for looking\nthat up for Elmo, Smartie. - I love leaving on a high note. - Ah! - Bye bye. (upbeat music) - Bye, thank you Smartie. Boy, hearing all those\ninstruments gives Elmo an idea.

Let's listen to the first instrument. (piano music) Is this the right instrument? - [Children] No, that's a drum. - [Elmo] Hm, is that sound a piano? - [Child] That's it, it's a piano. You play the keys of\na piano to make music. - [Elmo] Let's play again. (drumming) Does this instrument make that sound? - [Children] No, that's a trumpet. - [Elmo] How about this?

We look it up! Let's see what we can\nlearn about siblings. A sibling is another word\nfor a brother or a sister. Families can have two siblings,\nor three, or even more. Some siblings may be younger than you, some siblings may be older than you, and some siblings might\neven be the same age if they're twins. Siblings may look like each\nother, or they might not. There are half siblings, step siblings, not everybody has a sibling, but if you do have a sibling, that means you're a sibling too. - Wow, there sure are lots of\ndifferent kinds of siblings. - Yeah, I love my older brother, Flip. - Yeah. - We phones have a strong connection.

Could these two be siblings? - [Children] Yes, they're\na brother and a sister. - [Elmo] That's right. Now how about these two, a boy and a lamp? - [Children] No. - [Child] Lamps aren't people. - [Elmo] Right, a lamp can't\nbe a brother or a sister, so a lamp isn't a sibling. How about all these boys and girls? Could this many people be siblings? - [Children] Yes. - [Child] They're all\nbrothers and sisters. - [Elmo] They're all\nsiblings, even the baby. Hi baby. Oh, is Elmo seeing double? These two look exactly alike. - [Child] That's because\nthey're identical twins. - [Elmo] Oh yeah, some\ntwins do look alike, so are they siblings? - [Children] Yes, twins are siblings. - [Elmo] Yay, good job everybody. Wow, there's so many\ndifferent kinds of siblings and that makes Elmo wonder even more. What do people do with their siblings? Hey, let's ask Mr. Noodle, okay? Hey Mr. Noodle! Oh, it's Mr. Noodle's\npet poodle, Schmoodle. Hi Schmoodle. Oh, Schmoodle, what do\nyou do with your siblings? Oh look, it's Schmoodle\nNoodle's sister, Floodle and their brother, Frank. - [Children] Schmoodle,\nFloodle, and Frank. - [Elmo] What do you all\ndo with your sibling? - [Child] They're running around. I think they're playing chase. - [Elmo] Siblings play\ntogether, looks like fun. - [Child] Now they're eating. - [Elmo] And they're sharing too, siblings share with each other. - [Children] Aw, they're tired. - [Elmo] And the best part of all, siblings care for each other. - [Children] Sweet dreams doggies.

There are four seasons,\nwinter is the coldest season, that's when it snows. Next, comes spring, spring\nis the rainiest season. The warm weather and the\nrain helps flowers bloom so springs smells great. After that, it's summer. Summer is hot, a good time\nto cool off in the water. Then comes fall, when leaves change color and fall from trees, but don't worry, they'll grow back next spring. I told you my favorite season is winter. - Yeah. - What's yours? - [Elmo] Well Elmo likes\nwinter, winter's cool, or spring, and summer, oh, and fall. - But that's all four, Elmo.

It rains a lot in spring. - [Elmo] And you dress warm in winter. - [Child] What's the carrot for? - [Elmo] Oh, you need a carrot\nin winter to make a snowman. Boy, the seasons are all so different.

Oh nice kite Mr. Noodle. - [Child] No, you don't\nwear a kite, you fly a kite. - [Elmo] What did Mr.\nNoodle wear last summer? Yeah, that's what you wear\non a sunny day Mr. Noodle.

our thinking chair right come on [Music]", "UyYSmpoxVbI": "[Music] [Music] [Music]", "uzIqzjb_6Tg": "how's it going guys so today i'm super excited because we're going to be setting up a naturalistic enclosure now in here i have my little young alpine blotch blue tongues that i'm holding back these guys are so adorable growing really well but i decided it's finally time to make something a bit more of a display a bit more natural looking a bit more fun for the animals because in these enclosures above i've got them all naturalistic so i want this whole bank here to look really nice and natural now if you haven't seen my last video i suggest going back because i made this fake rock corner piece and if you want to see how i made that make sure you go check out that video because we're going to be putting this in as well as a bunch of other things to make this nice and naturalistic so let's get started these guys are doing so great growing so well that one in the back there's actually about to shed and after seeing these guys in the wild not too long ago it's really you know excited me and reinvigorated my want to see these guys in a natural looking environment so whilst this does absolutely fine for them they're just on the pine shavings at the moment you know a bit of gum leaves from richmond some basic hides food and water which is totally fine for them but you know you guys know me i love looking at animals like they are in nature and having that real natural vibe here in captivity so we're going to upgrade all of this change it all around and i think you guys are going to like the result first things first we're going to clean all this out give it a nice clean down and get some new substrate in there and just because i could in the beauty enclosure here i've actually moved a couple of additions into there because they like it this one's sticking out his little head now it's actually moved a couple of the baby westerns in here and they just love running around in this enclosure and you know going crazy they had under this big hollow log and they just stick the little heads out in the morning for some warmth and it's such good fun seeing them in here first things first let's get all these little grumpy nuggets out of here come on these guys are so cool so these are predominantly from my second litter and my third litter of babies from this season and these are just my pick some of the little beauties so we'll go and pop them somewhere safe and let's start this enclosure [Music] and of course to give it a clean we're going to be using some f10 spray it all around let it soak for a while it kills all the bacteria and any nasties and then we can all wipe it all up now we've got the enclosure all cleaned out it's time for substrate and we're bringing out an old favorite the good old classic yuki mulch from bunnings this stuff's absolutely great really gives that good natural look and it's just a great substrate especially for blue tongue skinks it's really absorbent it holds back a lot of smell and because eucalyptus as well it really holds back any bacteria or fungal growth it's really good at that so it's just an all-around great substrate and if you make it deep enough the lizards can bury in it and it's just really great so let's pop that in now i want to put a decent layer of this in because i want a lizard to be able to bury another thing as well is i usually let the mulch dry out quite a lot before putting it in i usually sit in the sun or something like that but i haven't had a chance to do that with being so rainy and crappy weather lately but that's okay because a lot of those blues are actually shedding at the moment so the extra humidity in this mulch for a short period of time will actually be beneficial for them in helping them to shed let's get a whole bunch in here spread it out a bit i really want to make a deeper layer up in the back corner there where they sort of bury down and sleep for the night because i've got a special log that i'm going to put in there and i want them to make all tunnels now already it just looks so much more natural with this sort of wood-based substrate i do want to make a nice layer so we'll put a bit more in so now we've got our big substrate layer in it's time for decorations and the first thing we're going to put in is something i'm really excited about it's actually this big hollow log that we recently got i was lucky enough to get this thankfully um it was a much longer but i'll just cut it right there so it'd fit in here really nicely and yeah i think this is going to be a really good retreat for the lizards i'm going to put this over on the cool side so i'm going to try and put it somewhere over here let's see i'm going to bury it into the soil a bit i think something like that would be pretty cool because it's not perfectly flat underneath i'm hoping the lizards will make some little tunnels underneath it and stuff with different access points to it i think that'll be really cool along with that because it's quite tall they can use it for climbing and getting closer to that uv lamp i have just up here so they get a bit closer to that uv if they want and then it also doubles as a height of course now next we of course have our fake rock corner piece that i made in the last video and this is going to go yeah like i said right in the front corner i'm going to try and bury it down a little bit i am not too worried if they bury under anything because it is so light it wouldn't even crush them i'm just going to move this probe out of the way a little bit and i'm just going to cover it in a little bit and cover around the top i think to help it look like it's blended right in with the natural sort of formation now as far as solid decorations go that's going to be about it again it's going to be nice and simple for these guys they're in the young animals and i'd like to be able to access things if i need to get them out for health checks and things like that so we're really just going to keep it with that but what we are going to do is make it look even more natural using some real plants by real plants of course means some gum leaf branches as well as i've got some tea tree here so i'm going to put this around the place and see what looks good as well as i'm going to try and cover the whole floor of the enclosure with gum leaves for that real natural leaf little look try and place some of these around see what looks good pretty sure i'm going to put this tea tree in the back corner for a nice little bush and i think that'll sit right there pretty well yeah i like that that's cool another good thing about that is because it is under the uv as well and on that log they can also get partial uv you know that sort of dappled light under there now giving the animals multiple options which is always great so um yeah i always use uh real plants now i don't have fake plants in any of my enclosures anymore it's just a lot easier to just get the real thing and you know you can chuck it out if it goes bad and just get some new stuff and um yeah the animals you know really seem to like it good enrichment for them lots of different smells and things and it just looks a hundred times better [Music] all right so we've got all our decorations in all the leaf litter on the ground all we really need now is food and water bowl here's our water and we'll add some food later once we put the lizards in all right here we have it guys like i said it's a pretty simple setup you know it's got a hide area there but there's lots of enrichment you know lots of leaf litter lots of different plants and things they can crawl through it's going to really be helpful when they shed all those different textures they'll get every bit of shed off their body of course that rock over there is going to absorb some heat for them as well and just lots for them to do lots of climbing opportunities and everything so let's go grab the little terrors and see how they like it all right here we have little crazy critters let's pop them in and watch them explore around this is always the best bit there you go there's blend right in right away just like they're in nature i love it no doubt they are probably all going to go hide right away but that's fine they'll come out in due time lucky last number five there we go [Music] so [Music] thanks for watching guys i hope you had as much fun with this video as i did i just absolutely love setting up new habitats for the reptiles especially these little blotch blue tongues they are you know my favorite blue tongue species they're so rewarding to keep here in captivity and i can't be happier so subscribe if you want to see more videos like this more australian reptiles give it a like if you liked it and we'll see you next time [Music] you", "k4MpxoF6Lww": "hey guys it's madam Moria welcome back to let's play we music it's time to check out the last session in the custom Jam with all the Nintendo themes starting with Animal Crossing I love this song the details were chosen by Ramnath who wanted a normal tempo a pop style dog suit cat suit and hand bells I have pop in parentheses because I actually end up leaving the style default I tried the pop style and it sounded like really classy and just weird I don't even know what happened with it so I was like well I guess we'll leave this default so Ramnath that is why your style is changed but I think you'll like it anyway I really I loved how this turned out this was so so so cute I loved it so here we go I love the background Bubba Animal Crossing like seasons changing way to utilize the animals for this - I was really looking for that several people had this idea but this combination worked really well and I liked it best and a lot of people just had one like cat suit or the dog suit instead of both and this was actually the first like animal suit option so yeah I was really happy with this it took me a long time to choose so there are so many good choices this week there really were I am so proud of you guys I love all the fireworks back there too and how both my faces pop up oh gosh so anyway big round of applause to Ramnath thank you for making the Animal Crossing theme sound so animal ish and so cute I really did love it sing with the animal crossing we move on to KK blues the details were chosen by Guido four five six seven eight I don't know if that's how you say your name I wanted a harp a toy piano fast rock style and yeah I believe this person so sorry we don't actually wanted Luigi to play this but after I recorded everything I looked and I was like oh cool I think I did that no I used myself and I was just like oh no I messed up so yeah I apologize that you're not seeing Luigi right now I think what happened was I was looking at one of the other options for the singer and then I went back from a some choice option got that right anyway that aside let's listen I absolutely love how the toy piano sounds on the board like it really goes felt like a blues song just like an Elvis song or something thank you this song is actually really fun to play and I haven't really played it all that much but playing it I was like a little kid fun fact we know at the time god I don't even know how you say man I'm just gonna call you bleed oh when I looked up JK blues we know was the only one who submit us a song choice for this beat one and only and luckily it was really good and then I went back later and I saw one more so there were two total so big round of applause for Guido four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 500 now we're moving on to Wii Sports which was chosen by the mario 6 707 wanted to acoustic guitars castanets maracas a normal tempo and medes play this I think that's the thing like all three they're three out of four the songs on here wanted madam Wario to play that their song so then when it came time for Luigi's turn I goofed up all right well anyway I love that CD cover first of all because it pretty much just doesn't make any sense it looks like a snapshot now I don't understand what bad jazz is about zoom in on pictures it's like they're watching us I really do love this song those songs so cute and relaxing that's like good fond memories because of when I first got my Wii and this was the first we game I ever play I was just like oh my gosh I remember thinking back then this song is absolutely adorable are like so relaxing like I wanted to fall asleep to it I really want to play Wii Sports soon especially with summer coming up this song turned out really nice - I liked the two acoustic guitars it's like very very very few people chose that throughout this entire play and hey Luigi's in the music room - I think every time he's performed he's been in the music room I have no idea why it just always turned out that way because the song fits best in there kind of funny so anyway big round of applause to the Mario six seven oh seven again and here we have the last song of the custom jam we music chosen by I don't know if you go by atac\u00f3 or whatever Oh Oh taco whoa who wanted a piano electric guitar galactic horn saxophone beatboxer and a hand clap and one of the normal tempo and me to sing it this cover to anyway yeah this is probably my favorite I have to say this is my favorite out of all the ones I've played the last two days the the group the other ones were excellent - I loved all of them it's just like this one was the most fun to play I have to say and Kubas in the audience a lot of applause for this one tune in a lot of turns so I'm just gonna call you taco because that's easier taco provided us with our grand finale which was absolutely fabulous I loved this how this turned out and so thank you for providing us such a wonderful finale but of we music custom jail when the lead musically is perfect it's actually absolutely love how they galactic horn sounds in this it picked up really well and even the epic hands clap has returned I love how your hands are just little like balls if you're a normal me but you've got the end clap you get as a gentleman pair that audience you're like yeah this is the finale so yeah again let me know in the comments which is your favorite a speech well you thought because there is no voting this week this is it for custom damn wonderful finale big round of applause to Oh taco oh boo Taku great job taco funny story my cousin had a user name like that night used to call it ooh ooh something and it was really oh oh oh oh so that's why I get your name confused but anyway let me know in the comments what you think of the songs which was your favorite I'm still doing that I'm reserving the kind of little contest they you're not really contest but best of the best that I haven't really revealed yet at all for the end of the project so that's gonna be in the works and I really really really want to thank every single person who participated in the custom jam portion of this let's play people who submitted details every week who followed the rules posted the password listen to what I asked for the videos got totally unique with their options everybody who did any kind of submission like that it was great thank you so much for all your support and participation because this project would not even be what it is without your participation it wouldn't even matter so thank you so much to everybody and congratulations to everyone who got chosen see those of you who didn't thank you for not being like sore about it like I wasn't chosen and to those of you who weren't sore about I really appreciate it thank you for being great sports about it and just like supporting other people who were chosen and saying congratulations and all that because that really says a lot about who you are as a viewer and just as a subscriber so I have a lot of really really nice people out there to thank so that's why I wanted to take a minute and say something about that and I really didn't have hardly any complaints and the ones I did I just kind of ignored because I was just well I mean if you're that worried about it then you probably aren't grasping the concept anyway because it's not about oh this person gets chosen they're awesome it's about you know this person everybody's participating and it's about the participation of all the subscribers just coming together and trying to be a part of this and you just by submitting details you're automatically a part of this whether you're chosen or not so yeah I really really appreciate it it means it means everything with this project to me so it's been a lot of fun it's been a lot of fun and next week I will show off the other portions of the game I can't remember it might be two weeks more that we have of this let's play I think it is because there is a lot of fun stuff that's like extra aside from the custom game that's really hilarious and I love it so we'll check those out like in the next couple weeks and then a new project starts so anyway I just really wanted to say thank you to everybody and give everybody props for submitting details and really getting the hang of this - I know it was kind of iffy at first and like what are we doing and everybody like posted the same thing and it was like whoa I don't think anybody's getting this so by the like third video I feel like majority of people were like okay I get what I'm supposed to do now so I I'm glad that that confusion was cleared up because that was kind of a mishap on my part but kind of it was a mishap on my part but um yeah so just thank you so much to everybody who participated and thanks for making let's play Wii music what it has been so far and what it will continue to be so thanks guys I will see you for more of this project next week and peace out", "e1-tgBeiKbw": "now now lads here we are two [Music] four six

another issue of grim work scum corner issue 8 issue with issue 8 I'm Tony and I'm here with Rome let's get to the flop this is obvious this is what BP RDW know number one it's Hellboy without he'll would ya BPRD is the bureau for paranormal research and I want to say research and development anything you write because regular R&D is research and development bottom out of the defense for like detective agencies or me anyways if you lay Hellboy has everybody has a fire take your hands if you rest a little bit of like what was going on like the I guess the previously page because I was like a whole page which was just like supposed to be like a tasty briefing oh yeah buddy next to it where they were showing you where the writers aren't everything apparently the BPRD has lost like a whole bunch of members yeah like they've been killed well I know that help was about the dead the Deardon he's gone to buy he's been gone for a while and he'll was gone - yeah wouldn't help so they were all like well do we do I'm here still [ __ ] demons and [ __ ] to be out there yeah I forget the AL is live the Miss comic book and she's kind of like one of the main focal points she has like a new boyfriend again I don't know when this happens because I haven't read Hellboy in a long long time I really should homeboy when you train the bring him back I read it I read I read Hellboy in hell that was the last thing that remember but if I remember correctly Hellboy hells must be a 12 issue mid like a 12 issue series mhm and then the first six came out and then after that like they took like literally like a year and a half off my god my heard it was coming back never break my guess is a new not a beanbag pen style maybe Mike Mignola is really picky about Hellboy in particular RFP BPRD he plots for and there's another writer on this one I didn't get his or her name but it has a different art sound and what Mineola Mamola usually does and remind me of the gorillas yes weird it's heads headland if you like having kind of thing like rope thick black lines a lot of stuff you like the look on it was good but for an issue one I was lost yeah and I was kind of like wait I know I was telling you before we actually said Rowling was that BPRD is a bunch of mini series that connect to each other so then I slightly minifigure those of your fan your fans yeah exactly and I've I've always been a fan it's just it's kind of hard together to be PRD and Hellboy I don't want to start from the beginning again but I want those beautiful beautiful beautiful library editions those being oversized hard covers if you ever seen them they're beautiful and honestly just pick them up for whatever you get them because they're like I think 40 bucks regular or 50 bucks regular but you should definitely pick them see I know I know hell would I know how boy yeah you know yeah I hope we were talking about regular how you slay the dragon to die you know how the she might spot me I know Liz just to be his fired telekinesis girlfriend and you have the Abraham the water dude yeah then you have whatever sidekick they gave hell away which was just a regular human which I think the original one got killed no no there's no necessarily like sidekick but you know how the the VBR the kind of give him a watcher expel tih it is a human and i know he became like real close friends of them and i don't know one of the issues the kiloton yeah i know the original listen and enjoy genome like another dude in the ayah yeah and he goes through quad yeah sure I kind of expendable other than that that's like that's how boy world for me Daniel there's just Hellboy century look Lynette I think that discover cuz to me uh I read I read since the Hellboy whatever is trying to come back there um to me the cover look like Hellboy was human that's what I felt like if you were giving your boy human body then hello looking nice man but the art when you're the girl isn't my like the gorilla so I'm going to give it so chance mm-hmm so good read but if you could who would I carry through yeah your loss yeah it's weird because there's like no one real special except their lives like liz is the only one that you can remember from the pinellas series other that everybody's kind of new and you know [ __ ] going on well they were focusing on the soldiers like the regular yeah that's all soldiers yeah whatever it is I was like why are they so focused on the are they like important to the agency yeah again really good story it seemed like an effusion but you know who they are so you can't be like oh man what if they did they're like oh okay [ __ ] happen I said very weird a lot yes I go to reason and it it's just it like it's minimally interesting enough to get you to pick up issue to you know there's no real big reveal at the end so you little done on it is like it feels like big series was the issue would yeah but I mean it's cool the the things that they're fighting in here are actually pretty cool I like them we have more hammer the more hammer 40k stuff I don't know if you ever saw the tyranids well yeah the buzz be an Indian yeah they look like the the xenomorph some alien they're kind of reminiscent of that and that's why I kind of like this but yeah I'm going to think about is YouTube they are going to read images and you can go who that completing the hell when I can do this still in the comments yeah put in the comma we have do doc yeah it was a little summer or what's going down and go and the Hellboy one flat enough for this issue pick it up she could read you'll be lost well gain to a I like this one it was it was okay I army picked updation for this yes and it was interesting so I my body again yeah it was a good read I like what they're doing because for a while we had this conversation where I think all Robins are [ __ ] crap and turns out that the teen x thinks he's entitled Brett yeah then just because he once is he wants an army instead of a team and there's one panel in here with these boys trying to find like nah you know you're making members quit and you're just firing people is like you sure to be here human Starfighter believe yeah but there is a there is a one than yours you can't tell us what to do you're supposed to bring as unite yeah like a team supposed to be united you want something that we're not and and [ __ ] robbers let me know help it is like but you do need help because you're over your head yeah but you see he has as Batman pride like I could do it no you eat your daddy boy that's the whole thing there's like even a conversation 20 greatest or yes the whole thing between Batman I mean Robins unsure of his leadership position and even asked like Batman is like howdy heels to justice leaders how do you meet them how do you make them unified and cohesive team and he's just like first of all and if I tell them just what to do not really explaining what he should do just telling them what to doesn't give advice he gets man exactly and that's Batman that's just what he is in the core demons like you company what to do right there why I asked her how exactly but the whole thing with Black Manta and Aquaman plays good comedy kill which that is what was a really good story what I like harridan everybody knows I like piracy I giving you our story this is good - it's like Pirates meet Alaska's nice magic there now is Mike eleazar's very treasure there's looking for bidding things and there's Maslin everything but I was so focused on the best hate robbery Kansas shame I was like this focus on Deborah the whole mess and his son and his ex baby mama yeah okay moving on so little is it a sword like I said pirates when it has everything as treasures and maps and magic and everything yeah I mean it's it's a bad comic book it's just like there's maybe a little bit like wonky writing for me like it's it's not as well written as some other comics but it's still a decent Tomica still but I'll see that cuz it jumps right the idol somewhat jumps too much but that's kind of the whole thing with Michael with 15 billion is that there's a lot of different plot lines that you try or a lot of those different lines for the plot that you're trying to weave in any kind you can only you can only give them that you would be patient yeah like what I say is that trying to give you this main story which is the black mamba that requires the team's help teams breaking down the trying to find out who the real leader is and how to control that's what it is yeah and I mean that's a good thing about team times other things that team science has always been about drama so there's always these different you know all these these different stories within it that you can find the one that you like and hope that they kind of expand on yeah I want you reading this series is good hey oh good that seemed good things be said I have my reverse really huh sometimes a lot too sure but after a couple of like it's following like the animated so lately you'll just in any good teen tiny interior I think I like it I like it girl they're they're even referring to everything I fear anything to has the Titans or Robin we kind of just dealing with it yeah the whole desktop stuff and the whole Superman Superboy or the whole thing maybe I was like okay they touched up on and so is they it Canon yeah the Kennex or is America right yes so it's a good read it's not the best read top I figure the week but it is a fairly decently I didn't know Robin hate in there to keep me expect here's mom money keep the Machine of it there's enough black man sir because I just like Black Manta yeah he's a weird one yeah I'm always doing Black Manta mainly because the loss command away Geoff Johns Rotem these human regional powers he has no power each is a either stressor answer basically yes all unions about these which is you gain a backstory yeah you're getting a lot of Baxter with Aqualad and like you got the father-son relationship that never was and what the hell's going on you gained a character death yeah exactly I'm sorry let's go pick up the other it's good read ten books always good now another real good one not think of the Wigner because it's a little it's variably yes whatever but one of the things that I noticed about this comic is that ending is kind of out of left field it really is for all our recent my yeah I bought this on maintaining travel stories I write each week we make a list right and one of those goes to common shop and pick some up so you get ready for the week and stuff like that right yeah it was a little weird we for comics everything's like Midway see they don't even know where the summer events are going whatever yeah so you know we're trying to try to give you whatever we think is the best we want to cover you know like oh you know issue one because it had that Power Rangers whatever have like a whole bunch of power and they had a [ __ ] venom verse let me down to them oh yeah so you know knowing that those titles are going to let us down kind of I usually spoiler on them but I calmness it was a yeah and I was like you read actually comics right sounds like oh man we didn't I hear comes apart to a fly and [ __ ] it wasn't it yeah it's not so much a fighting issue there's a goal that thought had from the very beginning true that was good it was a good good it's really really good it's a policy if you see that Zod is literally the anti Superman Superman Superman powers doesn't have any of his ideals their skill yeah exactly so it's the interesting is a little out of left field two things I didn't know what was going on particularly in action comments beforehand yeah we started off suddenly like yeah yeah exactly but it does wrap it up in a way that's going to continue and that's all I'm excited about the next few issues and because the ending is so kind of I wouldn't say a letdown it's just so anticlimactic but there's just a little hope and what is not as saying that's going to continue a story later on you guys are the last issue you guys know that teams all over the state super soon right they got trapped in the fun zone yes so you thought it'd be more fun right so in this one of course you know and then he had Superman with that whole blindness and stuff like that so much apparently if you're going to if Amazon you're blind you get cured of that if the locusts they explain yeah Ben zoom there's a way to keep them forever so they have to they get the whole thing with the bottoms on fire remember correctly like before this some of its still this way but basically a phantom makes you a phantom like the longer you stay in there the longer you lose your memories of being outside of the bounds own and you start losing like your your physical body yeah so the whole premise of the message is that oh we're going to go to the fan zone we're gonna get users ID the army and you get an army but not the one you think yeah it's a UH very little father's just a mobile army we had this time I'm talking money but if we talk about you know the whole yeah it really does yo exploiters and still you like okay I'd much rather hear read the comic that's good is good especially if you can go to a website and like see where this arc started like how many issues back it was because that's what I'm going to do because I want to read it honestly I'm going to start picking up shows I the characters are like people are just Tolson yeah you know they promise lean on the Greek for real another thing is the art is actually really good right I mean how all follow Superman coming here art was really good ours is actually pretty damn good I like it a lot honestly though he's a Superman Zod especially the way he's awesome mongrel you know the way he like even kind of a more boxy shape but which instead panel with mongrel was like really early I was like that mm does the van alright what was Paul that I mean it's not out because you know what it's not a big thing but it's a funny thing it is 180 like it goes back to my point of obvious people this note so everything's mean question [ __ ] mom goes like really do it and I'm this I goes well you might a university choice yeah he wants like another battle planet basically where you can just fight everybody games like yeah I'm going to give it to you just upper customer than that [ __ ] the uppercut them all the way to the [ __ ] space yeah babies like please like go state your pledging dollars later and then Basel I was like a shitty lying or is just like I'll come back for use I already not movie sleep I mean damn mother it's zero gravity so he's just blowing around down yet she legislators like the Superman and Kryptonians gonna fly so I know that that's why they can like movie in ma who can apparently breathe in the atmosphere well the Indian Radia but can't uh we can't do any has no propulsion yeah they're so easily like oncoming get yourself home over the like coal and on like a planet and it'll be full of Green Lantern's or something because honestly that's part of like if you've never read the Green Lantern's where mongrel becomes far the Sinestro Corps your [ __ ] missing out yeah there it's great that's where I learned like like mongrel biosketch Achilles just looking bruises like one uppercut like mad really hey well I mean he got you got bitched out in Infinite Crisis oh you remember that one yeah I'm gonna beat up old burgundy caught me at the end like okay the end the Ranma spoil the ending here give the name of the issue that's coming out yeah and it says Lex Luthor's laughter yeah we just called know like like legends not me inner coming was happy my soul thing is like you thought it was part of just like for a while so they got me I'm a sucked over there I wanna remember you actually cause baby Superman he's a good character you've got to go in the chain and you got you gotta give him a chance people get the chance you know what this comic I like except for [ __ ] Superman the whole Cummings little [ __ ] alive you know what to do he's like my girl vision his [ __ ] morally pozzolan always is like a soldier character he's like losses of red hot blooded American humans me she's like she has this book and go on and you so have always been the dynamic like Lois has always been to go get it well like I said I'm very much Superman comics you seem like your [ __ ] that's what Superman was about Lois Lane he's just like yours literally like what a human being imply here the embodiment of all human hot sexy female you're just another aliens all good I've had it with my salad like you're just really you're like [ __ ] you I'm gonna [ __ ] you up I want to do what I want Chen Zhen reporter mentality I bring into the story yeah and man Superman to me still seems like a [ __ ] but then again I think of that about everybody in DC heroes um we're looking at all the heroes thing like a little [ __ ] and family [ __ ] but I'm not you want like I'll row it to what you like in comic and I know you like question kids right there load me up like I said I like Shazam because he has an internal struggle and like you want but they all kind of have their own my brother's rebel is been that confident Boy Scout no they do have their own internal struggles because the thing is that Superman is more like the ultimate immigrants like he caves - but you need you know you know where it's gonna go the meat is bad for you they don't break Superman yeah little driver even know what he dies he bends like no yes again mom oh I know who you like I'm back in LA and we continue being this no no that's not the Superman that we have in these comics is not our Superman like the student right now we know from the new 52 that some of Superman that's in Action Comics in the medicine this is another Superman so this is not Ken because in any husband because what happened with rebirth is this Superman with his family is apparently the original Superman that we knew yeah one day darling can beg ya the 190 yeah there are some yes he died he came back a minute oh yeah boys go soon that means the but he's never changed that was always there he died never change oh the point in saying that he did change the sister you never read the comic where he did change is because when he came back he was in the blue suit and he was like full of electricity he was he became the red Superman so I mean he has different arts it's just again you never read Superman apparently they got you they got you alone she didn't it doesn't matter and I was around doing it everywhere they are visible all the pack of evil comes together religion is bad Superman wha what is the P in Justice Society identity stuff yeah I like a group of bad guys is a group of good guys and I was like okay I'm just saying like Superman like I'm a Superman fan and doesn't know no we are melodiously I'm taking out Superman out of it I'm still region be like damn it's good but it wouldn't be as good because Superman's not theirs do Ren I should be there because it's inning in a game I'm sorry the lot lower than the kid you can't have your heavy you can't have the end without the yang be a girl a token this goes in fun is this a I'm sorry how much should I think every side I like to end this event yeah I usually always villains villains villains uh you know keeping there because if the will is good you want to see how they're going to overcome that true basically another type of buzzes Boy Scout I'm sorry that was good oh I shoulda say it's got him he loves Superman he doesn't know it yet you love Vegas but that wasn't me talking about I'll be above that guys this littles like you yeah I got it I got it use me weapon and that because I like you blues uncle [ __ ] Boonton I'm [ __ ] depress American like everybody's looking out so I saw this cone I'm like huh okay the name is Justin government again I'm a sucker for [ __ ] that has to deal with heaven earth the hole isn't there I did not believe in [ __ ] I read a couple pages like ah all right Bernardo I forgot about 50 then I started reading and I was like oh [ __ ] really then I can't read I was like now you know what think of the week it has to be pick of the week it gives you it's an any of income right yeah I mean I've never heard of scout comics I don't know what what independent that is I mean as far as I know this is the only comic book but you know what I have here that my fingers I hadn't checked out all right so because the things you're freakin weak it is nothing going on in mythical week it's heavenly bloops it deals with heaven earth heaven in hell and it's all [ __ ] amazing to like you were mean to me like all this action-packed comic because he starts off with some dude I wish you hadn't to do in the comics and any goes to hell it's fun it's fun to compare somebody having them not good huh good health right and then how you found out that is so on this help right it's a you're free to do whatever you want like there's other people in Hell but what happens is you get partnered up with someone and they torture you mm-hmm and it's their job to torture you so much because you're in a crater they keep up with these people Union is your own jobs get out of that crater and overcoming and you get to live in hell yeah it's [ __ ] it's actually kind of on the story rolls are wrong in 1930 thief which he had the whole castle Balinese baby-faced thing where he wanted to be famous to be a thief yeah he has the goddamn it uh what's the [ __ ] that [ __ ] famous couple funny and Colleen cotton yeah like they were enough for money but more of her fame yeah any one of these things you want to be known as that you want to leave his mark in the world as of these but you know [ __ ] happens and he dies and he's in hell and then he gets partnered with this his 12 year old little girl and who days be young cause she she's [ __ ] mean and ruthless look and talk like a sailor when you're loved yeah and they're there you're taking be rich is like and the dis compatible sounds like there's dirt intelligent in there yeah the things goes man I do miss Cole beer and the little girls drinking beer she's like like died before I could taste the beer is well you know [ __ ] you that's how I literally she says like what you exchanger but the whole thing is right so he thinks is the thing sees and for some reason an angel comes down and gives them a what is that called he gives them a mission no not me and then also Needham oh no now I oughta make them is you either it's like extremes like in industry measure the whole thing is agent comes down down he goes I need a thief and you see it's still something from God yeah from from his [ __ ] secret you [ __ ] for the Archangel he said I heard you guys are the best things and help yeah you I'll let you into heaven you still yeah if you seal it and guess what he said haven't you don't turns out that Purgatory's are prison yeah I'm gonna follow they don't go back and how well they're free to do whatever they want yes took in his parallel with angels in back I think that the sole reason well that's the whole thing is like this thing that they're ads like everybody thinks from hell is like fire and demons and torture and all that their version of hell is basically purgatory where it's you're trying to kind of work off your your deeds basically because I'm very sorry is on your sins but it's more representative of like earth there's actual building like they said what they were at a barge I can get her things like that so that's an interesting take it's there when they do offer when he does offer them the chance to get back into heaven if interesting just because what is the Angels real motive here yeah you know you can tell that something's going on yeah it can go one of two ways he's just trying to get something just to trick them to have fun basically or he's tricking them play hints right like a head and more yeah like a heaven war basically what Ceaser I'm final is good I mean if the thing is though the main character would you to do the cover then the dirty Steve yeah he's scared of it because he goes along marine hell and he says we have freedom health and we do anything to piss off the devil or God we're going to end up in purgatory which is a prison yeah the little ghost heart I usually like I want to turns out they explain the thief's like life and really became one to help me what the little girl has a bad story where she doesn't think she belongs in hell yeah that in the ages she was born and she did the [ __ ] she had to do to survive and Hannah died for it yeah which is like I don't want to be now no more getting chance to go to heaven would do anything yeah so I get to thinking with you link interesting this character in [ __ ] and again like magic heaven hell and then all questions of morality and degrees each other it's a very basic story it's something that again well we're talking about last week where it's like things that you've seen already but there's different ways to handle it like you kind of see this type of story you know bad guys a good guy offers the bad guys a chance to redeem themselves and look like they're all that guy yeah exactly and that's what you see like in win something uh but the thing is it's well written I mean it's not it's not terrible it's not it fantastic it's just it's very good right it's uncoil open it it reads a good goosal yeah I treasure to the blue [ __ ] you know like every blue song has a story of like heartache and [ __ ] and history is like that yeah it's really [ __ ] good there but and it turns out a bad guys have a hard go because the agent was there's this under the tongue real quick yeah the angel was laughing at the dudes in help they know like you know I wouldn't do anything wrong to you because I love you and I'll keep an eye out for you and then he goes hollers love and he'll ironic yeah it's like weeks of humans bubbles like what but yeah guys heavens held heart of gold think it looks really good really good Oh it'll be interesting the characters in the art is weird too the art is kind of reminiscent of like Manoa which is a really weird thing whether this whole really is yeah and it kind of has that side you can tell that they're heavily influenced by that because the characters kind of have like a weird kind of angular face is kind of weird you and the way that the bow learn if you if you look at Hellboy comics and how their lettering is done and how the water bubbles are placed it's very reminiscent of that so you see that they have a lot of influence from Manila that's cool I like that and that's part of the reason why it's my car running out for it was good you gotta go to the lake like I say it was right into the rectum yeah I'm looking at a photo Scout stuff Scout comics comm ring tip they have a comic called a last stator Alaska cater it looks like a like a mr. plastic kind of thing well it's like mr. plastic meets invincible I think he's the [ __ ] cover is him in the mean go to prison yeah there you go then they have something called fish eye which caught my eye wink wink I mean because it's by massimo rossi which i've heard of and then the artists the follow cars carlos le and these are two names that I've heard of and I do like the weird art style if they have oh that's so amazing out loud of the original run of the old man Logan Feeny if it's really interesting hearts also I might pick up fish I like in the back of the Commons you know hunting there's so much really good [ __ ] Tigers new caught my eye well I've never heard this company yeah I've never heard of you but it was really good guys speak up apparently they have like Flash Gordon like pulp comics they have this one that's really anime inspire called Gary John you should help dokyum so although this little a Megan it looks like manga well it actually looks pretty cool it looks like old school my old school manga and anime which I'm a fan of so yeah um yeah so yeah then heavily booze just came out and then something called henchgirl that hits your lips babies as well though they call to get up there so scout scout comic could be there for us support your indie comics they also have apparently licensee deals of a andcb FC and e-discovery Disney Fox History Channel Hulu Lions pit Marvel MGM NBC paramount Sony summit Universal and all these cuz there's my Hannity show sometime yeah I wouldn't mind saying this will show how they go make a really good trip yeah I mean I really ladies if we're so what and then I take this again I'm not watch them then that takes us all to kill oh oh watch it watch it I told over the first episode okay but enough will mop it the way down to a road Nickelodeon my big leaguers of course wordy and weird I do patrol some Wow I like yeah are any of umbrella Kennedy yeah the art is like Michael Allred kind of stuff if you know who Michael over it is he did a mad comics or madman Alice is asleep in these stuff really really cool honestly I just like it it's an odd story it is a little way that beeping oh [ __ ] yeah beep we tell people wise difficult in this house police roll the night because I was like a Roman you know comics where we were in see where it said that yeah and we might like this I mind when it wasn't popular this was good hey go you might worry scooby-doo comics yeah it reads like that means like you know how you wanna watch like dumb like TV Pearlman and those could be doing it but beginning to end you have everything yeah I love scooby-doo and the are real ideas out of why everybody's scooby-doo knows like okay it wasn't it was worthy a so that's one of the reasons it like cleans the stories good but like I said comics that were he just yeah it's very pop art the pop art panels I mean it's exactly what do personal should be boom Patrol is of course the what was their catch time the craziest superheroes are like the the weirdest superhero something like that the on bones superhero pretty much so if you know any of the do control characters they're pretty much in here it's a one-shot just because the guy that kind of made all the Doom Patrol and had these different experiment comes back thief and he if you don't know this this is pretty well known that he's a and a gambler like an excessive gambling so this whole issue is him trying to square away his debt and trying to get the Doom Patrol back patrol doesn't like it and there's little nuggets in there that are going to lead to a full story this is kind of a one-off story that's setting up the next arc it just a day between issue when you're not it was good wordy I mean that's what a digital comic is I mean since Grant Morrison had written it in the 90s and Gerard Way was the singer of my cup aroma he didn't know he was actually Grant Morrison assistant commander has some stories yeah and if you don't know I think he had like a two-part interview with Kevin Smith yeah he did well you well he is yes Sarah pretend I'm in Kim's mother like only but of you the fat man I'm Batman yeah podcast where he's trying to explain his a young animal studies India he goes aren't weren't you the the assistant Sakura paramours like do know that do what he's like you dig I'm like weird so who he had me beat entirely focuses that you know shadows Kingston is like your kind of the reason we do this stuff too yeah I mean obviously a boy other comics and gets paid to do it I want the you I mean I was to a lot of your podcast with Angela check oh boy i watch your movies even though kind of up there on canadian sausage Nazis were doing I don't see my ass in that one no I think that toughs I like this because I like the actual tough costume yeah mainly that ending was kind of weird but I did like the costume the Gaza was really cool and I liked that he brought his daughter to fame yeah I am in the Johnny Depp's daughter apparently the parents like going on there but you know it's not work on what we're talking about this Doom Patrol it is a very wordy so if you don't like wordy comics don't pick it up if you don't like pop art don't pick it up but if you do a lot of those things and you'd be like reading stories that aren't necessarily cohesive intended necessarily cookie dough young shot it is what it is the one shot leading to something big yes I actually have moments where elves laughing because there's such weird things that are in there yeah all the comic there's things called scamp's that feed on bad memories or not bad memories bad ideas which I thought was bugging hilarious so yeah it's like really weak just because I like weird it is good out and good yes good and it reminds me again because it was so many goddamn cartoon there is a teeny tiny heart where bees boy was hard to do patrolling and they're trying to get them back yeah I put your mind in yeah and then she's kind of coming back together kinda need you this little meat yeah I like my okay I mean I know who don't for Joan isn't [ __ ] you may kill me Alan really know the characters like that I putting [ __ ] on them yeah but it was good actually I should finish Grant Morrison's run we have there's like seven graphic novels they grab Morrison divergent boobs oh yeah Rock seven graphic novels worth I only have like two or three three easy right no no these are like characters from the sixties way they were around the time of excellent that's why I like them an x-men are kind of like compared a lot because x-men are odd superheroes either otter because they don't have like a gazelle grand Morse's really dude other than my chemical woman and no super jump yeah I think like the big names are very doing because that said he stopped writing and kind of just died down yeah I think after him and might have been Brian cave on I'm not too sure there was a lot of writers for Doom Patrol show and then you hear like the virtual me father against us until he picked you up again never had the name but that really gets people going so yeah yeah but you can't just names not long a good story is what written it's quirky it's weird and odd it's like reading a circus in the form of a comic they'll have all these characters a why are they together but he worked yeah so I'm gonna say yes they have a little drawing in the back of flex metallo FX metallo is the Grant Morrison character and he's like a a circus strongman yeah that goes through different dimensions it's [ __ ] I like that you just take it out guys you won't find it weird be like huh okay yeah play enough of the flop is that was our pick for last week nope we're going to get to the tray bag yeah this was a little weird I've heard so much good things about it and they're like egg you should pick it up as a good tray back and some of that this made me realize two things hey I like weird art and B I'm not much of a sci-fi way yeah if I was uh not much of a whole science space and here dimensions you're magic I'm magic come on I'm a guinea elves and and [ __ ] witches in war like mm I still kind of just me I've never really liked they always say like oh you're very sci-fi or fantasy guy and I'm pretty much in the middle I like both yeah I thought about that yeah I thought it was that I was middle yeah Angie serving more sight bison are you care yeah and the thing is like I tend to lean towards by five and you haven't caught the nerd conversation I know everybody has them they're like low the ring Star Wars Harry Potter or Star Trek and how you go throw such a [ __ ] out of here I should scar [ __ ] I'm like um I like Star Trek I don't my night let me sorry you know I was in the middle cause I always said before the radio until I watched Harry Potter is like hey far as number-10 I mean I I haven't seen all Harry product obviously I'm almost gonna personal I am the third one and like part of the last one but I've been all over the place with there but um yeah I mean I'm truly in the middle like you know not very watching like bear movies like willow widows like [ __ ] magic yeah Constantine Nigeria what does the [ __ ] is a legend magic like Harry Potter and all you even a sources president Nicolas Cage yeah I like all right so guess what the bandages was this one here and it wasn't for a good story I wouldn't I was on this trip I go yeah the story gets me more you forgot to change the treatment mm-hmm it's black science yeah black pants written by Rick Remender is strong by Mateos Guevara or Amedeo still are Dale I'm missing an Iranian we know that dosa and my favorite colors and the game bean white use a lot of purples a lot of Blues a lot of greens they said mala art was really good yeah it makes the weird monsters are fine seem like agile creature they're like a ones earlier and just coming to find like frog often reminds me I would picture the by lagoon yeah elephant well then I'm gonna I'm a fan of the classic monsters and I was like okay here's my favorite monster like I say the whole oh this is plain real quick it's about a dude who wants recognition for being a scientist but he wants to push the limits of science yes and he creates something called the pillars and the pillars turns out they're keys to travel into enter dimensions of multiverses they call it and verse in here unless you have reverse or something like that yeah something like that I can't remember stuff my head they also be everybody just read it I'm kind of bad with that kind of stuff I'm that one names begin later and he traveled to different universes yeah basically right and in order to do that he has to tap into something called black science which is forbidden yeah it's nice like under black fine yeah but he testing to him but he you as you read this book by not that he said [ __ ] yes that he the bad husband a bad father and [ __ ] expect general because he's all about getting recognized it's all work you know he hasn't stolen on the [ __ ] laboratory and it's work work work work work so he finally gets you know this thing running he drives his family into this [ __ ] which is was like damn why yeah but he does because he became the he did make a glee gatos me [ __ ] awesome yeah the anarchist little Anakin League of a scientist yeah but it looks like that's what cool that he gets always like it crazy sciences are following him all these anarchism is where they're all met Sciences they just call them anarchist and understand that's a big thing with Rick Remender his independence it's all about like the anarchist outsider doing something another one of his good ones a deadly class which we might review later but you know black science is it's not as very like hardcore science fiction it's just advice fiction elements become to do yes you look you go to trip he's realizing that he's Bishop yeah that the choices in life that he did were wrong right the science fiction is stuff is in the background yes because he was a shitty quitter Sam he don't hit he was hosts headstrong he was so unprepared to [ __ ] cost him a lot of [ __ ] mmm-hmm so your youth Turkey them [ __ ] craziness yeah by the end of the comic there's a turning point for the main character he has kind of a change of heart it's not much of a spoiler because it happens well I think the first issue or second issue his wife dies and a third page yeah there's another thing I like I do like about the comment it jumps straight into this yeah it really does it's like gum it gives you the backstory later like him being like a scientist and why they're there okay it goes out of order it's like a 70s episode like Sify whether you're there you find a monster and you hear the narration well I got [ __ ] up that's how to start the third rule Bob story laughter yeah sorry this parts going to miss the [ __ ] running from these creatures I'm [ __ ] and he's like aw man here's like inside instead of being like ha tell me I got to this far should've [ __ ] up it should that in the Sun like page three the wife gets like a spirit of faith yeah he was about to embrace her and be like you know I'm sorry like shut the top hey frogman [ __ ] daughter Evelyn row but yeah it's it's a very interesting car I you can't say much about it well tell you later [ __ ] blows a lot of [ __ ] it's really it's a very simple comic idiom they've scared development big yes and everyone's around this is one dude hmm fine eighteen is like Bush yeah then it is real [ __ ] up where it's just like you're just going to do that I think I'm not saying it's Game of Thrones or nothing anything like that I'm saying it it has those kinds of don't get attached to certain yes Sean Bell yeah yeah ain't nobody safe yeah but it is a really good comic I think it's the first five issues I think for this one I'm not mistaken I came it easy the existence music but yeah but escolar work what they old scholars actual art is awesome I like the way that if it's kind of sci-fi because he uses like the characters have really thin arms but like kind of barrel chest and like these really angular faces and like pointy nose they're kind of weird characters but it works for this because you know within the first few pages that they're going to go through these different universes it was like have you ever played with those own like it was used to be like a lava lamps mm-hmm or you could put your finger umeela giggle yeah yeah like that liquid goop that's what this part feels like yeah I'm like the base of it is all eat like a goop differently research stretching now it turns out to me you know these uh creatures and humans and they're different colors in this weird sense and being light that gives us book like assertive like color palette that works like it just works for and I hope that it changes when you go to different universes but he uses like I said he's a lot of purples and that's weird in comic books because you don't see purple and start but he's using like purples and he's looking like he's really like vibrant blues he's using bike these really like rich greens it's really weird there's a color palette look quite as great ready but yeah Rick Remender is always a good rider these rims on my favorite comic belly class or your agent yeah so you like size on your like Game of Thrones you like weird character development you like goofy crazy awesome part pick it up super story you'll be like an animal a man it's all the book gets a little bit like why what [ __ ] well yeah it leaves you kind of want a little more cuz you that ending is so I want to say [ __ ] up it's just so like out of nowhere that it's like oh how is this going to continue and your policy on makes you think of you don't have time for a family [ __ ] you make it think yeah I mean in all work no play not a good life no but yeah you know that's gonna be the true book for this week we're gonna get down

good comment it is elsewhere number one and the reason I put this one up here is because this is just odd they're making things out of anything basically else world number one is Amelia Earhart great yeah it's what she did when you thought her plane crashed oh she listened yeah so then you're thumper didn't know father but I just [ __ ] take the bitty page would pretty much it might be a galactic tin it's a weird name galactic 10 number one ghost station zero number one the reason put that one on there is because it's from the creator of that atomic blonde movie I'm going to be pretty good so it's his idea again just like this is a sorrows probably an idea somebody else is going to write it I'm not saying anything else as it's all I'm saying GI Joe a Real American Hero number 242 Green Hornet 66 meets spirit number two hillbilly number seven the reason I put that on there that is one of my favorite writers that is Warren Ellis he's a crazy English bastard but I ever tell you but yeah we're doctor misprint come in town yeah cuz Garth Ennis which they people always get those confused I can see why because it's [ __ ] they both have batshit crazy ideas for the young garden is when they rights boys and preacher yeah where Warren is the one that does the war once he does he does uh like trans metropolitan he recently wrote Moon Knight to restart it run around so crazy enough to convey exactly and each one was different and it was awesome so I fell down in there injection number fourteen PS number ten I don't want to put that on there actually hey cuz well yeah kiss let's really do now he has to be another deep enough of another thing that you have to win marks to know number one roster Johnson man Jackie O really good today yeah losses out soon as far as the halfway universe really yeah alright a a mock cadet you number one which i think is written by Gregory Peck who doing that generations Hulk it's kind of like that is it that young shellack on whatever I can run enemy school yeah ah Evangelion Nina alien there you go where apparently robots come once a year to earth and pick up cadets so they can pilot them ha I have no idea what's going on there but Robo tech number one what they just did I have a typo here that - seven - is charted number eight sex criminals number 20 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ongoing number 73 Tarak number one they're bringing back Torah and then Walking Dead 170 and what's 34 yeah I heard they walking in from the indocin yeah there was a recent interview with Robert Kirkman he was like I don't know what to do with the walking dead anymore so it's coming to an end I don't know exactly when that is but he's heading to 200 well he was supposed to end it at 100 he was a regular [ __ ] ended at 50 50 50 was supposed to be like the one that was like I was just named it there because it kind of leads to an ending it seems like we're just gonna die and Carl's just going to be able to kid left alone but he continued it and then they were saying like oh one has it's got to be 100 it was a minion okay became a phenomenon and that's when he started writing the good Glen scene he is yeah and then it continued for me it's gotten just there's only so many stories you can tell and apparently he's gone to that point as well I mean blue some bees are dying down as it some be this zombie era is done and it was like hopes which about at least dozen to whatever we are now over done everything had zombies in it yeah I'm solid I'm 11 and I'm glad five pounds because being a little as issue origin evil those must get contributed because like in the walking dude it's going to be the end of walking down a bunt do not and I repeat this is coming from a collector unless you just really know the comic don't forget like all those variants whenever it ends because there is very few of them that are going to be you're getting your money's worth later on you know the original ones are the ones people at you yeah number one is what you really want and the number one is ridiculously high right now is so because it begins innum ennum because they'd be host popular people wanted talk about Deadpool Deadpool his first appearance was a I want to say like a hundred dollar issue another tasting whatever yeah even so even with the excellent thing it was still like a hundred dollar issue then I wanted to get down one and it whoever Dean was heading I want the princess grapple and not a couple grand it's at least the fibers are comic you know what you wanna do something you wanna do some well looking I thought last time I thought it was talk on Iran either you know what we'll check anyway right now cuz I was looking for that I was looking the I remember one of you guys being the first appearance of the Punisher acting like huh oh say what is it you 98 the purse appears of all right so we're going to do is we're going to 600 books courses we're going to filter we're going to sing E with the word that's the one I saw right there let's top seller okay for know that it's in near-mint fill it in let's uh let's put a grade on near-mint this is going to be solidified and when he goes live now people are asking crisis for like nine point eight switch if G damn eight hundred dollars for one uh one person is asking for fifteen hundred another one is 850 but those are the graded in box and these are already great idea so for that whatever is in the Delta that's do stickily grade and do just you know there's a specific wording that we have to use because these are already created they're you know the CGC looks good to me involved behind some kind of books I wonder okay this is a very fine very fine there's like a 5.0 6.0 or six six oh six five they're asking for 225 another one is the one there 115 if you really want to get your money's worth it's really hard for this book because everybody at this point has had it has it graded and grading is going to get you the biggest value so yeah I will the whole know we're talking about this huh walk it down number one and that mugging them wants to check out Walking Dead number one there's a lot of the number one of immigrants so there's an 8.0 and it's signed by Robert Kirkman signings don't really add value to comics okay I learned it devalue it yeah just because most people don't want side well as most people want it go get it son yeah weird but they want to have that picture when it's like when the creative like official on high so people are asking for these let's see ones agree to the nine point six they're asking 1700 yeah there is that walking Diaz up there good things come to an end yeah but yeah so these are some times once I helped three thousand dollars for a nine point eight okay people water you so I'll just buy whatever they won't pay so they will have that money and they want it so aka then if you guys want to buy all the various yeah the money for it yeah go for it I'm hearing to stop eating for a week to get comedy be worth something in the future stick with the originals yeah you want to do that everybody to buy like 2/3 of the original propria and you know and mainly people don't want variants they just want the original you know the original artwork for it so variants tend to be a little more price there a bit weird honestly I've only bought very few variants just because I like the art so much on the cover but I was like that's a nice piece I could probably get friends true or it's a almost sucker for study on I like chibi stuff yeah give me 2 cm be like oh I want you they don't work in Hulk smash you like bolster a little if you look on the wall I know they really can sit on the wall I'm a little punch of this is chibi kind of thing sure sucker I had a big-big post everyone come on let's Kalyan when he did the action versus um oh my pleasure is big and easy every [ __ ] fighting with kids toys like dad cute la that Hawkeye has like a bow and arrow with a little like suction yes so if you like it artisan they're doing a very a goal for you before but if you're thinking this is gonna be your ticket to being rich down good for ratings mom for you the mouth is invalid in support spring because like I said people usually go for the original steel tea so I'm a firm believer and you buy comics to read them keep them keep them nice don't don't be all shitty with them don't roll

It's a very glow in the water column, she needs to have a really long tool to get the food down to their mouths. - Okay. So they hold the pole\nwhich has a fish on the end and then the sharks come\nup and have some supper. (Blippi chuckling) Oh, this looks like fun. Cool. Those fish look big. How big is that fish that\nshe's feeding the sharks? - It's about this big,\nit's called a Blue Fish. Because it has a kind of blue tint to it. - Okay, that's a Blue Fish and it's about this big. So what kind of fish did I bring up? - So you brought up some Herring, which is the big fish in here. - Okay. - And then, some capelin, which\nis the little fish in here. - Okay. Ah, interesting. Ah, hey, oh, this is pretty\ncool, seeing someone else do it, but hey, can I feed some sharks? - Yeah, absolutely. - Okay. - Just make sure you have your gloves on 'cause the fish can be kind of stinky. (both chuckling) - Okay. Let's put the glove on so then my hands don't\nsmell like fish for weeks. Okay, all right. I've got my gloves on. Ah, oh, there we go. One glove. Two gloves. All right, now what do I do? - So we'll just take this fish bucket that you brought up from the kitchen and we'll head over here. - Okay, all right. Alrighty. - We'll head over to our feeding platform. - Okay. - As soon as we walk up, the\nfish will be all ready for us. - Okay. Whoa! Look, I'm on the platform. Whoa, look, there's no barriers\nbetween me and the fish. Okay, I'm just gonna jump in. - [Friend] Oh, no! - Just kidding. All right, here we go.

(Blippi chuckling) Okay, what are you doing? - I am feeding Greta,\nour Green Sea Turtle. - Ooh, she's feeding Greta. That's a nice name. And this is Greta. Do you see Greta? Hey, Greta. Hey. Ooh, what does Greta like to eat? - Greta loves lettuce. But she also enjoys\ncucumbers, bell peppers and even sometimes carrots. - Oh, lettuce, bell peppers,\ncucumbers and carrots. Sounds like Greta's really healthy. Can I try feeding Greta? - Yeah. - Okay, all right. How do I do it, just a little bit? - Yeah, you can do a little\nbit, the whole leaf-- - Okay, there you go, Greta. Whoa, hey what you doing, it's behind you. Shall I throw another--\n- Sure. There you go. Sometimes you just have to--\n- Okay. All right. Whoa, Greta's hungry. Here you go, Greta. Yum. Here you go. Oh, Greta is really big. Do you know how much Greta weighs? - She is a little bit over 100 pounds. - Oh, wow a 100 pounds. Wow. There you go. Okay, let's do a big piece. Let's watch Greta eat a whole piece. Here you go. Oh, it's right there. Yeah. Whoa. Hey. Hello? Whoa. That's a big piece of lettuce. (happy music) Hello. Hey. Hello. Come on! Since we just touched some animals, I think we should use this\nrestroom and wash our hands. Let's go! Okay, welcome to the bathroom. Whoa, look, whoa! Look, this restroom is underwater. And this restroom actually won\nthe Best Restroom in America. Whoa, you can wash your hands right here and look at shark, sharks and fish! Whoa, this is awesome. Pretty cool. All right, I washed my\nhands now I'll go dry 'em. You enjoy the view. (happy music) (joyful music) Whoa, hey, let's go down the escalator to the deep ocean. (Blippi chuckling) Come on.

(Blippi chuckling) That's so cool. Oh, look, look, look. Whoa, hello! Whoa. And there's actually a\nSeal in here as well. Let's go try and find it. Oh, let's see. Oh, here it is. Hello. See that right here, this is a Seal. Hi. So there's three Sea Lions\nin here and one Seal. And the easiest way to tell\nthe difference is this, I'll show you. So if you're a Sea Lion,\nyou use your front flippers to basically walk like this. (Sea Lion barking) (Blippi chuckling) But Seals don't do that. Seals... Oh, hello? Oh, you're curious, huh? So curious. Oh, so that's a Sea Lion. So it walks with its flippers. (hands slapping) Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello. They're actually really smart animals. See how it's following me? I'll try and change directions. Whoa. Okay and Seals, they don't walk like that. You know, this is a Sea Lion. Sea Lion and a Seal, they don't have\nthat much power right here and it's kind of short and stubby. So this is what they do. (Blippi chuckling) So they just go to waddle. That's silly. Wow, what magnificent creatures. Check 'em out a little bit more. (upbeat music) Whoa, penguins? Yeah, we're behind the\nscene at the aquarium and we're gonna meet some penguins. Come on. Okay, let's walk nice and slow and we'll be very quiet as well. Whoa. - Hi\n- Hey. Who are you? - I'm Hutch. - Ooh, this is Hutch. Hey and what do you do here? - I work with the penguins and reptiles. - Ooh, the penguins and the reptiles. Oh, do you see the penguins back there? Whoa! Hello. Are these your only two penguins here? - Oh, no we have more\nfriends that are coming. Would you like to grab a toy, we're actually gonna play with them. - Sure. 'Kay, let's grab a toy and let's see some more penguins. Look over there! (penguins gakking) - [Hutch] Keep moving. Freely like a lot of\nmovement with their toys. So we have-- - Hello. - He's already come over to say hi. - It looks like it's\nenjoying my shadow, huh? - That does happen. So penguins are really\nlight contrasting colors. They also can see colors really well and have rods and cones in\ntheir eyes, just like we do. - Okay. They're kind of, although they're birds, they're kind of acting\nlike kitty cats, huh? - Just a little bit. They do like to play with a\nlot of different types of toys and just like kitty cats, they tell us when they wanna be touched. - Okay. Ah, interesting. This is pretty cool. Hey, get a closer look. Oh, bye-bye. Penguins are so silly. So where are these penguins from? - These penguins are from South Africa. - Okay. - And we have 32 of them\nhere at the aquarium. - Wow, 32 penguins here. And these are from South Africa? Not Antarctica? - Not Antarctica, they're actually one of several species of penguins\nthat prefer the warm climate. - Oh, okay. That's pretty cool. Interesting. Warm climate and penguins. I guess you learn something every day. Hey, let's take a seat right over here. And then Hutch is gonna\nbring a penguin over. Ooh, I'm so excited. I get to touch a penguin. Ooh, hello? (Blippi chuckling) Okay. So I'm gonna touch the\npenguin with two fingers, gently on its back. Hey, are you ready? Oh. Hey. It felt so soft. Did you know penguins have\n70 feathers per square inch? Yeah, they're really\nsmall and really dense. Can I touch it again, Hutch? - Yes you can. - Okay. Does that feel good? Do you like that? - She's showing off for you. - Ooh. What does that mean when\nshe shakes her head? - So that means she's really happy and you might be her new boyfriend. - Ooh. I hope she doesn't want a kiss. (both chuckling) Oh, hello! This is a Little Blue penguin. It's pretty small. Oh, this board has the\nsizes of different penguins. Oh, like the penguin I met\ntoday, an African Penguin. Whoa, and they just keep getting bigger. Whoa. Whoa, look how big they're getting. Whoa! Look how big this penguin is. Whoa, four feet tall! 1.3 meters high! Jeez, look how big it is. Whoa, that's a really big penguin. (happy music) Whoa, look a Toucan. You see it's beak? Kind of looks like the shape of a banana. A really colorful banana. There's another bird over here, come on. Whoa. Hello! (Blippi chuckling) A colorful Parrot. Hey, how are you? (Blippi chuckling) Ooh, looks like it's yellow, blue and on its head, it's green. Hey. Hey, there's another\nanimal right over here I wanna show ya, come on. Whoa, look. Look at this animal. It's moving really slow. Do you know what animal this is? Yeah, this is a Sloth. Let's act like a sloth together. (joyful music) - Hello. How are you? (Blippi chuckling) That's funny. Hi, hello! Whoa! Look, these are otters\nand they're so cute. Look at 'em go underwater. Whoa! I bet they can hold their\nbreath for a really long time. Whoa, they're so fast. Whoa. They kind of look like water cats. But they're not kitty cats. (Blippi chuckling) Whoa! Hi. Hello! Ooh, another one! Whoa. Cool! (upbeat music) Whoa! That was so much fun learning\nabout all these creatures at OdySea in Scottsdale, Arizona with you. Well, this is the end of this video. But if you wanna watch more of my videos, all you have to do is search for my name. Will you spell my name with me? Ready? B-L-I-P-P-I. Blippi, good job. All right, see you soon!

Remember how the red lever\nstopped the tractor before? So which lever do you think\ncan make the windmill stop? The red lever. [Goofy] Yeah!\n'Cause red means stop! Let's try it. We did it! The windmill stopped! [grunts] Ooh! So that's\nwhere those went. [chuckles] [Donald muttering angrily] - Thanks, everybody!\n- [all] You're welcome! [Goofy] Uh, guys,\nsomething wrong here.

I bet if we plant\nlettuce and carrots, then the animals will\ncome out for a treat. Sounds yummy. But, uh, won't it take a long\ntime to grow all that stuff? Not with the Clickety-Clack\nTractor. Watch! \u266a Growin' veggies on the farm \u266a \u266a Is always lots of fun \u266a \u266a Our tractor\nlikes to plant the seeds \u266a \u266a One by one by one \u266a \u266a And with a clickety-clack\nand a poppity-pop \u266a \u266a Things begin to grow \u266a [all] \u266a Clickety-clack\nand a poppity pop \u266a [Mickey]\n\u266a Everything's ready to go \u266a \u266a Clickety-clack\nand a poppity-pop \u266a \u266a There's somethin'\nfor everyone \u266a \u266a Clickety-clack\nand a poppity-pop \u266a [Mickey] \u266a Plantin' veggies\nis fun \u266a\u266a [chuckles] [chuckles] Now all we have to do is wait\nfor the animals to come out and get their treats.

excavators with me yeah let's go [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] wow excavators are so spectacular let's look at the parts of the excavator huh come here let's start with the cab this inside here is where the operator of the excavator sits look inside wow there's a lot of controls in there oh that looks fun okay let's close the door oh whoa look yeah these are the tracks of the excavator wow there's no wheels and tires on an excavator there are only these tracks and it allows for it to go over rocks and mud and big piles of dirt and not even get stuck like this see i didn't even get stuck and look back here this is the engine compartment this is where the excavator gets all of its power from look wow there's more engine components on the other side and the top but there's a bunch of radiators coolant and all that fun stuff in here i almost forgot my favorite part the bucket let's go [Music] whoa look at the bucket this excavator bucket is really big it can grab and scoop a bunch of dirt out of the earth and this part right here the clamper yeah it's called the thumb whoa and look at all of this wow this is the arm of the excavator it's really tall and that part that is the boom of the excavator the arm and the boom in the bucket and how all of this gets powered are these hydraulic cylinders wow they push fluid up so then everything can move whoa looks like i'm an excavator that was so much fun learning the parts of an excavator [Music] [Music] so [Music] now it's time to operate the excavator [Music] let's go whoa whoa whoa first things first safety first yeah look i got my safety vest on and my hard hat [Music] do [Music] okay see these joysticks these are what operate the arm and the boom in the bucket see oh and this one this one makes it swivel watch this whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa this is so much fun okay and then i'll push it the other way and now we're going to swivel around this way [Music] okay go all right enough swiveling now it's time to dig [Music] pull the joysticks yeah whoa look at how big this scoop is yeah okay now let's dump out the scoop [Music] whoa that was a big scoop [Music] we're on a little joy ride in the excavator we're just dragging the excavator to find a new spot to dig in look at what it is it's a stump i wonder what's underneath the stump [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] this is where the stump used to be i wonder what's underneath the stump looks like a bunch of dirt a lot of dirt and look a giant rock what else look it's a boom box boom boxes play music i wonder what song is in here [Music] i've got a great big arm and a great big boom if i start digging now i'll be done real soon i'm a dirt separator i'm an excavator i've got a big old bucket and i scoop all the time digging holes in the ground wonder what i'll find i'm an earth investigator i'm an excavator [Music] to get to where i need to be i'm an excavator excavator hey dirt see you later [Music] hey it's time to act like an excavator i'll teach you all you gotta do is bring up your arm like it's the arm and the boom in the bucket and start to scoop [Music] that's fun [Music] i've got a place where workers sit it's called a cab where they control the bucket to scoop and grab i'm a whole regulator i'm an excavator oh can't you see [Music] that i work all day do you ever sleep no time for sleep no time for play i'm an excavator i'm an excavator excavator [Music] that was so much fun learning about the marvelous machine of an excavator with you bye [Applause] yay [Music] so much to learn about it'll make you want to

hitting an animal happens to most drivers in their lives so in this video we're going to look at this in a little more detail [Music] this video as usual is inspired by my viewers so please do keep on sending in these clips in a normal way what people often do is upload their clip to google drive or something similar and then send me a sharing link this first clip that we're going to look at is where one of my viewers encounters a couple of pheasants within a short space of time so here is our first pheasant which unfortunately didn't make it but what i'd like to point out is the importance of knowing who's behind before you decide to do any breaking obviously i've left out any of the gory bits but unfortunately my camera has another pheasant to deal with a little touch further this one survives thankfully even an animal as small as a pheasant can do significant damage to your car i remember my sister many years ago hit a pheasant and it smashed one of our headlights but do you have to report hitting an animal to anyone let's have a look section 170 of the road traffic act 1980 deals with the duty to report an accident and specifically states that a driver must stop when involved in an accident by which damage is caused to an animal other than an animal in or on that vehicle it goes on to say that the driver must stop and if required to do so give his name an address to a relevant party if for whatever reason this is not possible i.e the owner of the animal is not present the accident must be reported to the police as soon as possible or within 24 hours under this piece of legalization animal refers to horse cattle ass mule sheep pig goat or dog accidents involving other animals such as deer cats badgers foxes rabbits and pheasants do not need to be reported as a road traffic collision i'll be honest i did not know all the information and the regulations on what to do if you were to hit a deer on the road so i've done a little bit of digging and it might not be as simple as doing nothing deers in the uk are involved in thousands of accidents every year and these do cause human injury and even fatalities so what i would suggest if you ever hit a deer is called the police non-emergency number 101 and they should be able to give you some good advice on what to do in this situation for the other non-reportable animals i've mentioned i would suggest ringing the rspca but if there's no danger to yourself you can also take that injured animal to a local vets now you don't have to worry because if you do take an injured animal to the vet you won't be responsible for any of the vets fees so what can we do as road users to lessen our risk in these situations let's have a little look at a few things always keep an eye out for wild animal warning signs and drive with caution always be aware that multiple animals could cross even if that means domestic dogs and then you've also got to look out for the owner try and use full beam headlights where you can so you can spot animals but when they have been spotted it's always a good idea to dip your headlights back down again because as you'll see in this next clip some animals freeze do not swerve without being in full control and totally aware of your surroundings you don't want to hit an oncoming vehicle or end up in a ditch try to brake heavily and stop if there is no danger of being hit from behind try and anticipate the likelihood of animals running out or in this scenario laying down from the area that you are driving through a fair few of these clips were recorded in new forest and as you can see some unexpected things can happen this made me chuckle this clip but animals can actually be a problem even in residential areas watch to the left now this is one of the busiest roundabouts in liverpool although it's night time you can also see it's quite a built up area do you see foxes in the town where you live if you have slowed for animals in your path sometimes all you've got to do is wait and be patient they won't hurry for anyone my last point is to go back to what i said earlier on in the video i alluded to the damage and significant damage that hitting an animal can cause to your vehicle many years ago someone else in my family actually hit a deer and wrote his mum saab off so the bills can be significant but i'd also like you to think what it would be like hitting an animal or being hit by an animal if you're on two wheels so try not to get yourself in that situation in the first place keep safe everyone take care see you soon [Music] you",

bring millions of salmon knows several different species are now returning to these Alaskan coast to reproduce in the same rivers in which they were born if they get them they have the largest brown bears in the world for a simple reason they obtain extra rations of energy thanks to the annual presence of the cinnamon the cat sets in motion a basic process in the life of also miners on planet earth the process of obtaining the energy necessary for a living body to function on the energy brought by this salmon from the sea will not be used for the purpose it had intended the meat no longer belongs to the fish it has become part of the bear the energy used by the bears to walk here every year is more than compensated for by the energy obtained so much so the individuals luxury cannot assimilate such enormous quantities of food but killing doesn't always brings such rich rewards [Music] [Music] man like the animal here's also forms part of the energy cycle man learned how to use the energy of fire and around the fire his prehensile hands developed a privileged brain capable of inventing the claws of the bear he did not have but speech was the real motor of change [Music] through language inventions were passed on from generation to generation making it possible for humans to colonize the earth as they were able to obtain energy from other living beings wherever they were just as these Australian Aborigines to do in the 21st century human beings replaced biological evolution with cultural revolution transforming the accumulation of traditions into the most successful of all adaptive mechanisms the final aim of all this is precisely the same mean that Spurs the Bears on to catch the salmon to obtain energy in an efficient manner the hunter having first removed the poisonous sting proceeds to kill the rain and killing is inevitable in the transfer of energy from one being to another but the success of mankind as a thinking predator began in relatively recent times long before us other animals honed their hunting techniques aided by natural selection a slow but surprisingly efficient process [Music] [Laughter] [Music] on the Galapagos Islands lives a bird that is a good example of natural selection in this case to catch fish the brown pelican here the Pacific Ocean brings fish to this young volcanic coast over 600 miles from the American continent [Music] the method would appear to be simple [Music] but it's method not all predators can use first you have to know how to fly a bird like this also equipped with it's very own efficient net can commit itself the luxury of choosing a particular fish since the riptile moved over the earth birds have without a doubt achieved the most spectacular anatomical adaptations when it comes to fishing not only here in Galapagos but throughout the planet [Music] here on the plains of Venezuela for example over 20 species of birds fish in the same place and they are all visibly different it would seem impossible for any fish to survive such a constant onslaught but they do and there is food enough for everyone the secret consists of using different methods some gather together and beat the water with that open beaks using their sense of touch others work alone they remain very still waiting for fish to move and then harpoon it if they're lucky the final result is always the same though there are some that use surprising techniques [Music] being accessible that's the surface of the water with its lower jaw which unlike most birds is longer it has to avoid the obstacles and the alligators but the system works [Music] on the other side of the world in the celebrities islands we find a good example of the inventiveness of man in compensating for his lack of wings and leaf bali-ba how they are fishing with kites an ancient method to which recently has been added the advantage of an old motor birds but essentially has remained unchanged for hundreds of years [Music] the kite rises in the direction of the fishing line changes warning the Fisher of the precise moment when he must haul it in as fast as possible now where the last effort a large needle fish comes out of the water for the novice time but there are other human populations who though they live far from the sea also eat fish [Applause] [Music] here on the Guayana Massif in the South of Venezuela live ancient ethnic groups who have inhabited the Amazon forest for over 3,000 years their cinema the yech winners all the makita know that this particular Liana contains a very special substance they call them barbasco and after cutting them they carefully crush them to extract the SAP the curious thing about this technique is that over a thousand kilometres away the Hawaiian is in Ecuador use it in exactly the same way they are two completely different ethnic groups but they have in common of a firm knowledge of the jungle in which they live here their diet lacks mineral salts and Sylvie's two people essentially hunters are very glad of the occasional chance to eat fish the barbasco simply absorbs the oxygen in the water forcing their fish to come to the surface there are small pools left behind by the river and normally they are not many fish and those there are very small but they are grateful for this occasional and very valuable variation in their normal diet even if it provides relatively little energy when it comes to quantity however it would be difficult to beat another very distant culture [Music] in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam this family is heading home to their house built on the river itself they don't have to go fishing they literally lived with a fish the houses are fish farms in which the carpet in the living room isn't thank to trapped on giving access to energy the entire family participates in looking after and feeding the fish imprisoned beneath their home human beings have become so efficient that they have managed to move whether wisely or not from subsistence ecology to the market economy the excess energy can then be exchanged for other goods lawful money in any case the ultimate aim of all processes has not changed in the slightest it is a question of eating the body of another animal in such a way that the effort is worth it that the final energy balance is positive [Music] phishing implies in some way managing to get the fish out of the water but when the struggle will takes place on land the problem is very different out here the hunter and the prey share the same surroundings breathe the same air here the interchange of energy is face to face a challenge which natural selection has resolved by creating real killing machines [Music] [Music] in the Amazon forest of some of the most famous Assassin's award this is a three-dimensional ecosystem the thin outer branches are reasonably safe but there is Sun and wind and the food is down below down there where the shadows have eyes West Sun tears unimportant and everyone is in fact listening on each branch awaits a feast or death everyone wants energy their bodies can use predation means catching with violence the only language that evolution has torpor feed items like this one [Music] of all the eyes on its body only two been seen remaining absolutely silent it waits with something to make a mistake a slight subtle rustle which will betray the presence of potential prey this iguana chose the wrong moment to wake from its sleep the eyes of fear have found him but he still hopes to remain unnoticed camouflaged against the ground to close this hunter is an ocelot but it could be any of the dozens of species of highly specialized predators that live on earth that numbers are insignificant compared to those of their prey but nonetheless their role in evolution is vital because it is they who decide who will live and who will die [Music] [Applause] we humans still have one foot in our biological past and the other in a cultural present this man evolved as a hunter he gained free hands to create tone this led to an increasingly large brain finally making possible the appearance of language then like these foreigners and the jungles of Ecuador we were capable not only of inventing darts and blow pipes but also of coating them with poisons obtained from nature thanks to speech Hunter's could tell each other where the prey was could describe the landscapes and what is more important they could discuss the many different hunting possibilities our hams developed in order to grab on to the branches and our stereoscopic vision arose from the need to measure the distance between one trunk and another but for some reason we decided to come down to the ground and when we adopted an erect stance our hands could be used to manipulate objects it was then that we became a culture and [Music] and that happened here in Africa these are Bushmen they have been here in the Kalahari Desert for at least 6,000 years in the same ways that were any Indians they are preparing the poison with which they will smear the errors the same purpose but using different ingredients the fluids of the larvae beetle saliva among Rangga seed and Sansevieria root a mixture capable of felling anew with even a superficial graze so won't the world Homo sapiens found a way to kill more and better which made him the perfect predator [Music] now the animals he once shared the trees will that become his prey his sword vannhansen large groups in the coordinated manner for the vast knowledge of the behavior about animals [Music] the young world any learns from his elders observes and trains sharing their experience not even the Oscar could catch a monkey high of the nutrients but the Quran ease blowpipes can launch the poison into the very highest branches and what is more they are silent so if one hunter fails the master the cultural predator can still shoot [Music] in just a few minutes the poison takes effect the monkey's body and man once more climbs up into the branches for this to him to claim the reward for so many thousands of years of evolution cooperative hunting brought with it other consequences the impulse to kill became dissociated from the impulse to eat when the food had to be transported into a home base then groups of males took over the task of getting meat for the family unit sharing the journey risks and strategies forged loyalty among them the Hawaiian is to believe that when they return home the prey belong to their wives on the other side of the world in Namibia the Bushmen are also starting a day of hunting but in very different surroundings on the great African savannah distances are enormous smell is virtually useless and the hunter must rely on sight alone sight and of course experience and knowledge of the terrain the signs left behind by repassing herds speak to the Bushmen every blade of grass provides information every stone conveys a message for hunters represent for families and they need large prey in order to ensure the energy balance is positive barrier but getting close to a herd of onyx is not easy fortunately they need get only close enough to reach them with their arrows again the Silence of the arrows is a major advantage though the first bowmen missed the animals do not flee there's merely a slight commotion it's simply a matter of waiting until they calm down then trying again now the head is too nervous it is time to release the last round of arrows and hope one of them will bring down an Oryx a wounded animal leaves unmistakable tracks while the powerful poison goes to work killing it the long-awaited moment has arrived for at least 100,000 years the scene has been repeated countless times in Africa as quickly as possible they have to cut up the Oryx to be able to carry the greatest quantity of meat back to the village before the Flies and the heiner's claim their share the great predator the triumph of the brain over the claw and the hoof fresh meat energy to enable the body to function the essence of life and death but man the hunter went further still he needed to find meaning beyond his stomach and advanced further than any other animal had ever gone but the blood of his prey the ancient human clans began to think of the possible existence of superior forces and the religious predator was born the quintessence of human diversity [Music] in the frozen mountains of Kazakhstan and Mongolia that still lives the people for whom hunting is much more than simply getting food to eat according to ancient legend it was Genghis Khan himself I first held out his left fist to a bird of prey thus beginning this peoples tradition of training Eagles the fact is the Cossacks have achieved perfect symbiosis with both the horse and the Golden Eagle these enormous golden eagles are all females which are larger they were caught in the mountain called cont ingry by young men whose nets and trained

verse and the idea is that i'm thinking of those chord shapes but the actual concert pitch is like the key of d major but for this video i'll be saying c and a minor now we're going to start out with an a minor to a d minor and this is our intro with the little line that goes on top here's what it sounds like for the rhythm part one two three four [Music] [Applause] then we're into the verse right there that's the baby do you understand me now and what we're doing is we're playing an a minor for four counts and then a d minor which is open two three and one there so sometimes well typically i'll actually use my pinky there but a lot of people use their third finger which that's fine as well so d minor like that and then a minors from the a string down open two two one open so to start off you might just wanna go one two three four one two three four one two three four one and on top of that we've got the line [Music] and for the strumming pattern you could do something like this so i'm going one e and a two and three and four and so it's like an eighth note and then two sixteenth notes then two and two eighth notes don't play on beat three but then play three and four and so one e and a two e and a three and four [Music] and if i said the strumming directions down down up down up up down up down down up down up up down up it's a little tricky one there a fun strumming pattern to play so i would put one of those patterns per chord so you'd go a minor d minor repeat [Music] okay then we get into the verse chord progression and as mentioned that's where the vocal comes in baby do you understand me now and that's gonna sound like this [Applause] now i'm playing a four bar chord progression i'm going a minor to g to f to e and again each chord is lasting four counts one two three four switch two three four switch you can always start with just a whole note strum just nice and easy right do that with the recording and work on those transitions so a minor same as before g i'm playing with my third finger and my pinky here just on the outer strings of the guitar i'm muting the fifth string then f i do this thumb chord which you can do your standard f like this i just prefer this one which is 1 three three two one one and then e which looks like your a minor but everything shifted up one string see that there a minor e now i'll do the same strumming pattern [Music] and then we come out of this section to the chorus and that's that's like i'm just [Music] so that's gonna sound like this one two three four [Music] that's back to the the intro section there so it's a short little chorus here it's a little refrain and we're gonna play c for a bar to a minor for a bar then we're gonna do two strums on f with these hits one and two and three we'll rest in between so one and two and three four so that's that measure so for the c and the a minor though i'm gonna switch up strumming patterns i'm gonna go to just an essential rock strumming pattern which would be all downs eighth notes like this [Music] and then i do downs as well on the f chord just because they're like these rhythmic hits one and two and three and i'd like that strong sound of hitting down strums now i was doing c sometimes i'll put the g in the bass like that that's a really cool sound [Music] one and two and three and four and then we have a two four bar where we do a rest so after this f we're gonna count one two and three and four and then we'll count one two a minor back to the little melody there so or the re intro right if you're playing the chords a minor to d minor so i'm just a soul who goes to a minor then f two ten three and four and one two so and if i think about the words i'm just a soldier oh lord please don't let me be miss unders so be miss under and then stood is where you're back in on so be missed under is the two four counts so i'm just a soul you're back to the a minor now in the bridge it's where the words go if i seem edgy and we're gonna play this [Music] then we're back to a verse out of that section so for the bridge i go a minor a minor two three and then a g on beat four g and then we go f g three times f to g and the rhythm here is one and two and three and four and one and two and so i'm strumming down on one and then down on the end of two one two three and four and one and two and three and four and one and two and then c to a minor same strumming f to g f to g then we do a bar of f and a bar of e [Music] and then we're back to the verse now finally the last time we come out of the final chorus and we get the kodo which just like fades out so the last time after we play the final chorus we do this little tag and we just repeat it over as the song fades out and that goes like this [Music] i'm just a soul we repeat back to the chorus one two and three and four and one two and then the line right and then back to the c so you could either play this line which starts up here and this is the seventh fret from the capo one two three four five six seven we're gonna go that's just seven to five and then same thing next string down 4 5 4. [Music] back to the chorus that's how it fades out [Music] have fun practicing don't let me be misunderstood as recorded by the animals take it slow make sure to work out each part and then put it together and go and play it with the recording i recommend practicing playing along with the recording i do that all the time it's a lot of fun and it helps you put everything together before you go don't forget to download my free book and get the exclusive training again these videos are not on youtube and they come with tabs and sheet music so if you get value out of my lessons here on youtube you're gonna get a ton more value out of this free content so check it out at the first link down below as always leave any song requests in the comments below thanks for your support here on the channel and until next time [Music] you", "6zOarcL1BSc": "Even when more sea lions arrive, they can't seem to break down\nthe sardines' coordinated defences.

dragons amazing animals of australia and tasmania presented by net hab expedition leader mike kilmann it's wonderful to have you with us today mike let me hand it off to you thanks kendall and welcome everyone to my presentation today to give you a little bit of my background i've been a guide with natural habitat adventures for a few years now and i specifically work in north america i got in greenland up in churchill over in yellowstone as well as in alaska and i got my degree in zoology that's how i kind of came to really love wild animals as a child i grew up on shows like crocodile hunter with steve irwin and david attenborough and things like that i really enjoy talking about animals my family and friends know all about the fact that i was always giving them fun facts about interesting and weird creatures and i definitely through watching steve irwin and learning more and more about australian animals as i grew up really just kind of um was attracted a lot to all these interesting and weird creatures that you find specifically in australia and before i became a guide with natural habitat adventures i was actually a educator as well as zookeeper in the zoo and aquarium field work for a number of different zoological institutions and that's where i was able to actually work one-on-one with a lot of different australian animals and be able to talk about them to various guests that i would meet and so from there and with my zoology background i really enjoy talking about australian animals and that's kind of why i wanted to build this presentation and talk a little bit about australian animals because if you've seen some of my previous webinars through our daily dose of nature series i've done a lot of different interesting critters and typically there's an australian animal or two snuck into most of my presentations because they're so interesting and there's a lot of weird and interesting facts about them so it's a lot of fun for me to talk about them and it's typically a lot of fun for my audiences to learn about them so if you haven't got a chance um do check out natural habitat adventures youtube page or you can even go on the nethad website at nathan.com and then pull up some of those daily dose of natures and get to learn some more about some interesting animals or a lot about different locations around the world so today of course we're talking about australia and when people think of australia oftentimes they're thinking about the natural landscape and the sites things like uluru or ayers rock or the cultural aspects of it things like the sydney opera house and hopefully just like myself you're thinking oftentimes a lot about the nature the wildlife that inhabit australia and so i want to talk a little bit about some of these really interesting creatures and get you to hopefully get jazzed about going to a place like australia now what really sets australia apart when it comes to why we have so much unique and interesting animals in a place like australia is that 80 percent of their plants mammals reptiles frogs and about 50 percent of the birds are what's called endemic meaning that they're found nowhere else in the world and why is that well part of it has to do with the plate tectonics we go back hundreds of millions of years we have pangaea the supercontinent and then at a certain point we have antarctica and uh australia splitting off together around 100 million years ago and then from there they started separating it about 85 million years ago and then about between 45 and 30 million years ago australia is out on its own it's not bashing into any other continents it's not exchanging wildlife back and forth and so for that really long time 35 million years ago or so they have evolution is basically running only in australia and it's not trading animals back and forth and that's part of what makes it so unique in in addition to that it actually because of where it sits on the globe in its latitude and the fact that the geology has been relatively stable we get a lot of different types of habitats most people when they think of australia they think of the outback right any nature show starts talking about the outback when they're talking about australia and certainly the red center those arid regions are a vast portion of australia but it has a large diversity of of habitats you've got up in the north along the cape york peninsula you have the rain forests then along the coastlines all the way around you have these lush um either rock crevices and habitats or these massive um wetland environments you have mountain ranges and even pine forests and snow and not a lot of people expect that when we're talking about australia and it's also quite large people when they try to visit australia you should think oh i can go for a week and then see australia but realistically it takes a lot to see a good chunk of the country you can see here how big it is compared to the united states even tasmania on its own is the size of west virginia so it's a big place and so it's understandable that it has a lot of unique and interesting wildlife on a continent as large as that now because of that what i'm going to be talking about wildlife today i realized i had to kind of filter myself a little bit or bring myself in because talking about wildlife all over australia you're talking hours upon hours of webinars so i'm only going to stick to the northern route of our itinerary as well as the southern route of the itinerary that nethap does we have two different itineraries in australia and i'm going to really kind of focus wildlife that could be reasonably seen on one of those routes and kind of use that as my filter as i talk about wildlife today that being said even then i still kind of consider this presentation more or less a sampler platter of australian animals you could spend a lot of time talking about even just the animals along one of these routes and so i'm kind of picking and choosing some of my favorite animals as a zoologist that i love learning and talking about and hopefully you will as well over the course of this presentation now one of my backgrounds is that i am a bird watcher and i love on my trips pointing out birds as we're going along the way so why not start there and we're going to talk a little bit about some of the bird life that we have in australia and let me tell you it's got some great ones i've already said about 46 of the bird life in australia is endemic found nowhere else in the world all in all they have over 850 species of birds that can be found in australia and just to pull out a few of my favorites um here is our first one this one you may be familiar with the laughing kookaburra um even if you're not familiar with the bird you're probably familiar with that's call it's a member of the kingfisher family in fact it's the largest largest of the kingfisher family and they can't eat fish but they eat a lot of other animals as well but even if you haven't heard of these guys before their call has been used a lot in movies so i'm gonna crank my volume here and hopefully you guys can hear the kookaburra call so that is an iconic call that you can hear in many places around australia and certainly is a bird that i had to pull out just for the noise alone in addition this is another one of my personal favorites this is called a tawny frog mouth this is a nocturnal animal that eats a lot of small critters things like lizards and frogs and insects and things like that and reason why i like them in addition to the fact that they look kind of weird those big eyes they're nocturnal so it helps with that um they also look a little bit like a living muppet i mean look at this picture right here that big wide open mouth to eat some pretty large prey or eat insects very very easily i actually work with this species in the zoo we had a tawny frogmouth named jara and for whatever reason he hated male voices hated men's voices the lower tone must have set him off so um anytime i handled him i couldn't talk because the second i would say something he would start getting aggressive and trying biting me or something like that so he certainly was an interesting bird to handle and a lot of personality behind that muppet face which makes one of these guys pretty interesting now another one that you might actually be familiar with without realizing it are the bauer birds we have a few in australia and uh one in particular is a satin bur bauerberg it's probably one if you've seen any of the kind of big ticket bbc natural history documentaries in the last 10 years or so you're actually probably familiar with bauer birds even though you may not realize it this male is interesting on his own right just with that beautiful kind of satiny deep dark blue coloration but what makes this species so interesting is how this male tries to impress this female who's a little bit more of a drab olivier green but still beautiful in her own right and for whatever reason this female really likes a man who's great with architecture as well as interior design so watching hdtv or something like that but she wants him to create this beautiful power which you can see behind him right now are these two kind of spires of sticks would actually form a bit of a tunnel and he builds that up himself and when she comes in to investigate to see his handiwork she goes into that tunnel and then she sits in the middle there while she watches him dancing out on the dance floor but it's important that that dance floor is well decorated and typically satin bower birds really like the color blue and ordinarily out in nature they'll find things like blue flowers and blueberries and things like that but um those power birds that are near human habitation find blue plastic really desirable as well so this particular individual has brought in all these blue pieces decorated his little dance floor and now is waiting for fema to come in and see how he's doing um so it's a pretty interesting behavior seeing from this power bird in addition speaking of blue australia actually has penguins too so most people when they think of penguins they're thinking of antarctica right um all cold weather species well there's 23 species of penguins and most of them are actually more warmer weather penguins only a few of them are actually 100 year-round cold weather and a blue penguin is found in southern australia as well as new zealand and uh it's known as the blue penguin but it's also known as the fairy penguin or the little penguin i kind of cover all my bases usually when i talk about these guys i call them little fairy blues just to cover all the bases of the regional names that they can be known by and they are quite small they only come up to about 13 inches tall which means they are the smallest kind of penguin out there in the environment and that's about the same size as a football just to give you a size reference there and they live in these burrows during the night and then they head out during the day in some cases walking up to two kilometers from the burrow out to the shore and they'll swim out in the open ocean just like other penguins do catching things like krill and shrimp and fish now even though they're in australia some of these currents can be quite cold and so like other penguins they're adapted to that and they have upwards of 10 000 feathers covering their body from head to toe and unlike other birds though is penguins have a difficulty with molting meaning shedding their feathers out just like our hair their feathers get frayed and damaged over time and they need to be able to replace those now most birds like your sparrows or robins outside replace a couple feathers at a time but if a penguin were to do that they actually would have always a hole in their waterproof armor and they would get cold very very quickly so they have to shed all their feathers at once which means they can't swim for upwards of two to three weeks so in preparation for that they become pigs and they increase their body size by about 250 percent get really really fat so they can then head out on land and then shed all their feathers at once which is called a catastrophic malt and it looks like a catastrophe uh i worked with penguins before and i don't know if there's any other animal as miserable as a penguin during malting season they are shedding all those feathers at once it's got to be uncomfortable they're growing all the feathers back in and they can't rinse or bathe or anything like that so uh i i certainly give it up to our little fairy blues when they have to go through something like that now just as another aside uh kind of an interesting fact about our fairy penguins is that they're scabbed if you were to collect it and look at it they can't digest all parts of the fish they get pretty close but they leave some of the scales behind and that passes through so when you look at their scat if you look closely at the screen you'll see that it kind of sparkles they actually had glittery um glittery scat because of the fact that they are eating all of these fish so it just really lends itself to our fairy penguin which i think is a little fun aside on the side right moving on to some other flightless birds this is the emu of course it's going to be our biggest bird in australia and they're great to see we're super interesting birds but i want to talk to you about one you may not be as familiar with which is one of my personal favorites the southern cast wearing it's a cousin to the emu but you can see it looks a whole lot different this is a species that's just a little bit smaller than emu so it gets third place as far as biggest burn of course ostrich emu then cassowary they get up to about six feet tall and weigh 160 pounds that is a big turkey and this is a rainforest species found in northeastern australia and they move through the environment going after small animals but uh they also really love to eat fruit in particular a lot of the fruit in rainforests where they're found have these very thick outer shells not a lot of fruit to them but also big seeds so they're not super useful to a lot of animals but our cassowary here will actually swallow those seeds whole and in their gizzard grind away that tough outer texture get what little fruit nutrition they can out of it and then they pass those seeds unharmed out the other end and so scientists estimate that they actually are critical to spreading seeds of anywhere between 75 and 100 different species of plants in the rainforest they're literally the gardeners of the rainforest which makes them super important to have in australia to have those beautiful rainforests that i'm talking about here now in addition to that really the reason i personally like them is they are so prehistoric looking just look at that picture that stare down is is a little bit intimidating but then you look at their feet and you'll see here just those really dinosaur-like scales and then their claws on their feet can be upwards of five inches long so they're considered probably the most dangerous bird in the world because of what they've got um as weaponry and on top of that they also have a pretty crazy sound they sound like a dinosaur i'll play that song for you so these deep bellows kisses and roars i mean if you saw that foot and heard that noise first thing dinosaur that's what you'd think super cool and on top of that just like the satin bauer bird i also have a thing for blue as a color and so that also strikes me just a little bit and one of the reasons i really like cassowaries now we're going to switch from birds we're going to move on to mammals but i'm going to start with a little quiz time take a look at your screen here and see if you can come up with which one of these words is made up is one that i made up well actually these are all actual words this is a trick question they are all actual words for different types of manual mammals in particular marsupials that you can find in australia some of them are aboriginal words some of them are greek or indian or spanish uh and so a lot of people outside of australia haven't heard of the vast diversity of marsupials and all little individual ones typically when you hear about marsupials you're like okay the kangaroo and the koala but in australia they have 250 different types of marsupials and so i want to talk about a few of them but the first question you get is why so many marsupials well if you're not familiar let's recap what a marsupial is so unlike the placental mammal like humans like dogs like cattle and elephants marsupials give birth when their young are incredibly underdeveloped and then what you're seeing right here this little young kangaroo as climbing onto out of the birth canal onto its mother's fur and it's climbing into that pouch that makes uh that really sets apart other marsupials then from there that little youngster incredibly undeveloped it doesn't even have access to move its legs it's just moving its arms like an army crawl and grabs onto its heat and then from there continues the rest of the growth process outside of mom essentially inside the safety of that pouch now in australia kind of what i alluded to with those variety of habitats we have a lot of differences in how much water is there can be very arid regions there's these massive wetlands um different times of year it leads to dry seasons and wet seasons we have massive storms and wind coming in we even have the bush fires that a lot of people heard about in 2019 and all of those combined together all those changing constantly changing environmental factors is the reason why scientists theorize that we have more marsupials in australia than in other parts of the world um there's still a hundred marsupial species outside of australia but having just 250 there the reason most likely is the fact that say an elephant wants to give birth it's going to have a two-year roughly two-year pregnancy so over that time a lot can happen in the environment so if you can give birth relatively quickly while you're young is still a little bit underdeveloped and if things change and you can't raise that youngster where your survival is the most important then our marsupial is able to do something like that so they're not putting a large amount of investment in their young until they know that the environment can support the young that they're trying to raise and no more can you see that really happening than in the bandicoot so this is a small type of marsupial looks a little bit like a rat and they actually have one of these shortest pregnancies of any mammal they tie a few other species for the lowest at just 12 days she mates and less than two weeks later she's already giving birth and those young come out incredibly small only about the width of your pinky at about one centimeter meaning they're only about two percent of her overall length and she can have upwards of seven of them that leave the birth canal crawl into the pouch grab onto a t and then from there continue to nourish and then if conditions are good then she could have potentially several different batches of offspring in just one season and so when there is a boon for these guys you could see bandicoot all over the place because they breed so well and where there's a boon for prey there's oftentimes a boom for predators and green tree pythons are found in northern part of australia in cape york the rainforest and similar places to where you can see those cassowaries and they're super interesting they're one of my all-time favorite snakes partially because of that beautiful green coloration they have going on but they also are a perfect example of convergent evolution and what that is is that two species relatively unrelated to each other live in different habitats across the globe but those habitats end up being quite similar and so those two species evolve to meet the challenges of that habitat in much the same way so for a green tree python its convergent evolution cousin if you will is the emerald tree boa so you can see the green tree python over in new guinea and parts of australia and then the emmertree broad found in northern south america in the amazon rainforest and so they exist in very similar types of habitat and so they've evolved to meet those needs in very similar ways so here on the left is our emerald tree bowl of course our green tree python on the right look how similar they are certainly to the untrained eye you would think they're the same species the ammo trivoa can have variable coloration with uh that white that you see on there but actually so can the green tree python and this coloration scientists actually think is because they're trying to blend in camouflage in the rain forest hence the green but a tree branch often times get birds droppings on it because birds are flying through the rainforest and so they're mimicking those bird droppings along their body and that's why you see the white or the speckled yellow or things like that along our snake which is really cool they're so similar that even as youngsters the emerald tree boa and the green tree python start off as either yellow or red and then turn green as they grow up what's called onto genetic change and so it's super fascinating the youngsters even camouflage in the same way as babies and then grow up to be those big green adults look exactly identical but one's a boa and one's a python they're a little bit different and they hunt in a lot of the same ways they're ambush hunters so you can see this guy curl up right here this is another python and they'll sit there and wait for prey to come to them in much the same way both species have heat sensing pits along the front of their body front of their nose and they use them like little heat seeking missiles if you will to figure out where their prey is and be able to grab on and bite it really effectively so if a mammal like a bandicoot or something like that were to crawl across this branch they know exactly where it is and be able to bite it super accurately when they do super cruel thanks now let's go from the snakes to another animal you can find in the trees and that's our koala bear and before we get too far i want to ex bear out of your vernacular they aren't bears they're not related to bears they superficially look a lot like teddy bears and so that's where it comes but in australia they're known as koalas and they're specialists unlike some of these other animals i've been talking about that eat a lot of different types of of critters or a lot of different types of food our koalas only eat eucalyptus and of the 50 or so odd species that our koalas can koalas can eat throughout australia typically those species of of trees are found in just specific regions overlapping with massive range of the quality it can be found in australia and so that means that each individual koala usually has a preference like i find these two or three species of trees the most tasty and so they really specialize even further than just going towards eucalyptus leaves specializing on just a few species in a specific region now the reason why they go after our koala leaves is because they are um readily available in these eucalyptus and gum forests that you can find in australia but unfortunately they meet these challenges and that the leaves are incredibly tough to digest they'll eat upwards of two pounds of leaves a day but only getting about 25 percent of the nutrition out of that that being said they are actually able to get a lot of the moisture they need out of it in fact the female koalas which are just a bit smaller than the males will actually get most if not all of their moisture from the leaves never having a drink from a pool or a pond or anything like that now these forests you can see right here uh the eucalyptus forests meaning as these qualities are high up in these trees they don't have to worry about any herbivores down on the ground or any herbivores up in the sky or through the trees climbing around because eucalyptus is incredibly toxic in fact just about three quarters of a teaspoon of eucalyptus oil would be fatal to a human so no other animal really specializes on eating a very tough leaf that's also incredibly toxic and poisonous but they have a downfall to having competition out in the forest for these leaves and if their digestive system takes so much effort to digest it that they sleep a lot in a process upwards of 18 to 20 hours so they're essentially the australian sloth eating some leaves then sleeping out most of the day they even have an adaptation for that sleep along the back of their rump they have this thick cartilaginous pad beneath the skin that acts almost like a little seat cushion that they can press up against the limbs like you see in this picture right here and still make it quite comfortable while they sleep and i gotta say seeing different positions of koalas while they sleep is pretty hysterical they find different ways to to make it happen when you're sleeping 18 to 20 hours a day you got to get creative now moving from koalas to understandably the other famous marsupial of australia we have the kangaroo and if you've been to australia or maybe done some research in australia you've probably heard that there also are the small version which are the wallabies but did you know there's also a mid-range or a mid-sized version called the wallaroo now the differences between them there are size differences but it's kind of arbitrary depending on each species some like the wallabies eat a lot of smaller foods than the kangaroos but there can be a lot of overlap now when we talk specifically about our eastern gray kangaroo this is a species most people see when they come to australia it's a pretty interesting species of kangaroo in fact the name kangaroo came from eastern grey kangaroos the word gengaroo which is a word from aboriginal peoples in the northeast of australia was specifically targeted towards eastern grey kangaroo and eventually that term over time changed subtly and then is now definition the name for all kangaroo species that we see throughout australia and somewhat similar to our snakes our green tree python and our boa our kangaroo kind of is a bit of a coercion evolution with our deer that you can see in north america they are kind of a mid-range size herbivore they're eating grasses and leaves and things like that they're found in forested as well as kind of open grassland environments they're also have a very similar relationship to people in that there's a hunting season for them you can eat the meat and use the skin for leathers things like that uh they also are pest in farm fields and in gardens and they can be quite dangerous if you were to hit one on the road so deer and kangaroos you can kind of think of them in the same light but of course the main difference is that hopping ability right and so kangaroo's hopping ability is pretty exceptional and it actually allows them to very efficiently travel over vast landscapes throughout australia you can see this animation here with those two legs hopping that tail acts as a counterbalance and what's happening internally is their legs have these very stretchy tendons that act a bit like a spring so when their foot hits the ground that spring stretches you can see in the center photo there and then when they go to leap the next hop that tendon reckons uh reconciles and that launches them forward saving up some of that energy recycling the energy from the previous hop what's even cooler is the act of hopping opens and closes their diaphragm and so they don't have to worry about breathing while they're hopping because their body automatically pumps that lung as they're hopping along which is super cool and all that combined means that our kangaroos can be quite athletic top speed was set by an eastern grey kangaroo 40 miles an hour and in one of those hops they can clear upwards of 25 feet from one hop to the next which is pretty incredible out on a landscape now because they're so specialized with hopping they have to if they want to go slow do kind of a weird crawl this is what you're seeing right here in this video where the front legs and back legs are moving in unison with their tail so they're using actually five limbs rather than typical four to move along through the landscape with that tail acting a bit like a crutch and helping lift those big hopping legs on the back all those adaptations mean that kangaroos actually have a very difficult time going just straight backwards they have they really can't go backwards very very easily and so that's why the kangaroo is on the seal of the government of australia is it supposed to symbolize that kangaroos like australia only moves forward and can never go backward which is pretty interesting now while you probably know a little bit about kangaroos i bet you might not know that kangaroos can be found in trees as well this is again in the rain forest regions of australia we have this species the lumholtz tree kangaroo that's decent size about 16 pounds and like their ground-loving cousins they are an herbivore they eat a lot of leaves and vines up in the forest one of my favorite facts about them they actually have hair that parts along the back and grows down off each side and what's useful about that they live in a rain forest with a lot of rain understandably they get caught out in rainstorms every so often and their fur grows in such a way that as rain hits their body it runs off rather than soaking them to the bone which is kind of cool and on top of that they're pretty athletic because of those awesome back legs and their jumping ability they can jump from a height of 250 200 feet and land safely on the ground or on another tree without injuring themselves which is pretty incredible it's like huge height now be it tree kangaroos or our ground loving kangaroos they have to worry about predators like the dingo and the dingo is a really interesting species to talk about when it talks when we talk about how australians and cultural history interacts with with dingoes they're a medium-sized dog they're in fact actually the largest natural predator that you can find in australia this is a rescue that's at a sanctuary and research center down in southern australia and we don't really know exactly how dingoes got to australia there is some genetic evidence which suggests that they probably arrived upwards of 18 000 years ago maybe through land bridges that would have formed along southeast asia into australia during ice ages or they may have been a little bit more soon brought to australia a little bit sooner maybe between three and five thousand years ago by early peoples that were colonizing australia and the reason why this is so interesting and so important to understand is how australians look at the dingo because they have sometimes been known as canis lupus dingo meaning they're a subspecies of wolf they've also been known as canis familiaris just a different breed of dog or recently a lot of scientists are pushing for canis dingo meaning they're their own species and so depending on whether you consider them a wolf a breed of dog that's out there on the environment or their own species changes how people how conservationists how governments interact with a species out of the landscape because as you can imagine having a predator like a wolf um out on australian landscape where you're farming and where you're ranching you could have come into conflict and that's exactly what happens in australia they've actually because of this put up a fence called the dingo fence this is a fence that is one of the longest structures in the world man-made structures it's upwards of 3 3 500 miles long and this essentially cuts off dingo territory um from the southeast where there's a lot of ranches a lot of agriculture and hopefully protects ranchers sheep and cattle from any dingo attacks by maintaining that fence line now it has been relatively successful there's a lot less potential attacks on the the southeast side where it's protected from dingoes versus the other side though they have to worry about feral dogs and things like that in the area that aren't dingoes as well but what the scientists have just come out with a paper looked at the vegetation cover on one side of the fence in the other on the natural color side the brown side right there that's a satellite image which arguably can't tell the difference but using special filters with a satellite they can look at the vegetation cover and i'll highlight the line here where the fence line is the actual lower corner there is has less vegetation on it than the unfenced area where the dingoes are and the reason for that is they did some study plots and looked where they just excluded kangaroos remember dingoes eat kangaroos just by excluding that herbivore what otherwise would be a very arid landscape actually has a fair bit of grass in it and so the dingoes act a lot like the wolves in yellowstone in that they control the herbivore population which then helps promotes the growth of the grasses and vegetation that those herbivores would feed on so regardless of how you classify dingos they certainly are an important part of the landscape that's been there for at least three to five thousand years if not a lot longer than that now moving from dingoes on to some other predators we've got of course the tasmanian devil right here this is the largest marsupial type carnivore that australia and tasmania has in fact they were found in australia up until about 600 years ago and now they're only found on the island of tasmania and they're mid-range they're small um so biggest marsupial carnivores is really a small benchmark to achieve anywhere between 10 and 30 pounds but they're a scavenger they're going after dead wallabies and kangaroos things like that and to be able to do that they crunch through bones quite effectively with a 200 pounds per square inch bite force which is pound for pound one of the strongest bite forces in the world and of course they're known for being quite aggressive out on these landscapes where they interact with each other and meet when they're getting attracted to these carcasses and their call is probably the reason why they got the name tasmanian devil you can imagine early settlers coming into australia hearing this out in the forest you would assume there's a devil out there somewhere so i'm gonna play this call for you so super crazy for sure now cousin of the tasmanian devil are the qualls uh they kind of go with the black and white coloration on this eastern quaal but they have a lot more spots than stripes that like the tasmanian devil one of my personal favorites of the qualls are spotted tail qual this is a cool one that can be seen on the itinerary and they look a little bit like a cat they're about the size of a domestic cat in fact early scientists researching australian animals called them australia's native cat but they're not related to cats they're actually related to the tasmanian devil they are a type of marsupial and that beautiful spotted color that you see on the different species of quals acts a bit like camouflage because they live in these forested environments and by the light shining through those leaves of course if you've been in a forest that's been sunny before you know you have that dappled light all along the ground and that spotted coat helps them to blend in with that dap of coloration as they're moving around looking for prey and they're just a really interesting animal just one of those that not a lot of people heard about but are certainly a beautiful creature and one to appreciate now if we talked about devils now we have to talk about dragons as well in australia they have a lot of them any lizard in the family of agamids oftentimes is called a dragon and there are a lot of them there's upwards of 70 species of dragon lizards out on the australian landscape probably the most famous is the bearded dragon you can see right here and uh they're actually quite popular in the pet tray that's probably where they've gotten so famous is they're a really easy lizard to take care of um don't need a whole lot of effort and they can actually be a little bit affectionate that's like lizard level of affection but they are quite a popular probably the most popular lizard over iguanas in the pet trade now the wild ones are known a name for that beard you can see on this guy's chin right here all those sharp skills that form that beard where they get their name and they have a really interesting set of communication means of communication with other rival males out on the landscape they'll often start off by bobbing their head you can see this dragons actually turn his beard black they can change color from light to dark and then even flare that beard out looking really menacing with their mouth open you can even see their teeth and that menacing beard with all those spikes along it and if you're the other dragon realizing that you know what i'm messing with something i don't want to um they say sorry mate they wave and that's their um communication for submission which is pretty funny to see a couple other my favorite lizards we have the blue tongue skink this is a species that's found in kind of deserty areas much like our bearded dragons that typically are and they're known for that tongue and through research scientists expect that that tongue is actually there to scare off predators you're a bird like an eagle or a kite or something flying in trying to catch this lizard he'll open up his mouth really quickly show off that bright blue tongue might be a little bit startling at first and give that a skink enough time to slither away in addition to that the tongue even actually has some uv reflectance some ultraviolet reflectance and birds like our eagles and kites can see that uv so it even glows more for a bird than it does to our eyes another one of my favorites is the shingle back this is a species where the head is on the upper right and then the tail is in kind of the center right there on the bottom and they look pretty similar right the head and the tail and the shingle back actually stores a lot of fat in its tail so it balloons up like that and looks a lot like the head and so hopefully a predator will attack its tail first and that hopefully will give it enough time to try to escape without having a talon or a mouth of the predator around its head it can hopefully just pull its tail out and then continue on its way which is pretty cool adaptation they look like a living pine cone as well which makes them pretty interesting now keeping with the reptile theme let's talk about the world's biggest reptile this is the saltwater crocodile found in australia and they can get huge a full grown kind of max out size for uh salty is 20 feet long and upwards of 2500 pounds you can see in this picture right here this is our researchers and staff with the australia zoo they're getting ready to capture a 15 foot croc you can see how many people it takes to catch or that size and they're hoping to do some research and potential relocation of this particular individual this happens from time to time in australia you have problem crocodiles and that get into areas where people frequent and even though you put out signs and things like that australia the people even tourists may get themselves into trouble with crocodiles now when it comes to relocating crocodiles it can be a little tricky depending on the area um one such crocodile up in cape york in the northern part of australia was relocated from one side of the cave to the other and remarkably in just 19 days it had traversed the 255 miles around the cape to go back to its original home site which is pretty incredible if they were all home in to do that and to do it so quickly and the reason they're actually quite intelligent the saltwater croc actually was using the tides in the currents along the cape and so every time the current was going in the right direction that crocodile would get in there slowly moving along or just floating along with the current just using that like a conveyor belt and then when the tide switched he'd sink to the bottom or go out onto a beach like you're seeing here and then wait for that current to switch back in the direction he's going get back in the water and ride it all the way around without using a whole lot of energy and so when we look at a map of the range of our saltwater croc you can see throughout parts of southern southeast asia and australia but then they have this massive nomadic range because understanding the currents through the ocean these crops can turn up in some places well away from where you typically expect to find them in addition to being the largest reptile out there in the environment they also have the strongest bite force of any animal they have 3 700 pounds per square inch of bite force for comparison a line has about 650 and a person has about 160 which means our crocodiles can go after just about anything they want to eat they'll even eat sea turtles that have that strong shell to hopefully protect against a predator they've even been seen eating sharks this is a salty that's going after a young bull shark that had swum up into one of their estuary systems which is pretty incredible now as far as water kind of keeping along with that theme we're going to take a very short dip into the great barrier reef because i could talk a lot about great barrier reef animals but uh just to kind of start off short we're going to talk about some of the popular ones a couple of my favorites this is the clown fish everyone are probably familiar with from various movies and television the oscillators clown fish is the actual species name and they live in the anemone and ordinarily that an enemy would be quite stinging but they have this mucus coating along their body that helps protect them and they can live in this anemone and actually a bit of a symbiotic relationship that anatomy protects them from other predators as well as they help the enemy keep it clean as well as maybe attract some pests that the anemone will then eat and this kind of set up right here with a few different clown fish in the same anemone is pretty typical the female is the bigger one kind of dead center in the screen the male that she breeds with is in the upper left and then there's a younger male off to the right kind of hanging out in the periphery that's pretty typical the reason for this is because our clownfish do something pretty unique and pretty interesting say a predator were to come along and eat that female well sad for a second but our male clown fish that now has lost is made will actually grow in size and internally switches gender to female and then one of those males along the outskirts comes in and takes his old place so they actually change gender depending on whether those females are present or not which is pretty cool when you think about it um finding nemo would be an entirely different film if they were really true to life with what happens with uh marlin there another one of my favorites saltwater critters is our banded sea crate this is a really cool sea snake they actually have snakes that slither through the ocean in places around southeast asia and australia lovely black and white coloration they can stay under for upwards of 15 to 30 minutes and during that time they're diving around through these corals and rock beds looking for any fish that are hiding around so much in the same way an eel does that so as our banded sea crate they're able to do it so well they don't have fins like a fish but they have a flattened tail that acts like a paddle that helps move them along all right moving on to my last and arguably i think personally the best critters to talk about when it comes to talking about australia are the monotremes the echidna and the platypus and the reason why i love talking about it as much as i do is they are so weird so to start off with why they might be so weird is the fact that they split off from the mammalian um grouping quite a while ago about 166 million years ago the monitoring did their thing and the marsupials and the placental mammals like us and and mice and dogs split off on their own and because of that they actually still lay eggs so these are the only two types of mammals in the world that lay eggs you can see in this video from the smithsonian channel you can see the egg inside of not a pouch like a marsupial but actually two folds of skin that kind of grow up on when that female is pregnant she lays her eggs puts those eggs along her stomach and eventually a mammal hatches out a young platypus in this case which is really interesting really weird to think about just a kind of small ping pong ball sized egg now you can see this is a female platypus with a couple of our young as are growing up very similar to a marsupial though they start off very very underdeveloped that's why you can see those bright pink little youngsters there and for an echidna one of my favorite facts about them is their youngster is called a puggle they don't grow those quilts they don't have those krills in their egg they actually have to grow those that's why it looks really naked in this picture this is from a rehabber and um unlike other mammals like our marsupials and us um they don't have teeth to um to our mammary glands for that they're young to drink their milk but they still give off milk and they have modified sweat glands along their stomach that just ooze milk on their skin so this is a rehabber feeding a puggle but you can see much the same way that milk would be oozing out of that droplet just like oozes out his skin and then our youngster there is just lapping it up off the skin of its mother and echidnas are super cool they're essentially a cross between a hedgehog and an anteater they have an excellent sense of smell they have all those spines to protect themselves they have super strong claws to dig into an ant hill or termite hill and they have really long tongues upwards of seven inches which is about half the length of the actual echidna that tongue sticks out and then a sticky saliva laughs up all the insects in there and these guys can go to town on a little termite mound eating or moving their tongue in and out upwards of 100 times a minute getting all the termites they possibly can now when it comes to weirdest animal though i think platypus probably takes the cake this is a species that looks like a conglomeration of a bunch of different animals and in fact it kind of is with all the different unique adaptations it has one of my favorites is that duck bill that it has isn't actually hard like a duck it's got kind of a fleshy texture to it and it's got all these receptors along the outside like a shark that can sense electricity so if you look at this picture right here you can actually see that you can't really make out the eyes that's because it's eyes are closed when it's in the water it's swimming with its eyes closed just using the electrical sensor a bit like a metal detector and it's sweeping that build back and forth through the rocks looking for small crustaceans crayfish small bugs things like that that it can lap up inside of its beak super interesting but on top of that once it has that crustacean or in this case a worm in its mouth it can't chew it in the traditional way it doesn't have any teeth so it actually puts little bits of gravel in its mouth from the bottom of that river and uses that gravel mushes it around with their food and uses the rocks like teeth to be able to eat then on top of that um both the echidna and our platypus here if you look at this digest the diagram of their digestive system there's one big piece missing there's no stomach they don't have a stomach like we do their stomach as a definition is a chamber where all these digestive juices digestive juices sit and then digest a lot of the proteins and sugars out of the food and then that passes through and gets absorbed by the intestines they don't have that they have some unique enzymes and some acids moving through the whole system but they don't have that stomach like pouch that other animals do on top of that they have a bit of a prehensile tail bit like a monkey or an opossum grab leaves like you can see right here the possum's heading up screen and it's got leaves in its tail so it can move around and then put into its burrow and make it nice and comfortable here we're seeing the spine of a male opossum on its back foot and a bit like a spur on a chicken they use it to fight other males during the breeding season but what's even more interesting than that is that spine is actually venomous it's not deadly to people but uh it's been said that it is a quite painful sting if you were to pick up a male possum during breeding season and actually get stung by the opossum and this research just came out this year some scientists were looking at skins of different mammals and shining black lights at them and what they found with the opossum is that it actually glows in the dark when you shine a uv light at it it emits that light back what's called biofluorescence which is uh something that previously really had only been seen in a few mammal species and scorpions in particular are well known for that in the southwest here so in to recap why i think australia in particular the platypus is the weirdest animal on the planet is because it is part beaver with that lovely coat and those webbed feet part duck with that bill part shark with that electro reception that it has to sense animals moving around through the water it has a prion saw tail just like an opossum even has its nose and its eyes on the top of its head so it barely sticks out of the water just like an alligator or a crocodile it's venomous like a rattlesnake and even glows in the dark with a uv light just like a scorpion so you can imagine and understand why researchers when they got a study skin of the platypus from australia was sent to a museum in england when they first looked at it they thought it wasn't real that they were like trying to pull it apart because they were stitching somewhere someone was messing with them this wasn't a real animal and it turns out it very much is and every year we find out something more weird and more interesting about platypus so personally one of my favorite all-time animals in the world so i hope uh probably kind of geeking out about some of the really interesting and unique wildlife in australia it's got you thinking like i need to get to australia and see some of these super cool critters and if you're interested as much as i am i highly recommend checking out our australia trips we have two different itineraries the north itinerary here goes uh through the great barrier reef north of brisbane goes into the daintree rainforest where those cassowaries are checks out the beautiful water aquatic and coastal wildlife and then goes into cockadoo which is kind of a bit like an african savannah type environment where it has some cattle species and some interesting kangaroos and a whole wealth of birds in the wetlands as well or you can do the southern itinerary which includes tasmania and get a chance to see the things like our echidna um a platypus tasmanian devil and get a really cool experience along the south route along the great ocean road of australia so i highly recommend if you're as interested in you weird and unique wildlife as i am that you go out ahead and check out australia so with that i want to say thank you so much for your time and i'll open it up to see if there's any questions thank you so much mike we've got some great questions for you and i just want to remind everyone who's watching if you have a question for mike you can submit those in your control panel under the questions field all right a few people want to know if the tawny frog mouth is a type of owl oh good question it isn't it's actually most closely related to what are called night jars or nighthawks um you can find them here in the united states uh they're that's our closest living relative but they are a little bit of that convergent evolution and that they're meeting a lot of the same needs as owls do by hunting nocturnally that being said there are actual other owl species that you can find in australia as well but the tawny frog mouth has those big eyes big mouth and that really cryptic coloration just like an owl does and uh there is also curiosity about the cassowary and the crest they have what is that made of what's what is its purpose oh yeah so the crest of the cassowary that really sets it apart from the emu so that crest is keratin on the outside same as our fingernails in her hair um actually the same as its beak or any bird beak is made out of keratin but it's not solid keratin and it's not solid bone it's actually a spongy material inside of there and there's a few different ideas of why they have it one is it might act a bit like a resonating chamber we see this with hornbills in places like borneo where um when they call that sound resonates inside that chamber and makes that call a bit deeper and a bit stronger so for an animal lives in a rainforest where it's so thick you probably can't see five feet in front of you in places being able to send that call way out allows them to be able to talk to each other quite well or it could be something as simple as the females like a man with a crest that being said both the males and females have the crest um or it could also even just help them by using that crest kind of moving forward it's almost like putting your arm forward as you're walking through some vines or some trees that keeps that stuff from smacking you in the face if you've got something else to push through the forest instead awesome um so we've got someone who's a big fan of reptiles and wants to know if the northern itinerary or southern itinerary would be better in terms of seeing snakes and lizards i would probably say the northern itinerary just because it covers i think a little bit more diversity of habitats uh so and you're dealing with rainforest environment um like the daintree rainforest it's a prehistoric rainforest it's potentially over 100 million years old this forest has more or less been the same that's because australia hasn't had a lot of plate tectonic changes over the years so that's been changing where the forest has been and so you get some really interesting and unique species and of course um as i'm sure that person knows random forest environments really lend themselves to some pretty interesting diversity of reptiles and also you head over to kakadu which is much more of a dry area near darwin and so you get some of those species as well i would probably suggest that but that being said i think you're going to have a great time either way looking for reptiles on either itinerary and someone else wants to know specifically which part of australia would you see a bearded dragon oh so there's actually a number of different species of bearded dragons there's like the inland bearded dragon that's actually the specific species that the this one is right here that um is the species that you see in the pet trade there's the eastern bearded dragon have more likely a chance to see that one and those bearded dragons their range is basically the entire swath of everything that isn't the outback so the kind of red center of australia the eastern beard of dragon just goes from cape york all the way down into southern australia and parts of tasmania so um there are different dragon species for basically all of australia great and what size uh is a kangaroo when it leaves the pouch for good oh well that depends a lot on the species so they leave the pouch for good after about a year or so of growth from beginning from pregnancy until the end and uh see for an eastern gray kangaroo i would say um just to give you an idea of like kind of my length so that would be probably about half their their height so we're talking maybe three feet tall depending on the species of kangaroo or maybe a little bit less than that um what's interesting is there's an individual variation in that some youngsters will stay with their mother a lot longer they're a little bit harder to kick out of the nest if you know what i mean whereas some um just individual variation and personality will leave a lot sooner all right a few people are wondering if uh tasmanian devils are still experiencing that cancer that they uh ravaged with a while ago yeah so it's something i didn't talk about but um tasmanian devils their biggest problem right now aside from the typical stuff which is like habitat loss and and whatnot um they're dealing with a contagious facial tumor and what that is is they actually will get a cancer that's contagious there's very few cancers that are outright contagious this is one of them and it's contagious among tasmanian devils and as you saw there with their pretty aggressive behavior um they can bite each other and scratch each other pretty frequently as part of just feeding even actually their breeding results in a lot of bites that's kind of how they go about it and so they easily transmit that contagious cancer and those tumors grow along their face and um can push out teeth or just make it super difficult for them to fit food in their mouth because those tumors are in the way so oftentimes those animals starve to death because of those tumors and uh that is still a thing that's happening in australia they've had some luck with some vaccines but trying to vaccinate a population i mean we have a hard enough time vaccinating people in the united states or other parts of the world let alone trying to vaccinate a wild population of animals out on a landscape you can imagine the challenges that go into something like that but in addition to that um what we're seeing in some places those tasmanian devils are developing immunity and the scientists are still researching exactly what is giving that immunity most likely it's something specifically genetic about those particular devils and they're hoping was kind of um with selective breeding and things like that they can release some of these immune uh tassies into the environment and hopefully get those genes moving around and maybe beat these contagious uh tumors so uh jury's still out exactly how that conservation is gonna go but i've got high hopes for it okay and which of the snakes that you covered today are venomous uh one of them so uh the sea crate is venomous the green tree python uh is non-venomous and when we talk about venomous snakes in australia there are a number of venomous snakes uh in australia but they aren't necessarily that dangerous at all when you hear about envenomations in australia oftentimes it's someone that's like messing with a snake or getting too close those sorts of things if you follow the same rules you follow just about any wildlife in the united states which is um give it its distance don't harass it um watch uh watch it see what it does understanding its behavior those sorts of things you can be perfectly safe with venomous snakes in australia as well acts the exact same way the most venomous snake in the world is in australia called the inland taipan that species is found in the center of the country but very few envenomations actually happen even though it's so deadly just because it's not around people and people don't harass it so it lives its life on its own you live your life on its own on your own and you can be perfectly safe even with that that snake just a mile from your house great um and the last question i'll take today and i'm not sure how much information you have on this but a lot of people are really curious about how australia is doing um after the wildfires do you know anything about that yeah yeah so uh australia gets wildfires every single year um just like a lot of different parts of the of the united states like alaska where i guide the same happens there as well so a lot of species especially plants are especially adapted to a wildfire environment that being said in 2019 and early part of 2020 there was significant wildflower wildfires over across the landscape and so those areas definitely had some severe damage a lot of damage to property uh some human life loss as well as a lot of animals that lost their life during that process and so the recovery is going to be slow and it's going to take years that being said because australia is specially adapted for an environment like um a fire environment like that there is a lot of rebound that is quite hopeful and so through work with a lot of different conservation organizations in fact world wildlife fund australia actually is doing a lot of work with the rebuild and releases as well as um like feeding wild populations to help alleviate and get them through some of some tough dry times so those conservation organizations are doing a lot and i'm super super um hopeful and and interested in australia because i think they're going to bounce back just fine it just may take a little bit of time depending on where you're at in australia all right well thank you so much mike this has been fantastic australia is a beautiful location with such an amazing variety of unique wildlife so it was really fun to learn about all this i'm going to hand it back over to you for closing comments all right thanks kendall well again thanks so much for joining me on uh my little journey through australia's wildlife i hold a special place in my heart because of such unique and interesting critters to talk about and learn about and so if you've enjoyed as much as i have highly recommend checking out one of our australia itineraries goes through some vast section of australia get a chance to see a lot of diversity of landscapes cultural components and a lot of wildlife as well and so uh hopefully we'll tune in again for another wildlife talk sometime in the future and until then thanks so much and have a great weekend thanks again mike and just for everyone watching you can definitely get in touch with an adventure specialist at our office if you have more information wanting more information about our australia trip so give us a call at the number you see on the screen so thank you so much for everyone for tuning in today be sure to join us tomorrow for our next daily dose of nature we did record today's presentation we'll have the replay available on our website soon and with that i'll conclude the webinar goodbye everybody", "3MjnIvLQ09Q": "[Music] piet montrion was a dutch artist known for his abstract art he liked using line shape and usually the primary colors red yellow and blue to create his paintings today we're going to make an animal inspired by mondrian's work for this project you'll need some thicker paper i have watercolor paper we'll be using a ruler pencil and sharpie and i have some animal pictures i just went online and i typed in different animals outlines and that i printed a bunch of different ones off i was looking for just basic outline shapes that didn't include a lot of details on the inside of the animal pick an animal that you like to use for this project or you can do the whale along with me i'll also be using some construction paper later some watercolor paints and some scissors i'm going to start off by putting my paper the same direction as my animal since my wheel is horizontal i want my paper to be horizontal as well i'm going to have my picture close by so that i can look at it while i'm drawing i'm going to start off by drawing with a pencil just in case i need to erase i want my picture to take up as much of my paper as possible so instead of just starting and drawing right away i'm going to make some marks to show where i want the front of the whale to be i'm also going to look and see where i want the back of the whale to be i'm going to do the bottom line of the whale and the top of the whale i do this before drawing just to make sure that my picture is nice and big and fills up the entire space of my paper now i can kind of connect my marks so that i can make the outline of the whale [Music] i'm trying to draw lightly with my pencil right now you can see i'm hardly touching and that way if i make a mistake it's easier to erase at this point too if there's something that i want to change with my animal picture i can always change it it doesn't have to look exactly like the picture that i'm looking at [Music] i'm also going to show where the eye is on the whale and i'm going to add a fin i'm going to make mine just a little bit longer than the one in the picture now i'm going to use my sharpie i'm using a fatter sharpie as opposed to those really skinny ones and i want to make a line that goes around the outside of my whale sometimes it's easier to turn the paper to get the right angle of the line i'm trying to make a nice smooth outline with my sharpie and i'm turning my paper as i go until i get the entire picture outlined with my black sharpie i'm trying to be very careful in this point to make sure my lines are nice and smooth [Music] [Music] i'm also going to add the eye by outlining it and then i'm going to color it in as well when i color it in i'm going to leave a little part of it white to look like a little highlight in the eye the rest of it i color in black [Music] i don't need my little picture anymore now i need my ruler and my pencil when using my ruler i'm going to start with vertical lines vertical lines again are the ones that go up and down notice on the hand that i'm using to hold my ruler i have my fingers spread wide out so that my ruler doesn't move i'm adding lines in different thicknesses all the way down my whale i'm not staying in the lines because we'll be cutting this out later some lines are closer together some lines are farther apart until i have all of my whale filled with lines i would suggest maybe eight to ten lines try not to go more than that next i'm going to add horizontal lines remember horizontal lines are the ones that go from side to side again i'm going to try to spread my fingers out on my ruler so that it doesn't move when i'm drawing my lines [Music] now that i have the lines on my whale i'm going to use my sharpie to trace over them [Music] i'm trying to be careful to make sure that my lines are still straight [Music] [Music] do do i'm adding my last couple lines now to my picture and i'm happy with how it's looking i'm going to put my sharpie away for now i will get it out later again and now i'm going to switch to painting i'm using watercolor paints and a flat brush that'll make it easier to make straight lines got my water cup ready and i'm starting off with my red now i did speed up my video a little bit just to kind of help get through the video a little bit faster here you can see that as i am painting with my red i'm kind of jumping around to different shapes on my whale if you want to you can have some of them right next to each other but i chose to have none of my red ones touching each other so i'm going around my picture i'm using not a lot of water but more paint so that it's nice and bright colored and i'm filling in different shapes with my red paint as i'm doing this i'm trying to be very careful with my edges to make sure that i'm staying inside of my lines i want this to look nice and neat [Music] you can see how the flat brush helps with making those lines nice and straight if i do happen to go out of a line you can always just use your finger or a kleenex or something like that to blot out the color now that i have my red i'm going to add some more colors next on my list yellow yellow is also a primary color and i'm going to go ahead and fill in some of the other shapes with yellow now it's important when you're filling in some colors to make sure that you leave some of the shapes white mondrian like to have a lot of white shapes in his picture too and if we add all the colors too much we'll run out of white spots i'm also going to have some in black later so i'm trying to make sure that i don't do too many yellow too many red so that i leave room for some of the other colors [Music] next up is blue blue is the third primary color and is also another one that mondrian like to use in his art [Music] i'm adding blue to some of the open spaces again trying not to have any of the blues touch each other side by side but you can have them touch side by side if you prefer [Music] i do want to remember to leave some open for white and black you can always start off with just a few of each color and then go back and add more after you have some of all of the colors in your picture [Music] you can see that i've added a couple more things to my whale i added some black spots and a couple extra lines just for fun now that i have everything on my whale i want to cut it out so i'm taking my scissors and trying to be very careful and cutting on the lines of my whale [Music] now that i have my wheel cut out i decided to put it on a background i could do a big background like this and maybe even add a fun border but for now i'm just gonna put it on a little background this is red construction paper and i could glue it like that and there you have it my final whale inspired by mondrian hope you enjoyed and thanks for watching you", "3d5JtSHC3vw": "Hi, it's me Molly and it's time for...

I'm the princess of dolphins. And I'm the prince of stingrays. Once upon a time... Way down deep in the ocean, there was a king who\nruled the seven seas with the help of the seven\nprinces and princesses, each of whom had a magical jewel that gave them the power to turn\ninto their favorite sea animal. It was a very happy time\nfor everyone under the sea. Until one day... [giggling] My jewel! [doorbell ringing] Your Majesty! Princess Oona, what's the matter? Someone took my jewel,\nand now I can't... Now I can't... turn into a jellyfish. Oh no! I can't transform into a turtle either. Not your jewel too, Prince Nonny. Yes. Did you see who took it. - No.\n- No. Don't worry, I know\nsomeone who can help. Oh yeah! The Princess of the Narwhals. So Molly, Gil and their friends\nswam to the Arctic Sea. Excuse me, we're looking\nfor Princess Deema. Well, you've certainly come\nto the right place. Welcome to the Arctic. The best place in the ocean\nto sit back and chill. What can I do for you? Someone stole my jewel. Mine too. Well that's not chill at all. Did you see who took it? - Nope.\n- No. We were hoping you could\nhelp us figure it out. [whistling] Welcome to Narwhal-Mart. We have the biggest selection of\nocean animals in the deep blue sea. OK, what color was the animal\nthat took your jewels? Hm... it was purple. OK, purple. We need your help. Which of these sea animals are purple? - Those!\n- Those three! Right, it has to be one of\nthese three sea animals. What else do you remember? Well, it grabbed our jewels. That means it had arms. Yeah, and the arms were tentacles. The animal that stole my jewel\nhad tentacles! OK. Which of these sea creatures\nhas tentacles? - That one!\n- The octopus! An octopus took our jewels. A purple octopus. Uh-oh. That can only mean one thing. The sea witch! The sea witch? Yeah, she sends her octopus\nto do all her dirty work. Oh no! He'll probably try to take our jewels too. So we've got to keep them safe. My jewel! Hey, come back here. He got me with his ink. Octopuses use ink\nto help them get away. We've got to warn Goby before\nthe octopus tries to take his jewel too. You're right. Come on, Gilly. Meanwhile, down in the deepest\ndarkest part of the ocean... He-he! Okay. We've got the jellyfish girl's jewel,\nthe turtle boy's jewel. Here's the jewel of the narwhal, princess. Mm, thank you, thank you my pet. Soon all the jewels of\nthe seven seas will be mine and-- Push me over there, please. Yes, mistress. [groaning] And I won't be stuck\nto this rock anymore. Ha-ha! Because... push me back. [groaning] Because I'll be able to turn into any sea animal that I want, and then I will rule the entire ocean. [laughing] Hey, why aren't you laughing Olivier? [laughing] The sea witch and her octopus\nhad stolen three of the jewels of the seven seas. So Molly, Gil and Bubble Puppy hurried to warn their friend\nGoby, the prince of sharks. Hey, Goby. Hi. [screaming] [screaming] Gil, wait. [screaming] It's OK, these sharks are my friends. Goby, we're here to warn you\nabout the sea witch. Her octopus has been stealing\neveryone's jewels. Well don't worry, mine's right here,\nsafe and sound. Excuse me. What time is it? It's time for lunch. \u266a What time is it?\nIt's time for lunch! \u266a \u266a What time is it?\nIt's time for lunch! \u266a \u266a What time is it?\nIt's time for lunch! \u266a \u266a It's lunchtime!\nHey, what's for lunch? \u266a Mm, seaweed salad. What did you get for\nlunch today, Prince Goby? I got chips and a sandwich. What did you get, Prince Gil? I got chips and a... Sandwich? [laughing] A sandwich? That's silly. And sandy. [laughing] - Sandy...\n- Hey! He took my jewel! Uh-oh... After him! Don't worry Goby, we'll get it back. [music playing] Whoa. Come on, Gilly. Do you see the octopus? Gilly, look. We've got to take them before\nthe sea witch knows we're here. She knows. The sea witch! My jewel! [laughing] It was so thoughtful of you\nto bring me the last jewels in person. Molly, Gil and Bubble Puppy\nfound the stolen jewels, but the sea witch caught them. Your jewel please, Princess Molly. Closer. [groaning] Let's get out of here! Na-ah-ah. Molly, over here. Ah, what? [barking] [groaning] Get that jewel. Yes, my mistress. Here, catch! Got it. Here! Catch! Here. Heads up! [groaning] Oh... oh... [whining] Bubble Puppy! You can have your precious puppy back, just as soon as you give me the jewel. It's OK, boy. You're safe now. At last, I have all seven jewels and\nI can turn into and sea creature I want and finally get off this rock. - And then I will rule the oc--\n- Excuse me. What? I think you counted wrong. What are you talking about?\nSeven guppies, seven jewels. One, two, three,\nfour, five, six... [gasping] Only six guppies? But where's the seventh? Right here! There's a new guppy under the sea. [gasping] Zooli, is that you? Uh-huh, and I have the seventh jewel. Oh! Bring it over to me, kiddo. OK. Zooli, what are you doing? Don't worry, I have a plan. Oh my gosh! This is terrific. And now thanks to you, I will no longer be\na sea anononenome.... anemone. And I will rule the ocean. With friends like these,\nwho needs anemones? [laughing] By the power of the jewels\nof the seven seas, I shall become a great white shark! Ah-ha! I'm off the rock. And I'm scary, right? I think I just might eat you all up. Hm, scary. But it's not what\nI would have done. What do you mean? What would you have done? Oh, I don't know. I guess I would\nhave turned into something bigger. Bigger? Great idea, thank you. I shall become the biggest\nanimal in the ocean, an enormous gigantic blue whale! [groaning] OK, now I'll eat you all up. Well actually, blue whales only eat\nteeny tiny creatures called krill. Plus, blue whales don't have teeth. She does know a lot about animals. But I've got something\nI think you're really gonna like. Actually, you probably wouldn't like it. Yes, I would, I would.\nWhat is it? What is it? Zooli, why are you helping her? Don't worry, Molly.\nWe'll be OK. Just as long as she doesn't\nturn into a sea dragon. A what? What did she say? Oh no, he heard me. She said a sea dragon. A sea dragon? Well, that sounds like\nthe most ferocious, fearsome sea creature of all. I wish to become a sea dragon! [laughing] I can't watch! - You did it!\n- Yay! Hm... That's a sea dragon? Yup, they're related to sea horses. [squeaking] Aww. [clearing throat] Uh... I gotta go. And so, Zooli and her new friends\nbrought the little sea dragon back to King Grouper's coral reef. Oh, I'm so glad you're back. I knew you could do it, guppies. Now the oceans are safe\nfrom the sea witch forever. We couldn't have done it\nwithout you, Zooli. [squeaking] [squeaking] [squeaking] [music playing] She's gonna be very happy here. Yeah, and I think she's going\nto make a lot of new friends. Bye! [music playing] \u266a Now every creature in the sea \u266a \u266a Knows the water is the place to be \u266a \u266a So shout out to my ocean animals \u266a \u266a Ooh, ooh, yeah \u266a And they all lived happily ever after. [cheering] That was fun!\nWhat do we do now? - Come on!\n- We'll show you. - You're gonna love it here.\n- We're gonna have so much fun.

we're going to be continuing with my little bamboo forest area and i'm going to be putting drago's house here right at the end of the path and giving him his own little bamboo grove which i'm really excited about this probably turned out to be one of my favorite house builds um just because the colors go so well you know the green of the bamboo trees and the yellow and green of his house and i think it suits him as well because he's a dragon and i feel like a dragon would enjoy a bamboo growth it did take me a little while to figure out where i wanted his house to actually go um but i think it ended up being in a pretty perfect spot i think it looks really good where i managed to put it so [Music] [Applause] um i did want to um update you guys basically at the end of march and beginning of april there may be a little lull in video content from me because i am having top surgery on the 31st of march um and obviously while i'm recovering from surgery uh i'm not gonna be particularly in the mood to create um animal crossing videos i'm sorry but i'm gonna try and film and um do the voice overs for quite a few videos so that hopefully that there's there's no kind of gap but if there is i apologize um i will also be kind of pre-recording the voiceovers uh normally what i do is i wait until kind of a few days before the video goes live to do my voiceovers but um i will be doing them kind of in advance so if i don't mention anything to do with my top surgery in those voice-overs that is what oh that smells good can i help out you [Music] can [Music] so draco's house is built now and i'm just going to be finishing off the path here and i've so been loving using these little stone circles to indicate pathing along with the ghibli path i just think it looks really good and adds lots of like variety to my builds um because i don't want everything kind of looking the same all the time you know i'm not entirely sure where the path will lead um but i mean we'll figure that out when it comes to it i suppose [Music] i am really hoping that i'm going to be able to film some content with the samrio items before my top surgery because obviously that's something i'm really excited about um and i don't want to miss out so um hopefully i'll be able to do that so yeah hopefully i'll be able to do that and get those videos up for you guys [Music] i'm also i'm decorating kind of the cliff up here um i since this video i have um filled in this space uh so and it looks really good now but you will see that in the next video um but i just wanted to do a little bit of decorating up here because it looks really empty and bare and sad so yeah [Music] [Music] i just used the zen fencing to kind of um indicate this is like an enclosed space because obviously it's got the cliffs by there um to kind of close it off um but i think the the fencing just adds that kind of extra level of closed offness um and because it's kind of this like private kind of secret area almost um i wanted to add a little bit of waterscaping because i haven't really used much waterscaping on my island yet um so i just thought i'd give him like this tiny little waterfall and pond um you can't really see it but when you kind of walk past his house you can hear the sound of the waterfalls which um i think is really nice um kind of adds to the ambiance of the area honestly the easiest bit about this build was building around his house and the most difficult bit was trying to decide how to decorate this cliff up here because i knew it wouldn't really be seen but i wanted it to look good anyway for whatever i was going to do in the future with it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] i just did some time traveling here to get the trees to grow just so that i could kind of visualize what it would look like and so i didn't kind of overcrowd the area with lots of furniture um and i'm glad that i did do that um because it helped me to visualize things a little bit better and see how i wanted things to look [Music] i use the imperial partition here kind of like a fence for a tiny teeny tiny little front yard [Music] especially on purin bay i gave my villagers a lot of really nice big areas around the houses and i've done that less on compito just because i kind of want the houses to look like they do uh in japan so there really isn't very much space around the houses to have like a yard per se um that's why um you can you can build houses really really close to one another there's not like a law regarding that like there is in in some countries like the uk um there has to be a certain amount of space around a house whereas in japan they don't have that law right um so that's why you'll find really really really tall buildings like skyscrapers next to or like right next to like a traditional japanese house um it's bonkers but i kind of wanted to simulate that on my island by giving them kind of these tiny areas um you know big enough to decorate with a few furniture items but really not that much bigger i wanted it to be have more of an emphasis on like the natural areas the the natural surroundings so for example um here is obviously all the bamboo trees and obviously in the area that's next to this which was last week's video the um all the week before last week's which was the kyoto build um there's four houses kind of in like a neighborhood and i wanted it to kind of emulate that kind of these houses are really close together and really kind of clustered and i guess almost kind of claustrophobic in how close to each other they are um and i think it came across well i think it definitely gives that vibe especially now that i've fully decorated on top of the cliff [Music] i am so happy with this small mushroom platform i think it looks so good here i think it matches drago's house perfectly it's so cute [Music] yes the important thing is is that he has a little sitting area i like to give all of my villagers at least

Dolphins aren't actually fish,\ntheir mammals, like dogs and cats. They breathe through their blowholes. Buddy, I want you to meet my new friends,\nMolly and Gil. - Hi!\n- Hi, Buddy! Aww, he's cute!

Oops, looks like you missed\nyour mouth there, Mr. Elephant. [trumpeting] Er... Gil? A herd of elephants... Heard of elephants? Of course I've heard of elephants, Molly. Er... no, behind you. A herd of elephants. Uh-oh... [screaming] F is for frog. When frogs are babies,\nthey have tails and are called tadpoles. Then when they get bigger,\nthey lose their tails and grow legs! Hey, you guys, come look! Woah, Fernando's got legs! - Wow!\n- He's got legs! He's turning into a frog! G is for giant panda. Giant pandas live in China\nand eat a plant called bamboo.

Joey... did you order a pizza? [giggling] L is for lion. A lion's roar is so loud\nit can be heard five miles away! [roaring] I'll bet you there's a lion in there! Lions like to lie in tall grass where they can jump out\nand get other animals. [screaming] M is for monkey. Monkeys love to swing from vine to vine\nand hang on trees. [screeching] What's Gil pretending to be? Right, a monkey! [screeching] N is for narwhal. Narwhals are a type of whale\nwith a big horn. Their horn is actually\na really long twisty tooth called a tusk. There he is! - The Narwhal!\n- The Narwhal! The unicorn of the sea! O is for owl. Most owls are nocturnal, which means they're awake at night\nand sleep during the day. Their amazing eyesight\nhelps them fly in the dark. Here in the forest,\nyou can see all kinds of wildlife. What does wildlife mean? [hooting] Look, an owl! Wildlife means the animals\nyou might see in the forest. [laughing] Owls are smart! P is for penguin. Some penguins live in Antarctica\nbecause they love the cold. They are super swimmers and divers. Penguins? Uh-oh... Woah! [laughing] Q is for queen bee.

Some snakes called rattlesnakes\nhave rattles at the end of their tails. When they shake their tails, the sound scares off predators\nthat want to eat them. But why don't you come have\na refreshing glass of ice cold lemonade with us? Hot diggity! Refreshing! [laughing] T is for turkey. Turkeys don't just say gobble-gobble,\nthey also cluck and purr.

X-Ray fish have see through bodies\nfor camouflage to protect them from getting eaten\nby predators. Let's take a look at Oona's bones\nfrom her X-Ray. That's an X-Ray of my head. But doctor, what about my body? Hmm, which one is the\nX-Ray of Oona's body? - That one!\n- That one! Uh-huh! That's it, that's my X-Ray! -Thank you!\n- You're welcome! Y is for you.

[Music] [Music] [Music] you're so funny you're so fun", "v5_uCoMrB-g": "hey friends today we are hanging out at disney springs and we're going to be doing brunch at the house of blues and i'm very excited because recently i've done the brunch at the boathouse and now i feel like i'm on this trend of trying all the different brunch spots here at disney springs so let's go do this it is a beautiful saturday afternoon look at those crisp blue skies and then the balloon going up in the air right at this moment the boathouse brunch was a really cool experience because they had like dueling pianos and you sang along it was a captain's brunch so it's gonna be nice to see how house of blues compares to that you can watch the video for the uh boathouse if you want i'll put the description in the title of this video and you can check it out and tell me which one you think is better here is the sign they have out front it says weekend brunch saturdays and sundays 10 a.m to 2 p.m a new brunch menu with live music look at that chicken and donuts also bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's no that's something the boathouse didn't have i'm gonna be joining up with some friends and while i wait for them i figured i would just hang out on the porch and go over the menu a little bit sounds like they have some live music actually happening at the moment it's really fun it's a cool atmosphere here at the house of blues here is the offerings they have for brunch and it's a la carte so they got like a breakfast burrito a chicken and donuts a tennessee toast a brisket hash a morning smash burger some really good things actually to choose from it's not all you can eat but they do have the bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's for only 15 which that's not a bad deal especially if you can drink five or ten of them i do remember a while back they had a gospel morning brunch and that was all you can eat it was set up like a buffet in the back room but that has changed since then and this is the new weekday or weekend brunch one of my favorite things is to just look around the house of blues they have so many cool decorations this is the courtyard area right here and this is basically a seat yourself service but take a look at all these cool like figurines here this is a band they're jamming out look at the gas the gas cap or the gas tank this is really awesome what is his name i would call him i would call him rick i don't know why he looks like a rick to me if you guys happen to know of any other good brunch spots that i can visit please let me know in the comments uh i have been to california brunch before and i cannot wait to go back once it does open but so far uh i've only been to the boathouse and here at disney springs i know there's a lot of other good ones brunch is becoming a very popular thing and i'm starting to like it a little bit because i like a little breakfast i like a little lunch i like to mix it up a little bit and i also like mimosas so it's like a perfect time period for me to eat the live music is actually on the inside so it's a really cool atmosphere to come and enjoy your brunch drink your mimosas and just look at all the amazing decor in the restaurant it's packed here too like this is a very busy restaurant i ran into my friend ania and she's already given me the information that i need to try homecoming for brunch so that's gonna be next on my list i'm gonna try to make my way through the springs checking out all the brunch spots and i hope you guys enjoy this series let me know and give me feedback that way i know what i'm doing so that you guys enjoy the entertainment and the videos because i enjoy making them let me tell you that like i just love being here and trying all the amazing food and it's like a double bonus that if you guys enjoy it too we made it to the table and i joined up with my friends villains and vice hello friends hello and they've had the brunch here before and they always talked about the breakfast shot so i think we're gonna get a shot for breakfast jamison butterscotch schnapps orange juice and bacon what can go wrong oh and look at them here they come that is a scary combination oh and of course we got the mimosas mimosas and breakfast shops i don't believe i've ever had a breakfast shop before but there's a first time for everything and what better time than brunch at house of blues it comes in two different glasses so i'm not sure how this works maybe what like car bomb it like maybe that's car vomit right like you you pour it in the other one and just drop it i don't know but we'll figure it out so i believe the order we should do it in is we drink this use this as a chaser and then eat the bacon kind of like a tequila shot with like the the salt the salt and then you uh eat the lime and yeah okay yeah salt yep oh wow that's a lot going on i guess we're going to cheers cheers to breakfast [Music] and then the bacon yeah then we gotta hit the bacon afterwards yup we're kind of learning as we go here oh these were absolutely amazing definitely something you should shoot you're like you should shoot this it's a shot i'm glad that we did it the way that we did so of course the breakfast shop was delicious but now it's mimosa time and these are bottomless oh and the food is here wow that's the shrimp and grits and then we got the smash burgers awesome thank you no food for me but that looks amazing wow i feel like i should have gotten that but here mine is i got the chicken and donuts and look at this thing i like how they have it on this little like wood plank and just lift it up you raise me up i almost dropped it oh boy i brought it down quick yeah look at that amazing they even have like a honey sriracha sauce with the maple syrup i like it a lot i really appreciate the live music in here i think he's doing a great job and he's playing some of my favorite like music from the 90s and that's what i like i like a 90s music brunch even though i like the captain's brunch but this is fun this is really good [Music] [Music] i'm not sure how i attack this chicken and donuts maybe cut the chicken cut the donut dip it in the syrup but i do want to try the honey sriracha sauce so maybe we'll do one honey sriracha one syrup so that way we can see which one we like better [Music] so first we'll try the syrup oh i shouldn't have done that now we got syrup spelling on my shark syrup on my shark butt [Music] the chicken donut syrup combo was good but now i want to add a little bit of the honey sriracha now i think i'm going to like this a lot more because it's a little bit too sweet with the syrup because the donuts are frosted really nice but add a little spice so now we got like sweet savory and spicy all in one bite it's a win more mimosas please i like how they have it like in a crap a craft [Music] yes absolutely i think this is going to be the winning combination right here [Music] i'm going to try some of the shrimp and grits though heavily full of cheese so it's usually not my thing but i do love grits but um yeah it's worth a try so i'm gonna go i'm gonna do it she's baking in there she gave me like a good uh a good amount of bacon on top of it so it could you know kind of undertone the cheese but i love grits in general [Music] very good they are they are good yeah very good and i like the pesto in it either way i have to say all the food is amazing even the grits they both had the burgers but they're gone they were that good they were good they were so good they're gone and i'm just finishing up i got like a half a donut yet i i feel like the chicken the donut ratio isn't that great they give you two tenders and two donuts but the donuts are much bigger so you know i don't have anything else to pair up with this one but the honey sriracha is my favorite combination out of all of it and plus a little powdered sugar gotta get that they're really good with refilling the mimosas i think i've had three of them so far and they're good they're delicious delicious mimosas delicious donuts delicious chicken delicious breakfast shots good music i think it's a good brunch better company better good company yes yes this is good i'm liking the house of blues and we might as well make it four anyway we'll get him oh a fresh one a fresh craft so just along with a breakfast shot i didn't know existed i didn't also know that there was breakfast or brunch dessert and they have a a pretty amazing crunch dessert it's like a bread pudding and i'm excited to try it because i love bread pudding and this is the whiskey whiskey butter uh bread pudding look at that insane right i've never seen whiskey butter whiskey butter bread pudding before i feel like that's a tongue twister scoop see potato and you know do i have something on my chin i think i did i think i had it i think i had some icing on my chin oh boy but we're going to try the bread pudding now and you know i love ohana and you mentioned ohana's bread pudding getting all the love you know you get ohana's at canada right you can get ohanas by putting that corner out but this is better wait i got to get a little butter i got a butter scoop i got a butter scoop i got a a better butter scoop [Music] that is no joke and i can literally say it is just as good as ohana like it is actually it might be better like i really like the whiskey butter and it adds just like a a little kick to it very delicious good job how simple those good job waitress how many months does she have yeah wait a second here it's gonna be so after a wonderful brunch i think uh we're gonna head on out of here but one last cheers before we go three hours later three hours later how many mimosas do you think we had i would say more than we deserve yeah i would say maybe like six or seven right perhaps and with that i think we are done inside the house of blues it was so much fun i really really enjoyed the brunch here like it was a good mixture of just nice atmosphere the chicken and donuts were phenomenal the breakfast shop was a nice touch and the bottomless mimosas is like a key essential thing for brunch so i think we're gonna hang out and walk around disney springs a little bit beth my friend who uh they have a channel called villains advice mentioned that it was really cool that uh house of blues does brunch on saturdays and sundays where most places just do sundays so that really gives them uh an upper hand here i think and uh i would definitely come back i would definitely do this again but i'm excited to try other brunch spots around the spring as you can see it is spring break here at walt disney world or in florida in general and most of the crowds are just a little bit higher at the springs because there's no reservations to get in the parks so you can't go to the park even if you're staying on property so what else is to do but hang on at disney springs and like i said earlier now that i'm kind of on this grunge kick i've already been suggested to go to homecoming because i hear they have a fantastic brunch so i think i might go over there and just kind of check out the area i want to see if it's only open on sundays or if they do it on saturdays and uh i don't know just kind of scope out the situation a little bit it's definitely next on my list of brunch spots so yeah i just checked and homecoming does brunch on saturdays and sundays from 9 30 to 1 p.m i think we might uh try to set up a reservation for maybe next week in preparation for when i do come to homecoming for brunch i decided to get the 22 ounce jumbo squeeze bottle which is a refillable one and take a look at this so this is a sweet tea moonshine and now when i bring this back for brunch it's only going to cost me 13 to fill it up which is an amazing deal i'm happy that i decided to bring this so this actually encourages me like more to come to do the brunch and now we found a nice little spot to come and relax and drink our moonshines i got the sweet tea moonshine and this is phenomenal and i just love the springs because i love seeing the blue skies and just having good spots now normally it's not easy to find good spots to sit down because it's super crowded but we looked out right here because this is a beautiful view right outside boathouse you can see we have some of the ampy cars launching in the water right there and we're just relaxing listening to music and enjoying this wonderful disney springs view it's a perfect saturday afternoon and it looks like the live music actually started and this is really entertaining the perfect sunset is happening right at the same time a little bit of eddie maserati right there wow [Music] i love all the live performances that they have going on basically celebrating women's history month you can see the signs they say celebrate her story and she was phenomenal right i really thought i was actually an animal kingdom and it was a great performance and any maserati was jamming out here beautiful especially with the sunset and all i'm really enjoying my night here at the springs just take a look at that sunset isn't it amazing i can't get over this my friends actually went out on an ampy car ride so i'm waiting for them to come back and it looks like they're pulling into station here i've done the ampy car many times before but because of social distancing uh they don't allow as many people as they usually do so i was like you guys go for the ride because it is fun and i've done it before and i wanted them to experience it and this is the perfect time oh looks like here they come [Music] oh look at you guys well i think that's gonna do it for me tonight we've been here since brunch it's almost seven o'clock now we've been here all day long and i've just been having such a great time so i hope you enjoyed the video i enjoyed making it i'm excited to make more brunch videos in the future and we'll

Here, we will leave this here. And let's go look for Vincent. I walked up and one of my\nworst fears has come true. Vincent, the escape\nartist, has escaped. How are you, man?\n- Hey, Jackson. How are you doing? - You're Eric, I would imagine?\n- Yeah.  Good to see you.  I looked in all his\nregular hiding spots. I checked the back. And he could go all\nthrough down the street behind the bushes hiding.  So let's go over there\nand look for Vincent, huh? Cats try to escape for a\nlot of different reasons. I mean, they're hunters. They want to go out there\nand hunt their prey. Now, if they're not\nspayed or neutered, they're going to want to go out\nthere, mark their territory, and of course, reproduce.  Vincent?  Now, the last time\nI dealt with something like this was a few years ago\nwith a cat I went to visit named Kitty. But at least we found her.  Vincent? Come on, buddy, buddy.  Vincent?  No? Vincent is nowhere in sight. Now, of course, I want\nto keep looking for him, but I still also have to sit\ndown with Eric and Kaotar and learn more\nabout their issues so that when he does come\nhome, at least he stays home. OK. guys. So, clearly, I already know\nwhat the issues are here.  Yeah, he escapes every day.  Every day.  Every day.  He's coming back injured. And I'm really afraid that he's\nnot going to come back one day. - Yeah\n- You know.  Does he get into fights a lot?  Yes.  In my opinion, it's just not\nsafe for cats to be outside. So when Eric and Qatar told\nme that Vincent's been getting outside, getting into\nfights on a daily basis, man, the stakes went\nthrough the roof.  He's destroyed hardwood floors\nby peeing in the same spot hundreds of times.\n- Oh, he's--  Yeah.  So he's a pee-er.  He's a pee-er.  How old is Vincent?  He's about six years old.  When he was little, he was\na great cat, great kitten. But as he got older\nand more mature, those problems\nstarted to come out.  That's interesting.  Is he neutered?  Um, he hasn't been neutered. And  Why is he not neutered?  As a man, I guess,\nI felt really bad.  Oh God. Ah, OK. Um, his manly urges\nare what's causing him to escape every day. His manly urges is what's\ndestroying your home and causing him to pee on\neverything, not to mention that one unneutered male can\nbe responsible for up to 2,500 kittens in one year. There's a litany of\nawful things happening only because he's not neutered.  I can't imagine\nthough how neutering him is going to change\nthese problems.  They called me\nhere to help them. I'm telling them\nwhat the problem is and they're\ndismissing my advice. If I can't get through to Eric. Vincent is in big trouble.  If we can't fix\nthese problems, then we should get\nrid of Vincent.  Getting rid of him,\nto me, is not an option.  It's not?  No, it's not.\nOK.  I'm not willing\nto tolerate that. This just isn't working.  So not only do I\nhave to save this cat, looks like I got to\nsave this couple too. Clearly, I've got my\nwork cut out for me. So I don't want\nto waste any time.  Come on, let's go. I want you to get up and\nhave you show me around.  This is the room formerly\nknown as my music room. This was also Vincent's\nfavorite place to pee.  Is that because of\nhim that it's sort of--  Yeah, he has peed\nhere hundreds of times. It constantly small like\ncat pee in here now.  And that's how it's got to\nbe pretty bad to get to a point where you have\nabsolutely been evicted.  This was the tipping point.  I wanted to wring\nhis little neck.  This is-- actually,\nit's a pretty unholy mess.  And if you look over\nhere, he started over here.  Look at all the chew marks. Not only are the blinds\ncompletely destroyed, the screens are torn out. There are claw marks\ngoing up to the window. This cat is literally\nclimbing the walls to get out.  It is like his body meant\nto do one thing and one thing only, and that is to propagate.  Well, I mean, I can't\nsee how that propagation instinct would lead him to\npee on my corner though.  Let me tell you exactly how. He looks out this window, he\nsees one of the neighborhood Toms walking by. He goes, oh my God, I\nmust protect the territory and then pees off\ninto the corner. This cat is saying loudly and\nclearly, I have to get outside. This cat's not making a choice. His body is. All right, so here's the concept\nthat I'm completely lost on. All of this is because\nyou won't neuter him. All of this. Like I can't make\nit any clearer. And as a matter of fact, I got\nsomething I want you to see, just hold on one sec, OK?  OK.  For Eric and Kaotar's\nfirst piece of homework, I had something\nbrought over here that I thought would drive the\npoint home pretty poignantly. - Oh boy.\n- So--  Oh my gosh.  I've got a homework\nassignment for you. Will each of you just\nopen this box for me?  Oh my gosh, it's kittens. Oh yay. Oh my God.  Just so you know,\nmore than half of the cats that are\nkilled in our shelters are kittens like\nthese guys, over half. I needed to prove a point to\nthese guys that for every time Vincent escapes that house,\nthose kittens could be born. There is an immense\namount of cats that Vincent is\nproducing out there. So your first homework\nassignment is the biggest, tell me you're going\nto get him neutered. [MUSIC PLAYING]  Yeah.  Yeah?  I think that's the best idea. I mean, after what you told\nus about the kittens, that's-- that's terrible. And I'd hate to\nthink that I would be contributing to that problem. So--  Realize something, by\nmaking this decision, you are making a\nglobal difference. Glad we got that out of the way. Let's put these guys\nback down, let them hang with their littermates,\nand let me give you the rest of your homework, OK?  I never really considered\nthe ramifications of not having Vincent fixed. I don't want to be part\nof the problem at all.  Second thing up to bat, got\nto get your place fortified, OK? Take care of the screens. Make sure he can't\nget out of the house. And that way, he\nwon't get out again. And I won't be out\nhere chasing them all around the neighborhood. Now, there's also the\nlitterboxification of your house. You've got too much of a\ncat for one litter box. I want to see a litter\nbox in that corner where all the would\nhave been rotted away. You've got to set the\ncat up for success. You don't have to keep\nall these kittens, but you can keep them\nfrom about another hour. My friends over at\nthe Best Friends Mission Hills Adoption Center\nare going to come pick them up. [MUSIC PLAYING] All right, I'm here for my\nthird and final visit with Eric, Kaotar, and their cat, Vincent. Just after I left\nthe last time, I got an email from Eric with\nsome pretty disturbing news.  Murphy's law,\nVincent decided that he was going to pee on the bed. [SIGHS] What do you do?  Now, since then, I've\nhad some chance to take a look at their video homework. And I see some\ngood and some bad. Now, the good news is they're\nworking really hard at bringing the outside inside, helping\nto make the inside a lot more appealing to Vincent. I also got to see Eric\nworking on his new Vincent inspired song. And the bad news\nis that I'm still not seeing any litter boxes. And that coupled with\na peeing incident means that I don't know\nwhat I'm walking into today. Man, I will get\nright to the point. You tell me something. Last time I was here, I did\nask you to put another litter box back in the house again. Did you guys do that?  Yes, we did.  No doubt, Good. Where is it?\n- It's in the bedroom.  Oh my God. I'm so proud of you, man.  You actually-- that's biting\nthe bullet for you especially, Eric.  I think we should put\nit right in that corner.  Now, of course, the big\nquestion, since that incident--  Vincent decided that he\nwas going to pee on the bed.  Have you had any\nincidents out here? - Not at all.\n- Not one?  No, not one. [LAUGHS]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can't begin to tell you how\nhappy it makes me that Eric has not only added litter\nboxes around the house, but he's added one\nin the bedroom. This shows me that Eric is\nmore than willing to compromise for the good of Vincent. And in turn,\nVincent has rewarded him by not peeing in his stuff. OK, so, tell me the truth. How's Vincent's mojo doing?  Vincent's mojo is back.  Very nice, guys.  Bringing the outside in--  Yes, and the catnip and\nall the little grasses, he really loves that.  I don't think Vincent's\ntried to escape at all.  Fantastic.\nGood. There have been\ngreat things that have happened here with\nVincent and Eric in Kaotar. But I need to see\nVincent brought in to Eric's music room. I want to see Eric\nsinging Vincent that song. I will know then that\nVincent and Eric have a bond. And that Vincent is not going to\nwind up out here on the street. Ah, the familiar music room. Wonderful. Walking into the\nmusic room, I can't help but notice Vincent\nsitting in the middle of Eric's music room. And they had also provided\nhim with a cat house, which shows me that Eric\nhas opened up his arms and welcomed Vincent\ninto his hallowed space.", "1rAKwVwE-zQ": "Straight Talk to the bar oh fucking bar thanks I needed that well know much\nabout history don't know much biology don't know much about the frittata now I don't play\nto be a student while I'm trying to be for maybe by being a student baby I can\nwin your don't cost nothing sergeant at arms do your duty now on your duffle talk I name is weasel\nnow on your name is mothball Kroger your Delta Tau Chi name is Pinto by Pinto why\nnot well what's my Delta Tau Chi name Dorfman you're giving this a lot of\nthought now on your name is flounder pounder oh hey I think you know\neverybody here great Obi Li can't you know don't worry just keep your hands\nand feet away from his mouth don't you have any respect for yourself this is absolutely gross that boy is a\npea a cheap Pig see if you can guess what I am now I'm as it get it right you bastard let's\ngo right here hey what just lying around shit well\nwhat the hell is supposed to do you moron\nwars over man warmer drop the big one what over you say over nothing is over\nuntil we decide it is was it over when the Chinese bombed Pearl Harbor\nhell no Sherman forget it he's rolling over now that's when the going gets\ntough the tough get going who's with me let's go what the fuck happened to the Delta I\nused to know where's the spirit where's the guts this could be the greatest\nnight of our lives but you're gonna let it be the worst Oh\nwe're afraid to go with you Bo we might get in trouble dad was right\npsychotic but absolutely right we gotta take these bastards now could fight him\nwith conventional weapons that could take years cost millions of lives no in this case I think we have to go\nall out I think this situation absolutely requires a really futile and\nstupid gesture be done on somebody's part we're just the guys to do it let's do it nice there is this great now finish it\nflounder you kidding I never shot anything before my life I thought you\nhated niedermayer's guts I do and what about that horse is there anything in\nthe world you hate as much as that horse get just blanks right holy shit there were blanks in that gun\nI didn't even point the gun at him holy shit there were blanks in that gun maybe\nhe had a heart attack holy shit I gave my love a cherry that had no stone I\ngave my lover chicken that had no bones I gave my love the story had no I sorry", "BKo9qfZQ4hs": "[Music] okay now that we're in our thinking chair let's you will help me right great so we're trying to figure out what animal blue wants to learn about and our clues are black and white [Music] twice and so what hand will go we will learn it looks like an white sighs maybe maybe it's a black and white panel and yeah does that this is okay so what panel could you want to learn about that black and white and live on the ice and the baby sit penguins are black and white they live on the ice and they waddle like this we just figured out Blue's Clues we just figured out these bones we just figure out what you just figured out two songs cuz we're going to story", "n-Eaq3QkP7U": "[Music] yeah visit killed boy the", "YVgv1EFJZHc": "Oooh, a duck An elephant Hey, a rooster I hear a cat That's a pig A dog Listen Listen What do you hear?

"[Music] hi guys annie here from the hawaiian humane society to bring you a brief introduction on some of the careers we have available here for those of you guys who don't know the hawaiian humane society was established back in 1883 that was over a hundred years ago so we've been around a long time so i'm excited to show you guys some of the careers we have available hi guys if you've seen one of these vans driving around that means you've probably seen one of our humane investigators in 1897 the hawaiian humane society was given the authority to enforce animal cruelty laws that means that other than the honolulu police department our field services people are the only ones on the island allowed to hand out fines citations or even open investigations involving animal cruelty this is our admissions department our admissions department sees almost every animal that comes through the hawaiian humane society stars we get about 70 animals in a day some of those animals are lost animals some of those animals are surrendered to us and some come from all other types of reasons basically we accept all types of animals mannequins dogs cats birds turtles and more we're also an amnesty site which means that we accept illegal animals with no questions asked this is our veterinary services department it consists of veterinarians assistants and basically anyone who's here to help the animals on the medical side of things they perform adaptations dental work sterilizations as you can see right here and more um to become a veterinarian it does take a long time it's about eight years of schooling after high school so be aware of that if you do want to become an animal helper and work with animals in that medical field maybe consider looking into that tech school it's less time but also able to help animals with that medical side so now we're in one of our dog houses to make sure that our animals are getting the best care that we can possibly give them we need to ensure that they have clean cages and kennels we need to make sure that the animals have food water toys treats and more and most of that comes from our animal care staff and they help with all of that they are the ones who get to spend the most time with the animals anyone at the hawaiian humane society um anybody over the age of 18 can actually apply to be an animal care position so if you maybe think that college isn't the right path for you or even if college is the right path for you and you just want to spend time with animals all day consider a career in animal care adoptions is one of the things we're best known for here at the hawaiian humane society we have more than just dogs and cats go out for adoption we also have animals like rabbits guinea pigs turtles and more we even sometimes have chickens and pigs some of our jobs are more behind the scenes whether it's finance development communications or more we also offer careers for people who maybe don't want to work as hands-on with the animals but still are looking for a way to be a part of the organization hi guys i'm dr lance i'm a veterinarian here at the hawaiian humane society and i like my job because i get to mix science with helping animals hello my name is robert and i'm the behavior and enrichment manager here at the hawaiian humane society and i love my job because i get to play with dogs all day i'm harold and i work
