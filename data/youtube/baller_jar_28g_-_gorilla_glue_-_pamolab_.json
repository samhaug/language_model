today we're gonna be fixing some broken glassware specifically a French press that I bought from Goodwill and like a dummy didn't check before I bought it and wouldn't you know it this is what it is right now when I took it out of the box at home it was cracked all the way up until here and also like a dummy I tried to wash it subsequently causing this piece to go just like that so rather than returning it which I pretty sure I could do since it's broken but I'm the kind of person that likes to fix things when they're broken and not throw them away or return them that's just the way I work so before we get started I just want to say don't forget to leave a like on the video if you do end up liking it dislike it if you don't I don't care subscribe if you want to see more videos like this check out what I have posted already which isn't much and also if you want to support this channel and in any way I have affiliate links in the description one for Amazon and a bunch of other Amazon links specifically to my gear so check those out if you're interested so let's get started what we're going to be doing to fix this I'll put a link to the video above that I found on how to do this apparently you just use five-minute epoxy and you use acetone once it's fully cured to get the excess away and then voila it's just like new alright so the first okay that came off easy we gonna get the epoxy out drop it otherwise it won't work and I don't know how much we'll need or if this is even gonna come out well there goes my plans alright that's kind of where I got multiple toothpicks because I don't didn't know how many I would need I'm just gonna push that one through that should do that I have this one do the same on the other side oh that feels really hard I think this stuff might be dead well then this is going excellently well so much for that we do have some of this pc-7 stuff and we probably have some jb weld lying around but I don't think that's the same as five minute epoxy and I don't know if acetone would work to get rid of the excess so I'm not gonna use that and also to be perfectly honest I don't know if this is a good idea to be using for food glass I know you can do it for just glass in general but uh who knows so I don't recommend this but if you want to do it it's your your decision if a hammer would work is that I squish the toothpick in there somewhere and it's actually like kind of gooey on that side all right y'all ready for this oh it hurts it hurts so good oh okay some came out good it's not an even amount but uh there we go hammer saves the day now I don't know exactly how much we'll need for this now here comes the fun part we get to mix these for a good bit guy in the video I watched two minutes so it's that's faster so you don't have to sit there and wait and hold it while it sets so we'll do something like that I don't know this epoxy may not be any good it's supposed to be clear I don't know why it's all white and goopy yeah that that looks disgusting I'm not gonna use that all right so I just got back from Home Depot got some gorilla glue and some acetone which we'll be using later oh yeah look at this stuff it kind of worked but it's kind of gooey and I don't know that that would have done well so I'm glad I didn't use that it seems like every time you buy something again they have a new design like a different cap maybe it's better I don't know they're jerks they make it to where you can you can't put the cap on that's stupid why is this stuff come on there we go okay now it's even I'm not gonna use that either because it's not even so well I can't even there we go that's plenty that's actually way too much but uh it'll work so I guess do I just stick this back on it's not gonna work too well yeah so I'm gonna work at all I'll just use the old one later but right now we need to mix I don't know why I broke that I might need it okay get to mixing all right so that's been a minute at least and maybe two minutes so that's about as good as it's gonna get and you're supposed to clean things before you foxy them but this was a clean break so I would assume that it's already clean uh-huh but yeah we're gonna slather this stuff on there and hope for the best I'm gonna go real real heavy with it because I want this to stay I love me the smell of epoxy in the morning even though it's I guess technically it still is morning it's almost 12:00 no I take that back it's almost 1:00 it's not morning whatever just make sure you get the whole thing otherwise you'll miss up your never tell you miss apart okay and you I don't know I don't think you have to put epoxy on boats both surfaces you can go I think oh yeah it's about right okay now you kind of hold this pressure with pressure for a little bit until it sets don't worry again about the excess squirting out everywhere wipe that away once it's cured and I want to mention again I don't know if this is safe to do for food-related glass I'm just doing it because I'm too lazy to return this thing and I don't really feel like looking for another one so do this at your own risk unless it's something that it's not food related I don't know wait yeah that feels like a pretty pretty tight pretty good fit it feels smooth I don't feel any extra stuff it's not facing the wrong way or anything there's no glass sticking out so I'm just gonna don't know why I'm doing that but uh squeeze it together right now okay I don't know how long I need to do this I'll do it as long as it takes I guess it's supposed to set in five minutes so should only be really three minutes the cover is strong with this one the reason you want pressure is obviously you want it to be a good fit and the guy in the video made a good point that if you don't and there are cracks then when you do the acetone it's going to be able to eat through the epoxy that you want to keep like in between the cracks and you'll be starting over or something okay so I'm not gonna touch it I I'm not gonna wiggle it to make sure it's good I'm just gonna leave it I think that's fine so we'll come back in about a day and wipe it off with acetone and see how it worked okay so we've waited two days I don't I don't think I needed to wait that long but this looks pretty good it looks like it's pretty much repaired so we're gonna take some acetone open it up and bread them chug it I'm just kidding I don't know I bought this at Home Depot and it seems like it might have been open I should have realized that when I picked it up but it isn't it feels like the level is about here but I might be I'm wrong and yeah it's like hey hey maybe you have half-full so he was huffing some acetone I could be wrong I don't know yeah make sure when you get this acetone out breathe in real deep just kidding don't do that either it's probably probably bad for you too I don't know how this works but I'm just gonna do it it's basically nail polish remover in a way in a way doesn't smell as bad as I thought it would but it should be able to dissolve this stuff at least that's what the internet told me so it's got to be true yeah I did have quite a bit here so that may take a while well strong I'm getting a whiff of it now maybe we should do that oh it's not dissolving as fast as it thought it would it's supposed to dissolve I specifically bought gorilla glue because Loctite said it was solvent resistant hopefully this stuff isn't no it's kind of working it's taking a while but it's working maybe I just yeah I don't know maybe I worry about the outs the inside just sit the thing on there and let it sit I don't know I don't think there's as much on the inside it's gonna take a while a lot longer than I thought oh yeah I probably shouldn't be touching the acetone but it's kind of late for that now this isn't a tutorial by the way if you didn't know that I'm just showing you me doing this if you want to do it the way I did it you can but I'm I'm putting the link haha strong I'm putting a link to the video that I saw the set I mean this is this is what he did I pretty much she just used different epoxied but do it your own risk and I don't honestly know if this is good for food vessels I don't know I guess you'll find out if I'm dead I mean it can't be that bad obviously I'm gonna rinse it out and I'm not gonna I'm not gonna like wash it out with acetone and then put milk in it you know I wonder if paint thinner would have done the same thing that it would have not doing a whole lot that's I feel a lip in the glass I didn't I didn't do a perfect seal that's okay we're in in this perfection alright so I'm trying a lot more it's almost liquid I guess hoping that we'll get it all off cuz the damp rag doesn't seem to be doing it maybe the wet rag will of course it dries so fast that's one of its suppose it perks dries fast but I need it liquid I probably should have wiped it off better before I let it cure honestly that's probably why I'm having so much trouble scratching it actually seems to be working try that maybe try razor blades scratching just fingernails don't seem to work too good yeah that actually does work somewhat I worked you good on no I don't lip but uh it works alright so you can't tell but this is done the outside is obviously still sticky I think I want to leave that though because it might honestly be the thing that's holding it together the best I wiped down one last time with acetone and I ended up having to use a razor blade to scrape some of this record and get to it so and and it just wouldn't come off completely with fingernails so now what we'll do is rinse it out wash it and test it out well it does hold water which is it good soon okay looks fine let's rinse this thing off and try try it out okay time for the test fit see if it actually works okay yeah it seems good that'll work let's try with some milk you know good old cow two O's let what I do go of course I fixed the crack and I still spill it on the counter no the real test will be it obviously doesn't leak currently but the real test will be if it leaks when I do this but can I do this probably could have put more milk in there but that's okay and I wish this was turnable I don't want that to be there I don't want it to come out but see it's gonna take a while [Laughter] ofcourse it's coming out already it's so satisfying I think that's about all I can handle I'm gonna see how it turned out Wow that's cool that's like whipped cream but no it's it's for the frothy milk Wow see how it tastes Wow that's so weird it's like unsweetened whipped cream no I don't drink coffee but um I like the way it tastes so maybe start drinking coffee if it's got stuff like this in it I'm glad I made this and fix the thing and yeah that's good yeah that's a foaming success I would say fixed it and now we can make foamy milk so yeah thank you guys for watching don't forget to drop a like on the video if

here's the latest on my broken ankle doc says I'll be alright only I have to stay off my feet for a week or so anyway here's the ticket for the high teen carnival it's too late to turn it in so you have yourself a time and tell me all about it one couple that means a date not like just going around with the crowd just me and the girl well that's all right only what girl who how do you choose a date whose company would you enjoy well one thing you can consider is looks woody thought of Janice and how good-looking she was he'd really have to rate to date somebody like her yes he'd enjoy that except well it's too bad Janet's always act so superior and bored she'd make a fellow feel awkward and inferior well perhaps someone who doesn't feel superior there's Betty and yet it just doesn't seem as if she'd be much fun what about Ann she knows how to have a good time and how to make the fellow with her relax have fun too yes that's what the boy likes he wants to know he's appreciated and would be fun on a date so would he decided he'd asked Ann for this first date but just how should he ask her and what if she refused no it won't be easy asking for that first date edit this private no stick around with your life well hello Edward I thought I heard you come in hi mom what's for supper Oh mom is it all right with you if I have a date Saturday night well of course you generally go out on Saturdays hello may I speak to Mary please but mom this is different I think I well I haven't asked her yet but I'd like to take aunt Venus to the high tea carnival oh and a nice girl but a date well you're rather young Oh mom give him a break I think he can swing it you all have to start sometime well if you don't overdo I'm dating Edie knows what I mean weekends only and not too late hey mom I just go up to check on the right I think I can get by a little earlier than usual house 7:30 all right Mary I know boy you sure make it sound easy how do you do it practice my boy experience but I don't think I don't know what to say what to talk about don't worry about that just be your natural talkative old self come on let's see what's for supper waiting Oh mom into the floor dryer yeah yeah hello mrs. Davis this is woody I mean Alan Woodruff may I sleep there and how do you ask for a date what about this in well how about a deep well hmm well suppose he did it this way I am what's he doing Saturday night well I guess I'm busy oh yeah and they get to giving him the brush-off for me well is there another way and this is woody well I have a ticket for the high teen carnival Saturday and well would you like to go why yes woody I've had to talk to my first about it but I think I can go that would be fun yeah well shall I pick you up about 8 o'clock that's fine woody 8 o'clock Saturday I think it'll be all right but I'll let you know for sure bye [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hi hi Judy setting a do one why aren't you do you crystal little sister we're getting ready for my date tonight with woody oh he's nice a date huh what'll you do go to some fancy place for dinner no silly we're going to the hygiene carnival and then he'll bring me home oh that doesn't sound like much I read have fun at the carnival you and I wouldn't we oh yeah well what do you know you're gonna have fun you just that way I think the important thing about a date to have a good time then you don't need to spend a lot of money to do that just enjoy whatever you're doing whether it's movies or parties or anything and you leave your boyfriend enough money so I'll ask you again my you'll be out late particularly late mom and dad not have an agreement about what time to come in no um leave me your honey and get my stockings from the bathroom that's it son look here best your first date is mighty important yeah they had were you excited the night of your first date I sure was so I took my date seriously a date was a major event why the night of my first date my date had a flat tire and he was and he didn't even bother to call me well when he finally came I had to run upstairs and do my face and my hair all over again oh I was so upset that fella had a lot to learn about girls your mother lost all interest in him after she met me and the moral of that story is that I should be on time tonight right you bet and the same goes for in any girl can't be ready on time for a date isn't good enough for my boy are you doing find a mirror so you can see yourself yeah flowers Ann won't expect flowers will she huh oh I hardly think so I'm taking these to Mary because it's a special occasion of course if you want to take flowers anyway I guess there's no law against it but but I don't want to unless it's a risky affair that's the general idea flowers for a farm or a very special party otherwise you don't need to stay I'll have to run me to see you later I'm going folks [Music] but when you're having so much fun time goes all too fast well it's the time and it set for getting home and now good night the end of a perfect evening but how do you say good night perhaps what am or it could go this way well so long just like that after all a girl likes to know you've had a good time so let's try saying goodnight again one more way well it's getting late yes I'd ask you in for my feet if it were still night let's plan to get home in time for a standard response the next time say that sounds good I'll call you next week will you well thanks so much I hadn't known to fun oh did I good night movie night Anne [Music]"}
