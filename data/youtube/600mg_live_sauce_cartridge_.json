{"7jTt35Eu8cE": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another Ursa cartridge you know I'm very very happy although I did spend a little bit more than expected because I went to fee knows and it's not authentic and authentic when they had it it was $40 but at vinos it's 55 but I really wanted a cartridge so I was like [ __ ] it I'll pay $15 extra and you see if I'm not lying right here I mean the tax is killing me it was the one it's $41 without the tax but then it was like 54 with it so yeah definitely one of the the pricier cartridges I'm actually at a park right now I'm actually gonna hit a few in the car just because you know it's easier that way and then I'm gonna walk around and hit the cartridge - just to prove that I'm in a [ __ ] park okay guys [ __ ] Park [ __ ] park brother so let's just open this thing like I mean you guys already know the deal bros like I've opened this not this one but okay okay [Music] I didn't want to [ __ ] pull out the cap you know accidentally Laureus yes dope or battery I do have my dad's mate and do not have the magnetic piece on it so I'm just gonna use the side where it's cruising cheers boys who that wasn't even a blinker right this is a blueberry muffin in oh my god that show taste a pretty [ __ ] [Music] god damn holy moly cracker mode damn [Music] this is probably the the smoothest cartridge I've hit in a while if not the best or the smoothest the taste is there everything is there like I liked when I tried the first person car it was from the homie Chiron and he had ice cream cake which is a strain I didn't really enjoy as much this one has a sweeter taste of more blueberry taste obviously it's blueberry muffins and it's actually quite pleasant what [ __ ] it was just like [ __ ] the stats let's just read this [ __ ] right here so we got THC we're coming in at seventy two point one two percent it was packaged and manufactured on the channel on January 30th 2020 Best Buy same date but 2021 one gram all that good stuff not gonna lie it [ __ ] this [ __ ] hits so what I am going to do now pocket this water you can see right here guys very nice Park it's very nice outside I was actually getting pretty [ __ ] hot in that car I'm not gonna lie I want to go over there and smoke you see that boys that little stairway [ __ ] let's go there no one there and we can take some hits on the way to boys that's the thing about cartridges you could bring that [ __ ] anywhere and take a fat hit and especially with a cart like this that hits like a [ __ ] dab rig like it's a game-changer it really is you know like I honestly can't stress that enough you know cartridges are getting better just like technology with the mores I believe it's Moore's law where technology gets better every six months and technology is in everything when it comes to vapes computer it's anything you know I'm saying like the hits aren't that fat right now what you just take off let me see if I can take you about that the camera turned off let me see if I can take a little a little fatter hit damn well yeah I wanted to do I wanted to get my own orsa you know after Chiron showed me his I was just like damn there's just no way I cannot just try this muhfuckas and not buy my own it did take some a long time I would say about a month or something but it's only because Ursa hasn't been that much available in my area and it's probably something I won't buy that much often you know because $55 for a gram cartridge I know it's a it's average in LA but in Modesto that's not average that's a above average so you know I do enjoy it though I really really do enjoy it very very tasty you get the whole terpene profile of the of the strain which is good you know I wanna take one more hit for you guys I'm probably gonna call it a video hopefully you guys enjoyed it you and also in the car you could actually see the smoke thickened out here it's very spread out it's not a really good visual representation of actually how much I'm hitting but these are fat hits don't get me wrong but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I really enjoyed hitting this to be honest and making this video it's a nice [ __ ] day outside and hopefully you're having a good day so far peace out expecting company but that's ok cos don't try to prove", "eC4XsUNW2_I": "[Music] what's up everybody welcome back to a TC spot Here I am bringing you a half gram cartridge Himalaya life resin sauce cart yeah you heard it tonight resin sauce car gelato 33

fillers we're gonna go in and slap it on the on this new friendly farms battery low temp to make sure we are tasting the full flavor of the terpene so you know here it is packaging is dope right off the back the Millea mission statement we started with single strand cannabis frozen fresh at the farm and carefully refine it to craft terpene rich full spectrum cannabis sauce look what the packaging is like so there's that little half gram it says cutter Mayberry that's understandable because my rink is out of service so I've been taking dad's we're named after the highest place on earth for a reason crafted with all the good stuff oh hi majesty see our full spectrum extracts higher than what we got it open well that's amazing that is amazing I've seen other life resin sauce parts they

or so let's check this out that was the first hand I'm where's the first hit I do have it at a very low temporary pasty that's for sure that's facts very tasty very very tasty it has a very pleasant gelato flavor doesn't seems like candy I love that the fact that it doesn't taste all artificial instead you know [ __ ] that [Music] so yeah this cart definitely tastes like some sauce I feel like if I'm hitting a puff coal or a rig on very low temp settings I can taste the gelato very good flavor no breath inhale very smooth I'm not sure what I caught I think that was just mean but very tasty pretty pretty pretty good head high pretty click that change sorry yep I can see the cloud because of the way the cameras position I'm getting some crazy clouds imma turn it up to the highest setting and we're gonna wrap it up real soon right it's getting up in here all crazy oh that's all bad there we go I said he was definitely stronger on that higher setting tastes like straight sauce I like it live resin solace cars check them out in Malaya good head high this is a hybrid gelato 33 doesn't taste like frickin candy straight taste like flour oh yeah for sure job can't see the cloud I like the fact that tastes like I'm Annie no [ __ ] bad so it's getting pretty hot I'm gonna get up out of here yo this is just embarrassing reading over here starting his [ __ ] sweat I just wanted to give you guys a quick little review on the Himalaya get yourself up there high in the mountains all right that's core beats to see spot thank you for watching peace", "dQO7oqdzNfA": "but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge what is going on you guys my name is Jeff also known as popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe I got a lot of lip videos on the way like today I'm gonna be showing you when I picked up from silver stem cannabis in my last video if you missed that video I got to tour their entire dispensary bring you guys with me show you what it's actually like inside of there it's [ __ ] sick make sure you check out that video a link to it will be in the description but right now I'm going to show you guys what I actually bought and what it looks like because there's some fire ass products there when you buy weed legally it comes with a receipt I spent two hundred and seventy seven dollars it would have been two twenty before tax but there's some hefty taxes in Colorado but it's worth it because hey I can [ __ ] buy the [ __ ] in the store I don't need to have a plug I don't need to fly with my own it's nice just being able to go into a store and pick out some [ __ ] and even with the tax it's so much cheaper than it is in Pennsylvania like you don't pay taxes when you buy weed in Pennsylvania but the growers and the processors and the stores are definitely paying a lot in taxes and that goes down to you so you might not pay a tax but you're being taxed alright let's start with these I picked up these little tablets just cuz I've never seen these before they're called pressies they have desired effects on them like sleep energy focus they only have like five or ten milligrams of THC in them so they're not very potent but they come with some other stuff that are supposed to actually help increase the desired effects that are labeled on the package I try out the focus ones just see what it's like it's literally like a little tablet and says a little THC mark on it's pretty cool I know if you're supposed to chew it or pop it I'm really glad I read that it says right on the bottom swallow don't you alright guys I'll see if that 10 miligrams does anything to me but I'm gonna be smoking a lot on top of it so I probably won't even really feel it you know I get high as [ __ ] all day and I get distracted so much stuff this could actually like help me focus real a little like that'd be kind of cool now let's get to the live rosin you guys picked up some olio I picked up the strain tropic sunset its a mix between slur Akane number 4 and papaya punch number 3 I didn't even smell it honestly like the name just sold me if you watched the video yesterday though you saw him open up a package of oleo they have such beautiful packaging man it's really [ __ ] cool they definitely take the extra step to make sure there's a great presentation with the product and the products really good so you really can't go wrong with them and just like the homie said it comes a little dab tool I didn't let it sit flat last night so you can see a little bit dripped onto the side but that's not the end of the world oh my god you guys this [ __ ] looks so good I was sure you're gonna close up for this if you guys can see that like it's just a beautiful yellow has a very nice consistency to it it's like a liquidy sugar and that's what's so cool about rosin man there's so many different consistencies that it ends up being just loaded up the puff coke peak I hope you guys are smoking with me let me know in the comments what you guys are smoking on every go you guys man I just like flew away and went to heaven that tastes so good [Music] my god you guys even when I look on this you guys truly [ __ ] beautiful job if you guys are ever in Colorado pick up some holy Arase Jim I really like this dispensary you guys they have some top-shelf concentrates there flowers amazing that's what I'm about to show you next but just like with over 300 dispensaries in Denver it's hard to find like all the good ones so as soon as you find one that has like great prices and great products like I just wanted to keep going to it damn I picked up two strains I picked up at indica and sativa flower this is the mimosa this is one of my favorite sativa strains I love smoking joints in mimosa if you've had mimosa before you already know but if you haven't you got to try it man it's some great [ __ ] weed and this is a shame that the budtender sold Deon he was very helpful this [ __ ] like I usually don't for whatever reason strains that have the word silver in it I don't like I don't even not like them I just like tend to just like not look at it because I'm like in my head I'm like gold is the best of silver my aunt but this is called silver OG and like I don't know if we get much better than this like it is a heavy indica it is like that deep green with like bright white trichome still so it looks like it has like snow on it this little it looks like the Tegrity farms Christmas snow weed and like if that was true that would be very concerning I don't know how good the shots do it for the weed but oh my god you guys it is a fire I honestly think I'm gonna go back to silver stuff before I go home and get some more flour because they had some great strains out there I just started with one indica and one sativa preheating the peak right now cheers you guys that was a nice reheat what I really like about the earrings is you can put a decent amount of wax in there and like if you take a big dab it's not all wasted like you can just reheat it and keep smoking it but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge I paid too much money for this but I had to do it I said I wanted to try some cool cartridges while I was out here and I mean it happened this is from olio I don't want to skip over how great their packaging is they do such a good job on it that I feel like it deserves a little second I love you can kind of tell it has a little bit more of a foggy hue to it than a normal cartridge it's really cool how it says the strain on it too because sometimes you forget what strain you're smoking or if you have a lot of cartridges you can get them confused again using my cloud products rio+ different color but I just love these batteries they're one of my favorites cheers you guys wow that is one of the best AC cartridges I've ever had it's papaya punch that's gonna taste [ __ ] awesome but if being rosin versus actual distillate holy [ __ ] and like I can feel it like I'm getting really high off this like I can feel it on the face in the eyes this is not your normal cartridge this is crazy holy [ __ ] this is like one hit and you're high and it literally tastes like a rosin dab this isn't saying you guys the future man they can work on the price a little bit it would be way more feasible but what a great experience like I'm [ __ ] ripped I am so happy I got this this is the last thing we got through the liquid live resin cartridge I picked it off the name and the package honestly the [ __ ] is really cool and having a garlicy cartridge I've never had that before and it sounds pretty interesting chum the company Green Dot it's a [ __ ] [ __ ] to open here's the inside packaging cartridge is sitting on the side to push right through here to get the cartridge out then it gives you the stats on the back just peel here and don't use this if you're pregnant okay that this cartridge has a little adjustable air flow filter I don't really like these what it does is give you either more or less airflow I'd rather you just like tell me what's good and stick to it I'm gonna try minimal air flow and see how that goes Devlin gives you a hard hat doesn't Asus goes the rosin cart but still a good tasting cartridge well it's actually like kind of bad to the place garlicky it's not like sweet like that's why I prefer but it's like a very dank weed eat aced it's very heavy on the garlic I'll tell you that it's not even really a GMO taste it's definitely just more straight garlic it's a garlic explosion definitely prefer the rosin cart over this I'm going back to the rosin cart I need something with a better taste [Music] much better I think that's what we're gonna wrap the video you guys super pumped to try this for the first time way too expensive but definitely a cool experience that is so amazing this is probably the coolest thing I picked up in my opinion click like if you enjoyed the video let me know what you thought the coolest thing I got was subscribe for more videos I appreciate you watching my name is Jeff beaks", "kqigW35mDl0": "yo what up youtube welcome back smoking with small town you know the rules kids bounce on up out of here and if you're new to the channel click that [ __ ] down below and subscribe today i got a cartridge review it's coming to you by sauced this is a live resin sauce cartridge the strain is skywalker the skywalker og but before we get into this let's do a nose dab i've heard people talking about it i haven't done one so we'll do a nose dab shoddy make it special i do got a load already loaded up of some cali kosher it is some dosey does frosting and if you guys want to see the review to that i've already shot it i just got to edit it and put it up it will be out in a few days so stay tuned for that okay let's get this ready cheers everybody get this shoddy oh [ __ ] cut the whole hella big oh well i'll make it work i'll make it work all right i'm going to take the nose dab out of the carta nebula edition the dosey does frosting by kelly kosher a nose dab into a shoddy here we go nervous never done one before all right not too bad clean that out later okay i thought that was going to be more difficult but it wasn't too bad okay so we got the sauced the skywalker the skywalker og by saust this is a hybrid it is coming to you at a 87 percent on the thc and a .2 on the cbd this is gonna run you forty dollars for the cart this is only a half gram forty bucks it is a all ceramic cart i have took a hit or two off of it because i wanted to see how it was it does have the seals on them i got a brand new battery let's get it on here and i did get this at manzanita in merced california it's a dispensary manzanita like the manzanita tree nose dab okay let's get into this cart cheers everybody the all ceramic carts are the way to go if you guys haven't ever had one before i highly recommend trying one out this is the skywalker og by sauced oh that tastes so [ __ ] good it's really clean tasting it tastes uh i don't think there's any added terps or anything it tastes just like the weed should taste it's really smooth it doesn't [ __ ] your throat up and it packs a hell of a punch i'm not gonna lie when you just after you take the first hit you're like oh [ __ ] this [ __ ] is solid i know that ursa does the all ceramic cars in 710 labs there's a few others that do the all ceramic if you can find the all ceramic do it because those metal ones you know the plastic tips they're just not as good seriously yeah this is that full spectrum so i really like the packaging it's kind of neat i was disappointed that it's only half a gram because i really like to get a full gram cart but i'm starting to go for quality now and this is some quality [ __ ] take another hit or two before i give you guys my review oh i stopped by a save mart yesterday and i got a couple craft beers i will be doing reviews of those shortly too i'm not gonna show them to you today but uh i picked up a cool ass magazine lebron james [ __ ] lakers it's a like a special edition magazine i thought i'd pick it up since i'm a [ __ ] super fan all right cheers hope you guys are having a great day out there smoking on something good not no [ __ ] like that last cartridge i [ __ ] reviewed that select that [ __ ] was boo boo it's really good tastes amazing it's so smooth and it does pack a punch that's exactly what i want in a cartridge gets me loaded great flavor and uh very smooth so okay we can calculate this up we'll make this a short one because i already know what i'm going to give this so price 40 bucks for a half a gram that is expensive but it's uh it's really [ __ ] good so it's expensive but it's [ __ ] good the the look of these carts are great this the sauce in it looks really [ __ ] good and they're the all ceramic carts they're they're [ __ ] they're very pretty so uh the great look the you don't get a smell of course the the smoothness is there it's hella smooth it doesn't fluff your throat up at all the flavor is amazing and the high is definitely [ __ ] there i really like the sauce carts this is the very first time that i'm trying them and the skywalker og is a hit i really [ __ ] like it so overall for the skywalker og by sauced i'm giving this cart an 8.2 you know what i mean it's a i don't really give cartridges like crazy high reviews and [ __ ] because it's not like weed or uh dabs to me it's you know so i'm giving it the 8.2 it's really [ __ ] good the only reason i wouldn't give it higher is because it's only a half a gram and they are pretty expensive but you get what you pay for it's definitely some quality product and i highly recommend it if you guys haven't tried it try it out you can get these at manzanita in merced california you could probably get them in a lot of other places sauced given at the 8.2 that was my review i hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town [Music] so you", "7KDXXoIL28Y": "[Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff Austin is popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over

was telling these are pretty far and we're gonna go ahead and see I'm gonna I'm gonna let you guys know I love rock garden and [ __ ] but I'm gonna see if these are better than raw garden so you know I've never had a liquid diamond sauce car which it says there is pretty dope you know so if you guys ever see these be on the lookout so as a little button there and you got impress it and you gotta twist it off slow sticker pull out I don't break the damn thing oh [ __ ] Wow looks pretty dope guys so we're glad mom how do you do this do you just pop it up just pop it out and bam down this is a pre feels pretty good no nice and heavy the oil looks pretty decent you know it looks kind of different from what other cartridges would look like gots nice little day in there but you get a full ground because I I was reading their information on Instagram as well you know if there's a big day is because the Okoye in there has a nice big koala as you guys can see you know it's a pretty nice big coil in there so it's what it does is the coil sucks up some of the oil in there so that's what put some damp but you guys took it you're full ground you know I'm saying yeah I ain't getting ripped off or nothing like that so like I said these this is probably like the second Ursula review on YouTube guys there's gonna be you know these cartridges just hit the market so I don't know how long they've been out but I heard they taste like exactly like [ __ ] like if you're taking adapt hey you know what I mean like straight really it's it's is it I'm think no distillate so I'm gonna flip it over hold it for a little bit this is a distillate free cartridge guys it's just gonna be fire as [ __ ] it was like 55 bucks you know out here 55 bucks for cartridges it's kind of expensive you know and with tax on top of that so we're to be him I'm going to try hit those imma see if I have some flavors but I'm sorry you do get a little clean taste like a live resin like what's it called like a raw garden would taste like so you don't really get like in a specific flavor to it now I want to let you guys know um I just hit that criteria for for YouTube to be for my channel to be monetized so I'm not really really excited you know I'm really hoping you know the channel pays off that we can help the channel grow buy more products and [ __ ] like that so you know for you guys and as if it wasn't for you guys I would never got my channel monetize you know it's [ __ ] crazy so if you guys ever see ads on the videos don't [ __ ] skip them guys watch those ads watch them all please it really helped me a lot in the channel but thank you guys you know you guys are awesome so we're just gonna go numb we're going to hit this and I'm let you guys know if it's really worth it or not you know what I mean but cheers guys if you guys are smoking out with me go ahead and do so take a little hit just to get some flavors I could taste it oh wow the flavors guys I would describe it is if you guys took a literally a [ __ ] DAP it oh wow that's crazy so it literally tastes like some real real wax guys they don't taste like a cartridge you know this thing is amazing the flavor I would describe it like if you would take like a literally a dab of the raw garden taste like waxy clean taste to it it's [ __ ] bomb but you don't really get like an ice cream it's an ice cream cake strain so you don't really get the ice cream cake in it but you do really get this like I could cushy like a clean taste cushy taste it is so good it tastes so clean I'm gonna go ahead and hit this again I might hit it a little longer and try and kill myself at awaken Bay but cheers guys hope you guys are smiling on with me mo oh wow most definitely I will be getting some more of these this one's only flavored they had it was a ice cream cake I'm not heard they had like a banana oh gee they have a lemon tree but I'm I shot the only Hodgins ice cream cake but if you guys ever see this ice cream cake you guys got a copy I'm not [ __ ] around with you I'm over-exaggerating it sings fire I'm not playing it tastes exactly like [ __ ] dab it tastes so like that's so real like it's crazy I'm sure you guys the packaging again so you guys can see you know it's distillate free or 100% cannabis which is pretty dope you know the thing these are game changers right here you know liquid diamond sauce cards these are actually liquid diamond sauce cars not no [ __ ] and the cartridge itself you know they got to it's really cool they got the nice new ceramic tip on there everything's ceramic on the cartridge I'm pretty sure cuz it looks pretty dope guys so if you guys if you guys want to go on Instagram and look up Ursa to get some more information or you know just to check the cartridges out for you guys itself and I also seen some cartridges that had like some fuzziness and they're like they actually know like I had some actual accidents so it just depends on the cartridge you guys

15 minutes without hitting it it was so addicting I brought it with me everywhere I went Seema Herman never expected that what she thought was a harmless habit vaping would end up nearly killing her I took two days for my lungs to fail and I almost died the 18 year old going viral with this photo from her hospital best a tube still pumping oxygen to her failing lungs in her hands a call-to-action asked for like a pen and paper because that was the only way I could communicate and I wrote I want to start a no vaping campaign that was the first thing I did when I opened my eyes Seema's story is just the latest in a landslide of incidents linked to vaping sparking what many officials are calling a national health crisis what we've seen in the course of the past let's say month is an increased number of people coming in with respiratory problems as a result of vaping so far the Centers for Disease Control report more than 450 possible cases in 33 states of lung illness associated with vaping and six deaths have been confirmed in California Illinois Indiana Minnesota Oregon and now Kansas last Friday the CDC issued a stark warning if you are vaping no matter how old you are you should consider stopping like I didn't think of myself as a smoker the vaping just makes it seem like it's nothing like you're doing nothing wrong Seema was in high school when she started vaping nicotine I was 16 the first time 15 and even the first time I bought it at the smoke shop I went in and I was like can I get a pack of jewel pods and they were like how old are you and I said 22 and they were just like okay it ended up becoming my oxygen I couldn't live without it I needed it all the time every day but because all of my friends were doing it all the time and no one else had symptoms that I had I couldn't like I wouldn't even have imagined that maybe this is killing me sima was an active healthy teen she'd been dancing for years even making dance team her freshman year of college but as her vaping habit increased adding in cannabis her ability to dance disappeared she was vaping a cartridge a day that's like smoking the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes in one day her parents had no idea their daughter had become hopelessly addicted this healthy dancer dancing 12 hours a week stopped dancing because of it stop living because of it stop going to school in college because of it Sima says she was feeling sick all the time over a year I lost like 50 pounds without trying 50 pounds yeah by this summer Seema had stopped going to her college classes she says her health issues were getting worse but no doctor could nail down what was wrong did you not tell the doctors that you've ached I actually did I made sure that every hospital every ER every doctor's office I went to I told them that I smoked but you never thought I can't breathe I feel like I'm gonna die maybe it's because I'm vaping every 10 to 15 minutes no doctor ever said like maybe you should stop vaping it all came to a head on August 15th when Seamas dad rushed her to the ER I said go fast don't let me close my eyes don't let me fall asleep or I won't wake up now why did you say that because I knew I was dying you felt death on you yeah it was terrifying the worst part was I couldn't I couldn't let it like my parents watch it happen to me but hospital staff couldn't figure out why Seema couldn't breathe two days later doctors had to put her on a ventilator I was begging them found her faster event her faster she's going to die it was terrifying it was in that agonizing moment that Seamas cousin revealed her secret addiction she said you know she smokes every day what what are you talking about you said she smokes every day she smokes that beep I said you tell the doctors right now you go tell the doctors right now and I ransacked her room and I found all the vapes it looked like gum wrappers they look like little candy wrappers they look like little cute a mascara wands this progression is so fast dr. Catherine Melamed is a pulmonologist at UCLA Medical Center she worked on Seema's case this was Seema's chest x-ray when she came into our Hospital these hazy white areas here at the base at the bottom of her lungs just show that she could have a pneumonia but what you can then see is if we choose an x-ray from just less than 48 hours later now her lungs all of this white haziness here is inflammation from just day 1 to day 3 is remarkable dr. melamed is on the front lines of what health officials fear is an emerging crisis the National Youth tobacco survey found a 78 percent jump in East cigarette usage among high school students alone but any research on the impacts of vaping lags far behind part of vaping is heating oil and then inhaling that oil and that's not something the lung is used to inhaling and so with that comes an inflammatory reaction that then produces phlegm and sputum and gives the lungs sort of that wet cough when property that sounds terrible and dangerous yes last month 17 year-old Tristan zou fell described how he spent 18 days in the hospital fighting for his life after vaping I woke up just throwing up everywhere how it was just pounding on my chest going 100 miles an hour Tristan lost 15 pounds and said he had to relearn to walk and just yesterday a Texas teen had to be rushed to the hospital after vaping at school passed out and you and I wake up like he was not waking up in Wisconsin today a man was arrested for making thousands of illegal THC vaping cartridges the state of New York is taking an aggressive approach in an attempt to find answers and crack down on black-market products you shouldn't be vaping products that clearly you don't know what you're you're smoking or vaping many vaping products are popular with young adults and teenagers but no company has taken more heat than Jul the industry leader the company says it's designed to get adult smokers off cigarettes but just this week the FDA sent a warning letter to Jewell accusing it of illegally marketing its nicotine bait products as safer than traditional cigarettes without proof Jewell responded we share these concerns about youth vaping it adds it shut down its Facebook and Instagram accounts and recently began deploying new technology to verify IDs this yeah.but Seema's mom blames the whole industry for trying to hook kids early the fact that they market this crap to children and they turned into pink pretty purple packaging candy pisses me off there's a lot we don't know about the both short-term and long-term consequences of vaping and so I would just say don't and the week since Seema has worked to rehab her lungs she still feels that pull to pick up the vape now I don't necessarily crave the nicotine I don't necessarily crave the weed it's just craving like the act of smoking so that's been my hardest thing of like staying away from it but she hopes that going public with her story can keep her and countless others like her alive what would you tell somebody who's under 18 who's thinking about vaping and says I'm just gonna try it one time to see what it's like I would show them my pictures and say I tried it once too and then I tried it another time and then another time it's just remembering that you don't need it like it's gonna kill you for nightline I'm Adrienne banker in Los Angeles hi everyone George Stephanopoulos

cartridge operation busted in Kenosha County investigators say they saved about a half a million and a half dollars of illegal drugs our Hanna Jewell is live with what's been found so far and how this all started with somebody's worried parents yes is this one of the largest drug operations you've had in Kenosha I don't think it was but of this type it's the largest we've ever had and as far as I know it's probably one of the largest in the country Kenosha County Sheriff David beth says the THC vape cartridge operation was being run out of a house and paddock Lake and a condo in Bristol Beth says they seized THC products with a street value of 1.5 million dollars focus was on making money sheriff Beth says two brothers 20 year old Tyler Huff Heinz and 23 year old Jacob hoppings are both facing multiple charges for illegal drug violations that's just the tip of the iceberg in this operation search warrant served at the residences last week led investigators to find more than 31,000 illegal THC vape cartridges almost 100 thousand unfilled cartridges and dozens of mason jars filled with THC oil imported from California they would take a syringe and they inject it into the cartridges the sheriff says they also found guns marijuana buds cocaine pills and $60,000 cash investigators say they may never have uncovered the covert business if it weren't for a couple of parents in Waukesha who tipped them off to a THC cartridge they found with their son I asked all parents out there this is a perfect opportunity and a friendly reminder to have that conversation with your kids six deaths have been blamed on vaping nationwide many more injuries federal investigators are stepping in here now to see if any of those cases are linked to this case here reporting live in Kenosha Hanna Jewell Fox 6 News", "akodC6YYXTM": "[Music] what's up everybody p2ps here and you know we're back with another car comp episode this time we're taking a look at the himalaya vanilla sherbet live resin cartridge and we're stacking that up against the you know classics raw garden this time triangle cake strength i'm kind of really impressed with the himalaya packaging i like the fact that the cart doesn't come in a tube i feel like that's a lot less waste and uh i think that's pretty cool that they donate their some of their proceeds to himalayan wildlife and all that stuff right there you know these cars in there are pretty cool stuff too really cool stuff i i've never bought himalaya before so i'm definitely gonna go uh check out another one soon so yeah you know here is the raw garden stuff very standard very standard and uh yeah now we're gonna jump into uh the homie taking a little taste of his first raw garden this triangle cake it tastes good the hair was a lot better than i expected i like this one it's pretty sweet mommy freddy says a bunch of more uh intelligent stuff but i didn't really tell him i was gonna use the audio so that's my bad brother now we got some hits out of the hamilton ps1 yeah that is a delicious combo you're right bro like the raw gardens heavy is balanced by that like lightness from the himalayas flavor that's hella nice yeah if you guys ever get a hamilton ps1 triangle cake and vanilla sherbet is the move man we geniuses for this thing [Music] and welcome back so uh this is once again guys cartoon comps episode three we did a quick uh impromptu like on the spot uh first thoughts on these cards but uh yeah i'm going to jump into my uh more well-developed kind of thoughts so we'll start off with the himalayan vanilla sherbert cart um so the first thing i could say off the bat with this thing is its flavor isn't as deep as the raw gardens it kind of just lightly coats your tongue kind of thing and uh it leaves like a really kind of like airy well not airy maybe kind of like a fluffy sort of like uh profile in there so let me take a hit real quick and give another quick rundown of the flavors so it's actually kind of nice that you do kind of get like this vanilla bean ish kind of flavor uh coming off of the very initial taste of the very initial hit of this in the first initial taste like that's that's very rare that like a strain kind of actually tastes exactly like how you think it's it's going to taste when you you know read the name um but yeah there's not too many terps compared to lily to uh well i wouldn't say two not as many terps but the tit doesn't taste as terpy compared to raw garden ones um yeah this this is very light very kind of smooth uh live resting cartridge and you know that that's kind of surprising for me it normally tastes like a deeper flavor and it's it's nice that this is a different experience so far compared to the other live resin cartridges i've tried of course chronic creek nug which i haven't done a review yet on and hush which is coming soon and you know obviously ragon so now that we've tried our vanilla sherbet himalaya we'll do another quick thoughts on our rogar and triangle cake so yeah you guys know ragaron always has like some good stuff and always has like a very familiar turkey taste about in your first kind of hit so uh we'll see what triangle cake got a little different for us cheers oh hmm yeah this so this has a little bit more of a doughy kind of uh flavor there of course triangle cake but there's also citrus tones to it too this is very very unique kind of taste uh i wouldn't say it's a citrus cookie that sounds really weird but it's it's really nice like a sweet sweet citrusy kind of doughy flavoring obviously the same turkey hits you get from rawgarn this one doesn't feel as deep though as the space box number two for example like the the first hit here is definitely more of the doughiness and then there comes that citrusy after but yeah pleasantly surprised with the himalaya brand uh live resin cartridges i mean it's a little more expensive than the rawgarden one so i was hoping it'd be a lot better and um yeah i think at this point in time at least compared to triangle cake i'm liking this vanilla sherbet a lot better obviously it doesn't really look like that it looks like i'm enjoying the triangle cake a little bit more but i definitely like this vanilla sherbet a lot and now we get to a newer section on our car clumps uh courtesy of this hamilton ps1 trying out the cartridges with water filters um a lot of people you know out there they're just consuming either oil pen stuff or cartridge stuff you know just by itself uh but this hamilton ps1 absolute game changer i'm a big fan of water filters and the smooth hits that they can provide and it also helps you give a lot more or get a lot more flavor out of it so right now we got the vanilla sugar in and we're gonna take another hit cheers oh there it is wow there's actually the deep turkey flavor that uh i was talking about earlier with raw gardens it's kind of there with the himalayan not as deep but there is that trippy flavor now it's kind of crazy how much the water filter changes up so uh now let's see what kind of difference it makes with our raw garden i'm just gonna switch the cuts right here right here's just the plug since i'm only hitting one at a time they recommend that you keep the plug-in uh just just only if you're doing like solo hits with a one cartridge i think it kind of preserves the uh the thread there the connector connector yeah so this is once again the triangle cake and uh yeah cheers boys oh hold on i think my rocker is a little clogged there oh it's not okay all right let me get a proper hit for you guys you know this one tastes a little bit the same as a hit without the water filter just it's much smoother obviously i got a way bigger hit there and um excuse me i guess another thing i could say is the pininess is a little bit more noticeable when you get to the water filter so there's i was gonna say that there was an aftertaste of uh pininess to uh the triangle cake but uh i wasn't sure if i was tripping or not but yeah this this confirms that there is that so that's pretty nice as always guys if you enjoyed the video please leave a like leave a comment drop a little sub too maybe you know you want to see a little something more and if you guys want me to review anything specific you know any products you guys are kind of curious about or something that you like and you just

giveaway so yeah peace you out peace", "f-zCVt_jgh0": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at a new to us vape company and that is ocean cannabis co with their live resin uh today we are going to be reviewing their straw nana strain uh this is the one gram variety rocking 84 thc and 90 and a quarter percent uh total cannabinoids in there uh you usually see that big discrepancy in thc and tac uh when it is live resin because it has all those other cannabinoids that are usually lost in the process uh theoretically should be in here um so being a live resin cartridge uh it was on the more expensive end but cheaper uh than most live resin i've seen uh this one gram cartridge cost me i believe 63 dollars with tax in long beach california which again puts it on the uh more expensive end for a one gram cartridge but on the cheaper end for a one gram live resin cartridge uh so what are some other cool things about it well i really uh am kind of i was intrigued by their whole sort of marketing pitch and the reason they're called ocean cannabis co it seems like a pretty admirable goal to me uh they say on the back that they use all recycled materials in their packaging uh including plastic that has been pulled from the ocean uh so i looked at their website it's a husband and wife combo duo who are uh the head of ocean cannabis co uh and some percentage of the plastic that is in their packaging is pla comes from plastic that was uh extruded from the good old pacific ocean uh which is replete with plastic debris um i'm guessing you know it's probably not a whole lot of pla it's um hard to imagine it's made any kind of a dent but you know it's an admirable goal nonetheless uh so let's go ahead and get into it here this is standard 510 thread stuff so just your normal battery uh ah and here is that plastic that i was talking about that has uh some of it is uh ocean garbage which is again pretty neat i'd love to know the exact percentage the little press release i read online was pretty uh you know a little self-serving and smug but uh it's a cool again i do not want to dilute the coolness okay uh so we've got some different kind of child proofing here that i've not seen uh a line leaf with dot and push up okay so we're gonna line this leaf with these dots there's a little leaf there at the top it's kind of hard to see and it looks like it's lined with the dots and we're just gonna pull off perfect easy enough and there we are i found it curious that their website doesn't focus so much on the actual uh it focuses almost exclusively on their packaging and very little on the actual oil itself their their um their product they're trying to get you to consume uh but here it is and it does look fine that is some nice looking darker oil not as dark as some of the live resin i've seen out there but uh nice looking color nice consistency materials look pretty nice like that ceramic uh tip nice glass base and yeah looks like actually pretty decent materials all around let's get it on our battery here set the voltage at 3.3 ish and let's give it a try so here we go here is our first hit of our ocean cannabisco straw nana tasty it uh has those very strong nana e terpenes very sort of fruity and um uh yeah just a kind of a a sweeter tasting strain uh very delightful um i'm i don't necessarily doubt that this is live resin tastes like the strain there um i know live resin in terms of uh there have been some instances where companies have gotten in trouble recently for sort of deceptively labeling things uh live resin when they're not really uh that is a subject for a whole other video i don't know how to tell myself without having basically like a spectrometer um but uh i can tell you that this is still pretty quality oil uh whatever is in there and there's no reason to doubt you know they say it's live resin i'm sure it is okay well this is pretty quality oil and it's pretty strong i'm feeling it pretty uh pretty acutely after just a couple of hits there uh 84 thc so it is a high th c live resin which is nice taste is nice uh let me get another couple of hits in here i think this battery in particular has weaker draws than some i'm going to try turning up the voltage just a bit which don't necessarily do especially for live resin i'm not sure why but i've heard people say try to vape it on the lowest temperature uh you can but just to see if that'll help with the draws oh yeah there we go that helped quite a bit wow that is quite tasty quite potent let's get one more in here before we say goodbye for the moment yum wow ocean cannabis co uh this is a pretty good product i'm um more impressed than i thought i was gonna be uh i really you know i admire what they're trying to do with their packaging uh and the affordable price on this live resin especially for one that's as potent as it is uh makes this a pretty good value for a product um that uh you know the live regions usually come in that exuberant exuber oh i forgot how to say that word exorbitant exuberant no exorbitant [ __ ] i'm high [ __ ] 84 thc that right there guys is proof in the pudding the pretty the proof is in the pudding some kind of proof pudding situation it's all here uh big thumbs up from ocean cannabis co wasn't necessarily expecting the greatest things but uh really pleasantly surprised so far however like all of our wheats reviews we're going to review the whole thing all one gram here it'll probably take me about five days or so to get through it uh and once i do i'll come right back here and give you all of our wrap-up thoughts make sure that this straw nana is as fresh and tasty on the day we unpeeled it as the day we finished it that was never going to work but what will work is hopefully this for the next five days until then stay high stay healthy we'll see you soon goodbye hi guys welcome back to wheats it's been a little over four days since we started with ocean cannabis cos live resin straw nana this one gram cartridge you can see i've got a little bit of that live resin left in there not a whole lot it's actually hitting just fine i was just already out here at the ocean and i thought to myself what better time to finish our review uh our first half was really positive you guys remember i know i did really liked this stuff especially for the price and i also found their sort of recycling gimmick to work pretty well too or to uh to be um at least a a cool idea uh i'm not sure how it well it's sparing an execution but that idea of using ocean plastic as packaging is neat but the more important part is that the actual live resin is good stuff um and at that price i think it was what what did i say 55 something like that um not a bad price at all it might have been a little bit more for live resin which usually is like about 20 more or so than standard distillate so this is gonna be a big thumbs up for ocean cannabis co and their straw nana like uh pretty much everything there is to like about it um and i think maybe in the future we'll take another look at some of their products uh and then anytime guys we have one of these reviews that we like this much we like to give a little cherry on top dogs kicking up sand on my camera person as we speak how stoic is she any time we ever review that we like this much cherry on top i'm going to give you a perfectly perfectly paired cherry on top i don't know i hope i didn't mention this in the beginning the first half i might have if so that's okay because it's worth being brought up twice that is a twofer and the twofer is uh pbs's frontline documentary series all of them uh they're all amazing they come out with like 10 a year of all different kinds of topics but very specifically plastic wars from this year 2020 frontline documentary uh that is about plastic and plastics in the ocean and uh this sort of uh unbelievable fraud that is recycling plastic and how heartbreaking it all is uh but it's actually a wonderful documentary and has changed my views on plastics that is front lines pbs's front lines plastic boards something i highly recommend along with the ocean cannabis co live resin straw nana and that guys is gonna do for the cherry on top and the review efficient one today while we're out here at the ocean thank you so much to anybody who's made it this far until we see you for our next review that tractor says stay high more importantly stay healthy later you", "YvpSiTIk1A4": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to weeds the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at a vape brand uh one that we've actually taken a look at in the past but now they have a new line that i thought i would take a look at and so who is that we are taking a look at moxie a brand as i said we've looked at before but now they have their new mx line from moxie uh this is the mx they're live resin full spectrum cartridges so this is a standard 510 thread uh filled with as i said full spectrum live resin sour jack um concentrate is what we've got here today this is a one gram cartridge that cost me 45 bucks at my dispensary in long beach which puts it at the about average cost for a one gram cart at my dispensary um uh the most exciting part about this is is again that live resin full spectrum nature uh that uh makes it so that theoretically everything in this cartridge uh is the same or pretty close to the uh plant terpene profile cannabinoid profile uh should be pretty similar to what is in this concentrate as well should be as their uh motto says it should be it's just cannabis it's just weed in this full spectrum live resin cartridge theoretically at least um one thing to note that this is actually pretty low on the thc uh percentage scale this only comes in at 66 percent thc which is quite low for a cartridge um you normally see them in the mid to upper 70s or higher um but it does have uh some different cannabinoids in it for a cannabinoid profile of 75 but the most important one thc uh a low 66 so let's go ahead and open this bad boy up and give it a try um as i said standard 510 cart here nothing special nothing fancy um hopefully don't demolish it too much there we go got it opened got our little additional security feature push down open there we go one more defeated and here we are okay well here is our cartridge uh powered by c cell technology um which are usually fine uh vape cartridge designs the cheap acrylic tip the oil uh darker than normal uh maybe it's just because this the full spectrum live resin is a little bit darker than normal uh but it is a richer oil color than than usual so uh let's go ahead and give this mx by moxie sour jack a hit oh tasty yep definitely has that um sort of more live resin full spectrum uh what would you call it authentic sort of strain taste quite tasty sour jack isn't a straight on too familiar with plant material wise but um this one here um nice taste uh light um mild kind of earthy um kind of um vaguely like basilly kind of taste to it i like it though um in terms of taste pretty good uh it does feel about that 66 as listed this is not the strongest cart i have ever done by any stretch but it is still weed and it is still gonna get me high i am already uh experiencing it it's just uh a as i said lower thc percentage than i normally do but the oil itself in here is quite good um quite tasty uh nice consistency no problems with it um if you are a big fan of having your concentrates taste theoretically what the strange should taste like this is probably something that you might be interested in this is on the sort of uh lower end of price for live resin not lower end price for one gram concentrate carts but if you are really into the whole live resin hype this is a more affordable way of doing it and this one's not bad yeah okay well i have a whole gram of this sour jack to do my guess is going to take me about five days to get through this but i will like all our wheats reviews this is gonna be a top to bottom affair i'm gonna finish this bad boy off uh and once i do i will come right back here to you guys give you our wrap-up thoughts let you know make sure that this sour jack from mx is as good as we hope right now until then we'll see you in just a bit later guys [Music] hi guys welcome back to wheats it's been five days with mx live resin by moxie with their sour jack and five days later feel pretty much the same about it as i did back then perfectly fine cart just not my favorite cart in the world um it's uh more for your fans of your live resins your full spectrums your strange specific kind of things and then it's a pretty good value if you're really into that uh it's like that 45 46 dollar price point for live resin is good it's a good deal um but this does come in at a lower thc percent which is very noticeable at just 66 and the sour jack flavor where the taste is good but not my favorite strain by any stretch so this is one that i would say if you're really really into live resin if you're really really into you know strain specific things maybe give it a look um but otherwise they're probably going to be better values out there than the mx line by moxie again nothing wrong nothing bad about it and if you're really into the whole live resin thing you're probably going to like it a lot more than i did which again liked it just fine just not going to be the cartridge i go to pick up on my own so with that guys that's going to do it for this review here on wheats i appreciate you watching until we see for you for our next review stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you there goodbye", "yGYe8wZZTds": "hey what's good everybody jay ping here checking in live respect my region.com back with another west coast we tour review today we've got another special guest you guys probably seen her before jazz in stores hey guys new budtender in the industry over at mother nature's remedy she's got some samples a bunch of bunch of customers have been going into the dispensary and asking for these things yeah brooch and a couple other brands yeah um i don't know much about this except for that it's a live resin pocket bait i'll give you guys a better view real quick right here yep oh it opens like a book kind of cool i didn't even have any clue how to get into that and it says love it talk it feel it pass it plug it sneak it rip it hit it roach it then recycle it it's cheesy but it's super dope um hybrid orange creamsicle limited edition 2360 of 2800 testing-wise landau labs you want to read the statistics for them sure so total cannabinoids 78.6 273 point six milligrams thc and 7.2 milligrams cbd package um october 2nd of this year and yeah good until 2022 it says 2022 which is pretty interesting saying all right so we're gonna dive right into the product we're gonna hit it once talk about it and then hit it a second time and give you guys a score out of ten unfortunately we have to cut it does have directions to cut it but we don't have scissors right now so how do you get into it if you don't have scissors i would press it out this is should i go get scissors no it's okay i have uh there is another way no health insurance to open this up so yeah unfortunately if you don't have scissors it's not exactly easy to open but it is pretty cool it's a small device this is the smallest vaporizer i've ever seen it's very discreet it's the noisy cricket the cut look at the color of oil here you guys look at that amber color ladies first love it talk it feel it pass it plug it sneak it rip it hit it roach it then recycle it it does say hit it hard which is why design designed for long rifts and heavy hits and i'm gonna say that i actually really like it this tastes delicious it's so small look this is my hand yeah look stick your hand over come on look at that look how small gone covered done walking the venue go so crazy um first hit tasted really good tasted like orange tasted like a dab i don't think it's like that i would buy this i would recommend it too you're all ready you're sold one hit sold oh it's all in one hit you like it it's got a cool little brand new one before i give it a score though oh yeah everybody rip it a second time marinate on your score there were some really nice solid terps i mean i wish it had the terps on the back so we could know what exactly you know are we getting laminene osamine one of the other ones but it tastes like it tasted like an orange citrusy dab i hope they make a bunch of strands in that because 9.8 but here's the thing it's pretty high it doesn't really give you information no strain information and no jerkings yeah and i just all i know is that it's a hybrid and orange principle it's a 9.5 automatically or lower for me when there's no terpenes or genetics listed i do like how small it is i do like how small it is i think that adds a lot of discrete um opportunities yeah i said vibration chocolate at the beginning it is but this is the thing it's not soft this tastes like this tastes like dabs it does yeah so because of that it tastes like real live resin i'm definitely high score wise out of ten presentation cool appeal cool the book and the packaging cool the uh the smoke and the potency effective ten out of tens on the taste and the flavor so you can smell the oil through this thing after you rip it that's attractive when it comes to real live resin you know i think this is a solid 9.25 for me [Music] what i'd like to see is the genetics and the terpene information um on the back right here where there's where there's some space and then the it was not easy to get into whatsoever so i only docked them 0.25 but if you think about you know you go by the vape and you're in your car there's no scissors in your car most likely right and you gotta think about that you gotta think about ease of use for the consumer now this is for a very specific type of user but even still like i'm a millennial and i would buy this based on how it looks and i'd still be mad frustrated if that took me that difficult to get in if i was you could possibly damage that you could damage your vague you could damage your teeth if you were using that you could hurt your hands it was not easy and i'm a grown-ass man you know what i'm saying so roach make it easy perforated edge to tear not as dense a cardboard and still just as cool and i think it's it's roughly a perfect product for what it is this is the smallest vape i've ever seen but god damned as a pack of punch this is the noisy cricket of vaporizers i love it i love it and keep rocking citrus trains and we will always buy this and be a fan 9.25 for me 9.5 9.5 she went down i went down just a little bit and i always judge them on the title i think it's hilarious but it's called roach is a little bit of a rough title but i'd like maybe they go from roach to to noisy cricket down you know noisy roach and we all notice that or something creative but i think it's a great great product tap in uh go check out their instagram i think it's uh probably something around the lines of roach uh oh no at roach underscore dtla roachlife.com oh ingredients 100 unadulterated whole plant extract pure cannabis live resin well says that it's real are you changing your no i'm still saying it the same they don't have the terpenes and the genetics they have the ingredients here and i think that's cool if they didn't have the ingredients out of the doctor more um yeah this is great work let us know what you guys think in the comments show us some love talk some [ __ ] follow and follow most importantly please subscribe i'll see you guys down the road oh and don't forget follow jazzasaurus love you guys peace", "gFnKjTuOmIY": "hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at a disposable dab pen first of all hope everyone's being as safe as possible avoiding going out if possible if you've never heard of live they are a black market company I guess you could say out of Maine East I think I did a review on their like original carts like a long long time ago but that was before their packaging was like updated and actually like official so I might grab that just their normal Kurt's again and do it but this is their sauce pen so you can see right there and that's their little girl right there as you can see I chief through this already it's only 0.5 obviously but I feel like it went through fast even 4.5 like lasting me like maybe two days which carts usually last me like a week but I still say still stop chief and just so I could still show you guys the oil um you can kind of get a better look when it's a lot lower too because you can see how it looks without it compared to you know how cool you can see actually exactly how golden it is compared to the middle but um there's no flavor on this one apparently they they release ones with stickers I think that's their new ones like they have stickers that depend the flavors um but this has no sticker or anything as you can see for more info visit cartridges dot live I honestly have not checked that link so I cannot confirm or deny if that link works the battery to children okay I'd hope so but the wax itself it's not that bad it's it's it's not very flavored which is probably good because it's just a disposable like um you know what I mean it's probably better that they just did one like basic flavor I've had I've definitely had worse disposable Deb and and if you like their carts then you definitely would like this I don't see what you wouldn't if you don't mind black-market cartridges then this is a somewhat decent brand they do change their packaging quite a bit which is a good sign as if last like six months because they're trying to stop fakes yeah if you've heard of this break if you've tried this brand tried there are other products let me know if you enjoyed this video drop a sub I have like literally mad [ __ ] videos just like this mad different [ __ ] brands and [ __ ] but thank you guys very much stay safe", "C096Dfz2baU": "oh this is not a plot to make me change like a castaway it won't you know your page that you bought the color today kay you know what is going on everybody welcome back to another banger video man my name is Teddy G if you don't already know man welcome to another cartridge of you yes I said it cartridge of you guys today man we are going to be doing something a little bit different something out of the ordinary I haven't done a review on this brand and over I want to say like over a year and yeah man they had they have been coming out with some new stuff that they wanted me to try out so I'm gonna try it out for you guys because I have been hearing a lot of of my viewers asking for this too alright so without further ado man let's get straight into the video guys today we are going to be reviewing slash testing boom dr. zodiac moon rock this one right here is the sauce version which is the new one and this one right here is a silverback clear I think it's just the normal dissolute one so if anything we're gonna be I'm just gonna be showing you guys a new packaging that they have now that they're licensed and things like that so right here you got the sauce one like I was saying this one is a live resin sauce and this one right here is a distillate so I know you guys don't want to see the distillate too much man because you guys already know howhow that taste you know I'm pretty sure I reviewed that one far too many times on my channel so we are only going to be reviewing the live resin which is this one right here frosty snow cone as us can see man so I am not seeing on the box that it has any any labels of THC content or CBD content so I'm not too sure what this one's shooting at but men let's go ahead and take a look at the cartridge itself alright guys so this looks I'm not too sure if this is a half gram or a program I'm assuming it's probably a half gram and you guys can tell by that by the oil color right it is a lot darker than their old Darrow dis list so I'm assuming this is a live resin it doesn't look too too dark as compared to Stacy's live resin but it does have that little amber yellow yellowish tint to it so I'm gonna go ahead and take out real quick though she is can see the difference I mean go ahead and take out the silverback clear this is their disel it one and so you guys can take a look just look at it all right so that one right there is a lot clearer compared to this one guys so what I'm gonna be doing getting the proprietary battery oh I'm taking a little cap off you know screwing this little bad boy on here let's go ahead and give it a try man Savi jeez first try of the dr. zodiac moon rock new light resin saw spins I don't even know if they're out yet I think they're out I think he said they were out in Nevada or Arizona one of those two so I'm gonna go ahead and give this try it let me see I'm gonna give you guys my first impressions all right so we're going in on this frosty snow cone libraries and saucepan cheers boys if you guys are over the age of 18 and 21 let me know down in the comments below what you guys are smoking on man choose holy [ __ ] hold on hold on give me a second guys I'm trying so hard not to call right now dude so I'm gonna give you guys my completely honest 100% honest review on this man because that first hit was oh my gosh if I didn't take another hit just to make sure this is right right holy goodness dude this thing tastes so good it tastes it tastes like the frosty snow cone one obviously it doesn't taste exactly like the dissolute version though it tastes like yeah like if someone took libraries and it tastes exactly like what I no live resin tastes like but it has that that that Farsi snow cone strain coming out of it like very it's very very very heavy man I'm talking about you know how their distillate pens you know how this lids are usually filled with you know kind of like these different type of Terps that kind of taste fake this one right here guys does not taste make it alright this can literally this is live resin this is what live resin is man dr. zodiac coming out with these new live resins first impressions it's actually so freakin good man I want to try more my first impressions are that it's so good and I want to try more right because the taste I'm talking like if you guys liked the frosty snow cone taste you guys are gonna love the live resin taste it just emphasizes him brings out the full spectrum of that strain and it just it's just phenomenal it's just phenomenal it's a very very smooth hit and it's very like that's why on that first hit I was like just astonished because I when I when I exhaled there was so much smoke and I got every single flavor profile that I I was not expecting then I was not expecting but it's very very delicious so I'm gonna go ahead and hit my third one real quick just keep going into the review man Cheers oh yeah that's good dude it reminds me a lot also I have some dabs I just recently had up some lie resin mellon otter from field extracts this tastes very very similar to them and so imagine getting a dab inside of a pen this is as close as you're going to get I'm talking about when I've tried other live resin companies you know they they're they always make it seem oh yeah this is as close as the dab is you're gonna get blah blah blah but when I taste it it doesn't really taste that good as a dab usually taste man and this one for example this one is something different this is something I have never before tasted and it tastes exactly like a dab it tastes it has the full turps it has a full flavor profile of the strain it has the I mean so far the high it's slowly subtly coming in in and I feel like it just because I'm not holding it in or I'm not taking long enough hits but like obviously with the dab you take fat dabs man and you get super big but with this one it's just the more controlled hey you know so I'm gonna go ahead and keep hitting it so I can tell you guys what the full high really feels like I don't want to take a blinker I don't think I'll be able to take a blinker with this one man should we try it though one time for the semi gfm I need some water dude I don't even have water with me guys all right that's all the water that I'm gonna get oh I missed a trash can so that I don't even know if that's a sign all right we're going in hot on this frosty Sunoco and libraries and sauce blinker boys right Cheers that was a humongous I was a humongous head dude oh goodness that was so flavorful that was literally hold on I'm trying so hard not to cough right now but that was so frickin plate before I'm talking about that right there I'm getting big that right there at that blinker hit felt like an actual death yeah that definitely felt like a dab right there that blinker whoo-wee I'm I've been joking boy is that that did the job right there I felt that that blinker literally maximize maximize the Terps in there the flavor profile everything and it felt exactly like a DAB I felt the lung expansion I felt my throat get warm like not instantly what didn't like probably like in the five to six six second mark is when you guys start seeing my face like make a reaction but yeah that was that was enjoyable and it was not not as harsh as I was expecting it to be but holy smacks man I'm smacked out of my mind off that blanket guys this thing is for pretty freakin good I'm not even gonna cap dr. zodiac if you're watching this video right now which I know you are hopefully she gave me some more book because uh I want to try out some more flavors and I'm pretty sure the viewers would like to see some more flavors too because this frosty snow cone one man youuuu get it right on the nail bro this one is very very good shout out to moon rock for providing with this new cartridge man yes so so the overall review that I'm gonna give on this frosty snow cone right so I'm a base out on the high based on the Terps I'm a base on the flavor profile of the strain and just the overall enjoy ability of the you know the cartridge itself so the cartridge itself meant the high is it's good but you're getting the full spectrum high that you usually get from light resin guys remember that with me put me personally I do not get super stoned with light resin I get a very entourage effect high which is what it has to offer it's very very soothing as opposed to getting a distillate high which is very rushed but yeah it's very very soothing you feel all the entourage effect it feels very very nice and soothing and calming and the the flavor profile the Terps its chirpy it's certain way mortar purer than usual I resin that I'm used to and that's a fact man this one tastes phenomenal the flavor profile on it from the strain a really they did a really good job on bringing out the frosty snow cone flavor it's right on the nail like I said man it's right spot-on it tastes exactly like frosty snow cone no it doesn't taste fake though like you know I'm not saying their dislike cartridge tasted fake but it did taste kind of like obviously they added something extra in there you know and this one it obviously just tastes like it's coming from a whole plant so that's about that and the overall enjoy ability yes I can see myself puffing this front from throughout the day the next couple of days until I finish it man without a complaint but hey the overall fit is fine I love the high I love the taste is something I could definitely be smoking throughout the whole entire day like I was saying so yeah man I'm nice and baked I'm just gonna go ahead and out the video here man hopefully you guys enjoyed the review today man something eats at the table so if you did though do me a big favor like I always say go ahead and hit that like and hit that comment button and most importantly do your boy favorite and smash that subscribe button alright guys we'll catch you guys on the next video then we finish is a great function on the crane bloody knuckles I've been super money I'm some to the runaround are you sending me are you coming now cuz I'm post on", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "tHXXQbLYmP8": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive all right guys back here for another freaking video you already know what it is and if you don't know my name my name is shakka zulu um thanks for freaking watching the video clicking on the video but um today is going to be another freaking review but today i'm going to review um a strain that the people from my freaking live stream wanted me to freaking try out and it is runs guys finally got me one of those rent carts because um a lot of people in my live stream said do the runs over the lemonade and then also like i bought this mainly because a lot of people um saw me do the geo pin and i showed that they had runs for geopin and they want me to do the runs for geopin but i don't want to use the geopin so i just got the 510 thread one so i got the oh obama runs guys let's go but before i get into it you know your boy has to take a rip smoking on the roach right now [Music] and if you haven't seen the video on this i made a video on this it's a disposable um cartridge it's called a roach if you want to check that out it's up there on the screen in the corner but um let's get into it guys so i decided to do runs and runs is actually powered by cookies guys there are um a couple brands that are powered by cookies maybe more but the three main brands are runs lemonade and mints if you guys are cookies fans you kind of know those are the main strains that are the main companies that are powered by cookies but um today we just got the runs and whoo and the runts is also let me sit down for a second let me let me walk over here and sit down so the runts is a lot it's a live sauce i'm pretty sure that's what you call it or it's just a sauce car period as you can see it's kind of golden it's not as dark as a live resin but it's pretty dark and that's because of the added terps if you guys don't know the difference between a disc jillet and a sauce cart it's not much of a difference but distillate when you make distillate usually all the original terpenes are taken out when you make that distillate so what they do to make a sauce cart is they add terpenes back into it to make it a sauce so it's distillate basically with terpenes in it let me get you guys a close-up real quick so you can see the golden goodness today i got the runts and i also have another lemonade but that'll be in another vlog i'll let you guys know when that drops soon before i go into that hit actually let me freaking tell you guys the content in it so it says thca 10 53 milligrams it says delta 9 thc 55 278 milligrams and then it says cbd two milligrams so we got delta tac and then taca they don't even have just you know usually they just have thc on it but they're actually telling you the type of thc that is in this pack so i'm gonna just take this first rib you know just to get the taste and everything and then i'll take a blinker head for you guys because you know i gotta take a blinker head every time i get a new car i gotta take a blinker head at least one on the new cart so let's go okay so off top this is definitely very terpe very sweet and if i didn't say so before it's obama runs it's actually not that bad guys [Music] [Music] so yeah guys man this [ __ ] is like definitely very terpy you can definitely taste the terps but it's also earthy at the same time so maybe it's actually freaking terps that are derived from the actual strain that they made the cart with but it's freaking fire guys oh my goodness this is way better than definitely way better than the last strain that i got i think it was called like metal in or something like that i'll put it on the screen the strain but fire shout out to runs i make some good ass [ __ ] powerball cookies but yeah guys it's just a chill day um today i'm just relaxing i just got off of work got back home you feel me i might live stream i don't know but if you guys want me to live stream like i said man i say this in

spectrum live resident harm percent cannabis oil denied see seulji man she said technology right this was $80 at brown half around a center I picked it up as you guys can see the head space ready one thing I do not like about this packaging is that anybody can go in open it up i straight take out and put in whatever the [ __ ] they want right there's no type of SILS there's not no type of anything so that I do not like MPX you got to get that you got to get that taken care of but yeah let me go right into these numbers guys see th see a 15 point 38 THC 54 point 22 CBG 2.45 see BGA 1.79 terpenes

what is up with that damn headspace for $80 that [ __ ] should be like [ __ ] full now maybe because it's a sauce cart or a live rosin sauce cart it will not burn as fast but who knows so I got the Cresco pen I'm just gonna hook it up right to this fresco pan hopefully it works I don't see why it went because it's a seven-time 7/10 red of course I've had this in my pocket so there's all kinds of

purple kind of like a grape soda kinda yeah at f1 I like this this is a nice tasting thank you this package variation or the time the golden is standard but for $80 would I buy another one for $80 no I would much rather stick with the live cartridges from [ __ ] Cresco to be honest with you yeah $65 over $8 there's a lot more a lot better but you know with the $20 off of using my points it's what makes a 60 bucks is still still I won't ever do it again I just you know did it for a review and in the in the tribe but it's not bad I like the taste of it do I feel the effects as of now not not Jett let me take up more pools the taste is crazy just like it's like a soda pop I like it I like the taste of it really the taste is really really good oh you definitely get the the lung expansion feeling all that good stuff I'm sorry fill it in like in the head I do know that this is a indica dominant I believe yeah everything I got today was indica dominant so let's see I got this I got code blue Chris go-cart liquor live resident be on the lookout for that one and I got motor breath live sugar by grass roots and that was 60 bucks so 60 65 and then 89 dollars off for my point so I just want to just want to say thank you to everybody at Maryland health awareness Center you guys are doing a thing then thank you for for you know I'm talking to me through through the invisible wall

crepe and cushy everything it's a really good taste it actually reminds me of something that I've had before but yeah only thing I don't like about it is the price range the packaging is pretty cool and that's the second thing I don't like about about the packaging about this product is that the patching like you can open it up and put any [ __ ] type of thing you want in there so um just make sure you're like once the [ __ ] the person packaging people put it in there just put like a little thing I don't know if this part here is supposed to be like you know like stuffed or he can't open it up but it definitely was not like this yeah anybody could get into that no child per for anything like I said that's the only really negative thing I have to say about this cartridge in the packaging everything else is wonderful I mean I'm definitely feeling a nice buzz right now I'm kind of feeling more lazier which I really didn't want that but you know it is what it is I'll get back up and get motivated here in a minute err but uh yeah go pick it up make sure you smash that Lake subscribing all the stuff I did playing for you guys hopefully you guys did playing with me turbot I'm out peace", "TqHotohh99U": "here [Music] beautiful [Music] all right what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is another cartridge review but it is another buddies cartridge review but it is distilled cannabis oil and cannabis derived terpenes so this is uh i'm just gonna assume that this is gonna be tasting very similar to the raw gardens where it's distillate with live resin terps but then again i've never tried it yet but as you can see the the strain is zerple punch um the total cannabinoids is 87 and i do notice that the terpenes they still list on the back i do have an older one and let's just see uh the terpene profile on this one is a lot more it's almost more than double this one's about three percent terpene profile and this one's eight so that's what i noticed about this but we're gonna let rj open it or hold on yeah open it you know what i'm saying be on the lookout for the buddies for the buddy's cart hold on so that way you guys can go ahead and try this out yourselves let us know what you think about it to the side right here award-winning distillate it says features see sell surrender award-winning dude i mean it's got a gold medal all that good stuff right here and then i believe there's something on the bottom too or no oh no um go back to the back it shows the testing right here i believe the testing is from infinite chemical okay so open it up oh yeah and by the way subscribe to rj eats me if you have not already subscribe to simplicity [ __ ] all right i'm fine just rip it okay i don't want to like [ __ ] it oh there we go there we go got it pull it out for a little uh thumbnail okay it's back there we go all right so back to this camera we're going to try this out um from the looks of it very much similar to the raw guard a lot more yellow than the raw garden color right oh yeah yeah definitely what that one was more yellow than the last buddy yeah yeah that's what you're saying right no than the raw gardens oh this one see this is the regular buddies yeah so you can see it's hella more lighter yeah this one's distillate though so we're gonna see distill it with cannabis terps so so that's what you said it should be tasting like raw garden yeah uh that's what i'm assuming and also uh this is 28 out the door at authentic 209 which is arguably the cheapest well-known brand cartridge that i've seen so far 28 for buddies even if it's the distillate uh cannabis live resin terpenes or whatever still pretty good so or i haven't tried it yet so cheers be on the lookout but that 28 is not going to be priced at your location if you're exactly locating the 209 so damn sucks for you second it tastes like raw garden but less flavor because it might be the three percent terps that it comes with raw garden tends to have the same amount of terps as the the green buddies packaging um but not bad for 28 dollars you really can't complain i do i do like it but if i had to compare it it does taste like a raw garden but with a little bit less flavor it tastes better than last one yet yeah yeah you like this better than the real live resin one than this one really this is much stronger so with it being distillate and live resin terps in it uh distillate generally has a more uh higher percentage appears than you would get from a normal like regular live resin cart let me just bring this one out again so you can see right here total cannabinoids 78 no i'm saying so this one has a lot more well not a lot more like nine percent more um but this one has more terpenes so i would say this is more flavorful with more uh minor effects added with it with you know the the live resin terpenes there's just more of it and uh this one's just a little bit less in taste but uh a stronger hitting one that's probably why i liked it more yeah i mean nice good hit nice good high ready you know so i'm just basically like a waking bait for me you know i'm saying just got up like not 45 minutes ago so still concert like awake with me say that i do get a sweetness uh when i'm first inhaling it like like you definitely get like a candy taste i think it's because it's purple zunch or zunch purple whatever the [ __ ] it's called zurple punch but uh it's definitely not as smooth as the other light resin ones because with this delete it tends to be a little bit more harsher on the you would say but like i said subscribe to rj eats homie is investing in his camera [ __ ] you know what i'm saying i i'ma just say you right now i have never i mean i bought stuff from my camera but i've never bought like new lenses or anything so this just shows the amount of uh of a passion he's gonna put into this so [ __ ] i ain't damn i'm surprised that he that he bought all that [ __ ] but i'm i'm happy for him because hopefully getting all that stuff will motivate him to do content you know more content you know he's been doing content but when he gets all that stuff maybe it's just you know sparking his interest even more like a catalyst i won't even sleep anymore get off or go vlog be a monster but um so far you're going to see something i'll continue with what you're saying oh okay well um so far with this car do you like it i do yeah 28 that's why i like it yeah hell yeah which one by two maybe what i bought two i might just buy three [ __ ] they got all kinds of flavors i might just get interested and be like well [ __ ] i spent 50 on 2 grams i might as well spend me another 20 and just get me the 3 grams this is definitely a direct competitor to raw garden i know stizzy has the pods that are kind of the same too you know this method that raw garden popularized is slowly making its way around other companies i feel like you know raw garden was the first one to pioneer this i'm not too sure uh but their ones made it more popular you know what i'm saying but i'm gonna take another hit uh i don't know if randy's gonna take a hit but this will be the last one and uh yeah hopefully you enjoyed the video guys like comment subscribe all that good stuff if you want you know no one's forcing you here but cheers yeah cheers yeah being a lookout dang

train for forever till the wheels fall off because i don't i don't need to smoke anymore it's just not something that i see in my future and it's not something that i need in my present hey everyone welcome back it's leona another video another level up and in this video i'm gonna be talking to you guys about how and why i quit smoking yes i am 40 days sober now very proud accomplishment and i wanted to come and tell you a little bit about why i started smoking in the first place why i let it go as long as i let it go and how i eventually quit before we get started just do me one favor or a couple favors firstly give this video a thumbs up two go ahead and hit that subscribe button because one it's free and two if you find this information useful then you will find the other videos on my channel useful as well i'm the level up coach it is my passion and my duty to just show people that they can do whatever they want because it's all up in here now let's get into why i started smoking weed in the first place and i'll begin by saying i was not an advocate for smoking in high school my friends they were smoking and i was like no like i'm getting two shoes i'm not smoking it kills brain cells it does all this stuff and i'm just not wearing that i don't like how it makes your breath stink i don't like how it turns your lips black i don't like how my friends were literally turning into like couch potatoes and gaining weight i was just not feeling it i was on a high i was on my high horse and i was like no i'm not gonna be smoking and then like most people of course i went to college and fell into the kind of the wrong crowd and that's not any blame on them i was a grown you know individual i thought that i was grown and you know i could start smoking now i'm responsible i'm older i have you know my brain cells are here and i'm smart and all this stuff so i started smoking socially at parties and things like that and i was still pretty against doing it like like chronically like every single day um none of the people that i really looked up to or the people in my life that i knew smoked all the time i wouldn't necessarily have wanted to cha trade places with them and that's no shade but it's like i was just on a different trajectory than the people in my life that smoked every day and then basically senior year came around um i was roommates with my sister she moved to the costa rica actually to do a study abroad program and i was alone in my apartment for like three months or so and that loneliness really started to get to me my anxiety was through the roof for like a lot of different things that were going on at that point in time in my life and so i went and i got a recommendation and i started you know smoking not only recreationally but i started smoke i started smoking every single night so that i could sleep better um one thing it does do it does make you go to sleep thankfully i never became a chronic smoker to the point where i was just smoking like to function like before work or anything like that like i was never that kind of girl like i was never just gonna sit up here and start smoking before work and all that stuff i was not to be high on the job because that's that's actually illegal and it's illegal in a lot of the employee handbooks and stuff like that so you know you got to know what what you can be doing like legally on the job and stuff like that too but but the reason why i let myself smoke for so long like it was 2016 either 2015 2016 up until february 2021 so around six years is because i liked being in another dimension i liked escaping like the present and going to this dimension where anxiety didn't really exist and i could just have fun and i can open up my mind and during that time i did learn a lot before i started smoking i was a very close-minded individual i wouldn't listen to the things that anyone would tell me because i thought i knew everything i was very arrogant but you know once you start smoking you just get very curious about things and then one thing leads to another and you're falling down a rabbit hole and now you're looking at do we have aliens here with us and is the government out to get us and all kinds of things especially during the lockdowns though when i wasn't really going to work every day i realized like i was smoking a lot instead of just smoking to go to sleep and get a good night's rest i got the cartridge thing so i wasn't smoking like joints i was doing the vape pen or whatever and then i could take that with me everywhere like i could smoke as soon as i got off of work i whenever i would travel i would always bring my plane my pen with me because i was like i don't really like flying the anxiety of just what if this plane goes down and all this crazy stuff um just anxiety is being worried about the future instead of being worried about the present and i like worrying and living in the present more now that i am not smoking but again that pen i had it with me everywhere it was like my safety blanket um i remember i went on a trip to bali basically every flight that i went on if i ever had to go to the bathroom i would take my pen with me and take a couple of heads because yeah i just really did not like flying i was a little reckless like smoking weed on a plane is not something that i'm proud of but then you know something clicked with me and this is kind of how and why i stopped smoking so lately over the past year i've been doing a lot of leveling up it was it's physical it's mental um it's you know putting things into my body and into my orbit that are going to get me to the next level because i do believe every day you're alive is a day to overcome a new level a new vice or whatever so the the in my leveling up i figured that i wanted to be a lady i want to be a lady i am a lady a lot of people regard me as a lady and i believe in the power of visualization as well so in my vision when i think about the lady that i want to become and look up the definition of the word lady because when i was smoking i was a female i was a woman i was a girl now that i'm not smoking and now that i've changed like my manners my mannerisms my attitude i'm more cultured or whatever i just learn a lot more i seek to learn i seek to expand my perspective by understanding other people's perspective and like i was saying so when i think about the lady that i want to be because i do have a vision of who i want to be i don't want to be someone who is uh just you know some influencer and just partying my life away and doing it for the gram and doing it for the likes and the retweets i actually deleted all my social media as a matter of fact because social media is one of the most toxic things to the human brain in my opinion and in my own life um but when i saw who i wanted to become and then i thought about oh my god i'm smoking all the time i'm getting into this kind of depressed very laid back very lazy state that didn't match with the person that i wanted to become so i had to give up smoking um and it was pretty easy i first started by stopping my weekly trips to the dispensary i started to just have a little bit more purpose and i realized how much time i was wasting with weed and as much as i loved how it expanded my perspective i did not like how i was captive to this high it's not like you just smoke weed and you're like okay well i'm done being high now so i'm gonna go about my day like no you're captive to it for like three four hours or however long it is um but to the point also of living a more intentional life and a more organic life i realized weed is it's chemicalized it's not just something that grows out in nature it's cloned it's genetically modified i don't even eat gmo food like i try my hardest not to eat genetically modified food because it's literally synthetic food it's fake i try to put only organic things in my body and that allows my i don't know pineal gland or whatever i don't know it just allows me to be more sharp and more in tune with my mind body spirit in the present at all times since i've stopped smoking and stopped putting these chemicals in my body lord knows what pesticides they're putting on the weed and all this crazy stuff i'm very focused and i'm motivated to live my my live out my true potential and be the best me that i can be which plays into my level up as well because in the past yes i was still leveling up and maybe you guys found my channel because of my mr london challenge video i'm very i'm a very dedicated and motivated person if i set my eyes on something and if i see something for myself i'm going to manifest it and i'm oh i cut my hand i'm going to manifest it and i'm going to get it just because that's the type of lady that i am i'm not someone who kind of sits in this victim mindset and thinks for myself oh man if only i could if only i could like no if i set my mind to something i'm going to do it and that's become a lot easier since i stopped smoking weed so maybe this was all over the place again i just wanted to come and tell you guys why and how i started smoking why i smoked for so long again it was a coping mechanism for my anxiety i liked being in another dimension where i didn't have to worry about the real world but then i realized it makes me stronger being able to overcome these things on my own without depending on this drug that is holding me captive for hours at a time because i can't just snap out of being high my productivity since i've stopped smoking is just way higher than when i was smoking so if you're looking to increase your productivity and just be more of an asset to your own self in your own life i definitely recommend staying on it and i just want to finish up with a few things that you can do to help wean yourself off of smoking weed so firstly the most important thing is the power of vision and visualization picture yourself being someone who does not smoke and then start being that person that doesn't smoke um another thing stop listening to toxic music that promotes smoking and doing drugs and doing all this crazy stuff and all these negative things especially like rap music trap music i used to be a girl that loved trap music and all that stuff and then i was i took a break and started listening to more like afrobeats which is you know a lot more it's just funner but they don't you know talk about degrading women and doing all that that trap music is some of the most toxic music i've ever heard and i used to be just rapping along yeah [Music] and then i was just like um i'm a lady why would i why would i even listen to this song and why did i sing these lyrics talking about myself that's just crazy and why would i let someone else's negative influence influenced me just because the beat bangs that's i don't want to be a puppet like that i don't want to just be out here lost in the sauce like i want to live a very intentional life and i know i can get a little bit to rambling and stuff but another way another tip that you can do to stop smoking is maybe uh stop smoking or don't smoke every other day and then when you finally run out of weed do not re-up do not go to the dispensary do not hang out with your friends that smoke if you already know that you really can't control yourself don't listen again to that toxic music that promotes the drugs and i understand like music sounds a lot better when you're high but at the same time if you can condition yourself to just appreciate music and live in the present and it's like uh pocahontas would like in the colors of the wind or whatever if you can imagine yourself enjoying the same things that you enjoy when you're high but being sober then you will condition yourself to live the same quality of life but it's even better because again you're not a slave to these psychedelics and these chemicals that you're inhaling in your lungs another way that you can stop smoking is to actually do the research because smoking weed is not good for you guys it's not good to inhale smoke into your lungs like period it's i i that that's something that should have been common sense to me um and i'm kind of ashamed that i just tried to make a case like oh no but it's so good because it has medical purposes i mean at the same time it does have medicinal benefits and people on with cancer they will smoke so they can have an appetite and stuff like that but outside of that again you're putting chemicals in your body and you're inhaling smoke into your lungs and your your breath is your consciousness which if you guys know anything about me you know this is an anti-mass channel um if that stops you from subscribing then you got to do what you got to do but i don't let the government tell me what to do i don't let people on the tv tell me what to do i do my own research and figure out what's best for me because i'm free and i control everything in my life and ain't nobody at the little grocery store clerk and ain't nobody out on the street gonna tell me or guilt me into wearing a mask because um they're a slave a mask is a face shackle and i have nothing to hide obviously but aside from all that you know petty you know bs talking you know sometimes i'd be talking some mess and all that um in all seriousness you can definitely stop smoking weed if that's what you want to do but you just have to visualize yourself doing it and then start taking the steps to do it that is like any level that you want to overcome in life first you imagine what does the end of the game look like hmm what am i going to do to beat the game it's it's the same thing and make sure that you check out my life is a game level up video because that is this is just another level that i'm overcoming in my life this is another vice that i'm overcoming this is another shackle that i'm releasing myself from this is another way to set myself free and i think a lot of you have found this channel or found this video because you also just want to be free and you don't want to be a slave to drugs you don't want to be a slave to influence you just want to be present and in control of your mind body spirit at all times which giving up weed definitely allows you to do this is not a video to judge anyone for smoking weed i definitely don't have anything against it it's just that it wasn't for me anymore because again the lady that i want to become that lady doesn't smoke weed uh the girl that i was the female that i was the woman that i was just inherently by birth that individual smoked weed because she wasn't living an intentional life but now i am so i just wanted to come and share this information with you again if you haven't already if you didn't at the beginning of the video what's wrong with you go ahead and give this video a thumbs up so that i can get out to some more people and go ahead and subscribe as well i think you will like the other videos on my channel if you're looking to live an intentional life and just level up reach your full potential and overcome all of those limiting beliefs that you have in your head because a lot of people do not a lot of people are not held back by others they're held back from fear of not being accepted which you got to let that go or just fear of thinking that they can't do it but it's it's all in your head you can do whatever you set your mind to um again this is just another level that you overcome in your life if you're looking to do that congratulations me personally i am on day 40 and i am going to be staying on this bandwagon this train for forever till the wheels fall off because i don't i don't need to smoke anymore it's

bye you", "Y3vRyew74g4": "[Music] what's up Isaac Lucic here back with another new Intel entitled this is going to be another cartridge review and this is a pretty new company I've never heard of but this smell free cannabis company and they were kind enough to give me a voucher to purchase one of these for $2 and they actually let me try some of their stuff to they have live resin cartridges and they also have cured resin cartridges and her cured live resin cartridges mind you man from what I remember when they let me sample both of them I definitely remember that the cured lie breath and tasted so so good I believe this one's going to be there their live resin one another thing that they mentioned to me which was surprising was that that they're live resin cartridges also has distillate in here so I'm not too sure I mean I'm pretty sure they said that about that but I could be wrong so correct me if I'm wrong the free canvas company but we're gonna be using the pocket you guys already know I will have the link and the one description below if you guys are going to check that out this is a pretty expensive batteries so please check your other alternatives or other options before you finally decide on this because what I like does not mean you like it you know I'm saying I like it because it's a very I it's just a smooth sleek design and build it has a nice feel to it but it is pretty pricey so like I said please just uh know what you're getting into know what you're buying I'm checking all other alternatives because this channel is cool about cannabis content and all and stuff but it's also you know save you a few bucks let you know about the products and always trying to save you some money guys always at the end of the day money is how you gave [ __ ] so I'm trying to hit you I'm trying to help you guys get the best [ __ ] that you can possibly get but not to talking this is going to be strawberry [ __ ] guys very very good stuff [Music] yes I do in a car cut and yes this is the new bandana I'm actually washing the other one so like I got sick of the skull the skull is actually better than polka-dots only have this one because it's black and a black bandana is less is non-threatening at least the gang members you know if I wear a red bandana I could get a shot blue shot black maybe not so much you know so I'm going to open this by the percentage of THC is 86 percent guys you can see right here I'm going too fast and I am sorry right off the back they use the same as select you can see very similar to the select plastic kit from iceless leg and right that kind of smell strawberries so this could definitely be mixed distillate [Music] good yeah [Music] before I get into the review or talk about that hit you might be noticing a faint man noises because I got a fan outside the window so it mentally it's better my room has been getting hot lately it's just because there's probably a lot of electronics there's a lot of people in my room constantly so a fan that attaches to the window is pretty good and it's actually going outward so it's sucking all the hot air out and uh yeah getting into the cart it taste like strawberries not too much I can say about the flavor other than if it tastes like strawberries not too overly powerful you know I do it does fade away quickly just like this lid does you know you but this Li exhales you get that full flavor boat it goes away pretty quick I'm not sure if it's just this lip [Music] so free cannabis fun so like I said earlier there live present and then have cured live resin and their live resin is mixed look a little bit of distillate is what I remember them saying and let's be real like come on this is the way and it tastes like strawberry I mean like live resident tastes like strawberry there's got to be some sort of like terpenes or strawberry terpenes in there that they put in there you know that's definitely not from the plant that I feel like you know some people like the discreteness of oh this guy's just smoking strawberry vape or whatever you know but yes it is good but yes guys this is a legit company okay I actually went to come all the flowers and picked it up I will post their information right here also in the description below and I'd like to mention you know guys just be careful with the cartridges that you were smoking I've been smoking cartridges for a while and nothing has ever happened yeah I always buy cartridges from the dispensary never have I I mean I've tried a few but I don't really buy them like I've tried my homies he usually goes to the sessions and I'm not gonna like I've tried you didn't really like it but I've tried you know yes free cannabis company guys I really really am enjoying this cartridge I'm not gonna lie but you guys already know me I like that I like the cartridges that taste like so but like I said they're cured light resin has that taste so if you do see this company try their cured live recipe try both it does matter try them next to each other and you can actually tell the difference because that's what I did at the booth and yes hopefully you guys enjoyed this video this brand is not bad I don't know the pricing of this I actually have not seen this at my local dispensaries or on weed maps and malls are selling it pretty cheap at the Hall of flowers by a walrus it won't reflect what you're going to be seeing at the dispensary so I can tell you the price $20 for a program $15 $15 I believe it was $15 for the regular live resin cartridges this year and then $20 or the cured live resin but like I said these prices won't reflect what you will see at the dispensary but I am liking this definitely like the cured resin better but I'm not gonna clean about this one if you guys like strawberry taste water looting stuff I really really would recommend this we'll take one more and then [Music] [Music] and there's cloud Stephanie cloud but yeah other than that I'll see you guys [Music]", "EatKrxNtArI": "[Music] what's up y'all p2 peeps and once again we'll be doing a review because i want to use the screen so we're going to use it this time we'll be doing our bear labs lemon sorbet sorry i clear my throat there but uh you know if you guys can't get a good look at this in the video then for sure you know i'm gonna be including those close-ups all that good stuff but yeah here's the cart here guys right here let me take it out of uh the vessel here pop that out you know uh you know it's kind of hard to see with this camera not gonna lie i wish i could zoom in but a little too far for me to be able to do that so yeah oh wow my voice is really scratchy today yeah we've got our bear labs lemon sorbet it's about 87 thc here 87.32 now no cbd in here but we've got a nice total cabin noise percentage of 92 percent yeah really excited for this i love bear lab so far you know my very first bear laps product but everything they have looks great and uh personally i can't wait to try to find more things already so before we uh go in and let you guys know about the hit and how it tastes and stuff i want you guys to you know pack your bowls get your dabs ready get your pen ready all that good stuff you know the drill guys you know the drill but yeah cheers boys so it's got a really really nice lemony sweet kind of turkey flavor there you know a lot like a lemon sorbet you know there's that tang and citrus from uh the lime and lemony flavors you know and uh a sweet undertone that just coats your tongue and that's just it's just really nice you know i was a little disappointed with my last cartridge pickup for live resins i believe it was the ursus well i wouldn't say disappointed disappointed but in terms of its flavor i was a little let down you know i was hoping for a lot more flavor like this lemon sorbet you know uh deep derpy flavor um you know i just really like the profile of this guys but yeah me get another hit here and let you guys know if i pick up anything different with the taste and flavor so the potency of this is very nice guys uh like i said this is a redo review so um i will probably put you know the old footage up on screen somewhere yeah i can attest to the potency of this you know it's not like uh i just hit it in one go and i'm just telling you guys in this video now that like oh yeah this is all the [ __ ] i'm feeling no no like sure i'm telling you guys what i'm feeling right now in the video but you know that's also influenced by the other sessions i've had with it so our second here guys cheers yeah again this this liquid uh not liquid diamonds i'm sorry this live resin sauce is really really nice um not sure what else to say about it aside from that because yeah i'm not picking too many other different flavors you know um i was excuse me sorry one second okay i was uh thinking i was picking up some uh some pepperiness in there but it's definitely not that it's more of a pineness and gassiness so we're getting some piney some piney taste in there a little bit of that nice old sweetness like i was talking about in that citrus citrus tang and um yeah you know it there generally uh concentrates flavors and feels just around this area here after you're uh the first hit but yeah i really like the high too not sure if i'm feeling uh you know too much euphoria off it but again guys i am a little bigged so it's hard to tell especially since this isn't my first session of the day but let's take another hit here and see if i can drum up any more thoughts on this [Music] actually leaves a really nice sweet aftertaste in your mouth too so i'll add that to it too but yeah we've got a tangy citrus flavor more like a lime you know a little sweetness it coats the tongue flavor that concentrates in the back a little pineness in there as well and some gassy flavors overall really nice deep flavorful terps on this and i highly recommend this one guys i'll be looking for a lot more bear labs cartridges in the future but um you know for now this is definitely this is definitely a purchase guys um for its price as well very good 6065 is about the average for your live resin sauces and cartridges and i'm glad that this is definitely worth its price because i'm like i said i'm gonna be looking for more i hope you guys enjoyed this one if you did please leave a like

everybody for watching p2 out peace [Music] [Music] foreign", "NYweYsi0x2E": "everyone Pope all's well so recently there's been some negativity when it comes to vaping and buying carts off the black market knowing what you inhale into your body should be priority number one and when stepping into the realm of vaping you don't want to inhale something that's gonna harm you long term so today we want to put an end to all the pleasures out there regarding bad practice and to truly answer the question what is a fake oil cartridge and how to avoid [Music] they coil cards go beyond branding and counterfeit boxes the number one question you should be asking yourself is where am i buying my cards from most reputable companies have authorized retail stores that are allowed to sell their cartridges if you're buying from anywhere other than licensed reputable companies or their authorized retailers nine times out of ten it's a fake and companies that are legit aren't gonna risk selling products to non-leap States eBay Amazon Alibaba are not where they experience weavers goaded by high quality oils sure you can compare your boxes to the boxes on the website but unless you buy from the right site you can still get it wrong also if you're buying oils on a budget you're gonna run into the same problem a big red flag is recognizable big-name brands at low prices let's face it if you paid bunk prices you're gonna pay for bunk oils but how do people get ahold of big name brands and if it's the same cart how can it be fake that brings us to fake cartridge answer number one fake oils take these sell cartridges for example defconn action calm says that all seasaw cards must have two logos a serial number and a transparent rubber ring at the bottom of the cart this cartridge is everything a vapor should look for but I know for a fact that the oil inside is fake meaning that nothing's tested and they let the name brand to sell the cartridge for them to me this is black market plus most cards and boxes can just be bought online and some people think that if cartridges and boxes look legit then there's nothing stopping people from putting their own formula inside plus cartridges can just be a replica and they use cheap metals unless you have somebody you trust a source who tests their oils you never really know what's in it from a normal customer standpoint so what could be in here was they can put synthetics in there like k2 which is a huge deal you shouldn't do that oil thickener or anything that you usually wouldn't see on the cartridge unless your oils are solvent free distillates which indicates that the substances are environmentally friendly with no des lunes then you're gonna run into terpenes in PG you want to limit the amount that's put into your oils both drippings and PG act as carrying agents to carry more flavors into your discipline because distillate itself doesn't really have much flavor and no PG does not cause formaldehyde companies only use these agents to give it their own unique formula and it may also indicate on the stickers the percentages that they use but not always think about as buying mid grade versus Private Reserve but you still don't know what a fake oil cartridge is so what's a fake oil cartridge okay so you got your cleaning lab all set up you got your formula lock down and now you're ready to start filling it up cartridges can you just use any cartridge no no you cannot in January this year of 2019 a new California State law was passed calls phase Reena saving that all California cartridges must be lab tested for heavy metals these tests are specifically for for metals cadmium arsenic mercury and lead and phase threes testings limit is 0.5 parts per million of lead allowed in your oils this is a big deal for vape cartridge producers because unless you have glass pores cartridges contain metal and sometimes the exact same cartridge will pass in one lab and fail in another causing producers to just bypass testing all together just to make a quick buck also the price of testing in a lab has gone up so people are cheating the system by avoiding it entirely so why the variation of testing there is no standardized testing procedures for each lab to follow this means that each lab extracts oil differently and if oil touches exposed brass then it may very well fail phase 3 testing so how to metal get inside of your oil cartridges well that's easy 99% of companies buy cartridges from overseas which allow up to 4% of your oils to be made up of lead which is much higher tooth into what phase 3 wants and unless you're on top of your menu this could be a problem let an arsenic is added to metals like brass which help make metal easier to mold into cartridges and oil is acidic so it eats away at cheap metals allowing particles to be invaded into your body so stop giving people reasons to ban they don't become a victim of uncertainty unfortunately some companies don't want to know how the cartridge is made because they don't want to be how reliable and there's just too much money to be made not to get inside of the oil cartridge market we can't change state law or lab test procedures but we sure can certainly change babe cartridges there are companies out there that are responding to the issue companies like Herve pur have already started innovating carts that are guaranteed to pass phase three testing and multiple facilities and are currently leaving the market who completely lead-free cartridges that vetted testing facilities in California that know how to properly test for phase three requirements the next generation of VAP cartridges might be hidden stores in winter time this year but keep in mind that cartridges made before January 1st 2018 are still allowed to be sold and could still be in circulation and states like Washington and have passed similar laws only allowing 0.7 parts per million so be aware of your state's requirements I know it seems like a lot but now you're in the know and knowing is half the battle so please no more black market cards we hope this video was helpful to you guys let us know what you'd like to see in the next video where do you buy your loyal cards did you know that metal could be in it as always don't forget to subscribe and like and we'll see you next time face", "nkLla_V-vmA": "[Music] what's up I simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title already we got that buddies let's just do a quick little thumbnail hopefully it's good I know you guys have been requesting for me to try the buddies cartridge for a while now and I finally located one in my local dispensary I actually picked this up at a dispensary that I've never been to before well that's a lie because it's a franchise there's actually another one that I've been to with the same name but I haven't been to the newer store which is located on McHenry and yeah I mean it's called people's remedy as you can see right here you see the little QR code all that stuff and I bought this for 43 bucks originally priced at 37 but you know tax and all that stuff so $43 for our gram cartridge not too bad but yeah I'm excited the image up here it kind of looks like the Select cartridge the same cartridge so yeah should be pretty interesting it says seventy-three point zero six percent THC and as you know buddies they like to show their terpene profile as well which is so dope I feel like a lot more companies should do this because terpenes have individual effects and it's good to know what's in what you're smoking like there's probably other stuff that they can mention on the label that's in there that that companies don't even so or maybe they don't even have terpenes in them you know so as you can see it says a pioneer four point six one beam murder scene four point four eight and then beep I mean one point something and this is the string and lucid blue guys buddies and it is a sativa so it should get me getting me to wake up you know I'm saying so we're gonna open this is I'm gonna take good care of the box so never [ __ ] it ripped off the stick little lever to pull out okay Wow okay even has the buddies logo in there noise yep same type as select [Music] very very thick this is liquid diamond sauce liquid diamonds live resin boys so not the best smell like this citrus we're gonna be using my chill battery for this one very very good battery it's a good truck alright buddy Cheers it's a it's dark it's what what ten what you tend to see when you get a live resin in your cartridges other than raw garden I don't know how they get there so light but you know if it's their secret they're gonna keep it to the grave with them but as you notice just like the Ursa this one's very very dark just like that not as dark as the Ursa so I'm interested to see how this is gonna taste so Cheers [Music] Wow not gonna lie that did taste pretty [ __ ] amazing things I've noticed not as Turkey it could be the strain it's not as chirpy as the strain that or is it used but it's not as chirpy but still really really good and for $10 cheaper you really can't complain about that it's just minuscule you know it's still um when I'm saying it's Lester P that means like just a little bit you know I'm saying I'm not saying that it's like one level down or anything but this is pretty [ __ ] good I'm not gonna lie you know I bought this myself so this is not in a way like a paid review or anything I bought the Ursa one as well and Wow if I had to choose which one to get no I can't take another hit oh the cloud production is there ooh the taste is there ooh the potency is there holy [ __ ] that [ __ ] really hits so just like the Select cartridges it just hits just like that it hits just as hard as the select cartridges I would say it's a lot better in taste than the Select cartridges because the select cartridges all taste the same to me this one although I haven't tried other strains I'm sure they taste according to string and not just some generic co2 distillate tasting oil but and I'm liking it I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and yeah this I'm probably gonna enjoy this behind-the-scenes you know I am Cheers maybe I'll do a blinker for you [ __ ] it I don't know how with this shirt off time for this is but [ __ ] it I feel like this buddy's cartridge hits harder than the earth cartridge but the Ursa one tastes a lot better and I feel like they just switch those two around it's like vice versa you know this one the taste is a little bit less but the clouds are a little bit more what the Ursa it's the clouds are a little bit less but the taste is a lot more there but overall pretty good you know this is only ten dollars cheaper than the Ursa cartridge which is pretty [ __ ] good in my opinion yeah I don't know I think I got to do like another top five cartridges of two or just top a top five cartridge list you know I really like I'm sorry like I haven't been getting too much cartridges lately it's just that most of them are a pretty pricey and I have a wax pen and usually just a grandma wax just will last longer to me than me having this at my disposal cuz I'm gonna just be [ __ ] hitting the [ __ ] out of it you know like if it's there it's there you know it just makes me want to hit it hopefully you guys enjoyed this video would I get another buddy's cartridge yeah definitely like I have nothing but good things to say about this other than maybe like the Select cartridge being like a plastic mouthpiece you know maybe a ceramic one would be better maybe I'm just spoiled from the earth one who knows you know but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video peace out [Music]", "W8SlI597N5Y": "[Music] what's up guys p2 peeps here and today we're doing another cartridge comparison we've got our bear labs lemon sorbet here let me see let me let me just double check and make sure you guys can see this come on focus on it let's see that there we go [Music] there we go yep the bear labs lemon sorbet live resin sauce cartridge sorry guys i want to be able to make sure you know you guys can see what we're working with here and here we go we this is the ursa cuddle cake come on focus and there we go yeah a little bit darker in color than uh the bear labs one yeah so this is gonna be another impromptu kind of live cartridge comparison and um you know we're just gonna get things started like we normally do with the hit i just kind of adjusted the mic so it'd be easier for you guys to hear me so without further ado let's go start with um actually our ursa here and i'll let you guys know what i'm tasting on the flavors here and then we'll go into uh the differences between the two after i take a hit of the lemon sorbet so i hope you guys got a bowl dab all that stuff ready you know the pen i don't know what you guys got right now your bag of chips food and a lot of people eat to these things too so whatever you have i hope it's ready cheers kind of like a roasty um cannabis flavor like i believe i've talked about before in a few other videos and even the review for this but [ __ ] it there he goes this cuddle cake always hits me real tough and i am not sure why it's floating about 74 um thc yeah okay let's go ahead and um move on to our pear labs lemon sorbet and uh go ahead take a hit here with you guys and then we'll move into the comparison so cheers you guys haven't seen the review um pretty much the same points i had in there very very nice sweet lemony flavors uh pineness a little tartness on there too very very slightness of it you know almost like an actual lemon sorbet like lemon ice cream it's really nice stuff so with that being said let's move into a taste comparison um i'm picking up also some peppery flavors off of the ursa um and personally it's not to my taste i i was expecting a lot more out of ursa's flavors but then again i don't have their ceramic cartridge um and i know that there's that's their signature so um you know that could be making a huge huge difference um but this bear labs lemon sorbet is just knocking it out the park for me i love love love this cartridge i mean i you guys can barely see it on the vessel so you know that means it's almost out so yeah it's definitely one of my favorite new cartridges and brands i've been able to try uh this year so shout out to bear labs i don't know if anyone from there is watching this but you guys rock so let's go move into uh a comparison of the effect and potency here so these are both indica hybrids um but i do think that this hits me harder now this is 86 thc and i think about 89 total cannabinoids this is only about like 82 total catabolism i can't remember exactly off the top of my head but for some reason this one hits harder even more even harder than uh the magic melons cart that you guys have also seen it's this cuddle cake's actually really really potent um but it's not that far of a step above this lemon sorbet in my opinion now like it's like saying this was a 10 and this was a 9.8 you know that's i'm not sure where they stand numerically because it's really hard that's very subjective but yeah i do think that they're very close to potency level um and in terms but in terms of effect i prefer this bear labs one more this gets me really really really high right it always hits me really hard in the head and stuff like that but it's just i don't know there's just something about the bear labs cart uh you know the lemon sorbet hi it's just it's just a lot more enjoyable for me i i feel like i can do a lot more things when i'm uh you know hitting this rather than this when i hit the cuddle cake i'm like i feel incapacitated so um yeah that's why it's a little bit hard for me right now to do my review honestly and this comparison guys especially since i'm doing it live no script no preparation type thing this this cuddle cake's definitely making it difficult um but anyway let's move in to uh satisfaction so this i got for about 65 at uh the dispensary and this i got for 45 at a delivery on an awesome deal so in terms of satisfaction if we're bundling everything together of the high the potency effect and now we're getting down to the value of things i i think i'm a lot more satisfied with my ursa just because the money spent right it's about a 20 difference it's a lot of money that i just saved if i chose an ursa now don't get me wrong here that's not the end of the equation here for satisfaction um that's just our price satisfaction you know what i mean and you know if i would be sad you know you know like excuse me sorry guys i'm stumbling on my words but you know when you take everything into account um i have to i have to take if i if if i'm being confusing guys i'm sorry i didn't mean to say um when i hit my satisfaction and i chose ursa i didn't mean overall satisfaction i just meant for price to value type things but when it comes to overall satisfaction i have to choose this bear labs card i chose the effect as one of my favorites right and i chose the taste as far superior now once again guys if you're just looking for a great brand to try out that's going to get you real loaded and you find both of these i would choose the cheaper one at the time you know just at the time but for my personal overall satisfaction i'm going with the bear labs this time they're knocking out the park with this lemon sorbet and i'm really enjoying it so thank you guys for watching i'm gonna take one last hit here out of the victor of the cartridge comparisons today and then yeah so hope you guys got a bowl packed a dab pack or your pen at the ready so cheers boys all right well that guy said that should wrap it up i'll see you guys on the next one pizza out peace [Music] you", "zfF1rYZC3Tk": "hey what's up youtube alex here back again with another video and hey rya's finally got some select elite oil cartridges turn that down a little bit yeah select elite oil cartridges [Music] live oil this is the birthday cake strain select elite enhanced live resin cartridge i'll explain to you in a second what that exactly that means because some people do not know what that means there's all the information now i did open this got a little button on the side you press push down on the top and the cart slides out i already took it out put it on my pen and they give you across the bottom which is kind of cool right here they give you a little sticker that goes you you could put around the bottom of your cartridge like that i don't know there's the oil select elite live enhanced live oil this is birthday cake and yes this is coming in at 93 percent thc and uh you guys know me i would not [ __ ] you this cartridge is strong very strong matter of fact it's so strong but i forgot to put my microphone up close to my neck so yeah very strong cartridges select elite now what enhanced live oil is is they use um cannabis uh distillate which thc distillate and they put live resin terpenes mixed with it so it tastes really good uh you guys know i always say hey i should have bought two of them i was gonna buy two of them but i didn't guess what i bought two of them yes i had to pull the trigger i bought two of them and i'm glad i did because this cartridge is fire it is very potent very strong and tastes very good the uh birthday cake live resin terpenes absolutely delicious they had this cart filled up to the tippity top very tippy i've already smoked on this cart twice now and it's still that full now i guess some people had good experiences with these cartridges and some people may have had bad experiences but i'm sure glad that i've had a good experience with them this is a hybrid indica hybrid birthday cake boom two of them these are 60 bucks a half gram at rise erie in erie pennsylvania which is a medical marijuana dispensary uh yeah this brand has been around for quite some time and i've been dying to try them i've heard lots of good things about them they are a highly faked cartridge also you could put a lot of street cartridges these are these are like fake like cookies and other brands king pen select elite is highly fake cartridge so cheers let me get a hit that was my phone ringing you know just winging it here we just wing these videos nice flavor it's not real strong terpy like a moxie card or prime car you know how they're real terpy those carts are but it's got a nice terpy flavor but it's not like real terpy you know how moxie's are or even pharmaceutical x their cartridges are all very good nice terpene flavor you know they're real prominent this is more subtle but it's still very very good and with the potency you guys know i've told you before i would not [ __ ] you i've been smoking dispensary stuff cartridges for three years now i've been smoking marijuana and in the marijuana game for about 30 years that's right i'm 47 years old i've been smoking weed since i was 17 and in the weed game business since then trust me this is a strong fire cartridge i am very impressed by it it's got the nice little they're kind of made just like terrapin the same kind of tips and stuff like terrapin has it's got a sweet earthy kind of hazy it's a very good taste and the oil is super thick you said this is like i said i've already smoked on this cartridge look how full it is still it's still damn near full i smoked on it last night i hit it like four or five times it was potent like i said it's an indica hybrid 93 percent thc and that is every bit of that there and i'm so glad that i grabbed two of them at rise with my discount it came to 108 bucks for the two cartridges so that was 54 dollars a piece they are pretty pricey same as like a moxie you know or or prime prime is also 60 a half gram but those are live resins that's why they tasted this is an enhanced hence you get the word enhanced live resin oil so remember that it's very good but remember it's it's distillate with live resin terpenes so that's why they call it an enhanced live resin but don't make no mistakes is very good and it's very high potency at 93 percent so yeah i would give this definitely a thumbs up right now i can tell you that and cheers yeah i'm impressed on how full it was this cart was filled to the top i smoked on it last night like i said and it's still it was filled i hope the other one is just as filled that i got there's another look at the packaging select elite birthday cake indica hybrid rise erie erie pennsylvania got these they just got these in uh march 1st um so i hurry up around over there and grab me a couple of them this is the only strain they had was the birthday cake strain so if they had a different one i would have grabbed you know a different flavor but i had to grab just because it was so 93 percent thc and it is there like it is there he said i wouldn't [ __ ] you guys you guys know i've been smoking and i've been dabbing doing this for a long time these are strong and good cartridges i would put them up there just because of the potency right up there with moxie prime pharmaceutical rx they're right up there might not be as terpy but they're definitely up there with potency they're even higher these are strong like it's coming i hit that what two or three times and i could already feel it coming on cheers guys like i said let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comments section give me a little thumbs up if you got a little value in this video you guys have a great weekend and i will see you in the next one select elite live resin oil", "E968X6DBupE": "hi guys this is ben chu for dab connection and cartridge review this week will be legion of bloom and their california sauce cartridge i picked up the orange creamsicle and it's a hybrid and here's all the thc and cbd numbers and the back one second it actually goes into detail what each cartridge has it uses live version hte sauce which is um deconstructed live resin or shatter and this and they uh mix it with their cannabis oil and here's all the other delta nine and all the terpenes listed and it's very detailed and this company won uh three major awards at the emerald cup last year and for their two of their distillates which are called monarchs and those were for the banjo and tanji i think yeah banjo and tanji and then the lemon cake sauce cartridge got second place the other two got first in sec third place anyways yeah so back to this cartridge the oil looks very very dark like almost like a ursa or walks or um heavy headers maybe even darker a little darker than heavy hitters so this uh legion of bloom very much tastes like the heavy headers quite a bit the oil quality and the like the potency and i feel a lot of the entourage effects so looking at the cartridge they have their logo and the word cali sauce underneath just way too many people around at the park so uh i moved annoys um in conclusion i really enjoyed the lesion of bloom products especially the sauce cartridges but last year i also enjoyed the monarchs and though the monarchs are great like distillate choices and yeah so i'd rank this like near heavy hitters in between heavy heaters and absolute extracts probably um yeah so thank you for watching", "DJSPey5vWGA": "[Music] then [Music] yes yeah you should hold it i should hold like no no um i might do this as a thumbnail we'll see all right what's up guys simplisik here with rj eats subscribe to the boy if you haven't already you know i'm saying but if you can tell from the title we finally picked up the bear labs cartridge and i know you guys are probably gonna get mad when i tell you the price that we paid for this do you have the you have the [ __ ] uh receipt you don't toss that [ __ ] oh sorry it was 32 out the door for a full gram i swear 32. no it was 32. they trust they believe me you know what i'm saying it's not on weed maps yet you really can't check it honestly you're not going to see this video probably for like two weeks but it's 32 out the door lemon sorbet i'm gonna have him uh so as usual i like to um film this so get a better look wow i like the packaging very very nice the bear and then the labs yeah sorben what's the percentage percentage also show yours so the homie got uh his uh strawberry cheesecake [Music] and then the back of the strawberry cheesecake [Music] now open mine so live resin cart as you can see oh that's very light okay yeah i don't have my pants i'm just like okay i got mine my bro is bad too i can't get too harsh on my back all right so boom boom we're opening this up baby let's go ready until then pull out that for a thumbnail [Music] so uh from what i've heard from uh p2 piece this is some fire [ __ ] you know what i'm saying so i was really a fan of the lemon sorbet so all right we are gonna try this so very much very light what i've noticed is with that light lighter stuff it might have uh terpenes mixed in with it instead of reintroduced i mean instead of uh already being in there [ __ ] wait what is it that you just don't know uh when i when it's lighter i feel like they add turkeys but when it's darker they don't really add much children to it or if not any but that's just an assumption i don't really know but he's going to be opening the strawberry cheesecake and we're just going to take some ribs off this i don't have my battery on me you guys and my bad and maybe we shouldn't just meet get out the car we'll just use this battery let's trade them off oh yeah that tastes like the [ __ ] lemon sorbet oh wow refreshing hits that's like super lemony like if you haven't seen my lemon sorbet video it's exactly the same way it tastes like a lemon slushie oh my god that [ __ ] this is the [ __ ] that this was 32 buck that 27 [ __ ] even though it's still it's all right the cartridge itself is good [Laughter] damn bear labs you guys go check them out that's the damn seatbelt is it oh no i'll pick it up later all right taking a take another hit off this and did you want to try this one too yeah yeah oh yeah that's why i pulled it out [Music] i should probably like keep the keep the packaging actually still because i haven't finished my other one yet yeah you're right here but you want to take another this is the [ __ ] fire yeah i'm trying to smell it yeah this is a little surprise but yeah this is this is it 32 out the door 80 plus cannabinoids well and it smells like lemons you're not gonna get caught up with this [ __ ] bro and actually looks nice with the white the black tip coming out of the the device the black on black yeah all right let's try this one oh yeah all right if it tastes bear in mind we gotta switch no no no that one's [ __ ] good i feel like they're both gonna taste hell again if this one doesn't taste good we got a [ __ ] problem i didn't just say it doesn't work uh yeah there's something wrong with this car it tastes like [ __ ] it says strawberry cheesecake but it tastes like [ __ ] let's try strawberry cheese [ __ ] or what strawberry cheese [ __ ] all right cheers guys i'm excited 32 for bear labs i kind of want to just go back and buy like two more but i'll reserve myself because that's not the way what's the way that no it moderation taste like strawberry i don't know but not even the wires came out right there i think that was broken well did it taste like strawberry cheesecake i didn't even taste it it tastes flavorless to me i need to try it again i'm bad y'all need to try to slightly like a little bit in the beginning but not really huh yeah damn i always get stuck with one of them [Music] turn again try it again i should have got me uh the other one that they had the gg4 or some [ __ ] i don't know do you think the gg4 would have been good that's crazy this is strawberry cheesecake you would think it would taste like strawberries no something you know we shouldn't taste like the name sometimes or sometimes it does happen you know i don't know i don't know i mean it doesn't taste bad but it didn't taste this good no they're not it's not bad yeah that's not bad i've had worse doesn't taste like that limited sorbet but it definitely hit so i'll tell you that right now thank you uh but yeah that's uh it for the video uh i'm really excited that we did get to try uh bear labs the cartridge but i'm a little bit disappointed that randy didn't get one as good as mine um but at the end of the day he can just use that one first and then he has that other uh the other jetties one that's way better than that one so yeah yeah but it's only 32. you know well it's not like you're paying 40. that's what happens when you're not moderate [Applause] yeah see he was actually going in there not trying to buy a cartridge he was just gonna buy wax and then i saw this beauty i thought that was beautiful it was all right it's not bad it could have been worse yeah but whatever strawberries okay and we also got uh i got a bad fish so expect the video on that um you got anything to say to the people before we end it hope you guys enjoy the video man continue like i said to support the homie and stay safe out there you guys cover 19 is still a thing uh let us know what you thought in the comment section below man and also yeah have a good day peace out [Music] you", "grbMuzo9DW4": "is going on guys it's your boy gurney thank you very much for tuning back into the channel and if you guys do not subscribe please do so now you'll then get notified of all the videos i'm dropping i got a big dispensary haul coming up i'm going to hit the dispensary tomorrow i got a pile of stuff ordered a mountain of stuff for edibles all sorts of stuff so anyways uh yeah please subscribe to the channel and today guys we are getting into agrikind you see i got my shirt on they sent me this shirt they were sending patient shirt shirts quite a while ago um and i was lucky enough to get one got some buttons some magnets and some little uh notepads from them as well but in today's video this is uh pretty cool here i'm a big cartridge fan and today we are getting into this first agricutting cartridge i've had and um it just says rainmaker vape cart there on the front but what you want to see here is right there this is a liquid sugar cartridge so i emailed agrikind messaged agrikind whatever you want to call it and uh ask them so what are these liquid sugar cartridges you know because there's a lot of controversy on the in the pa medical marijuana market as to like the way some companies label cartridges like or is it accurate the way they're labeling them you know some call things live resins that might not really be live resins you know so i was interested to hear what they'd say and ask them what different parts they make at agra kind and all and uh the answer that i got this liquid sugar cartridge so this is cool i was hoping this was the answer it's exactly what it sounds like it is so i'm going to open this up so you guys can see but um so it's called the liquid sugar cartridge so that's what it is now me i like to get into the geeky parts of it and know exactly what's going on and all and um so what this is what they do is now look they put that little hybrid sticker on it there if you guys can see and we'll take a look and see what type of cartridge it is but um so what was i saying so oh yeah the liquid sugar so it's just all that this is is decarb wax decarb sugar so decarb concentrate what decarb means is decarboxylate it and that means like when you heat up the uh the oil or the weed or whatever to a certain temperature for a certain amount of time and it turns the thc a molecules into thc molecules so thca is not like as available as thc is so um yeah they decarb it um because here i'll show you is what look here's an agrikind sugar right here i hope i'm not all over the place and i hope you guys are following um i gotta understand just because i am understanding this like i know you guys completely some people might not and i'm not explaining this perfectly by any means i am learning right along with you guys but i'm doing my best to you know just be uh honest and informative here and show you guys what you're actually getting so this here is agrikind kosher kush sugar i'm gonna do a review on this for you guys i got this with the liquid sugar cartridge but the reason that i'm showing you this here is because that's agriculture and sugar there and then here's agri-kind's liquid sugar cartridge so i'm going to take that little hybrid thing off of the cartridge here so that you guys can see how this is filled and all and then i'm going to throw it on the uh my uni and we're going to uh give it a try the strain so it is 74 thc and then eight and a half percent thc a there's a little bit of terpenes in it one point four percent limonene 1.3 mercene and one percent cario so it has three terpenes over one percent let me show it to you guys here so you get a proper look at it i hope you guys can see that so it is a really light colored oil okay like it almost looks like it's just distillate you know but they said that it's just decarb sugar so they took that sugar i showed you they heated it it uh it bubbles and all and then after a certain amount of time they're professionals they know what they're doing it becomes like a more viscous consistency and then you're able to i guess they were able to add it to cartridges i know when i just decarb sugar myself here at the house i can't just draw it up and put it right into a cartridge i have to add like terpenes to it you can purchase or wax liquidizer that you can buy they cut it with different things so i'm interested they're saying that it just decarb wax but i wonder how they were able to get it to stay this consistency to get it in the cartridge that stuff's very interesting to me but um you see how light this oil is here okay so i showed you how light colored that oil is you saw look at this concentrate from agra kind so that's a darker one okay it's like it's not super dark but you see so i i would think like um that if they decarb that that the oil would be darker from that one you just saw but then it made me think now look at if they're taking concentrates like this here this uh i don't know how well you can see that in it but this was really really white at one point um it kind of darkened up a little bit this is some pandora's box crumble from them and it was super white when i first got it so i'm thinking maybe they're taking like their concentrates that are like crc'd like the color remediation technology that they use um i'm wondering if they take those concentrates possibly and then cook them down like i said decarboxylate them and then make this oil but either way that's my silly science lesson for the day and i probably didn't do too good with it but i did my best you know if you guys did have any questions on decarboxylation or you know anything that i was just explaining you guys can leave it in the comments or follow me on instagram my dms are always open over there it is at pa underscore gurney and i will put a a graphic up for you guys and yeah it's gurney like the the stretcher thingy you know in the hospital gurney it's pretty easy but this is a uh jupiter c cell cartridge that's the the brand i don't know if you guys are going to be able to see that on the bottom there now to me a cartridge a cartridge aficionado i i like uh the jupiter c cells they just hit really good and um i know prime uses them but uh anyways we're going to i'm going to turn on my uni here and what i did is i screwed the bottom attachment from the uni on and then you just drop it in there like that and let's see cheers wow it hits like a mack truck like i'm telling you these jupiter c cell cartridges wow not much flavor at all i'm not gonna lie it is it's almost flavorless i'm shocked i'm shocked with this terpene percentage actually guys 1.4 limonene 1.2 mercedes 1.0 cario it's not crazy terpy like i have uh my here's some pharmaceutical rx cartridges right here truly funky has 6.7 terpenes in it and this chem four one two nine percent terpene so i mean there's probably only about four percent in this one i'd say it has a um a real clean flavor to it let me try it again i still the little one guys i honest to god i can barely even like tell you like what i'm tasting i don't know am i sick am i getting sick or something i don't know but i i'm not getting much flavor off of that guys it is um it hits you in the chest though like that good feeling it um it reminds me of a uh like pharmaceutical rx makes the delta nine cartridges and delta eight cartridges like i'm feeling the effects coming on down the effects are nice i'm feeling that for sure for sure because i only did one dab since i'm home from work tonight um right before this video some african tie but uh i can feel this chilling me out for sure so that's a positive but yeah in the flavor department guys it's somewhat lacking it really is and something that always interests me because you know the cartridges they they say that they wick like it could sit on the shelf and by the time you get it maybe three months later it might look a little less filled because some of the oil absorbs into the inner part of the cart you can't see it then but it looks under filled this one was like filled with a tippy tippy top but what i'm getting at is when you take a big hit then like little bubbles pop out of the uh the ports right here and that's like you could see how much oil you're using up based on like the little bubble that comes out you know i hope i'm making sense but uh one difference i do want to show you guys here this is this is an interesting difference i have a cresco live resin here okay and then i have uh the agrikind so i got both of these here now look at the mouthpieces hopefully you guys can see that but the agrikind one is really really narrow and small and the cresco one you see is a little wider so not a huge difference but something i thought i'd point out to you guys so i'm gonna wrap this video up here i guess guys because i mean there's really not much else to be said about it it's uh the effects seem solid flavor i mean honestly it reminds me of a a distillate cart um i paid how much did i pay for this was it it was 60 and i got a discount so 51 so i think for that price i think it is a little high priced it's kind of like uh reminds me of like um a distillate cartridge that's that's what it reminds me of and i mean that in like a good way you know distillate has its place absolutely i did expect a little more flavor from the cartridge um but maybe that's just this strain you know it could just be the rainmaker strain i'm not sure or maybe i'm getting sick i don't know people might tell me i'm crazy that cartridge tasted great i don't know but to me it doesn't taste all that great and i know for sure like this kosher kush sugar oh my god it tastes amazing and there's uh less terps in this than there is in this cart so it's odd it's odd to me oh there's a funk a funk going on with the rainmaker i'd say like um i don't know the lineage or any genetics in it or anything but um it's funny i pulled out that pandora's box over there and it um that pandora's box had a funk to it man but uh with this flavor-wise they'd say minor bits of funk with uh that distillatey like not i won't say uh is it like chemically i don't know maybe you could say that but um not in a bad way uh yeah if i was rating this on a one to ten scale just to put it real simple for you guys i'd give it a seven if that makes sense on a cartridge scale you know my favorite cartridge of all time being a 10 i'd put this just right about at a seven not horrendous not anything amazing would i buy it again i think i would um if i could get it for about 50 or lower i think 60 dollars too much i'd like to pay right around 40 bucks for this i think that'd be fair 40 bucks for this i think it'd be right on the money so thank you agrikind um for the meds it's always good um always solid people and thank you for getting back to me like that uh so that i can you know come on here and not sound like a lunatic giving crazy information to the patients so uh yeah solid cartridge guys i hope you are having a a good night all this election madness going on and uh oh if you need any uh dabbing supplies

ranting and i'm gonna stop while i'm ahead have a good one guys i deeply appreciate all of you is uh very very much and uh much love sending out to uh", "vZfNT6Mm2UM": "[Music] [Music] hey yo what's up welcome to the thc spot i want to thank everybody that's been subscribing um appreciate your support and everybody has been subscribed since day one um bringing you a cartridge review has been a minute since i checked out some cartridges this is uh antibiotics super dope brand they're out here in l.a now i believe they came from nevada las vegas this is their white walker og half gram goes for about 35 dollars so you could think about putting 35 and 35 equals 70 for a 4 gram of that bomb but i don't think they make four grams this is live resin sauce um i did reach out to them they told me that their white walker og cart is derived from their straight clone indoor plant that they got so it's in-house white walker og this one's testing at 74 percent thc total cannabinoids 80 it tells you the percentage of the terpenes that's four percent meaning it's gonna have a good flavor in there and um this is live resin sauce so it's not distillate you know straight up like resin sauce um but the good stuff the price has it all comes in this crazy little dope box that uh which which i will safety proof like that cartridge looks full on quality slap it on any 510 thread battery so the usual vape batteries they recommend to vape this at at the lowest setting just to get the the good flavor so depending on the battery that you got make sure to put it on the lowest so this one's like at five volts right now with like 150 degrees so this is it little half gram cartridge of their own they got the brand in there super dope aesthetic the look is good and uh now let's go ahead and slap it on there to see if the flavor is good um i've reviewed a couple of their carts they're all on my channel um i've never been dissatisfied always always happy with the product so you can expect to get some good stuff from antibiotics their flowers are super good that means with their concentrates everything good reputable brand for sure check them out here we go white walker og oh wait a minute forgot to check to see if this was uh oh yeah indica perfect indica so here we go all right all right all right pretty tasty antibiotics straight tastes like sauce i'll tell you that for sure very smooth um vapor production is there not harsh at all white walker og straight cerebral effect right away um i feel like i'm taking a dab from a rig at a very low temperature so that's a good sign the terpenes on this tastes really good straight up marijuana terpenes so you ain't got to worry about and any cuts the lid cutting out all the pg and vg all the uh additives that you shouldn't be putting in your lungs you gotta go with that natural stuff you know so very fun very bomb the flavor is unique the potency is there um definitely different for it being a cartridge um live resin meaning it's from a frozen plant i definitely give this a give this its full approval pretty good stuff bomb very danky and it's pulling yeah now i'm feeling it good job antibiotics so you bump into them in your dispensary or you're looking to go try it out try them out you won't be disappointed a little bit more expensive than the usual but you get what you pay for so i hope you got uh what you are looking for in this video and um once again thank you for all my new subscribers appreciate your support thank you and uh have a nice day", "76etd8Ye6BA": "[Laughter] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another nug product video so yeah we got an authentic bag right here i paid 41 out the door for this shopping mall so yeah let's just see how much should i pay yes 40. 40 99 you see that for a full gram cartridge not bad not bad so this is ambrosia this is their nug live resin line and uh yeah as you can see in the back all that good stuff the the percentages i believe it's uh eighty percent exactly well not exactly but that's what they put it and also the manufacture date and all that stuff is uh fairly new about three three months old so not bad date of manufacture is a bit older i think april so but got the nug family i haven't had a nug cartridge in a while i've only had one of their cartridges i forgot what strain it was but i just remember that it was a actually a pretty pleasant experience um i did enjoy it and it lasted pretty long so i'm excited to try this other one and uh let's just see if i can find my battery all right so if you didn't know by now i lost my chill battery i dropped it in the hole when we went to sf you should have seen that video by now but it's unfortunate but we got the press slide right here so you just okay well it's a ceramic heating core as well so that's pretty dope and also nugg.com if you guys want to check them out so just pull it out to use attack wow okay you got the logo right there let's do a little box little thumbnail action hopefully it's getting it go up go down right there so we're going to be hitting it in my dash vape retro you guys already know the deal and uh yeah this is looking pretty good i'm not gonna lie screw that bad boy in let me know if you've tried nug before like i said i've tried it only once and i really enjoyed it it lasted really long compared to these other cartridges so uh i'm pretty excited let's see i haven't used this battery in a while i've been using my chill one so cheers boys oh very very smooth you can you can tell that ceramic heating oil works because i do not taste no burning sensation very very smooth hit it's very very comparable to an erza i'm not gonna lie wow let me take that hit again this is the ambrosia by the way cheers boys that's a blinker for a blinker it's not as fat hits that i'd uh i'd normally see from other live resin cartridges um but the taste is there wow i feel like i could probably like do a five second hit and then a blinker and that will do a pretty decent size hit which is what i'm gonna do so hold on oh there you go wow that is really enjoyable so would i like i said what i remember from the other nug is that it lasts longer than other cartridges so i'm hoping this one lasts just as long because i'm really enjoying the flavor here uh for 41 dollars is generally the price of what you get from typical live resin cartridges uh except for the exception of urza which is like 55 to 60. but this is good i'm not gonna lie like i'm honestly it's one of the better tasting live resins that i've tried lately lately and uh i don't know where i'm gonna be placing this but i know it's on my top five nug is definitely on my top five uh from my last top five video i said i believe it was four or three um i just feel like maybe buddies edged it out a little bit because they had more of a selection and it's a bit cheaper but this taste like i've been on a bad roll right now of buying products and not liking it and honestly i'm kind of happy that i bought this uh this was like the only one in the display that they had left that authentic so i knew that maybe out of all the strains that they had of the nut cartridge that this one was the one that was chose the most and honestly i'm glad i chose this wow i'm really enjoying this and look at it i think i barely even touched it and i just did maybe like two three blinkers maybe two let me take another hit for you guys so like i said the hints aren't going to be as fat for you know blinkers on other live resin cartridges but not [ __ ] bad not [ __ ] bad i'm probably gonna take two more hits off of this and then and then we're just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed this video if you haven't tried nut cartridges i've tried two out of i've tried two of them so far and it's been two out of two [ __ ] a hit so uh i'm gonna take two more hits like i said cheers boys enjoyable so also i'll post the link to this battery if you guys are interested in that i believe the cheapest that i've seen it was like 15 to 20 i don't know and then there's obviously uh shipping involved but nonetheless very very good battery from daz vape shout out to them always supporting me um yeah just uh i don't know i'm happy about this cartridge right now i'm ecstatic that i bought this cartridge i was gonna buy another buddy's cartridge because i did lose my buddy's cartridge i was gonna buy another train wreck but then i was like let's just try something new and a nug well it's not totally new because i've done a video on their their uh i forgot what strain it was but it was a good strain i'm gonna take another hit for you the last hit and then we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video you know like it subscribe if you haven't already if you want to and yeah i'll take this hit cheers boys all right guys peace out [Music] [Music] you", "ZFyVScdiSIQ": "hey if you're under 18 and you just somehow managed to stumble across this channel um i want you guys to click off this video just do me that favor click off this video but for those who are 18 and up this is an educational purpose channel only about cannabis and for cannabis patients so without further ado let's get big high go get some snacks and let's just vibe out together see i don't even know if y'all can see me but uh welcome back guys we're here at uh main stage this is like their side building at uh what's it called broadway i've noticed that i've been cussing a lot recently in my videos and like that's like a like i got a potty mouth you know what i'm saying so i'm gonna try to cut it down because like genuinely i had another channel it's called chaos realms k-a-o-s-r-e-l-m-g i'll just write it up here and uh what's it called i cuss a lot bro but like what's it called i'll be dropping f-bombs like left to right but we're gonna pull up to main stage we're already here no intro you feel me just welcome back to another video back again but uh we're gonna go ahead and cop that ursa cart so i'll be right back so we just made it back to um or we just made it back from main stage you feel me i did a little bit of homework and then i had to go to like the [ __ ] junkyard or whatever to throw away some [ __ ] so now we're back now we got we're here from uh main stage remember when i said it was on broadway from sacramento well it is it's a neighborhood dispensary all that goodness all that good stuff you know so let's go ahead and see what we got because it's not just any normal car i think it's like i'm assuming it's a um it's a uh ceramic cart because it was like white or some [ __ ] but uh i don't know if it says right here but anyways here it is we got the [ __ ] ursa cartridge now this is one of the cartridges that i'm [ __ ] hyped as [ __ ] to try out because like i've been seeing a whole bunch of reviews on it and with the with the aircraft being so flavorful and apparently the ursas are pretty [ __ ] flavorful too i think about it man like this one's the uh cherry diesel and it's rating at a 72.9 percent thc with zero cbd the package date was uh what's it called september 8th uh best buy september 8th 2021 so they usually have a year life um shelf life they usually have a year shelf life there you go and liquid diamond size card so this is the first time i'm ever gonna try one of these and the first time i'm ever gonna try something with diamonds in it basically but here's the receipt if you go in on monday through wednesday uh from 10 am to one you get like a 10 off so i pulled up it was 50 but then with taxes and everything came out to 53 so shout out to main stage man it came out of 53 and went from 50 to 53 that's basically three bucks tax right there pretty much basically oh holy [ __ ] oh i thought i was gonna say some diamonds no cap damn i didn't even get to see there's no diamonds in here on the box it says uh less than a two volt battery recommended but i guarantee you we're gonna break that rule today all right before we plug it in we have to taste it and i already tasted it i'm not gonna lie let me just tell you something right now the airflow on this like i said on the air graft it's impeccable like that all right so there all right let me compare these two products just real quick so this one's a liquid diamond this is just a live resin right and thing about this [ __ ] is that it it's like you have to draw pretty hard to actually like get the smoke to come out but with this i don't know if you can hear it but just the airflow is crazy you know so uh let's go ahead and put this up on the battery uh let's see where is it at and oh yeah by the dry head too to be honest with you i'm not even getting that much there's like a i don't know if it's because it's not heated up yet but there's like a little subtle taste i can't describe it almost like a like a pastry of some sort like a sweet kind of thingy and like a chocolatey thing i don't know why but it feels like there's like chocolate in it i don't know how to describe it so let's go ahead and hook this up on the ooze and click that double setting so we just connected it up on the ooze and let's go ahead and turn it on i didn't even realize it didn't even turn it on but uh let's go ahead double click it get it heated up and while it's heating up let me compare this [ __ ] with the aircraft right quick so this is a full gram let me stop it right now but this is a full gram whereas this is a half gram and i filmed this video on saturday which was the sixth i believe no no today's the seventh sixth five fourth it was like the third when i did the review and it still tastes good but i don't know if you can see but literally this [ __ ] is gone like it's gone like there's like a pube left at the bottom well i mean it's still like a little puddle but like come on air graph you got to make something that lasts longer at least make full gram carts or do like a two half gram for like 75 i guess i don't know like do like a little combo or something but that that didn't disappoint me on the flavor i'm not gonna lie let's go ahead take a hit [Music] for some reason it's not a it's not hitting through the battery all right so i'm just gonna let it like preheat on the setting so uh let's just let it [ __ ] be because i think i don't know if it's like the thing is too cold if it's like too too live resin if that's even like a [ __ ] justifiable answer but uh hopefully hopefully that that worked hopefully that little preheating worked dude hold on i think i got scammed bro hold on do i need to screw it in like all the way to the max yeah so the problem was i didn't have it screwed in all the way but um it's because so the last battery you had is screwed it in too tight and like there's like a little plate at the bottom of like these like uh 510 threads and um like usually it's like uh if you press down on it too hard it'll like stop the battery from working and that's what happened to my previous battery but it was just the whole entire battery that stopped working not just a little plate but uh that's fun fact that's what happens if you screw in your cart to uh what's it called too tight you'll [ __ ] up your battery i couldn't really get that much flavor off the first hit tasted pretty uh phenomenal though but couldn't really get much um much recognition if that makes sense [Music] no cap when i do like that ghost inhale through my nose it has like a [ __ ] like a foul ass like like a gassy i guess like a literally like it says diesel like literally like it smells like some [ __ ] type of like a some [ __ ] that you shouldn't even sniff bro like smells pretty strong you know the name diesel in this [ __ ] i don't know if it's because it's like a type i don't know if it's because it's a 3.3 and it's supposed to be under a tubal that i'm not getting that much taste but i'm getting a lot of um smell from it if that makes sense like it goes in through my nose i'm not really tasting nothing let me go ahead get some water real quick i don't know how to describe it like i'm not getting that much of a uh sweet taste like i know on weed maps i think it said something about [ __ ] sweet but i do get like kind of like a funk on it you know what i'm saying like when you it's not necessarily like a taste like the taste i'm not really tasting nothing really but i'm smelling it like i can taste it with my nose basically you know what i'm saying like sniff it and then it coats my mouth but it's mainly just like a stink you know what i'm saying like a guess like a diesel i've never had any diesel strains not really getting that much flavor dead ass i don't know if it's because [Music] like literally it does not taste like anything but like besides like that gassy funkness you know what i'm saying like you don't get nothing from like uh like nothing really you really don't besides like what i said like it smells kind of like like funky you don't really get no uh like a sweet flavor like how this one managed to do like the aircraft you could [ __ ] taste everything with that [ __ ] bro but i i what i really want to say that it's because of the battery so i'm gonna have to redo this whole video will not redo but [ __ ] segment it either to another day or i might just upload this video as it is in conclusion man this cartridge i don't want to say was a waste because obviously the 3.3 and it literally tells you on the packaging use a less than a 2 volt battery so i really don't want to say it's the the card itself because [Music] off them dry hits you get some i guess some like aromatic um what's it called like a bliss of [ __ ] like uh just like a bliss of like a i did get a [ __ ] sweet bliss of like [ __ ] i don't want to say like cherries but maybe well actually probably like cherries like you do you actually on the dry heads to be exact you do get like a sweet maybe like a cherry like i'm not really feeling the cherry like i can feel something sweet it does kind of feel like fruity but it feels more like a flowery type of not like a wheat flour but like a like you just smell some sweet flowers you know what i'm saying like that's what it feels like it tastes not not no cherry i could kind of see the cherry now but it's more like that flowery sweet maybe with a little bit of cherry that's all i have to say maybe but to me personally it's like kind of sweet and then i guess you get that diesel vibe which is what i was talking about kind of like when i was saying chocolaty i guess kind of chocolatey like earthy you know what i'm saying so guys i started to connect the dots right i was like it's more like a baked good but it's also kind of chocolatey so it's like like a earthy taste if i'm saying like this [ __ ] got me faded like i'm tweaked but yeah like i guess i got earthy and um definitely when you smell it a gassy ass [ __ ] taste or gassy smell but really the flavor profile is mainly based off of these dry heads and it's very subtle let me let me try something real quick yo can you see like past my head let me see kind of i guess that was like a weird way of measuring it but like i hope that's like steady you know what i'm saying but like i said after really the only flavor profiling is from the dry hit now i brought the water for a special occasion and that is when you taste bud to me personally i feel like i don't know if it's just like an effect in my head maybe like some randomized [ __ ] like thought that came across my mind but i feel like if you are to hit this right like it usually happens to me with flour i've noticed this a lot is i take a hit i got the bong to be exact and then i drink some water and you get i guess it activates like a bigger flavor profile this is like a theory but this is like i personally feel like it's the way it should work right so you ever had candy like a jolly rancher and just hit like you're finished with it and then you're just chilling and then you drink water and then you taste that jolly rancher taste like it's subtle taste but it's there that's what water i think does with the terpene so we're gonna go ahead and see if this is like genuinely how it works like this feels like it should work because this usually happens to me when i be smoking flour when i was smoking on when i was smoking on the antibiotics the blueberry i didn't really taste it at first well through the joints i did but on the long ribs not really so what i did was i drink water and i'd get like a sweet like node kind of so let's go ahead just let's take a swig and let's take a hit [Music] let's take another swig actually another hit [Music] all right so i don't know if it's just because it's a flower that i did get the taste or if it's because of the cartridge but i didn't really get [ __ ] from that either so let's go ahead and so from this in conclusion all right this [ __ ] battery is like eyes all right this is all i gotta say so if i'm going to do this review on this ursa card i got to get like a two-volt battery because like i'm getting some taste at the 3.3 but it's like like literally on the past hits you know the one where it [ __ ] came out my nose in the second hit i couldn't really taste like i could taste like that subtleness this [ __ ] is hidden and um i do get that like taste you know what i'm saying like that uh what i was talking about earlier earlier i [ __ ] i'm [ __ ] tweaking but what i was talking about earlier it was kind of like blossomy kind of now i get someone like cherry but i'ma still stick like i can see the cherriness because i can taste it but i can also taste that blossomy like sweetness like a flowery blossomy sweet so i'm just gonna say like here's the cherry here's a blossomi we're just gonna [ __ ] bam in the [ __ ] middle you feel me so it's gonna be just in the middle dead shot so once if you ever try this cart that's what it tastes like it tastes like in between a cherry and like a blossoming thingy and like i said like an earthy gassy like diesely [ __ ] like smell like burn kind of but literally dead ass the reasoning as to why i didn't really get much flavors mainly because of the battery and because i really want to put this video out of me trying a ursa cart i'm not going to say that this [ __ ] is ass but i am going to say that this [ __ ] is [ __ ] amazing you could taste the flavor like an insane amount of flavor on this [ __ ] man whereas on this you really can't to me personally i don't know if there's something out of my palate today but i'm gonna genuinely blame the battery now this isn't oozes fall for not because like it's a 3.3 battery this isn't oozes fall this is like a default like thingy and you can change the voltage it's mainly because this is more of like a [ __ ] like a low temp car or low temp battery and if i was able to put this in here then i genuinely would and i would get a better [ __ ] flavor profile but we're gonna have to uh do another video except with a different battery shoot all right so i know i said in the last segment that i was gonna [ __ ] um just i was gonna [ __ ] get a new battery get something that will like fit the [ __ ] cartridge but i realized that if you [ __ ] double click it it actually heats the car at a lower temperature than it has i'm assuming that it heats it at a 2.0 volt which is like i guess the minimal amount that you can taste the taste but like if you want the maximum flavor profile you got to get that 1.8 battery and i was gonna i was going to cop the [ __ ] ursa battery but that [ __ ] was just like too expensive bro like if [ __ ] main stage had that [ __ ] i would have copied but they don't i'd have to go to another [ __ ] place and they charge you [ __ ] 30 bucks for that battery that i'm only gonna use on ursa carts maybe even buddies cards but i don't really know of any places that dispense buddies so uh and i heard that they're good so we're gonna have to [ __ ] soon try that [ __ ] so let's go ahead and connect this [ __ ] up and i'll hit y'all guys in a [ __ ] bit you know all right so here it is you already know it's already [ __ ] connected and right out the packaging i started to notice that it does smell like weed more i cheat this thing a couple of times but like when i first unboxed it you didn't really smell nothing you really just smell like basically what it tastes like damn near except you don't get that sweet like cherry blossomy [ __ ] thingy that i was talking about let's go ahead double click it you already know and i'm just i gotta wait all right yeah so like that flavor profile gotta do it again so honestly man right off the bat i gotta [ __ ] move the smoke everywhere but anyways right off the bat man like like i said you all right so if you do do it at the two volt right off the bat you do somewhat taste that cherry blossom but that like that like gassiness that you smell almost like which you smell the car you taste it more than that little [ __ ] background taste but on a dry head you get that sweet taste so if i do have something underneath the 2 volt battery man i would have [ __ ] reviewed it right on the [ __ ] spot you know what i'm saying but instead i just double clicked it you know got that two two volt i think at least here so i i think that that's what it is because they look at other batteries and they say that they're like two volt on the preheat so um i mean [Music] would i recommend this [ __ ] and like i said in the like the little last segment i don't even know if i'm gonna even put that in because i couldn't even get my word straight but uh i would definitely recommend it for you guys because uh they're just like they're expensive kind of but they're just actually worth the price like 50 bucks for a cart that's what you would pay for like a [ __ ] one gram plug play card and that's like not it you know this that's distillate this is [ __ ] basically as closest to the [ __ ] plan you can get as possible so yeah uh i'm gonna go ahead and preheat it again and we're gonna take another hit so we're just gonna see if we can get more of that flavor back in there i feel like the less vapor you get i feel like the more you taste possibly literally no cap like how i said last time or just like a few seconds ago i guess it's like literally the same thing you know it just has that gassy diesely diesel you know what i'm saying i haven't tried the diesel uh strain at all but it has like a [ __ ] like a cherry blossom sweetness in the back like a gassy taste to it but would i recommend this thing like i said absolutely man this thing is definitely worth it so if you guys have it at your disposal maybe try to get something that's like more of a sativa on the side because i know that sativas are more fruity whereas indicators are more like earthy and like all that fun stuff you notice all that gassiness but this is like right in between like the dry hits you get that sweet but [Music] still get what like the car smells like so uh yeah that's pretty much like the end of this video bro like i hope you guys did enjoy this and uh if you guys are out here in sac make sure to go ahead and visit main stage man like snag up and take advantage of those uh monday through wednesday deals you gotta be there from 10 to one something like that or 11 to 1 and you get like ten percent off so basically if you do the math with taxes and everything it's like um it's legit get the retail price add three bucks on it so like this car was 50 i only paid 53. hope you guys did enjoy this video once again and i do got a really [ __ ] nice banger i'm gonna take my time on this video so if i don't upload for a week not not this one but the video that i'm gonna record today um yeah if it doesn't [ __ ] like if you don't if i don't upload in like a week or so that's because i'm busy with school and work but hopefully if my plans come together i'll give it to you guys by uh next week because this week i'm gonna upload this cartridge review and 100 i'd recommend so hope you guys did enjoy this video make sure to like comment subscribe all that [ __ ] fun [ __ ] and all that stuff that you guys like doing the majority of you guys don't like doing that man 98.3 of the people who watch my channel are not subscribed now 89 or something like that because i looked at it recently but if you're watching this video make sure to subscribe i hope you guys have a good ass day [ __ ] get baked for me man while you're watching these videos and pretty much peace out i hope you guys did enjoy man", "KCz0D8Y0kgY": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive yo what's up ladies and gents and if you're new to the channel my name is shaka x420 and i'm back here for another video guys so today guys it's a new year so new year means new cars and today guys we got two carts from the same company called blue river i'm only gonna try one of these one of them they're both sullivant list carts but one of them is a rosin sauce full spectrum cartridge and the other one is a jelly sauce ultra refined and i'm actually going to try the ultra refined uh live resin first so this is a ultra refined live or it's a ultra refined sauce car actually guys sorry let me let me step back a couple couple steps it's a freaking sauce car guys and it's a chocolate orange fresh baked it says chocolate orange fresh bake on there i don't know if you guys can see it because it won't focus but it's a whole good it's only a half gram because they we're only selling half grams and let me see what we got what's the potency on here so it says it has 11 or no 49 percent terpenes in there um 80 thc four or point fourteen percent cbd for 93.93 total potency so it's not necessarily um [Music] you know full spectrum so you won't get you'll mainly you know you'll get that thc head high mainly probably you probably won't get like a body high too much but still a good still a good freaking i've heard of this brand actually i'm not sure if it's a good brand it's my actually my first time trying it but i've heard this brand is hella good so we're gonna try it out guys and i already took it out of the freaking container because some things are hard to freak it open so here we go and i'm gonna give you guys a close-up real quick before i hit it so you guys see what it looks like let me give you guys a close-up so that's what it looks like guys it's pretty clear has the freaking logo on it ca on there and the tip is more oval so you might be able to hit this out of the bong bowl man so guys this is freaking a jelly sauce cart guy ultra refined it's not a full spectrum like the rosin so you're not going to get all the effects like you would in a live rosin car but here we go put it on the bat real quick so let's test this out guys let's see how good this actually is it's not bad [Music] it's not a bad taste it's actually a pretty good taste i can taste like a citrusy orange type taste to it but not much of the chocolate you know they just put chocolate orange but it's like dank it's pretty dank it has like a dab but with a freaking you know a citrus taste like a citrus aftertaste you feel me but sorry i got up just now guys um i couldn't tell if you guys could see me so i decided to just get up and finish the vlog like this because like the lighting is very bad out here right now i keep getting too much glare and too much sun in my eyes but i hope everyone enjoying the vlog man this blue river is not bad i can't wait to try the rosin we might have to put it up against another rosin maybe i'll put it up against lowell maybe i'll get a low well rosin cart and put it up against lowell because we got the rosin cart too but right now we're just trying out the the sauce cart it's pretty good though guys like [Music] like like all sullivan sullivan list carts sorry if i said the word wrong but all sullivan liz carsman they're smooth as [ __ ] guys they're smooth as [ __ ] [ __ ] and this one's smooth as [ __ ] tastes hella good man and it's just [Music] but i'm just chilling guys bad i had to hit you guys with a reviewed i hope everyone's having a good weekend a good

just depends on how many people pop up you know [Music] so if you made it to this far in the vlog guys don't forget to like comment subscribe more vlogs coming more carts coming man this blue river [ __ ] is actually pretty damn freaking good but it's pretty expensive a half gram i think it was like 30 40 bucks a half gram so it's pretty expensive but you're getting sullivan liz product guys and i feel like all probably should be solventless man i don't trust that i don't trust the processes that they use to make concentrate sometimes guys but you know not saying that the products aren't good man because there's good ass products out there um that aren't solventless but solventless man it's just tastes smoother than me so that's just my thoughts guys man talk to you guys soon see you guys soon see you guys in the live you know what it is peace you can zoom in whatever [Music] you don't like what you see so you rub up on my energy i just wanna be me smoking on the end of wheat so i just

"w0_1bXksiUM": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive yo what's up guys back here for another video and your boys back here with another freaking cart review slash versus guys i haven't tried these too strange in so long so your boy had to try him um the homie he picked up and he's just been you know collecting a lot of cars so you boy had to you know hop on and he let me try the bezel so shout out to the homie you already know see get yourself a homie who got cards that you can review you feel me and try out you feel me so we got the nug and the nug is a big sur it's a live resin and then the bezel it's actually called bezel i think i said bezel earlier it's actually called bezel it's a sauce cart and this one is actually i think higher in terpenes and stuff than this other cart and it's actually it's also um made using butane actually i read it on the side in their ingredients but it also says it's high in terpenes so we're going to check that out see how good it is it's a a disc chill it with terpenes basically turns it into sauce i guess but the other one is more of a live resin so sauce versus live resin you kill me but um let me give you guys a close-up this is uh what the bezel comes in like a tube comes in a pretty big box but they only sell uh half grams so if you guys are in the full grams you're probably gonna end up having to buy two they haven't made a full gram cartridge of this yet but you know what it's all good let me take a hit before i even open up this other package hope everyone's smoking right now i'm smoking on um the rest of the absolute extracts the orange creamsicle freaking fire we're going to turn this temp up i know y'all like seeing them clouds because y'all like seeing a brother cough i let a lot of that get away but y'all saw me but um as you can see it's hard to get these shits open with one hand but it's all good the bigger one is the nug it has their little symbol on if you can see it you can barely see it but as you can see the sauce cart it's a little lighter and that's just because it has distillates and the terpenes you know it's not enough to make it super dark but it makes it dark the terpenes i'm pretty sure is what makes it darker but it looks good it's a nice little i don't know what kind of i don't know but you know it's pretty much the same as nug it's just another is a little bit darker but they're both kind of an amberish color this one's more yellow though you know what i'm saying but um we're gonna try out the nut first just because i am a nug fan over basil so we're gonna try snug first shout out to nug if y'all haven't seen um i made a video on their dispensary so go check that out um and also i did a review on one of their freaking fire ass products called thc a if you guys haven't seen that i'll try and put it in the top of the screen but don't be mad if it's not the top of the screen just go through my vlogs check me out watch it man you guys will catch a [ __ ] vibe all right cheers guys enough time let's see if i can take a blinker hit we'll see it's on a very high temp right now so i don't know if i can bam what street big sur i don't know what [Music] what freaking strains they use flower wise but it definitely has like a um let me taste it one more time guys hold on i give you exact what i think in my brain what it tastes like i don't know i feel like it has like a little taste but it's not necessarily sweet but it's definitely just like super dank because it's not guys it's live resin you guys already know that but it tastes super smooth like it's not harsh really at all you already know it's freaking it's amazing like nuggets probably one of my top live resins that i would get and one day i'm gonna do like at the end of the year when it's a new year guys i'm thinking about showing you guys all my product so tell me if you guys want that vlog showing you all the products that i did um that i smoked this year and telling you guys which ones i thought were the top best ones because i feel like in some of my vlogs i don't necessarily you know tell you guys oh this is better or this one's better because some people like different things and i want people to try things you know think for yourself you feel me because i'm not an influencer guys i i'm just gonna put that out there right now i don't want to be called an influencer if anything the thing the message that i want you guys to get is to think on your [ __ ] selves you know but um shout out to you guys let me take over here before i try this sauce yeah that shit's a hit man that's just to hit you turn the temp down and try oh yeah let me turn the temp down and like maybe i could taste it better that's facts i forgot see this is the honey stick that i used to have guys you've seen it in um vlogs before but mine broke or got stolen one of those i can't remember but hey it's almost 10. it's a little tip and we're high as [ __ ] but um let's see what it tastes like on low temp because low temp guys this is what people need to understand like yes it's cool to have big clouds get that fat head get loaded as [ __ ] hella quick whatever but it's also cool to just gradually get high and take low temp hits because you actually get the flavor of the strain that you won't you know that you're smoking like that's why it would be dope to you know vaporize but you know it's just a lot of vaporizers that i want like the volcano are super expensive because i would honestly bake the bud get high you know and then use the vape bud to make edibles or something but we're gonna try it on low temp [Music] i don't know it don't almost taste like uh like a cake like plain by itself you know what i mean i don't know if you got like just you know like pound cake or something i don't that's just me you traced in i don't know you i don't know maybe i'm wrong it has something in there like a certain taste to it that i feel like but it is dank as [ __ ] mainly it's just like a super dang dab taste but it has a taste to it i feel like what do you think [Music] dude i could taste this sauce it almost tastes like like lemon cake see i'm saying it's like a i feel you it's like lemony or something bro i'm puffing on this right now and like it tastes sweet as [ __ ] take a puff on that the sauce tastes sweet as hell when you puff on it right now like don't you think holy [ __ ] like i think this might have this might win no no we ain't gonna say that yet we're gonna say that yet hold on let's switch it up [Music] and i'm not the biggest fan of these tops because like you can end up seeing the oil there but these tops because they're circle they're good for taking bong hits you know if you don't have like the tool to smoke your boners so cheers guys we're gonna taste this on low temp because it tasted super fruity like it had like flavor to it guys so we're gonna see what it tastes like [Music] damn bro [Music] this [ __ ] is good guys holy [ __ ] i'm trying to match the flavor on this [ __ ] bro it's like um like a like i see like i don't know [Music] it's like a sherbert you guys can barely see the vapor probably because it's on low temp but it tastes like freaking sherbet or something taste it real quick tell me i'm telling you bro flavorful papaya papaya okay papaya what which one is this dude this is the the miss usa this is miss usa guys sorry i did not say in the vlog you guys probably can't see that but it says miss usa and it's an indica hybrid slash hybrid so it's a hybrid probably dominant indica or indica dominant you turned up 10 a little bit [Music] all right guys this this bezel is is giving nug a run for their money not not trying to dis nug but you have to see it like this guys the bezel is a distillate that's high in terpenes nug is a live resin so it's not a fair comparison because they don't add anything you're not you don't really add anything to librarian some brands do like um i'm trying to think like buddies they add terpenes to their live resins but um i don't think nug adds any terpenes to their live resin i'ma look at the ingredients [Music] they might have terps in it but it's like maybe low in it low in terps but um this freaking diesel actually tastes freaking fire you gotta try this strain exactly guys miss usa try this straight exactly i'm gonna take um a couple more hits for you guys and i'm gonna dip out and just chill you know gotta chill a little bit you know you know spend time with homie talk a little bit and you know maybe have some high moments some high thoughts guys tell me if you guys want to hear our high thoughts video comment below if you guys want to see a video about just my high thoughts or some [ __ ] we've been like me and the homie been thinking about it so maybe we'll just jot some things down that we said because we say some like crazy freaking [ __ ] that's just like what the hell high thoughts guys like i thought but let me take a rip real quick [Music] damn yeah this cart i'm buying this car soon i'm buying this car soon guys but um i hope everyone enjoyed this video new vlog coming soon probably in a couple of days literally after this vlog drops um finally 2 000 subs guys so i already told you guys i'm telling you guys in every video bong giveaway coming soon um honestly you should just go follow me on instagram shaka x420 because it's probably gonna be giving away on a live video but i'm also going to be dropping a dope video um to thank you guys for getting me to 2000 um you guys will see that video i think i talked about what i wanted to do in that video and you guys will see what really goes down so i'm gonna take this last hit and then i'm gonna get out of here guys [Music] peace [Music]", "-LOgUO7XJMU": "[Music] what's up guys simply secure and back with another video we got our NJ takes a picture Jimmy no RJ eats subscribe to the home he's about 580 right now let's get him to 600 should be a easy goal you know I'm saying but this is not about RJ even though he's in here subscribe to him but but if you couldn't tell from the title it is another buddy's cartridge and this is by far the cheapest live resin cart that I was able to get my hands on I did give money to Randy cuz he stopped by the club yesterday and he bought it for me I've been mowing him the money and he got it from me but this is buddies and this was for 30 to 50 and this is about the cheapest live resin car I've ever like received or not received but and yeah I've tried buddy's before so nothing like special or new here but it is a new strain it is a lien push can you open it hold on we're gonna have a Randy open it not right now I'm gonna oh it shows the back first so these are the terpenes that are on there as you know with buddies and you can see right there on the right it says manufactured April 3rd that's by April 3rd 2021 all that good stuff you know just talking a monoids 280 7.39 on that alright let's go just get this pop oh and baby just come of it yeah so you can see very similar to the select cartridge I've had a buddy's cartridge before guys so hold on thumbnail right here hey there we go all right my ugly askin to or not it's a bad habit but a lot of people do and trying to start the bad [ __ ] done better anyways but you can see right here it's very much similar to the cartridge type of select but this is alien cush so I'm interested to see if this tastes like [ __ ] uh thank the lemon salt stuff that everything's been tasting like I hope not even though I like the taste of that is not bad it's just you know I'm kind of like all right kind of taste something different so was the first time you tried buddy's cars only like five four or five months ago so I've had it before they definitely run out quick these cartridge types the they go out quick turn it off we're gonna take a blinker so they don't last as usual as long as like a water and probably like a short like a day or two earlier it would run out on me but cheers boys popping a session below what you guys just smoking up let us know man always keep us updated to keep us in the mix we want to know man you know I saw some strains you guys are commenting on the other day kind of forgot honestly all the names oh well that's a hitter and yes the cartridge hits and apparently it says these are ceramic coil carts as well so that's a that's probably why it tastes very very much it's a tasty experience that's probably like looking resort so a real stoner high then this is the wood good starter huh just good tastes good it doesn't taste like the light like like an OG Kush it is alien Kush you know so it definitely has the more flour taste and then the more citrusy taste that you would generally get from sativas or everything else on the market you know saying but that was a good hair right yeah excuse me boys let me take another hit and we're probably gonna call it a video after he gets another hit and he's gonna do a blinker no blinker I got not beat so hot from the room that had a good level huh just so you guys don't think don't believe me with the 3250 program I'm gonna show you it's a dirty price huh for live resin that's a very good price and you know this this video is not gonna come out until like a week or two so I don't know if they're still gonna have it but I will show you the proof right now just so you guys believe me and it's not all talk you might make the drive from where you're at just to get like you know she's in product yeah so 32:54 the alien cushion 30 to 50 for the blue skittles as well so cheering yeah but yes stay tuned we're also gonna be doing another video with money I know you guys have been requesting money or aka be cheapened because he can take fat hits that hits the ones that you like to see you know I'm saying like he will take those packets and yeah my homie don't give a [ __ ] so I'm gonna take one more hit how do you like this cartridge so far 8250 would you buy it and consider buying it for 30 to 50 yes I would anything higher than that probably not it was more than 40 I probably not go ahead and buy a cart unless I know it was beating some fire I'm saying this is I don't know definitely it you can spend basically happy oh yeah you can split that in half in at 2 grabs with some wax spend another $3 each you know on each one you get some decent good wax yeah but as a cartridge person once again he's getting price on the cartridge yeah I'd buy it for that price that's a good-ass price on the it for grams - that's not you're spending like half a gram sometimes almost at same price for even just a little less so that already tells you that's a good purchase you know yeah yeah definitely what's go in and buy something like that if I was looking to buy a car okay that's good to hear we are gonna end the video here guys hopefully you enjoyed it subscribe all that good stuff like the video if you enjoyed it subscribe to rj eats and see you guys the next one [Music]", "ZQImEJ1zG9w": "[Music] yo yo what's up guys it's your boy savage back yet again with another review for you guys if you guys didn't know every Friday we try to come out with the banger card tree bu dropping is what is the hottest on the market right now what am i using you know what's poppin what's not and usually we try out some of the best stuff and sometimes we get really really unlucky and end up with some crappy cartridges but for today's video men this video has been a long awaited video I've had a lot of viewers telling me go try this you need to try them they're the best in the market and you know your boy after long time in the works we finally got it coming to you guys so tell you boys without further ado we are gonna be reviewing friendly farms true full spectrum live resin cartridges true full spectrum boys you guys heard that right so for those of you that don't know or have ever heard of friendly farms they're a company based out of them it's where is it somewhere somewhere in San Francisco I believe and they started off just I think they started off from what I believe when I first started following him they were making these sauces and they were popping off man you know that was big and then they switched over to UM cartridges they have dabba related applicators you know all that good stuff and they're just killing it man they're just killing it so after you know having my viewers tell me you guys a guy that I needed to try this I obviously went out hit him up and they were super super nice and generous meant to be like yes for sure ma'am you work together we kind of want you to try it out because they even themselves believe that this is some of the best stuff on the market so I was like kind of happy you know it's good working with the company that that is so friendly you know it's just in their name so what they did though this isn't just a normal you know here's our product give us a good review this guy was like here's our product men give give the gift that make the video and give the people a real review don't sugarcoat it know that stuffin you already know your boy ain't sugarcoating [ __ ] so we're gonna get into this man way to be reviewing some of the best stuff so before we get into this video though they dropped the one new product it's it's not new Prada just a different style and it is hold on hold on one of the worried is that we're gonna lose in truck so it is this one right here so this right here is their cured resin cartridges so basically going to offer their Instagram this is what this is what their cured car cured resident cartridges right so our fresh cured liquid is just like our liquid live except this oil is made from cured cannabis plants rather than freshly frozen as with all friendly forms product zero additives zero dis list so you guys know for sure you you're not you don't have to worry about vitamin E may you don't have to worry about all this fake BS stuff that can possibly get you harm and when when you guys are smoking distillate I just hope you guys know that that you you don't know what's going on because distillate they're adding they're adding additives or added preservatives all this stuff to try to make that oil you know vapor Bowl dude and these guys what they're doing is just straight-up squishing the plant just adding it to a cartridge and shipping it out to you guys and of course your lab testing and all that good stuff so you guys know that you guys are getting some of the top-notch quality like in the game right now that's for sure so without further ado man all that rambling I think it's time we get into the cartridge tasting right so busting out a new battery full unboxing for you guys man so these are their batteries right here the this battery right here has three different heat settings it has a low heat as a medium heat and as a high heat all right so taking it out boo you get your charger in there all that good stuff but I think this is my favorite part right so hopefully this is focused in for you guys and give it a little second but when you turn it on a little rainbow colors so badass right so like I said the three different color settings I'm not really going to get in it's every every battery has has variable wattage at this point but this specific battery is you know prioritized for their own cartridges they give you the best temps and it actually it's actually pretty amazing dude because instead of just having one temperature like most [ __ ] cartridge batteries they switch it up with three and every single eight all three of them is a super different here I'm not even joking you could get a very very subtle hit with the lowest one and then with the high hit you get like a massive dab so that's something that you know how is very very happy with and actually you know what this is the cured resin we're gonna hop I have not tried the cure guys and I have not tried the cured resident all and I have tried the liquid life but I think I'm gonna try a new flavor so this one right here is dude these guys are killing also with the collabs man they've been doing collabs with connecting cannabis and they'd have been doing cold eyes with alien lab so if you guys are fans of those companies already you guys should definitely try out these man because it's literally just the the connected and alien labs cannabis just squished up and put into these cartridges man like friendly farms is doing their thing bro killing the cartridge game so look at this look at this packing around me show you guys the packaging because I feel like not a lot of you know what it looks like so hopefully that's focused in and yeah dude so in the fact that got the lab test results all that good stuff on the on the top they got the manufacturing date all that goody-goody and let's go ahead pull this sucker and then all this way to grow I need to smoke so white to all that good stuff and boom the black tip cartridge so before I get into the actual cartridge I'm gonna show you guys what comes in the box so in the Box you get this little paper right here it pretty much tells you how to use it how to get started with using your cartridge all the good stuff of how it's made why does it my cartridge to look full because as you guys can see right here there's a little gap but it has a lot to do with these cartridges and you know the headspace that it gives you and so this is the most important thing this is the most important thing that's cotton atten before but I haven't really looked into it and I think I might tell you the truth man because this is something pretty amazing I haven't really seen a lot of companies do it it says for every gear for every grand purchase $1 goes to a homeless or youth program in your community and it says thank you thank you you know what man thank you for any farms for being so friendly miss you got to have more companies like them and people who care about the community other than just make it a quick buck and that's something that you know says a lot it says a lot from a company so enough with the BS talking does it get this get the chief and boys so this one right here is the animal style if you guys have ever had the animal style but from connected cannabis it actually looks pretty [ __ ] crazy slap it on there so it's on the green setting I didn't even use it on the green setting right so first look into the animal style friendly farms cartridge Braille collab so let's get it boys hopefully you guys are enjoying the content so far go ahead and leave a like comment subscribe all that good stuff man it helps you boy more than you think and if you guys haven't already man go check these go check this company out if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you already know that the oh man some of the best of the best in the game cheers boys don't fail not sure why they didn't work all right I don't know what was wrong with the other battery but I think it was dead so we put it on a new battery he got it fully charged all the good stuff still on the green setting so let's go ahead and boys first in first try of this animal style so I'm actually pretty excited tell you guys to choose so let's get into oh my goodness oh my goodness well that was like a dad boys oh we did a good thing I need to take a big hit because not that was gonna kill me right immediately immediately off the bat boys the reviews coming in hot get ready so me off the first hit I haven't smoked at all I haven't done anything so I'm already getting a head change in my eyes are getting low I already feel it that's something that you instantly want from the cartridge you don't want to be having to puff and puff until you actually feel something so off of the initial rip your boy is gone no I'm not going but I don't want to say so that taste of that taste was like a really really really like medium to low temp dab just really really tasty in the oil and not even I'm not even talking about like do you know how when you taste distillate you can taste like the oil like this is this is like a good oil man this is like something you really want to tell you so see it's fire dude all right all right let's take another hit and get a full flavor profile see what the effects are going on then what is this I think this is a hybrid right all right this is a hybrid I'm hoping that it's a little bit more indica dominant than any you know animal style seems more like a sativa by the name mmm all right boys Cheers oh man that thing just opens up the pathways bill that literally the lung expansion is immediate and it's smooth it's so smooth like it's smooth but it makes you want to coughs just because you know your lungs are so full your lungs are so full with the greatness oh man in the excel it's just like a relief of stress but when you're exhaling it just like exhale you guys ever heard the term of inhale the good [ __ ] exhale the [ __ ] someone probably was chief in this and made up that quote because this is what it's doing and oh my gosh I'm just in awe dude this is amazing an amazing feeling it went from straight-up head to a full body in full head and I'm just in straight-up chill mode man after a long day of work man this is definitely something enjoyable something I look forward to chiefing on you know with most other cartridges I'm not gonna lie it's like it's there you know you have it you could just have bought it the other day but do you want to hit it probably not what this literally as soon as you can you you're gonna hit it row as soon as you get that a single opportunity to hit this bad boy you will I'm in complete love man there's these days we're gonna have to taste another one so this is a hybrid let's move on to the I think we're gonna move on to another hybrid well no wrong with the sativa so tan G tan G is one of the og strains in the game if you guys don't know the hand she's been around for a while I think oh you remember when I started in here nothing but I'll see what the city was there about usually cities are a lot more like pungent a lot more flavorful I've never tried a sativa in you know in live resin form or true full spectrum light resin form some let's see how that how that tastes us this one's a little bit more full to the oil bro the oil is so crazy looking you guys a little close-up of the oil real quick hopefully that's focused in ya know and I know a lot of people are gonna be like oh I'm turned off by the oil the oil why does it look so dark to like do just understand the concept of what um you know marijuana is a whole man when it comes to making these products like people think people have this you know this natural we're not even natural it's probably just been a rumor that's been going around that people are like oh that clear it is the better when in reality that's not the case at all you know there's rosin and stuff like that that are like white and clear but that's a whole different thing room this is this is literally full spectrum light resin in a cartridge bro and this is what you want this is what you want I'm telling you 100% coming from cybg himself this is what you want in a cartridge you don't want distally you don't want oil man all the other stuff that people are cheating right now is it has it's nothing close compared to this if you guys are able to get your hands on this 18 and over 21 and over whatever it isn't yearly will say if you can even get these just try it just try it so we're going in on the tangi sativa see if it's any any different than the hybrid I feel I'm already fated you I'm showing them but we're gonna do this for the tube cheers boys Oh oh my goodness that was unexpected that is good bro oh my gosh I've never tasted @anjghie that tasted this good like I've tasted tangi before but this is [ __ ] phenomenal whoa in full spectrum mode it's literally like a whole different experience man I'm not gonna tell you guys like you literally can't go out and try anything like this is for this friendly farms cartridge is like something I've never tasted before it doesn't taste like plug and play doesn't taste like city it doesn't taste like wrong guard and this thing is so distinct and so good and my lungs are just so happy because it's like so smooth too and just like it hits the hits in every single aspect bro like the smell the taste the smoothness the from the from the inhale to the exhale everything about this cartridge is phenomenal definitely great so I'm gonna turn it up there you see or think it's premium as a preheat function to on it so this is purple setting I'm not too sure if this is lower hot but what's going on the purple side oh yeah the big boy setting boys that's that put you to sleep sending holy moley yeah that's that punch you right in your face whoo that was a dad with I was phenomenal oh this thing is kidding I'm not even a fan of [ __ ] sativas but this is a hit tangey killed it all right so I guess we're gonna end out the video with where the hell is that I'm tripping all right the blue dream right here so this is the cured resin right this is going to be their newest addition and their newest them yeah their newest addition to the lineup so this is um the cured resin instead of the librarian yeah the liquid live I mean right so right off the bat this is their that then this is their new um cartridge within you well it's the same tip and everything but it's just actually I think it is an encourage holy yeah definitely upgraded well I think it's the same one looks like the same one just a new tip they added a little I mean yeah let me show you guys let me get a little closer yeah so it has a new there this is our logo up here up on the top and the bottom if you I don't know if you guys can repo not because they're reflection but it says friendly farms and the oil and in terms of quality of the oil it honestly comparing your right right away it looks very very similar to their liquid life except this one the liquid live looks does look a little bit more thicker in terms yeah definitely their liquid live looks a little bit more thicker a little bit more um definitely something you would see from a squish plan this one this would like a fresh frozen pie if you guys I've ever seen different types of planets getting squished are like if you guys are into that stuff I know it's kind of weird for me to say this but you guys should definitely go google that in terms of how different types of libraries and suffer made and you guys would really get a really Indian detailed look of how how things look of how things can taste of their their flavor profiles you know their aspects of what what they bring to the charts in terms of TC percentage to body lock you know all that good stuff so I mean get right into it I'm gone I'm faded so cured resin coming in hot boys this is the blue green by the way that blue dream a blue dream when I saw that name it was kind of like you brought me back to like I don't know why Blue Dream has just been one of those things that you know one of those strains that have been around for a while even like I feel like I heard about that straight in like junior high so I'm gonna lie though this new cartridge with the logo on top is it definitely some swag hopefully that's what you're saying alright so cheers boys cured resin let's see if it tastes any different Yushu show you guys a whole difference right I always think that can be able to tell too much about the high I might save this cartridge after hitting this and make you maybe make a full review we'll see about that but cheers boys was gonna do it hmmm I honestly can't even tell the difference in terms of taste it tastes pretty good obviously I can tell the the flavor the length of strain flavor but in terms of like you know when you get a cartridge like even if it's different flavors you still get the same that same little taste like because it's the brand taste you know it's what makes the brand the brand so finally formants did a good job so if you guys want to know like pretty much the Cure they made the cured resin lion just in terms to appeal to more of the consumer base because people I guess were saying that it wasn't too budget-friendly their liquid live and honestly like you know and what I personally have to say if you're going to be doing you know consuming all these cartridges all these all these things you're gonna have to spend the bulk and if you're willing if you want to get some of the best stuff this is a right here man this is it like you you should go out and definitely get this because this is designer weight men you know this is that good stuff this is that good [ __ ] and they made this when the cured resin - like I said appeal to them to people with the lower budget you know people who only want to spend like I'm guessing like thirty thirty-five bucks on a cartridges instead of spending for like 45 so whatever the case is and honestly it's amazing like friendly farms is definitely doing their thing they're killing the game man if you guys are interested their Instagram is gonna be linked down below and you guys can go check out their product they've won multiple awards man definitely I can see why now I'm glad I got to test this out if you guys want to see some of their dab stuff you know these are their DAB sauces and we also got the the applicator we can definitely do something like that if you guys want to see some crazy ass challenge videos man like hitting for friendly farms at once or something like some something crazy man let me know in the comments below what you guys have as an idea and we'll probably do it so yeah get in the video I hear if you guys enjoyed it like I said leave a like comment and they", "_O-lZqF_xEo": "[Music] howdy friends welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help all you find wonderful and beautiful folks make sense of that crazy awful busy stinky but also wonderful and beautiful place we call our dispensaries today we are taking a look at another cartridge one we've never done before this one comes super highly recommended from my friends at the lift they said you gotta try this you gotta try this on and that is bezel sauce bezel sauce what an ostentatious name and the reason that we're going crazy is this is a this is what do they call it live resin this is a live resin cartridge meaning you know it doesn't have any of the cutting agents it doesn't they don't use co2 to make it it's it's just all high terpene full-spectrum cannabis it's good stuff and they they swore by it so I was like I'll give it a try I did come at a bit of a premium price at my license dispensary it's 40 bucks for a half gram cartridge is pretty expensive it's not the cheapest in the world I know the full spectrum process is still pretty rare and I assume it's not the cheapest so I assume you know that's why it's you're paying the premium in terms of packaging it's pretty basic just a big cardboard thing here please recycle on the sign who doesn't like to see that and then we've got our ingredients over here cannabis distill it high terpene full spectrum cannabis extract no butane um and then that just lets us know all of our instructions but we already know how to do that and then on the back of course we've got our you know checklist of great stuff and on the top is our like lab testing results as well as there on the front this is the orange Fruity Pebbles hi Brid and it is seventy six point six four percent and THC which it puts it about mil in the pack four cartridges but they swear on that full-spectrum oh wow that is quite elaborate um it's a very colorful on the inside so here we go let's get this open let's see if I can figure this out oh boy it's like you know I'm breaking the keys for the nuclear codes here oh and that gets unscrewed there wow this is very very very like you know I'm about to break up my fire extinguisher glass because the contents in here are very valuable so I've got my standard 510 battery here the oil they're more yellow kind of a nice beautiful piss yellow not being disparaging piss yellow can be a great color for a while uh looks quite viscous sort of drips in pretty easily they're flowing up and down uh but all together pretty handsome package it's got that plastic acrylic tip high quality plastic and prefer not plastic but you know you take what you get otherwise pretty standard issue so let's go ahead and give it a taste here whoo I forgot to count down that was surprisingly big that is very flavorful it doesn't taste a lot like orange Fruity Pebbles to me I've never had this trim and I've had fruity pebbles strain but never orange fruity pebbles what take it back it does it okay that's a very citrusy taste I had it there not sure it's fruity pebbles citrusy but definitely some orange kind of citrus I'll give them that this is pretty wild stuff in terms of I'm not drawing a lot and producing pretty dense dense vapor in my lungs yeah Wow okay man I'm not sure if I'm a full spectrum what do we call this again oh god I already dropped the name of this special way of extracting the oil this solvent free way is called whatever this full-spectrum stuff um it's delicious and it's quite generous of feeling with those with those clouds and in terms of THC it they are not kidding when it's 76.64 I would have guessed it would've been slightly higher this feels like a really potent cartridge to me three or four hits in on quite high on and absolutely loving this man this is great you know if I had any editing skills I would try to edit something in while I'm just sitting there breathing going or just like that but I don't know I'm lazy so you know maybe my nice spouse older but she wants that at some point um okay so far two thumbs way up it's expensive you're paying for the process but I so far would say it's worth the premium for the unfortunately named bezel sauce um but guys but but but but there's always a but make sure you stick around because as we all know these cartridges tend to not last the entire time the break they leak the they burn hot whatever I always use the same excuses but there are a myriad of excuses for why these things fail or start to go bad Lee so as always I will review this entire cartridge I'm going to finish this off I'm going to really hopefully continue enjoying to finish this off over the next couple of days and probably about two two-and-a-half days I'll come back to you guys and again hopefully go warship at the feet of bezel and it'll be great until then guys you uh you know stay high stay beautiful and whatever else I'm hi and I'll see you right back here in just a bit I'm not gonna say ciao cuz I always do that but I'll just say goodbye I'm high [Music] well howdy friends welcome back to wheats it's been about two and a half days since I last was with you guys and we were talking about diesel sauce there and there orange Fruity Pebbles uh and here she is guys all depleted they're almost every little drop gone from the cartridge and this one is a big old thumbs up for me guys um this full-spectrum buzzword seems to make some kind of a difference this is a very tasty very clean tasting a cartridge the the the taste was subtle but it was it was definitely um nothing artificial about it it was very very natural and clean tasting which I really appreciated it got me pretty high not the most potent cartridge I've ever had but you know after a couple of puffs of solid four or five somewhere in there not really getting much past that uh and in terms of value right at about the length and cost you would want to see and you do pay a little bit extra for that full-spectrum buzzword but you know it's hard to see if it's worth it on the first go but it's worth trying at least once to see if it if it means a lot to you or if you get more enjoyment out of it I certainly recommend you guys give the full spectrum um sort of cartridges a shot if they're around but you know there's it's up to you whether you want to stick with them or not um so really though this bezel sauce orange Fruity Pebbles is pretty good guys no complaints solid thumbs up um probably not gonna be my first choice they're just other things out there that I like a little bit more for the price but if this is you know if this is one of the few carts that your dispensary has I have no problems recommending bezel sauce in there orange of Fruity Pebbles at least that strain so I'm gonna give that a big thumbs up no no qualifications and don't need to hedge it in any way shape or form really enjoyed that cartridge and guys anytime I really enjoy something I want to leave a little cherry on top for you a little something extra just because I'm feeling generous and these little extra things are something you know not weed related in any way shape or form and you don't necessarily need weed to enjoy them but you know probably couldn't hurt so this week I'm gonna give to you something that I am not sure if I've recommended or not I might have done it very recently but you got to forgive me because I'm always high in these videos anyways and that is the Amazon Prime TV show a flea bag with Phoebe Waller bridges Bridger Bridger Phoebe Waller bridge I can't remember that last word of her names it's bridge Bridgers there are a lot of Phoebe bridges out there apparently but anyways a TV show about her and sort of the fourth wall breaking she turns to speak to the camera all the time but the other people aren't really aware that she's doing it sort of like a malcolm in the middle' kind of thing if you've ever seen that show where Malcolm's sort of addresses the audience it is a wonderful wonderful show they're only 12 episodes in total spread across two seasons only half an hour of each if you like you know your sort of comedy dry British acerbic and full of sexual situations get fleabag a shot I really really really enjoyed it and I also really enjoyed the bezel sauce so guys that's going to do it for this cherry on top that's going to do it for this review both things heartily recommend and that guys is gonna do it for this review thank you so much for watching folks and we will see you right back here you know or somewhere else who knows on the next review ciao friends", "SoVy7emFQOk": "you're smokin man growin and watch it fall down [Music] DGC Scottie real hanging out and doing something very interesting thank you for Jason from dialed in Terps for coming in I am really interested in trying to learn what do they call this they have to make these high-end extracts and now I always thought they made them with BHO and whatnot now Jason comes over and says no you can actually make them using real high-end water hash and pressing that into rosin and then you jar it up is that this jar tech is that what they call this yes jar tech it's um it's fresh frozen material that's then turn into bubble hash exactly like you said and depressed in the rosin and at some point you know you have to decide what you want to do with is our consistency goes right why is it look so different what's it start out so it starts out as rosin right yeah it's really suffered rosin okay we got a picture of that Ross and that [ __ ] is so bright why the hell is that rosin so bright white well you know quality in quality out you know you want to start with the best material possible when you're starting with the fresh products and you've matured a trichome to its full maturity right and still hold a nice color but I've seen things that are yellow I've seen things that are a dark almost like a tan brown and by the way it can be dankus [ __ ] but I seem like the 710 labs they do that real white five-star water hash sure and you're saying five stars kind of this five star material yeah I think 710 would probably be doing more if they're selling it they're gonna be doing a six star but the [ __ ] the difference help a brother out man all right six stars as good as it gets six stars as good as it gets no cars both wash goes all right that's the bright whites they all really light do you holo bright whites a full milk bubble hash okay put it on a bowl there's not gonna be any residue left got it and that's what's gonna burn clean right that's really what they're looking for for a full bubble hash by the way that 6r that's just expensive man I don't even know I bought that a little bit $75 a gram and I had like no second thoughts after I went through it or like 10 15 bucks it's just you want to do a few it is delicious I agree so is that what that way you end up with here or that's what we start with most stuff you're president of rosin would be a five star hash and what the difference is starting material yes the starting material is gonna leave a little bit of residue if you put a five star hash and a puff go peak it's still gonna taste delicious right you're gonna really enjoy it it's just gonna leave a little residue at the bottom of the bowl when you clean it you ever smoked bubble hash and you see that that's gonna be a five star hash or a four star hash and again I'm just trying to understood the difference is the quality of the material going in right so six star hash this is gonna be no residue it's gonna burn totally clean Wow just like you know when you smoke a full mil okay so what does this start out as this is five star what do you what do you call this this is five star material for that okay with I work really hard in house to peruse really nice flowers that I've fries fresh beautiful right beautiful you've been here about ten years right no I think we both heard the calling and yeah left our homes to come and be growers be growers out in public I love it I really enjoyed my 10 years in Colorado it's I'm home now yeah you're relieved oh yeah you're right he's right by the mountains absolutely beautiful beautiful up there I'll come visit you can't visit me I'll come visit you next time man all right all right let's get into these jars guru's got beautiful pictures of the jars over there yeah what what are we starting Wesley this jar tech I totally don't actually get to start material over here it's mousey absolutely yeah we got everybody in the shop hey that's I think it's secure I meant to do an AB you take that live you know fresh frozen bubble hash it goes into a freeze dryer okay so this is definitely freeze dryer right huge how beautiful beautiful that's what happens when my friends come over you all right so I've took 56 grams yesterday or this morning actually I woke up early at 6 a.m. right and press 56 grams of bubble hash okay and that's important you didn't press flour you're pressing 56 grams of bubble hash gotcha and that's how you really get the old dry quality Cessna and the bubble has just been dried in the freeze dryer okay and now what's in a freezer until I pressed it so to help me out I understand why everybody wants a freeze dryer why why that's like the key to super high quality okay a pretty dryer really is gonna preserve all the terpenes all the cannabinoids and it's gonna preserve its freshness and make it absolutely just perfect right so what so and your freeze drying the buds the flowers before you or your freeze drying the hash here freeze rather than bullish she's got imperious drying the bullish beautiful without losing any of terpenes right you're drying it at an extremely cold temperature wow what a trip all right I get it now I get it all right so now we got we pony that was a tad a process something like that this came up rest us this morning and if I were to pressed it and immediately it would have not started waxing up I've got it we came up to the show it's starting to wax up a little which is fine it's just a little bit harder to collect right so we're I'm in here and that's gorgeous it is warm by the way the air conditioning broke they're fixing it up we just fell right yeah we had this in the freezer and I already pulled it apart and the cold temperatures a key to this know right even everything cold right yeah so it started tearing the wax of him that is impressive that's the starting material okay yeah so now what do we do it now that to me I'd be dabbing the [ __ ] out of that as a matter of fact so is that dabble yeah you want to try it yes yeah you know we've got these these are called a puff coke peak is that what this is yeah absolutely yeah awesome you showed up with one and guru showed up with one the beginning in a week and they really do hit beautifully I think so yeah it's my preferred way to smoke I was a double uh double press here Yeah right Yeah right see he already turned it on so oh no what your right hand I'll turn it off because these are cold start tabs always for you now I just changed it to you take this more damaged how you didn't even started up so you're doing alright beautiful I forgot it's the right temperature I like to do it on green I think if you have a high quality product if it should burn really well and hey yeah I'll shout out to Stony scholar who was teaching me about this at the last dvc cup and he was probably the first time I heard about cold start dabs Yeah right great once ready deal alright I'll get mine going to this I haven't tried this yet this is star dog I did a full spectrum start up here ok beautiful star dog is it's JJ from top dog is that right really so yeah alright so back from bubble hashes is gonna be the 45 of you for me 45 of you all the way to the 160 you I don't even know how what say you what do you you have it's the micron size of the bubble bag say use it oh sure I know about that sorry so both bags coming about half that you get half a dozen bubble bags they go anywhere from what about 30 or something like that 30 microns 25 micron yeah 20 yep right usually or 220 or 190 or contaminate bags and then your your 160 bag you have some really nice head to start in and get in there yeah what he means by that so that's ones you keep your ear material and your starting material bubble bags all right hang on excuse me let me date with the puff coke peak oh yes let me turn my own give me some small talk here so we're starting off with this and then what that goes in a jar tell me how we get to these I don't understand the jar we smoke the [ __ ] out by the way this is amazing hang on a second smells good I haven't tried it yet this is my new harvest I do everything in-house and you know in Colorado you're only allowed to do 12 plants so it's really hard to have material all the time yeah absolutely you can put air quotes around your 12 plants your church things very interesting know if I did it right I still got some left oh oh I better q-tip it is this gurus you could double click it if you didn't want oh I guess going yeah that should have done that and sometimes you could get sugar done the double click oh good thanks pretty interesting best tastes pretty pretty delicious [ __ ] great it's pretty much cold Karen right here that's what you have here so yeah so what I have no idea what's going on here so let's go for it we got what I would smoke right there what are we trying to make we're trying to make diamonds and sauce with it we're trying to that's one of the that's one of the consistencies you can make what are they tell me tell me what are their Jesus movie it's almost offensive right so this is grease monkey and I took a little cookie pucker from camerado and mixed it in with the grease monkey from exotic genetics okay kind of spiced up the Terps a little and made it a little Wow yeah it's interesting smell yeah Jesus it is weird man that's an interesting smell so okay so that starts with this yeah it starts with this and you have your option of collecting into a ball right you know you're gonna take all these and collect it into a big ball Drazen that's easy I done that yeah exactly and you're gonna put it in a jar and seal it okay you could have options you could go into an oven at a temperature around 220 degrees okay 45 minutes an hour and we'll go over that later just a simple of them like a toaster oven or some convection oven yeah perfection oven okay I used my oven in my kitchen when I first started here thousands of dollars of equipment so I guess you got a couple G's in the freezer freeze dryer yeah so freeze right in a bubble bags the good bubble bags are getting up there and prints really and I love those bubble bags I spent my last dime I was on vacation found out those existed and spent my last dime on them it's like I got this right all right so we got we get it uh like this now what we put a leg ball it up put it in a jar how the hell is a ball of that gonna make that that doesn't make no sense to me it's like I said oh okay they'll go into the oven right 20 degrees got it or about 45 minutes this jar is gonna melt up and it's gonna foam up and it's gonna start 2d carved in the jar essentially what you're doing is separating your using solvent as a using terpenes as a solvent you're separating THC and the terpenes got it terpenes will go to the top THC will settle the bottom that will go on a heat map and that will sit on a heat man anywhere from 12 hours to 24 hours and so far none of this is specialty equipment I've got a seed heating mat right there I used to sprout seeds and and make clones with yeah that's what you need yeah kitchen the kitchen of an oven and a seed mat is all you really need I mean if you know this is all very high-end product you're working with medical medical instruments as much as possible right if you have a nice clean Breville convection oven that you could get at Best Buy or bad bad thing yeah all right yeah but aside from the freeze dryer which you'll make a lot of friends with that at least no yeah a lot of folks come into the house oh yeah and so how long does something like this have to sit after so you you bake it and it's it's ready or you sit what you're gonna do is you're gonna take that jar and you're going to essentially turn it into a liquid and though though it's gonna foam up and the bottom will turn into a liquid the bubbles will start to rise up the jar kind of like a beer okay when is three-quarters of the way up the jar is all liquid on the bottom and the top are bubbles it'll look like a beard when it was freshly poured exactly right that's when it's ready to pull out of the oven you're gonna take that jar out of the oven and put it on a heat mat like that and it'll sit on that heat mat anywhere if I can set from 12 to 24 hours and it'll the crystals will start to collect and form and that's it and how long so after 24 hours it's good like that that's only a process I would think it would take weeks for yeah I remember making rock candy as a kid that shook took weeks man it could take anywhere from 12 hours to 4 days five days goddess I've ever seen a jar takers been six days and does it matter about the quality if there's not enough terpenes and in the material or it always work I've seen some jars not work absolutely right not every strain does work but for the most part if you have a good quality starting material you do your process right right you're gonna you're gonna have good results did you see this is [ __ ] cool cuz you can do it with a convection oven and just go over to nosies house man he just bought a kid you didn't you just buy your a freeze dryer brother yes loving it I'll be right over absolutely okay so what other consistencies do we have man you know the most popular consistency in my world right now and I think a lot of people are really digging on is a cold here which hold you here come on get us get us up to speed I told you I gotta go to the 7:10 cup the concentration celebration in a month maybe get my [ __ ] together man this is the cold care dude so show that to the camera man that is if they had that in the store I might run out with it I have to I'd have to think I have to conscience man that thing is uh insane how many grams is this first of all so that's one ounce 28 grams okay yeah that's fun that's fun to have in my hand so has it been whipped yet this I'm still caring okay how long is the Cure on something like that so this the first stop is there a cure on that you said one to four days is that what you're calling it cure so what I'm calling on that is the separation okay yeah you're separating the terpenes or the THC and forming crystals is that after the cure this is so Karen so this has been this foot into a ball right and put into a jar right that's it all I've done is take that collected and put it in the showcase I love it how long's that after how long does that cure so this has been in a jar now for two days okay I'm gonna let this sit in a jar for a few more weeks God okay that's what I was thinking I thought there was some stuff he did for a few weeks and that's room for 60 degrees for a few weeks the sweat get terpenes will start to rise to the top they'll get softer where do you keep a room sixty degrees if we're trying to be practical and helped a DGC actually do this so you just take a cold basement like a dresser drawer got it and it's in the 60s clothes or it has to be dialed in 60 degrees I would consider a six a cold Kyra's 60 degree room okay you could also do a room temperature here is just just fine and it goes quicker it works just fine okay no reason to not do a room temperature here I'm still obsessed over it why not brother yeah if I cure something up it'll be just a pocket cure yeah I call it yeah yeah a pocket cure pocket cure that sounds like something I would do and when you're ready when it's when it's secured and you feel you feel it it's good where you like it right it's sweating terpenes it looks delicious sweating to smoke yeah yeah you take care take your tool and you go ahead and whip it like mashed potatoes essentially what's that can you do that what's that look like right we'll do it to this one all right so this one is the same material that this was the second press material so we'll show that material first of all all right that's the second pressing it's [ __ ] impressive normally when I would do the second pressings or at least a second run with my bubble bags it was much it was a lot less quality can you say a lot less quality much lower quality that's limit to say manthe books I didn't mean it's kicking it I've never been known for the best grammar myself you can make great concentrates nobody gives a [ __ ] about your grammar yeah all right so this one thing about this is an ounce that's announcer there's 14 grams okay half an ounce an ounce looks like yeah beautiful I put this in the oven okay yeah so in order to speed this process up you could put it in the oven as well and do cake batters what a lot of people are called so that's when I goes I get that a batter sometimes yeah okay so my batter out of the oven is gonna come out dry like this it's this is unlit so what about this moist you do there's plenty of terpenes in there and it's delicious and you can smell it it just needs to be kind of whipped okay that's not a fast profile yeah you know I'm more of like a no-till guy man so this is kind of I don't know man right I know it's actually the same idea though you know you get everything exposed to a more surface area get it exposed Wow okay that's looking like something to get it at a dispensary yeah then you start smashing it down kind of potatoes that looks good you know misty all looks getting wet and delicious already and you know right look at that so Leo is soft and gooey beautiful show that to guru man yeah come on you really get a nice good mash on that you're welcome to stop by the bakery any time so so what consistencies is coming like I said this is the end this is a second press and I did put it in the oven just to speed up the process of the cold appear for the show oven will loosen terpenes I don't know I think you could bring out some terpenes well it depends on the strain you know some the oven will bring out terpenes on some strains of them will destroy starting really fragile terpenes and some strands as well huh yeah absolutely I like to do a little bit of both I wish that's my tournament entry so I'm just kind of like oh yeah they're like that I can't smell it yeah you know the press of that so you know you so the quality is there it's delicious you want to try it yes yeah you probably don't ask me that any other man let me see that let me see the whole jar I got that cheese man right I'm happy today it's a good day in the bakery nice limit limit let me hold let me know yes Jesus what strain is this what do you think hate the nausea will you put this all back in the fridge it's totally waxed up it's gonna be really hard to click now but yeah the key thing is cold cold is the key yeah it is colder the better you're working at home if you could turn on the air-conditioner or open up some windows if I live at elevation so I keep everything really cool does that make a difference oh yeah damn I try to keep miles at 60 you know like I'll let you handle it yeah you know I just I start making pizzas and I'll be damned you got a really a just [ __ ] for elevation I'm sure making that stuff that's way sensitive man you really got to adjust you're a mile high up makes a [ __ ] huge difference especially with water absorption I so dry yeah it's almost impossible to keep up yeah is there any difference if people are trying to do this in you know up in Portland where it's more humid or anything is there any kind of special precautions they would have to take well Portland's humid yes what I'm wondering is such a different client man yes so the probably was something somebody that actually lives in Portland to ask wouldn't it yeah I mean you want to keep bubble high school most people professionally love make pilaster live and work and walk-in coolers so this is all about a walk-in cooler this would never hit this temperature as a professional matchmaker yeah yeah so this for the show it would have never made it this long and started to wax up already right I would have collected that immediately put it in a jar you put it in the oven for Jam put it in a jar put in a cold room for a cold cure and now what's a jam what's a jam so the jam would be you know the the crackles that's why we call it jhanas okay okay I believe olio cause a jam 710 calls it premium rosin and I believe gotcha you know there's different companies call it different things so help me out with these pro companies it's because they're able to do things like by walk-in freezers I think I forgot must have forgotten to turn mine on I'm still trying to help you with that Scotty I'm still trying to get this thing what am I doing wrong it's gross I see him that's I'm on it yeah so you want to click it once I'll get once all right and then click it twice to get it going and concert vibrates you're ready to go all right I like it I like it it's pretty cool man let's see a couple of these at the at the 710 concentration celebration I'm gonna bring mine yeah I think it'd be a good way to hit them I mean how torches are cool but yeah this is a safe little bit and a little bit yeah couple hundred stoners with torches sounds cool that's then I hit my sword on my place yesterday I heard a lady I was reaching around trying to fold the back up of a piece of paper I'm sure and sure hit my plate my will templates not so low-temp what they're doing that dude I use a toaster for like five minutes a week and I burnt myself man all right so did you get yours yet uh not yeah I don't think it's ever vibrate uh I mean I was actually making small talks ah there we go man there we go that just turned off double-click that again it it sways boom boom there you go now good now you're I like this thing but what stop at the learning curve how come I'm the only wall to learning curve it's bold school job school study all these gadgets I took me a while to I got laughed at for not having a filter on my joint last week the filter gets in the way honestly kind of taste taste bad throws in anyway hey okay it's a double quick hit that's what it is all right cool man I think we actually did pretty good man I think we uh I think I learned some [ __ ] man you run out I want to see this guy definitely but I'm pretty stoked that you if you invest in a freeze dryer that's kind of you're good to go you can all sudden start making super high-quality extracts like this as long as you're growing super high quality weed y'all I think so I think the learning curve here would be a lot a lot less than making butane hash co2 hash any of those types of hash it's illegal as a [ __ ] is illegal but you know there's a lot to learn yeah there's a legal and then there's a legal yeah yeah you know in a legal lab it's a lot to learn isn't very what's your brand called again I know you got a hangout dialed in Terps man died on turbulent turkey diving terpenes and ER yeah this is some pretty cool [ __ ] you got Instagram yeah I'm an Instagram that's about interest on Instagram other than terpenes on Instagram all right we gotta hang out a little more man this is [ __ ] cool I learned to hold this is like opening up a new world to me I had no idea actually I didn't know this existed because I would see the six star hashes and all these all these crazy concoctions at the dispensary but I really didn't know what went into him or how they were made I love the fact that there's there's no external solvents into it this is just what the terpenes act as a solvent right yeah absolutely it's cool it's awesome so that's yeah you know making bubble hash water solvent carrying agent you using water and ice to break off the trichomes just the very heads of the little live flower and it's bad acid into this yeah it's badass I still think I'm doing this wrong but Jason thanks so much for hanging out man thanks for making the trek and extra show me how to use this thing well though it doesn't even seem like I put the carbon cap on at this point that in terms out intervenes over on Instagram [ __ ] with a match take it easy brother Thanks crack take it easy oh yeah [Music] little break [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] medicine [Music] [Music] today [Music] [Applause] [Music]",

and we'll see you guys on the next video all right man peace", "lZ-vfMIuGco": "[Music] welcome to truebuds tv it's your buddy jack talking distillate vapes versus live resin vapes what's going on here what's the difference i've had tons of requests so i'm happy to be fulfilling those requests let's see what we got in the uh little handy dandy true buds pack let's open it up well that's for another video i'm going to be opening up this top shelf pre-roll see what we got inside keep an eye out for that video i have the uh live resin from jetty here the unrefined let's go ahead and open this up we got the little satchel in here tastes so good so live resin upon harvest is instantly frozen this is the way that they're going to get the most terpenes in there the full flower flavor that everybody loves live resin is usually extracted with butane and purged in a vacuum oven i'm not going to go too far into the process let me know if you want to see more videos on the actual process now live resin usually on the scale shows it's a little less potent and a lot of people go shopping i want the highest potency i want this and that that's why distillate cartridges are so popular and that's why i'm making this video to kind of educate people because distillate is the bottom of the barrel if you will it's the leftovers the trim the shake because everything is going to be burnt off essentially it's like making booze it's like making a moonshine or ever clear you're going to put all this [ __ ] in and then you're going to be left with the most potent stuff possible basically tasteless odorless colorless and then this is when the companies add in the terpenes if you're lucky sometimes they're delicious sometimes they're not but a lot of times you can taste the artificialness and that's why i think especially after having this live resin i got a live resin from my uh packs the other day from jetty too i think this is the go to from now on i'm tired of these distillate carts when i hit them they taste fake i'm [ __ ] like sneezing that's another video i've been with people when they're smoking vapes i sneeze all the time after hitting this distillate cart like what kind of terpenes have you put in there is it some [ __ ] random flower that i happen to be allergic to like that is the beauty of the live resin is you are getting the live flower if you will the closest resemblance in a nice form that's right there price point price point this graham cartridge is pretty damn expensive i'm not gonna lie i was a little hesitant it was like 62. i got it from ease i'll put a comment down below if you want to order through there for your first time get 20 off but that's expensive sometimes i have people commenting like dude that's some serious dough you're dropping on some carts and [ __ ] but it's convenient it's legal gives me peace of mind i really don't mind actually you know shoveling that money forward people buy the stuff through ease it all kind of comes back but what i'm saying here is i think this has helped transform me i've had other live resin vapes and i've thought the same thing but i'll still buy distillate ones but i'm sitting there i feel like sometimes these like even the circles one like i'll take [ __ ] like 10 15 [ __ ] poles off it and it feels like just now i had like what four of these like this is better so i guess you got to decide where you want to put your money quantity over quality i'll just compare it to like schwag versus fire ass nog you know what i'm saying i would say this is that good nug and the distillery cartridges are the swag so yeah like that we got the unrefined live resin and then we have a distillate like this was like 15 bucks and you can tell so that's my two cents i wanted to break down the difference for you between the live resin and the distillate vapes like i said the tons of people were asking like yo bro like what's the difference man and i'm like i'm gonna make a video so here it is thank you for hanging out i'm gonna go enjoy this and if you're liking this pack or you want to grab any of the other true buzz merch you know i'll be truly grateful and i got some really cool stuff just dropped the free smoke edition the stone bald eagle i got a whole video coming about that because it represents a lot to me i put a lot of thought in it and i want to thank the artists on that video too so keep an eye out grab some true buds merch if you're feeling this video show some love to me i'll keep making videos showing love to you you know what i'm saying thank you

cut of sativa anything that you need break it down like the weed this is true buzz tv buzz i'm a stoner i'm a smoker it's a hobby it's a lifestyle and a culture yeah this is yeah this is", "kX_Q94myqoQ": "what is up YouTube fabric boy baskets you're gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys and then a Saturday morning today it's time to wake and bake so I really hope you guys are really having a good day hopefully you guys staying blessed the world's kind of [ __ ] up right now but it'll it'll be over soon guys so everything will be back to normal so I really hope you guys are doing good and yeah guys last week got posted like two videos I usually post like on a Friday or Saturday so you know my bad had kind of been a little busy you know with all this [ __ ] going on but today actually last week I have picked up this moxie these are actually new you know I've never seen them before I had gotten one before it was super super fire you know they taste like an Ursa cartridge like actual actual like resident and I had a like a question you know if you guys ever know like don't you guys think like why is raw Gardens live resin so lighter than other live resins like like this one right here for example this was like a dark amber color compared to this one like I'll show you guys right now like live resin for the raw gardens are really really like you know which there's a lot there's some people I'm a comment section that say like regarding this fake like fake life resin so I don't know I just want to get your guy's opinion on that and that's a couple people already telling me you know but we're going to take a hit others before we get in the cartridge just waking big guys Cheers but I want to appreciate my new subscribers and those who are new here you guys are awesome for watching my videos you know I really appreciate you guys but let's get into this Moxie cartridge these are called MX brand but I had gone in there um on their Instagram page and it says they have to do something with Moxie so I'm guessing it is Moxie cuz it's like the same letterings everything this one's a yellow og this one's of life as full spectrum life resin so THC on this is 80% so it's a pretty good cartridge for some live resin there's some licenses that don't really get that high THC you know but this one's around 80 so it's pretty good cartridge I paid like maybe like 40 bucks for this so it wasn't too bad you know so we're just gonna go ahead and pop it open guys I had had one before it was like the it was like watermelon OG it was really really good you know it had tasted like an actual dab you know it tasted like really weed and it is like no discipline and intake and I like a really really different flavor than like what a raw garden would have like that clean like rock gardens to me that kind of tastes all the same you know they have all that fresh clean taste to it which is I don't know it's pretty good I'm getting wrong but they all kind of do taste the same here you have a cartridge it's a seesaw I really love these seesaw cartridges right here you know they're like the dank dank vapes how the tips are I really really love these tips now this is what I mean you know raw Gardens this one's life resin and this is my resident as well so and this one's a Moxie and this was a raw garden as you guys can see this one's way lighter than this one this one's the darker amber color so a lot of people been saying raw Gardens fake live resin so let me know what you guys think about that and that's just coming from couple people not just one you know so let me know what you guys think about that oh I thought about it as well like it is kind of lighter than what this one is and on this is real dead live resin so guys let me know on that so this one's it's really really thick yellow oh jesus was the indica hybrid I'm guessing so I'm good and dry hedges let me see what it tastes like you know flavors off it so the best way to try to just to [ __ ] hit it so we're not going to take this off I didn't do a cartridge you'd be on this raw garden I was just too lazy and I got a like on a Wednesday or something Wednesday night so I just started puffing the [ __ ] out of it so we're gonna gonna screw this on the cartridge battery hopefully I was smoking well wouldn't you guys plot you guys vape pens whatever you guys got to get [ __ ] high mass waking day just around 7:00 in the morning before I hit this let me get up Oh Red Bull sponsors we may get sugar-free Red Bull but besides that guys oh hopefully got a smoke along with me work on ahead and try this [ __ ] this one's the yellow og moxie I guess MX brand whatever you want to call it so cheers guys oh wow right off the bat if you guys ever had a if you guys ever had a Ursa cartridge these cartridges taste exactly exactly like them they taste exactly like weed you don't get like that raw garden like taste to it you know it tastes actually like dad and that's one of the things that I was wondering like why does this taste more like dab you know and like the raw gardens taste like a little chemically you know I don't get me wrong they're pretty good but I don't know that's kind of weird to me but these cartons are pretty far guys are like 40 bucks for some actual life resin I said these taste like an oyster cartridge the taste on it it's like a strong dad taste you know really really good you definitely get that OG taste like a strong cushy taste at the end but it's mostly like a clean fresh oh gee tation well it tastes really really good like when I tried these cartridges like last week it was a watermelon og cross was something and I was really amazed by the turf shamash it was crazy I little smoked the coke cartridge like in two three days you go back-to-back that's how good it was but this one it tastes kind of the same but it's just had like a more strong cush taste to it now I'm feeling like a little good high right now I know like a really good buzz you know there's my waking bag I'm gonna take a bigger hit to see if you know I [ __ ] get a big cloud for you guys I hope you guys are smoking along with me and I'm also having a vaporizer I'm going to give away I don't know if you guys had seen my review I had done on these belief goes if you guys want to go ahead and check out my video I did on these but I would appreciate it and I'm also gonna do a giveaway because they gave me two of them so I'm not gonna use the other one so I'm gonna give it away I will personally share to you guys his doorstep I'm sending out to UPS wherever you guys are at so you guys let me know and guys she got something loaded already I'm glad and hit it again she'd like to take a blinker man [ __ ] it never tried to blink on these [ __ ] arm pen cards which is only like on Stevie or like a plug-and-play but we're going to try it blink on this [ __ ] I'm already loaded this card you just smacked guys if you guys ever see these MX brands Moxie cartridges like presents they're pretty fired they have a lot of flavors as well you know just as you guys can see they say Moxie on there so they say MX like I don't know it's it's weird but yeah that's just like a MX for like a little short you know we're for maxi but really appreciate you guys watching my videos you guys stay tuned for more I'm gonna be

better content for you guys and also would really appreciate that as well so you guys have a really blessed day and these guys", "JFpLUTbWBw8": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive what's up guys back here for another [ __ ] video and today you guys already know you can tell from the title today i'm gonna do another informative informative video um if you guys clicked on this video it's probably because you guys have bought a select card and you guys are wondering is that thing real or is it fake because select had a lot of fake cards going on back in the day but that's back when that's back before they had live resin guys back in those days they only had distillate but now guys man they faking they faking the live resin now guys so today your boy is about to put them on blast because um i recently got a select from flower co and um my friend he recently got a select off the streets and he came up to me with it and it was pretty much the same box but totally different and you could just tell it was fake and i felt so bad for him so he let me borrow the he let me borrow it i got the cards and i'm going to show you guys the difference between the real and the fake you probably could kind of tell already from the box which one's real and which one's fake but um before we get into this guys hopefully you guys can hear me it's kind of windy today actually but um let's take a freaking bong ring boys all right guys so to start off off the back we're going to do a little close-up you feel me so you won't see my face for a little bit we're going to do a little close-up talking right quick so check it out all right off the back this is the real one and this is the fake one and let me tell you guys why this is real and this is fake off the bat you can tell it's fake by the colors all hybrids are in the orange box and it's a dark orange it's not this light orange you see the lettering the lettering it's in light orange um the name of the strain the thc content and the amount in there is a lighter orange as you can see also let me get a little closer this color scheme thing right here the yellow orange red pink purple the color scheme is lighter than the one on the rail box those are off jump ways that i knew as well as you could tell by the print they're using different fonts as you can see it's more bold up here is more popping on the real one more plain it's more pop it gives it more of a pop like it's coming out at you you'll see the difference okay and then another way you could tell guys is the real one off jump a real one's gonna have a bar code there you go barcode fake no barcode no nothing sealed up nicely it almost looks almost looks real another way you can figure out that this is fake guys is when you push it out to open see at the bottom you could see that it just pushes straight out when you push this button in on the side guys that i have my finger on right here that i'm tapping you can just push it down and then push the cart straight out you can see from the bottom the box comes straight out on a fake cart it's just a flat bottom you just pop that off this is a flat bottom this has no use maybe after you pop it off you can slide it but it has pretty much no use as you can see the difference the actual box pops out from the bottom when you rip this tape off another way i could tell guys is also from the bottom it's a hybrid and it says indica on the bottom it could obviously be an indica hybrid but it just says hybrid on there and if it doesn't end like a hybrid it will say indica hybrid like this one says sativa hybrid it's a dominant sativa because most you know strains you get these days they're hybrids so um usually they're either sativa dominant or indica dominant this one's a sativa dominant as you can see but this one it just says indica on the bottom and just lemon hash diesel so that kind of threw me off that new that that's what made me know that it was fake basically a lot of things did but also you could tell by the font the font is different as you can see it's a light orange color just the real one's dark orange feel me and the font is way different guys this is a fake just look at the font you know give it a couple seconds make sure it's hd now look at this font you could see that it's much different font but it's very similar they did a good job on it but some of the font stuff is different like the warning sign should be yellow there's no yellow and you can see that the font is different boom boom all right guys those are the ways you can see just by looking at the box this is the real one the tropicana and this is the fake one it's too light like you can tell it's fake guys come on now um another way you could tell is um by the actual oil you see the lemon hash diesel it's a little too light you feel me you can see how light it is i'll take it out the package later but your oil is going to want to be dark like this like the tropicana cookies you see that dark consistency you don't want that you don't or no you want that sorry guys you want that dark consistent you don't want the light consistency you see that it's too light you want that dark because live resin is usually darker but yeah let's pop this open but yeah guys you know there's a lot of you know fake carts out there that are easy for you to you know realize that they're fake because they're mario karts they they got fruity pebbles on it they're named after some kind of cereal brand you know different brands that are trying to entice younger people to buy it basically but you know select it's a little harder to um just drop the box it's a little harder to tell because you know they try to make it look as legit as possible and select is actually a real brand mario karts and those luigi's and all those other carts that are out there the skittles and stuff like that those aren't real brands nintendo is not gonna let you put theirs name on a car guys let's be real so we're gonna open up these boxes real quick there we go so it pops right out guys the real ones you can actually use the button and it pops right out there's no cardboard on top it's just like a plastic thing you have to cut off and then boom you got a cart the fake one as you can see you have to actually peel back a box you feel me you have to peel that back and actually open up the box [Music] then you can slide it out after you already open the box [Applause] the real one it's already out you can already push it out the fake one you have to rip open the actual box bam so like i said guys look at the oil the real one is going to be much darker than the fake one as you can see the fake ones are super light it looks like fake wax usually fake wax looks like this looks like this or clear this is real it's a live resin this looks like a distillate this looks like this joy with this live resin baby so make sure you know what you're getting guys the last test honestly the last test to know if your cart is real or fake is to taste it but i know for a fact that this one's fake as hell so i'm not gonna be hitting it let's inspect the cart see the fake one the fake one sorry guys i'm not even done yet the fake one as you can see has no stickers or nothing a real one is going to have a ca sticker on it my guys as you can see let's see what kind of cartridges they use the c cells look a little different too hopefully i can zoom it in good enough the c cells look different [Music] way different but they're both cell i guess but the writing on this c cell looks more bolder as you can see the writing on the real season looks way smaller but either way we know we know that yellow stuff is fake in that dark stuff this is the real this is the real deal guys fake real you can just look at it and see the difference ca dark color no ca light color looks like a disc joy all right so thank you guys for watching the video though guys more content to come i had to get you guys another fake card review and i felt like select one of the biggest like companies out there other than raw gardeners dizzy so i had to do one of them and my friend came through with a fake one so i had to make sure he ain't smoking that fake [ __ ] but um guys i found my battery with my cart on it so let's hit this card quick little blinker hit for you guys and then let's put this real one on just a real live resin i was gonna do a review on this maybe i'll still do a review guys if you guys want to see a review on this cart comment down below but right now i'm just gonna hit it smoke it i'm not gonna talk much about it and i'm gonna end the vlog [Music] i would hit this but it's it's so blatantly fake so thank you guys for watching this video don't forget to like comment subscribe more videos to come thank you for always being here shout out to everyone who saw my um ounce hot box in the bathroom man that [ __ ] was [ __ ] had me loading man thank you guys for um being in my premiere because i premiered and i was in the chat talking to a bunch of people that were watching my video so shout out to all you guys that were in there one more last rip and i'm out peace [Music] you", "ldodqwERjx0": "[Music] hello everybody welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are going to be reviewing a cart from a company that i've seen around for some time i've seen them selling their flour at a lot of uh shops here in southern california especially the long beach area for it seems like a couple of years uh and now it looks like like a lot of folks they are branching out getting into other kinds of products um i know uh that this these people are now doing cartridges they're doing uh different concentrates and they are also doing tinctures of uh different varieties uh and what is that company that company is cresco cresco and this is their indica cartridge just uh nominally called rest it is their half uh gram cartridge 500 milligrams um and i picked this up for i actually couldn't tell you what the real cost was i it was uh some combination of purchasing this and one of their tinctures some kind of uh discount but i think they're a more affordable brand i think this is probably in the realm of like 20 to 25 for a half gram cart not too bad um in terms of packaging um it is uh refreshingly minimalistic not a lot of uh you know extra materials here just simple cardboard but all the information you want to see uh so the it is also in addition to being their rest line uh it is the critical purple push strain uh excuse me critical purple kush rather we all knew that and then you've got lab testing results there on the side a little sticker and then on the bottom you do have the um thc results and that comes in at 76.5 percent uh for 382 and a half percent or 382 milligrams of thc if that'll focus so uh this is pretty standard 510 fare here um uh no special pod or different kind of battery involved just your standard good old-fashioned 510 vape thread battery which you know feels to me like is uh becoming more and more of a uh a rarity to find uh the universal beloved 510 thread okay so we've ripped some tape off here at the bottom now we've got some push to do pushing pulling and there we go ah yes and this is a liquid live resin the uh still uh lost a little bit of its luster the term live resin not as much of a buzzword as it once was but still a lot of uh live resin devotees and this is apparently live resin uh and so here we are here is our cartridge design um got the plastic acrylic tip which is not my favorite uh but otherwise pretty standard looking 510 thread doesn't look like the nicest materials in the world but i don't think it's the most expensive cart either so let's go ahead and use my trusty 510 here as you know if you've watched me do some of these before i used to try to use nice 510 batteries uh to do these reviews with uh but for a variety of reasons i no longer do one because even the nice 510 batteries suck and they break down and then two i realized most people don't actually who are using these cartridges don't use a nice fancy online purchase battery they use the one that came free in the store the one that costs 10 bucks at the convenience shop or whatever they're not you know out there looking for the best so this is more uh in line with what a lot of people are experiencing uh not that this one's terrible just a standard 510 uh this one is raw garden branded i think it cost me like 12 bucks some number of months ago so uh without further ado let's go ahead and shut up and try this cresco uh critical purple kush half gram cart yummers wow yeah that is pretty good that is a pleasant surprise that that both hit harder than i thought um also came out more than that's a pretty nice hit for a um 510 thread and it was uh quite tasty it didn't taste like any added terpenes um tasted like your good old-fashioned full spectrum there wow yeah this is an unexpected trait this is pretty good stuff um i was not expecting to be as enamored with this as i am um super tasty it's very strong um this is a pretty remarkable amount of draw or um pardon the term cloud for such a small hit watch this not bad at all not bad um feels every bit of that advertise what was it 76 76 and a half percent for sure um and then again very very um nice flavor super smooth um and if you like your cartridges to have a very authentic non-added artificially terpene taste this is gonna do it for you wow this is uh a a nice little surprise i'm i'm quite enjoying this cresco liquid live resin uh and even the cartridge itself is is surprising me in terms of the kind of draws i'm getting here so let's get one board yum well this uh first half of this review is extremely positive but you know you're gonna have to stay tuned for the whole thing because here at wheats we don't just review the first half of our cartridges we do the whole gall darn thing um we do it from top to bottom so that i can come back to you guys give our whole thoughts let you know that the whole thing went through smoothly it never started to burn uh the wick didn't go out the uh didn't start to get clogged all those things that can go wrong with these uh 510 threads make sure we'll give it the whole wheat's review really really looking forward to uh doing so and uh i'm looking forward to come back in here coming right back here to report those results so i will see you guys right back here keep sitting right back here uh in probably a couple of days or so until then take care stay healthy and stay high my friends welcome back guys it has been about 60 hours two and a half days uh since i had started our journey with the cresco rest purple critical purple punch live resin cart uh and i still really enjoyed it uh this is a very good little cart um that oil is uh very quality stuff uh it tastes great um never got this super super hot burnt taste there at the end that you sometimes get you would get those sort of um uh they would burn a little bit hotter at the end but not nothing too much to worry about uh the one thing that i would say to be cautious of uh and i haven't had to say this in a while um is the thing that i brought up in the first half is uh there you're gonna get some unexpectedly big draws off of this uh i was very surprised uh more than once uh sort of devolved into a coughing fit because i took bigger draws than i um intended to i don't actually mean that as uh um a slight against it i i wish actually more carts uh had uh the ability you know you didn't have to uh draw as much on them to get such big hits but this one uh definitely does not have that problem so uh be careful if you're accustomed to other ones this one can give you a huge powerful hit without much effort uh it's not the oil is that much more powerful it's you know good oil but nothing crazy it's just that whatever this card design is airflow or whatever heating element uh causes much larger actual intake than normal uh but i did not think of that as a bad thing i just screwed up my implementation every now and then um so on the whole really really enjoyed this cresco rest critical purple push punch excuse me i assume they probably just have uh hybrid indica and sativa with the generic name but they have different strains it's like this is called the rest but it is also critical purple kush don't quite get that um but what i would get is this cartridge if i saw it again for an affordable price uh i'd love to try their one grams if they have them i'm not sure if they do or not but this half gram was a big thumbs up for me uh again that is the cresco liquid live resin indica rest cartridge pretty good stuff especially if you're a live resin fan well guys that's going to do it for this review here on wheats thanks for staying tuned here till the very end it's been a blast hanging out with you and until our next review guys be sure to stay high and even more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you back here for the next video goodbye", "W_3fnDIau-w": "ayyyy YouTube Alex here back again with another quick video hit uprise Erie today because they had some new stuff in from grassroots but I didn't get any flour although I thought about it but instead I grabbed one of their new live sauce carts half gram and I grabbed their diamonds legend of 91 diamonds now the weird thing is it says that this is a sativa this is 96 percent THC diamonds I'm not doing a review on that right now today but I will be doing a review on this for sure my birthday is coming up Friday so I bought this for my birthday the diamonds sativa diamonds yeah I'll do a review but I bought this today I'm which I'm gonna do right now Apella Rojas saw scarred by grassroots Pella Roja live sauce I believe it's just a sauce it's coming in about 72% teetsi a little over that when you add the two together the TCA and the THC it's like 72% grassroots it's got a little button it looks like you have to press right here to pop the card out which I will be doing in a second here the first time on this channel for the grassroots cartridge 500 milligram cartridge without further ado let's get this bad boy open got my water want to get the taste down all right I'm gonna need scissors for this I hope not I think I will damn one second I'm prepared I'm prepared always so yeah let me get this open here get the scissors in here okay they have to pick both sides cutting both sides this little safety tape across the top push this little button here and guess I'm pushing that little button and I'm gonna see if I can't get it open yep that's it that's it boys ooh I must admit that is the most baddest-ass looking cartridge I have ever seen wait till you guys see this cartridge whoa whoa you did to focus in on that it's got the logo on it it's got the grassroots symbol it's a turquoise looking color Wow says grassroots on the bottom of it let me see do you see that better like that come on focus for that cartridge very nice-looking cartridge it's got the logo on it this little mouse oh it's almost like a Cresco it's got a little rubber mouth top piece that you take out of the hole right here's a little hole at the top my camera's heart is trying to focus on me instead of the cartridge that little hole it's got a little rubber piece that pops out of there and it's got another little rubber piece on the bottom it says grassroots across the bottom of the cartridge and it's got their logo on it really nice I hope you see that I'm trying to get you to zoom in that this camera is like so good at focusing on my face that it wants to focus on my face that is a half gram let's give it a taste pehle Roja grassroots first time hope it works on this pen kangertech that is badass looking cartridge and I don't know why this cameras having trouble focusing [Music] cartridge yes Oh must be the lighting in here or something I never seen it do that it's having a really hard time focusing there we go it's got to be the lighting that's a nice cartridge it's hard to see the logo but it's on there it's uh yeah well let me get a rip of this I'll let you know what I think that tastes good now I did have the butter of this before I you if you look back in my videos I did do the grassroots pelo Roja butter I had that like twice and that was really good this tastes just like it Wow and those cartridges look really cool I can't get over how smooth they look it looks like it's turquoise it's got the grassroots little flower symbol that's oh you can't see it on here it's kind of on the boxes you guys know it's on the cartridge though and it says grassroots across the bottom of it this is one of the nicest cartridges I've ever seen Clara's got nice cartridges too I'll give it to him but this is nice circular mouthpiece like the grant I like the Cresco it's almost similar only thing it's just decorated nicely you know it's got nice I paid 60 for the half gram and I did not know that it was a live resin car because all's it doesn't say it on the menu it just says Pell Roja it didn't say if it was a distillate a live resin or not but on the box it says Pell Rojas sauce card so I know that's a live sauce definitely in a taste amazing so yeah oh yeah I was gonna grab two of them but instead I grabbed another Bruce Banner and I grabbed this here that legend 91 yeah I dropped 200 bucks at the dispensary 60 for the Bruce Banner 60 for this an 80 for the gram of yeah with $5 discount so was 195 but I was gonna grab two of these but I wasn't sure because I don't want to grab two and then not like it you know I like this a lot you might have to go grab another one they stood they had an East Coast Sour Diesel also in grassroots cartridge let me get another rip that tastes good it tastes like what I remember that butter the Pell raw butter to taste like mm-hmm man that tastes really good and that's she's nice I could already start to feel it feel it hit me believe it or not that's good man definitely recommend it pehle Roja sauce cart and it's so probably a live sauce I'm almost certain he'll rue a lot of sauce scarred by grass with roots hello Roja yeah pretty tasty pretty tasty like I said I will get you the review of this legend of 91 before I do it I have to do a review of it 96 percent THC let me before I finish on that this was packaged sorry guys I'm all over the place not the gum I'm getting the highest hitting me already trust me the grassroots this was packaged on 1024 so very recent not even two weeks ago 1024 well no a couple weeks ago yeah 1024 about a month ago but uh yeah since 200 per gram doses 200 per gram so this is a half a gram so a hundred doses yeah it's pretty much it expires 1024 2020 it's got the tarp the turps and the oil yeah yeah this is good this is real good that's hit me it's hitting me guys yeah whoo Pella Roja man if I don't know it was gonna be this good and it's only like I said 70 what's a 72 73 percent THC that's really nice it makes me want to go back tomorrow and grab another one of these cartridges all right I'm out I'm gonna do another review real quick with this on the legend of 91 don't know why they're calling a sativa when it's usually every other place calls legend of 91 is an indica but for some reason grass roots excuse me was calling it the sativa I asked the bud tender she said she wasn't sure that they questioned it themselves there and they thought it might have been a mislabel but who knows don't matter to me 96 percent THC diamonds the diamonds I'm going to give you diamonds that is the Diamonds yeah all right i'ma let you let you go I definitely recommend the Pella Roja by grassroots 500 milligram cartridge 60 bucks it's tasty and it's really good and now that I know it's a live resin a live sauce cart that yeah I'm even more impressed I'm glad it's not a distillate wouldn't have been upset if it was co2 I thought it was a co2 but now that I see you know the lady said it was a sauce and I was like what do you think enchants explain a live sauce yeah really tastes yum I'm [ __ ] blaze the guys off of this already Wow and it is what 120 right now in the afternoon on Tuesday afternoon here so I'm gonna upload this today it's Tuesday

taking a look at the very limited and exclusive blueberry ock jelly sauce cartridge starting off with the material source we have a unique three-way blend of whole plant indoor cultivars such as beyond blueberry oszi cush and the brand-new strawberry OG Kush all masterfully crafted by Wonder Bread all the flour used was grown to full maturity and freshly dried prior to extraction this attention to detail is able to truly maximize both THC and overall turkey percentages the extraction process is devoid of any use of water chemicals nor salts making a true ultrafine hash frozen the next step in the process is the separation of hash frozen and inactive THC any or blue river snow from the static seed has frozen the rosin sauce then undergoes additional refinement to reduce plant fats and enables a more dynamic range of cannabinoids terpenes and flavonoids because of this process jelly sauce is going to be a bit darker in color the naturally occurring flavonoids are molecules responsible for a wider variety and spectrum of flavor exhibited through natural representation of the blend of the cultivars used the separated blue river snow is fully converted into THC and range reduced back to the refined rosin sauce to boost overall potency and onset of effects the flavor profile of this oil is something you've never had before my trooper bust mixture of right blueberry and gas coat your mouth as the vapor delivers a powerful 93 percent total cannabinoids containing 9.6% terpenes mercy and Kari awfully in healing and little ole being the highest testing terpenes in this

from the title this is going to be another pen vape device this time it is a reusable saucepan which is pretty interesting because from what she told me at the hall of flowers event is that this is all-in-one you could refill it and you can also recharge it yeah I don't know if they actually gave me a charger but I'm sure it's just a regular microUSB so let's open this you know by the way this is antidote the brand and I've actually never heard of this brand until I went there so if you guys have zoom in from like this and then you should like where is this video right there and right here I believe it's a 70% AC with 77 total cannabinoids yeah [Music] and this is a saucepan that's fish holy [ __ ] yeah Alex I think used to be like a regular looking pen but this is a grand that I say looks pretty sick oh that's a little port charge you guys yeah so yeah basically they told me that you get this device or syringe and you just [ __ ] and you know put some more in there if you ever need to know so I'm not too sure about that we're just gonna hit this and see how it is the strain is strawberry-banana so there's an indicator of when it hits [Music] [Music] it definitely tastes like like a it kind of tastes like the [ __ ] end but when I just felt absolute oh very saucy [Music] a little bit more strawberry-banana that'll definitely don't taste the strawberry genetics so it doesn't have like artificial fruit drippings in it it tastes like the flower itself yeah better I don't like the mouthpiece to be honest it feels a little weird yeah I feel it yeah because it's it's like the same size as the whole Oh Timothy he's [ __ ] high so what I'd like to say is it's getting hot love it actually not too hot was cuz I'm off Mises medal yeah you could feel it yeah exactly and then it is rechargeable so it's better than those it's not a disposable and in a usable sauce pan which is dope you know a lot of times when people get these all-in-one type [ __ ] the battery will run out before all the sauce is gone you know or the whole nut all the oil is gone that's hella dope so for them to add this you know it's like a lot of people probably wouldn't have done that but I mean it says I mean they told me Oh Ethan says rechargeable on here so but other than that it's a pretty good product I definitely like what I've tried to actually try their THC a as well and it was pretty good I did finish the raw bar and it definitely enhanced the high-end experience I also believe they do like diamonds and other [ __ ] too but like I said I've never heard of antidote antidote or whatever and I've never seen him in like the dispensaries in my location but I'm sure they're like located maybe and I Kelly something other than that I would like to say I mean it's a good pin what would you you just don't like the mountains what do you guess about it yeah it's good you know it's small compact very a cigarette like for the people that like the cigarette like shaped kind of you know a little disposables who still had that feeling so I'd recommend you I don't know the pricing but I'm sure you can find out through their website or something and if I do I'll post it thank you right here and yeah I am as you can see I'm pretty [ __ ] Heinz but before I stumble with my words more I would like to end this video and say thank you for watching peace out [Music] you

going to hit it twice give you guys a score on 10. while the flavor the flavor on this is incredible definitely not distill it you know with live resin and sauce pens on the market in california you never know if you're gonna get a true live resin product or something that's been blended with distillate or even just the sauce from all of that um what's what's cool is at the lower temperature i'm getting no burnt popcorn taste i'm getting nothing but earthy pine this sweet berry uh and i think what's cool about that is an og should be sweet and piney and earthy and there should be a pungentness to it and this is definitely roasting the nostrils not because it's hot i'm hitting it on the lowest setting here on this battery five heat settings i'm sure it's around two or two and a half volts or something along those lines but it's absolutely incredible when i think about the battery experience combined with the cartridge although i although it couldn't fit with this one i do feel that the luxuriousness of this cartridge of the the hardware definitely will overcome the fact that it may not fit on all the different devices and just looks sexy and sleek you know this is working even though i had to twist off this little section it's still working and so i think that's wonderful um score out of 10 presentation appeal taste color smell potency um what i recommend hell [ __ ] yeah um experience you know this this for me you know price point depending on the at the at the store this to me is probably a 9.5 out of 10. uh what gets me is going to be 0.25 on the genetics and 0.25 on the terpene testing again we want to know if it's 100 cannabis terpenes we want to know what the terpene profile is at least the you know two or three of the main flavors that we're getting and then the genetics is always helpful to understand the lineage and some more information overall i think this product is immaculate i think napalm cannabis company whether it's the grenade or these items or some other ones that are coming down the line they do a really spectacular drop of the branding so shout out to ted in exhibit putting this together 9.5 out of 10. absolutely incredible from the flavor to the taste to the experience and the high you name it go check it out let me know what you guys think in the comments this is jpeg here man doing a respect my region west coast we tour review 2020 baby we got more reviews coming vessel go check them out i'll see y'all down the road baby west coast we tour peace", "25ZPhrmHCNs": "holy [ __ ] that one that one was hot I'm excited to have my hands on this so I can finally give it a try this is the 710 labs life resin pod I've had a lot of 7-10 labs concentrate to my day but this is totally new to me I haven't even opened the box yet yeah comes with a little instruction manual and the pot got a live little peek C logo they put it on all the cartridges I always just pull it off I'm not gonna lie it looks like there's pretty good stuff in there it looks super thick I usually [ __ ] with 7/10 labs so I expect this to be a pretty good experience here's what it looks like with the battery that you have to buy separately because I don't know any other battery company that makes up pod for this this is [ __ ] weird I don't know any company that has a pod like this and I don't know any battery company that makes a battery like this so this is super unique I don't really think that's a good thing but let me try the pin out before I voice my opinion [Music] that's pretty smooth really doesn't have a crazy taste I hid it until it wouldn't let me hit it anymore it's on a full charge I don't think this battery changes heat settings but it does have like a light indicator here and when it's green it's above 50% then when it's 20 percent to 49 it'll go to blue and then it's at red when it's below 20 percent battery so that's kind of cool you can know where your battery life is actually at all right that hid a little better in swears usually the first date of a car or a pen usually the best one and then it just gets progressively worse but that second head was way nice done the first one I want to point out the definite difference in color between the box and the actual pen like this is a actually angry oily color and then on the box it looks like it's like bright yellow I've had the Z or Z before I thought it was called C Oz but the guidance offender told me it's called zoz so I've been going with it when I dad did it tasted a lot better than it does out of this pen but this is their cure for which is like their lower level actually believe it's the lowest here I think they just do it 1 2 3 or 4 so that might be one of the taste isn't that great it's not bad but like I've had some cards recently where I'm like damn this is so [ __ ] flavorful and there's light pressing cartridges this is a la Crescent cartridge and I'm really not getting a crazy flavor up [Music] definitely starting to feel the effects a little bit and then nice little head higher I do want to say it is very smooth this is a waste another hit that I really ever expected out of a cartridge this is definitely some new technology I really don't think I like it though like this battery shape I do really like actually it's pretty sleek but the charger and the USBC and like who has that I mean I actually like you so I guess I can't fish but I have one USBC charger in my house and I have like 50 normal USB chargers I don't think a lot of people have USB C charges just laying around like a couple people do but not like the vast majority which is I think what you should still hate or - I know 7/10 laughs is more of a higher-up company but it's just like they were like how could we make this as difficult as possible let's find a pallet battery that nobody has ever used before so people have to buy the battery now let's give them an annoying charger like I don't know I feel like they were just like trying to be annoying when they were making this battery but for all I know in two years this battery is going to be the standard and I'm probably gonna be eating my words and they were totally ahead of the game [Music] this really doesn't give you a long blinkers man the design on this pen is definitely cool it's pretty trippy I like how it kind of wraps around the side of the pen so each side you get a little bit of something like doesn't have that weird no sniffle either I just realized you know how sometimes when you smoke a cartridge you're like really tickles your nose this is not that at all the total THC is 80 point four one percent and the total CBD is 0.1 nine and eighty percent THC is pretty high for a pen actually a lot of especially on the black market a lot of pens though a 97 percent THC and a cartridge and it's like bro if your pen is 97 percent THC like it would not burn them those wicks that is not possible honestly anything above 80 is not gonna burn very easily in a normal cartridge so I've always been wearing when I've seen like 85 90 percent even in the PA market I've seen it before I've seen th see that's like 95 percent THC just to live like tested in a jar and it's like a [ __ ] Rock I just don't see how I could possibly get that in the cartridge damn that is actually Sunday pretty hard now yeah dude 710 labs get your [ __ ] baked sorry for the lack of content on my page recently you guys got some big things on the way I don't want to share them until it's officially out but I'm super excited to share with you what I have going on with popcorn in the near future and obviously when I was in Denver the last week of it we got my dog spayed so I was actually like kind of busy being attentive to her and then since I've been back I've been getting my house ready because my girlfriend's actually moving in with me her lease is up in September but she's just kind of over being in Colorado so she's gonna fly here with Piper next week so I've been getting my house prepared because I've lived here by myself the entire time which there's enough space for both of us but I've definitely spread out all my [ __ ] so I've been consolidating stuff and you know just getting everything prepared so when she moves back here she can just move right in I was thinking about doing another Q&A video too so if there's any questions you have you can leave a comment in the YouTube video I'm gonna try to pull as many off yours I can oh my god man I'm setting to get pretty [ __ ] big I'm not gonna lie oh my god feels good to be back you ever get like so big sometimes that you feel like you're like a different person so and you're like wow I like literally feel like I'm like an alter-ego all of a sudden like I am not the same person I was 20 seconds ago nothing really anything serious it's just like you were like in a bad mood and now all of a sudden you're just carefree like well it is like Jeff too has arrived it is a whole new version of me I remember the first time I took a gigantic dab it was like four weeks into that like I was thinking blobs but like I don't like a half gram that like it was ridiculous and I remember like I was so high but like I was almost tripping if you guys have seen the movie the masks where Jim Carrey has like this alter-ego were he like puts on a green mask and he's like a totally different like crazier person I felt like that was me oh whoa okay I am the man in the mask right now holy [ __ ] like I am lit but usually I'll just get super awkward what am i honestly I'm super awkward when I'm sober it's like a social anxiety I have I just I don't know I don't know what to say sometimes I don't know what to do like what I do with my hands work put like what the [ __ ] I'm just weird brah but please if you ever seen me in public and want to say I feel free to even though I'm a little after it I really don't mind I think it's going to meet you guys it kind of helps but I face the the people I'm making videos for and all I are super [ __ ] chill I don't know what it is but everyone haven't met it's been like nothing but kind of friendly Beckham I say what's up oh but I'm curious how long this is going to take the bat out still looks like there's a decent amount of oil in there two giant air bubbles on this side really doesn't have the best taste though like the highs nice it's okay when you actually think with just a glee about buying your own separate pen having to have this whole separate pot system it's just too much the flavor was alright at first but it's really really lawful flavor it's like resin it's not dis Calypso it should be a little bit better flavor you think but I am getting so high yeah I really honestly think I'd rather just buy gram of 7/10 left like Ross and the BIOS pen and battery I feel like at least at the cost of what it is now I feel like this is going to be more of a gimmicky thing or more for like the heady boys that just want to have it but really isn't for like that everyday smoked beer like this isn't really something you need to have oh I guess where these blinkers aren't too rough on you I'm trying something to spend in one sitting but I don't know if it's gonna happen guys this really shouldn't taste as bad as it does for the amount of oil that's still left in there there's gonna be a long day boys holy [ __ ] that one down what was i that [ __ ] hurt oh my god that was intense but double records how you do it boys oh my god [Music] oh yeah it tastes like [ __ ] that - we'll just burn through it right oh my god I'm getting so I I have to be getting pretty close to the end there's some giant air bubbles in there please and soon and drops in this video if you take one second just like like for me I would really appreciate it it goes a long way you'd be surprised what a like would do so if you're watching any of my videos and you like it please click like I'd really appreciate it this one's for everybody that clicks like triple oh my god hope you got oh that hurts a bad one I do that goddamn whoo it's weird how a pen high is so much different than like a weed high it's looking at joint we're so gonna pen like if I took this many hits of a joint I would be a totally different high it's not like I'm not high though it's just that like a joint just hits different and like weed dabs just hit different than pens I don't know what it is I feel like if I took it dab with the amount of stuff I just smoked chances are I'd be higher off the dad I don't know though maybe that's just me god be suck no no I to die one have so many levels of emotions on me so I'm like this is awesome it's like it's okay it's like all right that's pretty cool it's like this sucks like this isn't such an emotional roller coaster I really don't know how to feel about these when I had the live resident of the cr-z it was way tastier than this like I was actually like my blood how pasty it was I was like wait this is Rossum like that's how good I thought it was and then now I'm like hitting this pen only yeah this is trash I don't think I've ever had any string of seven ten laps that was Tier four so maybe once they hit Tier four it is really just like the bottom of the barrel but there's so many better things you can buy at the dispensary instead of this and RJ even from 7-10 labs like the amount of money it cost for a battery and the pot itself it's like just by a grandma live rosin it'll go a lot longer and be a lot more enjoyable like this this sucks no cold is this telling me I don't see it anywhere dude the amount of information Colorado gives you is nuts like versus Pennsylvania like this is the one thing that blows my mind this is the kind of information you get out of one of your most popular Colorado companies you know you get the THC CBD batch number yada yada in Pennsylvania they have the date of his package do they have like a code for the person who packaged it they have the THC the CBD the CBN the CBC all that [ __ ] there's so much more testing in Pennsylvania you really have a better idea what you're actually smoking when you get [ __ ] from PA it cost so much goddamn money though [Music] this thing's hitting hard however it tastes like [ __ ] dirt getting up triple I'm so so almost empty you can see my hand oh my god I decide to ever oh my god you guys I'm so [ __ ] high it's not getting any better but hits are a little less intense though so that's giving me hope that this pods almost done if there's one thing I can say it's that the pod is in full effect right now I still stand by my statement that taking it dab of this amount would give me higher though I actually asked my battery's about to die and I feel like I got close enough that's what I'm gonna call the video I'm not gonna smoke any more of this so click like if you enjoyed I really did not enjoy this pot but if you enjoyed the video make sure you click like subscribe for more video it's got a lot more on the way leave a comment let me know a Q&A question for a future video but thank you guys so much for watching my name is Jeff peace I'll hit you with a goodbye rip",

for those great positive comments man in the comments in the comment section below appreciate it hashtag real smokescan you guys rock dog peace", "WybKEbikSXU": "what's going on youtube financial both ask us we're gonna be doing another video today for you guys i really appreciate you guys for staying tuned you know my bad you know i've been a little busy it's just kind of [ __ ] up right now in the world you know there's a lot of [ __ ] going on but i really hope you guys are doing good out there you know you got to stay blessed but other than that guys like i said i've been pretty good myself so today i ended up going to my dispensary because i rather have a [ __ ] cartridge so i mean i love smoking on cartridges it's just easier to like just to get back to wherever you want you know what i mean so um big shout out to the new subscribers uh i really appreciate you guys you know for taking the time and watching my videos that really means a lot to me and for the ogs who've been here you guys are the real mvps um if you guys haven't out of the instagram or snapchat go ahead and do so i really appreciate that everything will be down in the link below not in the link in the bio below my bad so so yeah guys i ended up getting this elite live resin honestly select has been pumping out some bomb ass flavors literally yesterday i went and they had like a shitload of fly resin flavors i didn't know what to pick so the one that i really stand out the most and there was the last one it was a apple fritter crust blueberry muffin now that sounds hella good and it's a live resin cartridge as you guys can see i couldn't wait so you know how to pop that [ __ ] open and get straight to it you know um so it says enhance live resin i paid like around 45 flat for this no tax is just 45 flat it's not bad you know if you get what you pay out here so if you you spend like 20 30 on a cartridge it's not going to be as good but it still gets you high but like the flavor won't be there so mostly all live resin cartridges range from like 40 dollars and up so i really love select you know their flavors are really spot on and like i said they have a shitload of flavors so this is the cartridge itself it looks it looks nice you know it's not like a dark amber like other live resins are which is uh which is pretty dope you know i don't really care for it i mean i've resin in it the thing i like about it it comes with these little stickers you can put on your cartridge on it and it says uh the name it says the strain and the thc percentage so the thc percentage on this is 86 thc guys which is pretty high for a cartridge which is good you know select so that cartridges always range from like 80 and up so you guys the the quality on this is amazing it doesn't even move at all and you know i was expecting like a really dark amber color to it but i guess not you know this every live resin is different but it's pretty it kind of comes with his own little sticker you could put on the cartridge it has a tc percentage and the strain on there it's apple fritter cross blueberry muffin looks hella good you know with the clear tip on it these sea salt cartridges always hit dc show you guys a little bubble test because i know you guys like to see the bubble test make sure it's nice and thick it's good quality you know my dispensaries always legit like one of the best prices in town some of the best prices in town and yeah guys let's get straight to it cheers first hit of the day one of the reasons i really love select is that their cartridges [ __ ] hit these c cells with the clear tip on it these are the ones to get they always give you a fat hit man wow now the taste on it um it has like a weird specific taste to it it doesn't taste like apples or blueberry muffins it just tastes like a combination of like fruity flavors and it tastes [ __ ] good you know it has like that live resin taste to it and it's choking as well you know this cartridge is like 86 which is not bad you know you're definitely gonna get baked the [ __ ] with this and then you think i'm trying out guys hold on i made this over time the thing i'm trying out i used to always [ __ ] with sativas so honestly there's not that much flavors in sativa when it comes to like select so most of the good most of the good flavors are like indicas and indica hybrids you know what i mean so i'm trying out some indicas right now and most of the flavors are pretty good you know i [ __ ] this is like my fourth select live resin cartridge and honestly they're all [ __ ] fire they all have like a specific taste to it they're all different like rock garden they all kind of taste the same to me i don't know if i'm tripping but i've smoked live resin cartridges so much they all kind of just taste the same to me that's kind of one of the reasons i kind of stopped smoking raw garden just i don't know i kind of got tired of the same taste all the time so i started [ __ ] around with select selects pretty good ursa is pretty good you have friendly farms out which is pretty good but friendly farms just has like disposables i don't i [ __ ] hate disposable you know they don't really give you a big cloud you know but they're pretty good i have had those before but maybe i'll do a review on those pretty soon hopefully you guys smoke a lot with me this is the third kit i'm going in guys i put it on the lowest temperature now i was in like medium heat so kind of turn it down a little bit even on the lowest setting you get big clouds oh [ __ ] and it tastes a lot better i don't know to me it tastes like a pineapple like it tastes like something i don't know something i look good in there but i guess to me it tastes like um like a pineapple you know but it's uh apple with the blueberry muffin apple fritter with slash blueberry muffin which is a crazy strain you know this is what it came in it's just a simple box you know just says welcome to the better that's your new packaging for the live resin and yeah guys um no my bad like i said you know i haven't been pumping out as much videos like i had like i used to but i'm gonna be back on the grand guys videos every saturday or friday i'm gonna try and do more if i have the time but don't worry guys this it won't happen again you know i've been slacking a little bit but yeah guys you know [ __ ] happens so it's good to be back and i really hope to hear from everybody on here doing ribs i mean if you guys ever had the live resin cartridges from select let me know how that how was your experience with them do you guys like them and maybe how much do you guys get them for out there i've never seen fake ones out there before but i've been seeing some guys on my snapchat setting them like by the box like you know by the boxes and i'm like what the [ __ ] i don't think they're gonna be real so let me know if you guys ever had a fake one before but these are pretty good guys i'm

Angie [Music] Angie don't taste no oranges well maybe you are yeah you protect orange I don't know something like a tangerine yeah okay nevermind there is a taste towards the end once it won't buzz became the best medicine right now if you like rock gardens basically similar tastes the same yeah [ __ ] yeah so yeah I appreciate it again so we got two opinions orange tangerine a dirty look see what I think let's see what you think hey not bad from Moxie very uh it tastes like weed I would say but I don't know if the orange is trash aw I get more like a thought was to smoke like I felt like I'm a smoking weed yeah like I'm hitting we are almost up to me my earthy but I'm actually care that's why I mean my aura theater you're definitely like I'm the he didn't like a joint yes to me it tastes like that I don't know tastes like I'm better than joint you guys you really think Soren jizz I don't say it's oranges or earthy though I would see like a little bit like I don't know maybe towards that you like a sweetness sweetness but also I picked up Papa herbs another one but they're Papa's og so we're gonna try their own [ __ ] strain not in this video obviously but you know first the Papa Shoji it they all smell the smell the same okay they all smell the same yeah but I'm gonna take one more hits what do you your thoughts on this cartridge it's not like start like this really I would say this is better than the other boxes I've had sure like some some like pins are like some sure yeah it makes me feel like I'm like I'm in a different place like this makes me feel like Yosemite or something like spores okay anyone else I would say like a 1 through 10 this play like a seven maybe an extra 7 ok it's definitely good and the price was a only 39 out the door so not bad no it's not but then again just because I bought it for 39 does not mean you'll buy it for 39 you know I know LA prices are very very high so just keep that in mind but yeah oh yeah I'd say that to my Google opinions yeah it's not an opinion aspect okay but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video anyone got anything to add to us man oh yeah shower and they come when I saw you or Nick Cooper [ __ ] I'm bad with names but James stay lit stay safe stay home stay home and basically staying safe right okay just vibe have a good day I enjoy life to the fullest oh all right peace out guys [Music] [Music]", "o-nBECgquZ8": "all right been hitting this for a little bit now about five ten minutes I gotta say the effects are good it's just that at that price point you know sit over 60 bucks there's just other carts that are available that are gonna be give a better effect and so this is a you know I know this is available in multiple states but I'm talking about most California and Nevada in California you know select lead arrow Pro I would imagine Korova is probably stronger based on what our reviewers tell me about it than this this I would you know in Nevada roots is definitely better select lead arrow Pro you know and just the fact you can get better cartridges for less you know routes cart in Las Vegas is gonna run you like 45 you know range so it's about 15 dollars cheaper than this you might be able find this a little bit cheaper some dispensaries and maybe even save a 5/10 but you're still paying more than the routes is stronger AeroPro you do have to get a separate battery but those are stronger to and select elite doesn't taste as good as either three but stronger than this so even at another live resin cartridges the most recent I tried was the remedy live resin and I would say that they have better oil they have crap hardware if remedy took their oil and put it in this Harbor that would be an awesome cartridge you know even the clone or they're using now still pretty good but this at 60 you know it's a good cartridge and you know if you're getting a good deal on Vince cartridges and you're not paying 60 a pop it's probably worth that you know if it's on par with like regular cartridge prices sure but I would say even if it was on par with it was the same price as real same price as arrow Pro you know and these or select I would probably go with those still not bad it's a good cartridge if they were running a deal on these I would for sure get them so that's removed my review of bins and I'll throw the straight up on top now when we we look at the pictures but yeah I mean it's pretty strong it's just not best of best and as far as I've seen it so far it costs best the best prices so thanks for watching guys is dad connection and have a great week", "qdtZpjteg9c": "yo welcome to the THC spot thank you guys for tuning in today I'm gonna open and review Durbin poison buddies live resin liquid diamonds yep it's a

out there right now in 2019 so basically went to pretty much my favorite dispensary ever went to this place called high tide and Oceanside and it was exactly the way I would imagine a dispensary should be where everything is just super high vibration everyone in there is full of love and joy you can just tell that as soon as you walk in the door they've got crystals everywhere you know amethyst crystals they've got salt lamps it's a very low dim just everything is just wonderful and everybody in there really knows what's going on so first of all shout out to them guys that was my favorite dispensary I've ever been in I would buy a house out here and move out here just to have that as a local dispensary because I don't see that replicated anywhere anyway getting on to this cartridge right here Cresco labs they're a wonderful brand she shared with me all of the charity work that this company does all of the different organizations they're involved with and she said it's a very high vibration company who's doing some great things in the cannabis industry basically these guys just are doing it up right now I've already opened this cartridge and been using it for about a day or so I love it it's wonderful it's it's great but I'm still gonna do this as if it were so basically I'm interested in the live resin cartridges not so much interested in the distillate with the re-added terpenes that's just basically what everything is out there I'm interested in the live resin cartridges which are not adulterated at all they're completely full-spectrum nothing else added to it love it so anyway this stuff is wonderful Crisco this cartridge is a high quality cartridge you have the glass and so basically we're gonna try this out on a pen that I really like and that's going to be this pin right here which is an open alright let's see what happens okay light and that is the lowest setting I was always always like to test on the low setting mmm oh that's wonderful no burn no harsh no hot there's the tickle on the back side the Terp tickle the Terp tick yeah that's good this is a high quality cartridge very very high quality cartridge yeah this is on point", "3ZFmpeVsXCw": "[Music] hey what's up everyone Robert here and welcome to today's review of the newly released modified banana cartridge from Blue River cartridges and vaping have become an increasingly popular method of consumption in today's markets blue river has already begun offering two unique variations of a 100% solving this cartridge for users to enjoy first off let's start the cartridge itself as opposed to using resin which is commonly used in a lot of products like these all blue Burkhardt releases will feature a 100% real glass encased cartridge paired with a ceramic bullet tip if you're drawing on your cartridge from a Blue River brand an APD seat battery the first thing you'll notice is a very prominent haptic feedback this is the unless you know that proper air flow is occurring from the cartridge and you're getting the very best of the salt in the soil inside secondly the oil inside the modified banana cartridge was born from a truly unique collaboration sourcing gmoe full melt from Kaali extracts whole plant honey banana from bottom-up farms an incredible blend of gas funk and sweet plantain meet your taste buds and deliver a long-lasting potency this jelly sauce achieving a total of 85 percent cannabinoids 7% of which being mouth-watering terpenes lastly if you're using the AV DC battery remember to not overtighten a magnetic attachment thus allowing proper air flow throughout the cartridge drop it in the battery and take a draw from anywhere between 7 to 10 seconds [Music] well thank you everyone for watching and I hope you get to try the new modified banana cartridge very soon see you all next time [Music]", "-H3-2wI6q88": "yo hey guys and welcome back to my channel it's your boy real maddie smokes and today and today guys we have

feel like a freaking vampire bro what the hell", "N2rKR9IMdFQ": "[Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another alpine live resin cart they gave me three strains so there will be three videos you know what i'm saying so in this video we're gonna be smoking on the gmo and you guys already know what that is someone said is garlic mushroom onions or whatever i don't know what it stands for the acronym but we just know that gmo is usually good most of the time you know so we have the alpine limited edition gmo cannabis live resin or cannabis oil or live resin cannabis as well okay [ __ ] it up you could pause it from going too fast also check the sides so this is the second alpine live resin card that i've tried and the first one was phenomenal towards the end it kind of did get clogged but you know with every cartridge that has ever been made it clogs mostly towards the end so you can't really fault him for that but very enjoyable experience from the skittles punch so i'm excited to try this and i did feel like maybe i didn't give this uh its fair share of the battery because 2.6 didn't really do much we're gonna just start it at three and see just you know do the battery so with the alpine you got your manual got the cartridge itself i like this color i love it so let's just smell this doesn't really smell like anything but here is the cartridge itself i'm going too fast i'm sorry you could pause but very nice so we're going to be using it on obviously the alpine battery at first but we're also going to be using on a third-party battery the shiv so but cheers guys see the battery didn't really hit that well so generally with live resins especially new cartridges start on the lowest um but you know from my previous video i did do 2.6 nothing really came out so i'm gonna try it again i'm gonna do a half a one and a half so i like how this tastes drastically different than the skittles punch it does not taste the same at all but it has its own unique taste it's very enjoyable i would say maybe my favorite out of the two is the skittles punch because it did have a sweetness towards it or towards the end and i really enjoyed but this is not bad i'm taking another hit see the hits aren't all that there with these batteries but luckily i do have this we can just uh maybe it's just i don't know i don't know what it is but i'm actually gonna up the ante we're gonna put 2.8 [ __ ] it right so cheers guys oh so you're not gonna get the fattest hits from these alpine cartridges and i i feel like it's because we're starting it at a low voltage we're not really putting it on the highest voltage to get that vapor because you'll burn off the terps that way but just smoke a little bit more than usual you know i'm saying take a little few more extra hits than usual and it should get you just as high i really enjoy it the experience is pretty pretty phenomenal especially for these cartridges that aren't even out yet this is their first run of cartridges in the live resin market good good stuff so take another hit cheers let's let's let's go into eight [ __ ] it all right eight let's go to three so cheers so far i'm enjoying the alpine live resin cartridges very enjoyable i wouldn't be able to compare to the first one because i've never tried their first cartridges that they've had but if i had to compare this live resin to other live resin cartridges on the market it's definitely up there among the top five so yeah i'm gonna take one more here for you guys and pull it towards the light to show you guys that you know maybe it's just the light that doesn't show the cloudage but cheers peace out guys [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "VkWO2BFFJy0": "how's everybody doing this is John let's see sors and we've got a good one for you today alright well today we're going to be discussing one of the most recent of eight bands the one here in Washington State and some ways to get around it if you do vape THC concentrates well we have here in front of us this is like it says this is distillate this is THC distillate this is watermelon flavored champagne Kush this is one gram we're looking at a THC of abrupt 78% the total of cannabinoids of 84% all right now what we have here is 1 2 3 4 5 5 grams of concentrates this is all dis little strawberry lemon-aid pineapple watermelon pineapple watermelon now what we're going to do is we're going to show you some of the workarounds seeing as how you can no longer buy a flavored cartridge in Washington State now you used to be able to just buy a cartridge much like this that is already filled with distillate at the local shop now this particular cartridge is a si sell by Jupiter research very high quality cartridge you could normally go down to the store buy one of these full of concentrate and and you'd be set well recently our governor decided that due to children vaping and some of the deaths related to vitamin E additives and THC cartridges he's removing all flavored THC distillate cartridges from the market well seeing as how he's done that we no longer have access to high quality cartridges with good quality distillate in them I feel that is not a positive thing well it also opens up the market for black markets products to enter and people to try using them instead of the much more safe legal methods as such I decided to come up and show you a couple of the methods that I'm going to use to stay safe whenever I vape now this distillate is still available it will not be marketed as a vape distillate it will be marketed I do believe as an edible that is the way they can get around this it is watermelon flavored distillate nowhere on it doesn't say that you should smoke it or that you should vape it it is technically watermelon flavored distillate and as such should be eaten okay that makes sense very nice the same can be said for the pineapple the strawberry lemonade all the different flavors so you can go down to the store and you can buy these one thing they will not come with this nifty little green tip because this is specifically used to fill up a cartridge so you will not have access to one of these that's fine now if you have any of these old cartridges that you got when they were full if you got a high quality C cell cartridge much as this one and it does not have the metal band across the top here then you should be able to unscrew the top and refill the cartridge with distillate I will show you how to do that as option number one now that will be option number one refilling a standard C cell cartridge I do not recommend filling them more than three times one two three that means you get it and it's full you refill it and you smoke it you refill it and you smoke it that should be it if you do it again it's on you that's the way I say it that is one gram we will refill in a C cell cartridge this is a company called unite vape where then is the email address that is their website that is their phone number unite vape where makes a a couple of different vape products this is one of them this is the all-in-one Evie one vape in this specific pin has a battery and a cartridge attached to it it's very nice it's one use disposable it's metal very high quality you unscrew this mouthpiece you fill it up with one half gram of oil much the same as you would do with that that's our second method now the third method we are going to use this is a pod system this is from eye crusher this particular pod system is called the Zen what this does is this is utilizes a battery with a different pod to refill to utilize to smoke with here is the pin with no cartridge in it here is the cartridge before it is filled now this is a one-gram cartridge I will be filling it up placing the lid on it and showing you how this operates now the fourth method that I will be utilizing is from a company called transferring transferring vapes transferring vapes manufactures a very different multitude of cartridges we believe will be utilizing some of their 810 cartridges this has its AIT's right here this is an 810 half milliliter with 2 millimeter inlet holes 1.6 ohm coil as you can see the size of those holes on that are very large for a thick distillate now I will be pairing that up with one of their batteries this one's pretty neat it operates on touch one two three four five one two three one two three one two three four five so that's kind of neat well without any further ado let's get right into it first things first this is the Zen cartridge or pod right here this particular unit utilizes a data cable I forget the name of the particular data cable comes in a very nice box my cursor VAP different this is the cord that they are utilizing for charging this particular unit [Music] now first things first you pick a distillate I'm going to pick watermelon open up your distillate now you want to get a dispensing tip apply it to your syringe because you definitely want to be able to accurately dispense your product now [Music] [Music] [Music] now I'm not overly showing you the full way to fill this up yeah I've got that on some of my other videos what I'm doing here as I'm just trying to show you some of the different methods that you can use to still vape after this vape ban all right now that is not the cleanest method that I've ever used to fill one of these sons of [ __ ] up but as you can see the hole in the middle is clear my above the outside edge is just like that put that plug right in there this is the top it squeezes right down and then clicks just like that that is one gram of watermelon flavored distillate in these in I don't know if you can hear that or not but is this is magnetically operated and when it connects there is a vibration allow you to know you have successfully connected it all right well there we go that is one done right there that method right there works quite well you should be like I said you should be able to order some of these I crusher Tom I crusher dot-com they different if this seems like something that you like this method right here these pods are purchasable we'll let that sit for just a little bit and we'll see how that turns out after after a bit we'll we'll give that a hit next up this one here is always a very popular method reusing an old cartridge okay there is definitely 100% nothing wrong with reusing an old cartridge as long as the cartridge is a high quality cartridge and it's one that you think works well now as such we're going to take some pineapple and we're going to fill up this C cell with it this already has some oil in it but not very much so shouldn't be too much of an issue filling this thing up alright let's open this thing up and we will get right on it all right so here it is now I would like everyone to know just so there's no confusion I uh I warm up all of my distillate before you see it hit the screen so I just turned the camera back on after warming up this distillate and that's why that bubble moves right like that because I'm about to refill a cart with it and I don't want to be here for a half an hour I never put additives in my distillate I don't use this lip that has additives in it distant need additives put into it and that's about all I can fit down in that son of a [ __ ] because it needs to uh just settle down in there which it will slowly over time in order to see it starting to so we'll set that sit there for just a minute that's number two refilling a standard cartridge this is the all-in-one I'm extremely happy with the all-in-one so far they work really good in my opinion these two here are both half grammars I'm going to be filling them up with some strawberry lemonade here so like I said the strawberry lemonade I'll be utilizing it to fill it up with and let's get this ready all right here we go once again we have this strawberry lemonade right here put the tip on tine there down take the lid off of this would be the transferring a ten cartridge with the two millimeter holes and that sumbitch is cracked right there he sits of it he just cracked that glass cartridge just [ __ ] cracked right there so [Music] that's uses his [ __ ] tits right there very very nice high quality you can tell why that shafts that big I have no idea as you can see it clearly does not have to be [Music] [Music] [Music] now we let that settle down in there a little bit all right [Music] put that lid way back on there [Music] [Music] let that sit there for a little bit so here we go this is the transferring cartridge a 10 all right they have a trans brain all right well now let's let this settle on down in there see what we got all right so here we are back first things first what we have here is four different methods for vaping THC distillate now whenever you get THC distillate and you put it in one of these pens you need to understand you probably won't be getting it back so if you put it in a bad cartridge you may lose that distillate and that stuff's not cheap it's one of the reasons I do this now first things first if you have a C cell cartridge that already had oil in it and the top screws off and you can just put more oil into it well I got to tell you that method does work all right now you will be tasting whatever flavor you had in here before and you will never really get a good clean flavor out of this because you already used it plus the coil has already burnt up a lot of oil that may have a burnt flavor to it it is what it is this one right here this is from the United Way of this is the Evie all-in-one pen very very nice here is their contact information now this is a quite quite nice pen I like this quite a bit it would like I says 400 million power battery ceramic coil very nice now this one right here you put your oil into it you screw the lid onto it and then you hit it that's it cut-and-dried very easy 1/2 gram capacity you buy it you fill it you smoke it you're done just like that very very nice all right this right here is the eye crushers in this takes a full gram just drop it right on in there the vibrates let you know what's working has variable voltage functions on the bottom of this button very nice but this is also just a hit and go [Music] this one actually has very nice flavor it's very user friendly the mouthpiece is long and cinder I haven't had a single problem with this one yet and I have used it quite a bit I would definitely say if you do like the square boxy style pod systems this one is a full gram and it is it isn't too bad so last but not least we have the trans spring right here this is another company that does different cartridges and this one right here I've hit this pin a couple different times then it works it works just fine this one that's a little harsh this one's actually quite a bit harsh I'm not sure why I looked at the voltages online and it says the Green is the lowest and as you can see right there it is green so I'm not really sure why it is as harsh as it is but there you have it Tran spring like I said transferring makes many different sized cartridges one grams half grams a couple different style batteries but I've never really honestly had very good luck with the transferring brand the C sell brand cartridges a big fan of those there is a link in the description if you would like to buy brand new C sell cartridges and utilize those that is what I recommend above all else these right here they are a half gram they are more expensive than a cartridge but they do have the battery they do taste very nice the flavors very good they are designed specifically for the cartridge that they are combined with so they work quite well these are just a couple of the options seeing as how you will still be able to buy the distillate in the syringe and you can add it to any one of these products to have yourself a nice thing that being said you guys have an absolutely beautiful day thank you so much for tuning in this is John with C&C connoisseurs we'll talk to you guys next time peace", "1jFtPFQ8z9g": "to the people that are new to dabbing and see all these consistencies and get confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all today i'm going to be dabbing on some garlic cookie sauce from grassroots let's crack the seal on this as you can tell it's super [ __ ] goopy i'm gonna try to keep it as level as i possibly can jesus christ dude the whole room just reeks of garlic trying to do this without spilling any there's literally just like a straight up layer of turp juice on top of it we're gonna mix this up a little bit make sure all those diamonds and terps get mixed together nicely just look how gloopy it is you guys this stuff's so hard to handle on a dabber bloop but it's fire i love the function of this recycler that's the perfect little drain let's get our dab ready i'm not kidding when i say this stuff's running you guys you really want to make sure you have a dabber that has some sort of scoop on it so you can make sure you get a decently sized dab all right let's go you guys [Music] this [ __ ] is crazy you guys i know i talk about garlic cookies a lot on my channel but the aroma and the flavor that you get from this is [ __ ] nuts like that aftertaste just stays for so long the dab is gone i've already taken it but i can still just taste that insane garlicky feeling and these are some great effects too i swear to god that one dab does the job but this is some live resin sauce most people just call it sauce though it's a pretty popular form of concentrate there's a lot of different terms to describe extracts like shatter butter batter crumble sauce diamond sugar the list goes on and on these names are used to describe the consistency and the malleability of the concentrate not the quality everyone has a preference on their favorite consistency but none are just bad off of the consistency so just don't overthink it when it comes to quality of an extract it really just comes to what the quality of the product is going into it and the knowledge and experience of the person who's actually doing the extraction process it's not like chatter means bad sugar means good but sauce is a pretty popular form of concentrate if you've been to a few dispensaries you've probably seen it or if you know a few plugs they probably got it it looks like a million tiny rocks swimming in a pool of like yellowy ambery liquid diamonds are their own form of concentrate typically they're on the bigger side and much less terpy where sauce is usually super tiny diamonds sometimes there's a couple big rocks in there but usually it's so small where you really can't even see them mixed with a crazy amount of terpenes but those little tiny diamonds are where the cannabinoids are so that's where majority of the thc is stored and the liquid portion is live resin terpenes so there's a super high percentage of terpenes in there and a super low percentage of cannabinoids which is why it's perfect to mix the two so the sauce might not get you very high alone but when you mix it with those diamonds it just packs a punch you get pretty [ __ ] lit and the terpenes add an additional entourage effect so it really does add an additional kick to the thc but i say it's time to take another dab [Music] uh oh [ __ ] this drink feels so awkward to hold i'm not gonna lie oh my god that train is [ __ ] crazy oh [ __ ] those terpenes are always super [ __ ] heavy on sauce so i usually try to make sure i get the strains i like when i pick it up i know i said that they're all pretty much the same thing but the main difference between sauce and every other strain is that it has like the most intense terpene profile plenty of other concentrates of high terpene profiles but the most overwhelmingly high is typically sauce and the terpene profile on this one is [ __ ] insane it's five point seven percent mercy and almost five percent carry off i mean four point five percent limiting and that's just the top three it's total terpenes is 18.4 if i did my math right like that's a lot of terps sugar also has a high terpene profile but it's a little bit more easy to work with let me open this jar real quick and show you what it looks like for those who don't know all right this is a fresh gram of bubba kush sugar as you can see it's still terpy but there's more of like a solid consistency to it there's still some sauce in there but there's much bigger diamonds that are a little bit easier to handle and work with these two are made of exactly the same stuff but have a completely different consistency but the main downsides the sauce in my opinion or how liquidy it is like i just said you really can't keep it in a hot environment you can't put it on its side for a long period of time and it's hard to work with on a dabber at least if you like big dabs like using a little needle like this would be so hard even using a scooper like this you really can't get too fat of a dab but looks are deceiving with sauce and sugar in my opinion if you're used to just only dab and shatter and you really haven't experienced sauce or sugar like you really don't realize how fat of a dab you're taking if you just scoop up a giant bit of it but again not all sauce looks exactly like this sometimes sauce looks like a mixture between the two concentrates that just showed you where they have a couple big rocks in there but it's majority that like super small diamond but a lot of companies really aren't that great labeling this stuff i bought some sauce before that was just straight up sugar i've bought some butter before that was sauce there's a little bit of like subjectiveness that comes to it where they're like i mean it's sugar but it's super terpy so let's just call it sauce they do try to label it as accurately as they can so that you can get a good idea for what you're going to consume nobody likes pissed off customers so they try to make it as accurate as they can but i'd be lying if i said i've never had it be a little off but to the people that are new to dabbing and see all these consistencies and get confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all it's the best way to find out which one you like and which one you don't and it's like none of these are bad technically so you can try shatter you can try sauce you can try butter and you can see which one you like the best but i say we take one more dab before we head out of here this time i'm not gonna use the diver though personally this is my favorite way to dab sauce hey that's fire now that's the right way to dab sauce a lot of people message me and ask me to like clarify what consistency of concentrate they have it's mostly people that get it from the black market because it's not labeled but i feel like i might start a series where i go from concentrate to concentrate and just kind of show them off let me know if that's something you'd like to see in the comments below but click like if you enjoyed this video if you made it this far you probably did and leave a comment let me know if you want me to make this a series and if so what concentrate should i do next don't say live rosin i already have a whole [ __ ]

into another episode of how to from cure to you with me your host Noah today we're gonna tackle something that we've heard a lot in our dispensaries as of late you're going through and you're seeing the difference between two cartridges one says liquid live resin the other one says co2 and my word what is the difference before we delve into that there's one thing that we need to understand before we can talk about the different extractions to make those and that's the trichome of the plant the trichome is actually that white kind of bulbous part you see on the dry leaf itself and today I have a visual aid so as you can see these are the trichomes you can see the nice bulb on top and the reason that these are important is because those trichomes housed all of the THC CBD all of our turf beans all those can monoids are found in that little Bowl right on top and the reason that that's important is because to make our cartridges and our concentrates we are extracting that trichome off the planet so now that we understand what a trichome is let's talk about the differences that we see in our dispensaries of co2 versus liquid live resin so first off we're going to talk about liquid live resin and the main difference between this and the co2 extraction is at its harvest point when the dry leaf itself is ready to be harvested in a liquid live process they harvest it and then they flash freeze the bud once they flash freeze the bud it maintains its whole plant structure and then it's put through the extraction process using a butane hash oil wash where it pulls the trichomes off of that frozen plant and it maintains its chirping profile a little bit more so so you get a little bit more of a flavorful more tasteful medication when it comes to a liquid live extraction process but the main key is is that they are frozen at the point of harvest I have my co2 cartridge here now and the main difference between that we go back to the harvest point for the co2 extraction we harvest the buds and then we dry and cure them which is just a fancy Dancy way of saying we remove them of their water weight in some times during that process we can strip away some of the terpenes and so with co2 process we've put a we harvest our plants we dry and we cure them we put them in the extraction machine and instead of using that butane hash oil or BHO they use co2 to strip away those trichomes off of the plant to create a more extracted and concentrated form of cannabis and that's the basic difference between the co2 and liquid live resin is at the harvest point remember liquid live resin is flash frozen flowers where the co2 is going to be the buds are dried and then cured and then put through the extraction process but wait a minute there's a third one that we see in our dispensaries that's now becoming more popularized and it's called a distillate a distillate is used creating co2 extraction methods but once it's extracting out those trichomes they separate the terpenes and the cannabinoids the smell and the taste of the flower from the actual THC and CBD and then they distill it out and they purify it to remove any unwanted products like your chlorophyll and your plants or any residual byproducts of the extraction process once those things are distilled they're purified they're reintroduced with terpenes to create a more pure cannabis experience when it comes to your flower so basically at the end of this we have like we live with the flash frozen buds we have the co2 where our buds are dried and cured and then put through the extraction process and the number-three that you didn't even know we were going to talk about is the distillation process to create that purified distilled product that's able to be used in a cartridge now the main question that we also hear is what is the difference is there any medicinal difference between them and right now there isn't really any evidence that states one way or the other that's co2 or liqui live is more medicinal a beneficial than the other but if we use our logical sense here if we have a co2 extraction process and we lose some of our terpenes and we know terpenes work with THC whereas liquid live we maintain some of those terpenes a little bit more so one could venture a guess and say that liquid live might be a little bit more medicinally beneficial for you but that's just based upon you know a to B B to C then and that's just my opinion right now but hopefully is the future the more we learn about this the easier this process becomes and sometimes hopefully those questions will be answered but right now I'm here to give you my expertise in this field and that's it we went over three cartridges we went over what a trichome is and now

\u00ebism\u00ed guys so we are we are one with YouTube I guess I don't even know but we got a new cart pharmaceutical rx I've never had one of these yet sour Joker live resin cultured this is what I don't get total THC 7404 you come down that s THC a 50 percent THC 29% so that's just down that up doesn't know it never does alright we got here we've got the cush one 18% but then it says that's 20 right here so it's like I don't get it whatever cartridge here we go pushes and leak Locker certified it's mixed with haze in East Coast Sour Diesel it's like I don't know how to get that Joker name like that but it's just exact same boxes dizzy state you know it's the exact same for the box business dizzy which is kind of weird alright out just a different anyway that's pretty cool Zen box cartridge there's no writing on no writing on it all it's a nice girl Jupiter Jupiter I love these battery they work very well we have a bong in the background and we got this guy you ain't hit a pen until you hit this telling that right now but let's try as is throw it on the pen here and give it a shot it looks like a nice cart full resin they're supposed to be all about their flavoring so we're gonna see sour Joker la pr\u00e9sence pharmaceutical rx Wow that taste very well I can't even tell you what it tastes like that just tastes good like one of the standard farms best cartridge like it has that standard farms well as that standard forms taste to food they'll make you call maybe once or twice a quarter block that's real [ __ ] good we're gonna blast it your boss oh there it is -

"[Music] what's up guys simplisik here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is uh another cartridge video but the title it said unrefined live resin cartridge very very much throwing shade at raw garden but it is the jetties extract and uh you will hear some background noise because rj is on the tv as well but shout out to rj eats if you haven't subscribed to him already please do he's around 730 31 subscribers so you know what i'm saying the goal is to get him to a thousand the short term goal long term goal obviously a million subs but a thousand should do you know so uh you have anything to say yeah that's it oh i like to mention is that this isn't the first jetties unrefined live resin card that i've tried i've actually tried rj's and uh it was a wedding cake and honestly very very good stuff uh i i do like to mention that the the wooden tip did kind of affect the taste initially but then as you exhale you do get that live resin so it kind of adds like a little little difference to it but as you can see right here for live resin it says 83 percent hopefully it can show yeah there he goes and then uh manufactured date all that stuff you can uh pause if i'm going too fast but as you can see unrefined and uh yeah let's just open it it says twist or cut so we're going to twist this twist it this is already open what the [ __ ] see right off the bat you do get the wooden tip very very nice looking oil right here like to mention that it's we've been taking hits off rj's not too much but uh a good amount and it's still like halfway you know so he's definitely last a little a little bit more about it but yeah all right we are going to put it in the tow tron and let's hit this cheers boys like to mention that this is also uh the strain is called cantaloupe haze so oh wow that's [ __ ] phenomenal that was a hitter i don't taste any cantaloupe but i do taste the very familiar live resin taste um i don't know it's very similar to that nug one that i had recently ambrosia i would say but very very nice very very pleasant very smooth and uh you know say what you want about the wooden tip it does make it a little bit uh more classy you know i'm saying like you you take a hit with this and drink some wine or some [ __ ] you know i'm thinking that's the fire dude good cartridge i like to mention that i purchased this at finos and it was 45 out the door so typical price of nug around here raw garden is priced like that too moxie's around 30 80 35 and then buddies around the same price as moxie so around the mid mid tier of the of the live resin cartridges you know uh or is it being top tier uh at like 54 to 55 bucks so but nonetheless very very good for them ten dollars cheaper uh than urza you know i would definitely consider this you know if you're not trying to spend too much on on a one gram cart let me take one more hit for you guys and blow it towards the light to show you that ain't [ __ ] around with these hits no i'm saying he's playing all right peace out guys oh i actually tasted the cantaloupe there wow very minuscule but very pleasant very enjoyable uh rj do you have anything to say to the people i guess

Tyler Greene today we're going to be covering diamonds and sauce versus shatter two forms of cannabis extract but what is the difference and how in fact are they similar those are the questions that we are going to be answering in today's video remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you are feeling these videos that helps us grow rich even more people and get our message out there so without further adieu let's talk diamonds and shatter I've got my Chuck B glass piece originating in the USA for today's video it's getting out of the Pelle case so I can show you what it looks like oh yes and we are gonna fill it with water you ready and here we go we are ready to kick off the video let's put this pillowcase away the old one 120 Pelle case what you need if you're traveling with your glass let's talk about the difference between shatter and diamonds and sauce we're gonna start with the most familiar form of extract that you've probably come across for ready it is shatter and this has been on the market since at least a few years ago but all the way people have been extracting cannabis going back to the last century recently shatter has become a much bigger thing lead partially due to the advent of medical legalization and recreational legalization in the States that is where this was first super popular and now extracts come in this form so what does she look like shatter can have different coloration but is generally gonna look a bit more stable than other forms of cannabis extract when you get shatter you will know it is shatter because it will literally shatter when you break it you can see from the way that it breaks although some of it may potentially be a little bit more sticky but basically shatter looks like this this is some lovely mimosa shatter we got beer 710 this is what shatter should look like if it is clean it might come in a different color look at the consistency look at the sort of golden hue and just just look at it guys you can see that that is some nice-looking chatter if it's tiny or if it has got too much chlorophyll or aged plant material eg trimming it it might be darker and you might see shatter that's like really dark almost black looking I wouldn't really want to dab that anymore but have done in the past how does it differ to diamonds and sauce well let's take you through what diamonds and silks of Diamonds themselves are almost pure THC a crystals basically 99 point something percent tetrahydrocannabinol where is the source is a mixture of Turks some cannabinoids and the flavonoids giving it this lovely rich flavor profile not being an extractor I don't know too much about the process of creating diamonds in source but the source is a really Turkey volatile cannabis extract that is on the other side of the spectrum to something like shatter shatter has a really nice stability to it although it may degrade into a more waxy like substance over time particularly when not refrigerated as those turps cannabinoids flavonoids begin to break down into a delicious extract soup that's when you'll see shatter waxing up diamonds and sauce basically is like honey sort of looking liquid the diamonds are the crystallization of that so that could happen when the extract has been left in a pressurized compartment over time it begins to crystallize and over the last few years the process has been honed and developed until we start seeing big thca crystals that look like rocks basically and that is diamonds and source I really like the flavor profile you get on this I think it's very hard to replicate the diamonds and sauce flavor profile in shatter or even in fact in other forms of cannabis extracts the more stable something is the less in my experience is the flavor some exploded in my mouth you know a lot whether it's with the Diamonds and sauces so volatile goes turps something which is unparalleled so this is some lemon skittles diamonds and sauce you might be familiar with the skittles strain skittles with that is a really popular Cali import strain lemon skills in their skills cross and this is the diamonds and source of that straight away I can tell you that out the to extract this one smells really nice this one smells about ten times nicer you get a little bit of the aroma with the shatter but with the diamonds and sauce it is really really stinky in a really lovely way for the lemon citrus the skills sweetness you know that fruity pebbles types or a sweetness I've got both of them in front of me I can smell this one and I can't smell this one diamonds and sauce is going to smell a bit stronger because of the volatile nature of the extract you know it's lighter pea sauce shatters a little bit more stable than that stability means that you can pick it up with your hand as you see with this shutter I can just pick it up and hold it and that is because it is nice and stable allowing me to do that without it breaking down I couldn't pick this up and hold it I'd get it sauce all over my hands and that would be a waste we need Abdul for that so that's a comparison between shatter and diamonds and source hopefully I haven't missed much out do feel free to add your input your insights in the comments section I think that people will be wondering what the difference is between the different forms of cannabis extract and Shatter versus diamonds and sauce is an interesting comparison should we dab some first of all we're gonna start with these shatter this is mimosa another really popular cannabis strain that I'm sure some of you would have heard of so you can say this is Shattuck is as I'm digging my dad's hole into it it's literally splintering off into little portions you need to be careful with shatter particularly when cold that you don't accidentally flick it off of your your parchment paper and onto the floor sometimes it can be harder to pick up with a dab tool than than with your fingers as this is proving because it's just not sticky we are ready to go live with this dab of mimosa shatter and I'll see you guys on the other side wow that mimosa flavor is delicious but I do find with shatter he's sort of got a very slight chattery taste to it so you sort of can taste the form of cannabis extract it is now a wonder whether that is actually the lack of volatile Terps meaning that it's not as flavorsome as other forms now there is also something to say about open-loop blasting versus closed-loop distilled butane both of these forms of extract are extracted using a solvent it looks like this it is called butane and it is the same gas as goes into your blow torches your clipper lighters etc obviously handling this stuff in an enclosed environment is dangerous it is extremely flammable that is why it is recommended that if you don't know what you're doing do not try this at home I've spoke to more than one extractor that has told me that they've had an accident in the past and it's not really a little accident when it involves things like explosions and fire so stay safe people there are safer ways to make your own extracts at home just look at rosin all right should we do a dab of the diamonds and sauce and see how it compares to that in the motor shaft that we just tried I think we should it isn't the best shape to dad till family in diamonds and source actually but I think we're gonna be able to to get your nights tab allows a these looks great guys we're about to do this tab right now and I'll see you on the other side tears folks [Music] wowsa oh man all the flavor got me that dad makes your eyes forward sometimes that was intense that was expansive that actually gave me the sweats guys been a long time since I got the sweats doing a DAB the flavor of the lemon skills diamonds and sauce is absolutely incredible through the coffin I was able to get that delicious sweetness you know just as it smells it tastes and I've been dabbing that all yesterday I'm really loving that flavor so which is my favorite out of diamonds and sauce and shatter it has gotta be the diamonds and source guys and girls it is a delicious form of cannabis extracts able to give me the sweat after all this dabbing that's pretty impressive and it is certainly particularly that version of it a winning flavor and dabbing experience shutter is nice but it's got that shattering flavor but I think with the Diamonds and sauce you get this like magical level of flavor that you don't really experience anywhere else saying that though with diamonds and sauce you definitely don't need a big dab those crystals of THC a are expansive and very very strong and I just experienced that from a normal-sized dad got me quite a bit high up and giving me the sweats which I don't mind it's been a while since a DAB has done that to me but what do you think of this video folks what is your favorite form of extract have you tried dabbing it they leave your comments below this has run on to 24 minutes of filming supposed to be in a three minute video that has been the video comparing the diamonds and sauce and the shutter that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching and keep token stepping

video make sure you like subscribe and watch the end for a chance to win a free grinder what's up I should play mastered my aka Anthony here for hop cannabis life and we're back with another review video today we're gonna be talking about a new product it has just come to the market I've been waiting all day to show you guys I haven't even opened it it's still staple in the bag isn't that something so we're doing a review from the bag okay this came from Burton creations in Columbus shout out to them and today we're gonna be talking about live resin syringes so a lot of people are familiar with these syringe products so I'm gonna read the information here but I'm gonna talk about why this is different from the ones you've already been buying in the program first of all let's go over the testing information here again this is a standard wellness product this is a live resin where is the other cartridges or the other surrenders you've been getting are just THC oil so the numbers here the testing here the TC is 550 milligrams and the CBD here's my favorite part is a hundred and twenty-five milligrams this is a distillate and this this particular product was created using a butane extraction process a lot of other dishes are created using a co2 extraction process a lot a lot of different people have different emotions about co2 extraction versus butane extraction so just so you understand and I'll put some more information on my website and everywhere else on the Ohio cannabis live page about these different extraction methods is that some extraction methods are better suited for some products than others so when it comes to making live resin part of the process involves you taking the cannabis and putting it into a freezer first and you do this to protect the plant from degrading typically when you take cannabis and you cure it in a normal method whether you cure it in a mason jar or you hang it up in a room let it dry and cure that way or in a barrel like some places do that is degrading the plant almost immediately so when you do live resin frozen live resin you freeze it first and then you put it into a butane extraction system - you couldn't use a co2 extraction simply because it just wouldn't work the the cannabis and the TCS and everything and terpenes everything with degrade faster so typically when dealing with live frozen resin it has to be a handle in a certainly different way than it would be if you were just making a co2 based distillate so a lot of people have concerns about butane extraction even myself I've had some concerns I have that opportunity to tour standard wellness and I have actually seen their butane extraction machine and I can tell you that it has a lot of safety measures involved with it utan extraction process also a lot of safety and it's you know it's relatively you know controlled environment that these things are done in and then there's also some testing and stuff done to make sure that the product is still safe so I can personally say that all the products that I've tried from all these growers including standard I feel that they're safe I haven't had any adverse actions person that doesn't mean that it can't happen to anybody so I'll just get that out there let's get that out of the way but you know with this syringe being in live resin like I say it's gonna be different than what you would be getting in a regular THC to still a syringe which as many of you who have been buying these since the program started obviously because you get more volume in the syringe than in the pen the pen is mostly half a round tins and with the syringe here we're getting a little bit close to a gram we're not we're not actually all the way to a gram we're at point zero we're 0.84 of a gram here so pretty close but we're not quite there yet part of the reason we're not getting to the grams because whenever they try to do a full gram it ends up being a higher potency and then what tends to happen is the state makes them take it instead of it being a one-day product that makes the product end up being a two-day product so I know many of you have wondered why these products are not coming to the fulgrim where every time they try to go fulgrim ends up being too strong for the states policy limit which you know it varies depending on what product it is there's a different potency limit for edibles there's different pulses little flower and there's different polti limit for these these concentrates and that usually caps around 69 70 % I do believe I could be wrong don't quote me on that but I'm pretty sure it's pretty close to 7% or less that these have to be at in order for them to be able to be approved and also like I said this stuff goes do additional testing that lets say flour doesn't necessarily go through it because the way it's processed in maize so they have to test it before they make the actual solution that distill it and then test it after they make it to steal it so it's kind of like testing it multiple times to make sure that everything guy you know everything is the way it's supposed to be I don't know exactly how much that cost but my understanding is it's a lot more expensive to get the concentrates tested than it is to get flour tested just because of the way the product is so let's go ahead and open this puppy up fresh as you can see it is sealed I have not opened it I don't know what I'm gonna see in here what colors don't look like I don't know so let's do this together one two three yeah we're open all right you've all seen but for those who haven't seen to open these bags you have to get your finger in between a little place here where there's like a little thumb thingy right here I'm pointing a finger and then you get your fingers in there and pull apart it's not too bad that's not the greatest thing all right so then here is the syringe whoa hey that looks really good now that looks like some go there that looks really really good I would say this is looking really really good so what I'd like to do is tell people that and this is something standard suggested this you want to kind of warm this cartridge up a little bit I'm sorry syringe up a little bit before you actually use it what I'm gonna be doing today is I'm going to be using my packs and I'm going to be using the oven that comes with the packs in order to do this review now just like I did with the RSO syringe if you saw that video what I like to do is I like to run mine under some hot water to get it lucid so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pause the video and I'm gonna go run this under some hot water for a few seconds and then I'll be back and we'll go ahead and load it in my packs and see exactly what it tastes like now by the way I didn't mention but this is actually the strain is called headband okay just to make sure I have covered that the strain name is headband so those that didn't catch that I'm sorry I couldn't see it the glare was because of the gold on the on the pack so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and pause this and go ahead and warm this up and I'll be right back alright I'm back so still looks the same - ie I recommend roughly 30 seconds of hot water you know and that's it just you know make sure you don't make sure the cap is still on it before you do it obviously you don't get water and your distill it that would be bad all right so I'm gonna go ahead and twist this off see it came off real easy you can see the fluid here now Ivan is empty okay and we're gonna go for small small amount you only need a dab folks so don't fill the oven up the oil should drop right in there and this in this oven is cold so there's no I like to do my cold so as you can see the distilling is in there and that is not a lot but that's enough for us to sample okay and then I put my I screw this back on there and it's clean all right so now you know I'm gonna go ahead and prep this up and I'm gonna go ahead and do my 30-second warm-up and like I said I think it's important to note that a lot of people do use these syringes to fill cartridges and that is something you can do and you still the process be saying you want to warm it up and then you would want to you definitely want to get one of those needles that didn't come with it little needle but there's a little new you can screw on the top of there to make it easier to get the oil into the syringe I mean into the cartridge I'm sorry and I think that that's something they might have to look at adding maybe a plastic one or something like that that will kind of make the refilling cartridge process easier but for me it's fine without it so now I'm a green light I'm going to go ahead and give it a taste hitman huh whoa yeah yeah let's do it water let's do doing the water folks is getting us get a water test going cuz this stuff's and tasting all right still in that same little bit the those guys are standard they doesn't did it again this is very smooth yeah I would say how am I feeling right now okay well when I sat down into this video I was in a lot of pain so I'm trying to assess how this is helping me for pain because that's what I got it for because I'm having pain where am I having pain that right now I'm having pain in my stomach where I had my hernia surgery and so I'm looking for relief for that specific issue at this point I'm not paying other funds to the disaster that is where I'm mainly having pain and I needed some relief so I'm going to pause this video for a second just to give it time to set in and then I'm gonna come right back and tell you how I'm feeling I'll be right back all right I'm back so it's been about 15 minutes or so and that lasted a lot longer than I thought let me check the oven here and see what's left it I hope she's my - ticked off my oven cuz could still be kind of hard you can see it's still smoking and well lo and behold look at that there is essentially nothing in there and kind of get a good angle and so it almost burned it completely clean I mean they say it was definitely a small dose but what can I tell you I tasted terpenes I'm not an expert on terpene so I can't tell you what terpenes I taste it but you know I think that that's something that we're gonna get you know some feedback on is that when they make these kind of products it will probably be a good idea to maybe get the terpenes either on the front kind of like what they do with another another cultivator or even to get the terpenes on the back so I think that that's certainly worth doing but really overall I'm feeling a little bit of relief I mean sometimes takes a little while for stuff to kick in but as far as my body and my mind I'm feeling relief from anxiety and stress and you know I'm definitely seeing some positive medicinal effects from this so I would say that this is a good product it tastes great it has a smooth taste if you saw my video I didn't call for choke at all and I took pretty good topes on that even after I pause the video and I continue to keep taking toks I still didn't have any really harsh hits my throat didn't burn so what I would say is the product is smooth smooth on the throat smooth on the lungs I did faith fit through packs with the convection heat so I can't really give a fair assessment a little be like in a pen with the coil heater but it's still similar is still heating oil vaporizing but in this situation like I said but packs it gradually heats the product and then you vaporize it verses with a pen it's pretty much one to man heat you know so it's like now so I think that that makes a difference you know if I hit a pin it sometimes can be a little harsh on my throat whereas if I hit the packs I can control the temperature a little bit more and I can turn the temperature down so I think that makes it useful so with that I'm gonna go ahead and wrap the video and say I think if you get you some had been live resin because it is different from the THC syringe you got before it's definitely gonna be tasty it's gonna be a little bit stronger and I think you're gonna feel the effects a little bit sooner than other products but again I think that you should definitely give it a try and should Boyd mastermind okay Anthony on how cameras live sign up see you next time 8 well thank you for watching my video make sure you hit

"UmT0yiIcFZs": "how's that bike that's easy connoisseurs and they got a good one for you today so today we are going to take this C cell 1/2 gram refillable cartridge we picked up at vape part smart comm and we're going to be putting some oil in it and showing you just how easy it is to make your own cartridges well here we go what we're going to be putting in it today is some dab ex gelato this is 92.9% total THC for a grand total of ninety four point three total cannabinoids as you can see the color on this is absolutely beautiful let's open this up and get to work okay there you go opens it up every time very nice very nice look at that color it's about as clear as it can get right there loving it now all of this is extracted using ethanol alcohol so it is definitely the way to go this is a good company they make really nice distillate it is quite thick so I do recommend a cartridge with large holes like this see cell first things first you need to try to acquire an applicator tip this is very simply a very large syringe tip to administer the distillate into the cartridge now there will be a link to where you can get some of these in the description a lot of people ask about them and I did the work find it one now first things first we take our distillate we assemble it not too hard now as you can see when I pull off this cap [Applause] the tip is slightly frosted that is to ensure that this when you apply it has a good mating surface and does not slide off now would they recommend first and foremost is that you heat this syringe up just a little bit using whatever method you prefer to get it nice and viscous you take your oil that you want to load into the cartridge have it ready you take the cartridge simply unscrew the lid from the cartridge very easily take your syringe full of the fluid that you would like to dispense into your cartridge insert it into the cartridge as far as it can go and begin to diminish pinch the fluid you can see it pushes down simply go around the cartridge filling it up as you go okay I knew at that point just top it off a little bit remove the syringe take your lid replace your lid on the top [Applause] and there you have your cartridge simply allow the oil to run down to this spot and test it for function as you can see the oil as has gone all the way down to the bottom is filled to this level at that point in time so if we remove the mouthpiece and a small silicone seal on the bottom get a standard 510 thread battery this is a VAT mod very nice battery 510 thread screw it on to the bottom [Applause] and let's try this thing out shall we [Music] all right well there you have it that's how you refill a C cell cartridge you guys have an absolutely wonderful day thank you so much for tuning in and if you want some cartridges to refill yourself make sure you check this website out Bait part smart vpm comm very great place you guys have a good one that thanks for tuning in peace",

napalm and we know this is real live version we have both spoke with them so can confirm um so let's dive right in shall we okay so this is the sativa hybrid 86.9 [Music] um it's a half there it's a half gram i was looking for more information but they have um the instructions up there read it there we go remove rubber stopper from bottom of cart cartridge screw on battery do not over tighten and then it says serving size three second drill second drop that's pretty interesting oh here we go seventy nine point one percent thc and point forty six percent cbd cbd servings per container that's interesting 125 125 servings per container manufactured june 15th of this year and packaged july 14 2020. so relatively relatively you know still not necessarily fresh but that's so you know it's from the summer yeah from the summer so that's pretty decent um you know a little couple comments about their packaging if you guys want to check this out a little bit closer uh nice white and black logo on the top the s with the line underneath uh the white and orange box i think this is something that you know you would definitely see in a big box retailer that would sell cannabis i feel like this is designed for freaking target right yeah basically um but yeah it does stick out it's attractive i like i like most of what i'm seeing here um child proof container how do we get this open is it a slider oh no okay so it slides at the bottom all right so we've gotta tear this here oh this is always tricky how do we get them strip it apart i open we'll just go with the rip it apart method um or maybe not i would have lost my patience then yeah it's oh it's because of the sticker the sticker is making it tricky so now i think we can no i just don't know at least it's recyclable there's a there is a recycled you know recycle this little thing on the bottom all right there we go that's tough there we go so yeah a little bit hard to get into the packaging but again at least it's nice on the outside um when it comes to the actual oil color and the cartridge you guys can kind of check that out right here um right there there it is so you've got this nice golden color it definitely looks like a distillate blend i'm just going to be 100 honest that gold yeah versus the traditional amber color so you'll notice a little bit more gold a little bit more amber i didn't smell anything did you smell anything so we're gonna try it on a couple different batteries right here we've got the vessel battery we're gonna try it out first and make sure the temperature is on the lowest setting here yep it is so we'll go ahead and stick it on here now you guys might notice a little bit different here on the vessel we took off this covered area because the napalm cart is a little bit oversized uh so first rip my lady the way we do it on the west coast we tour is we're gonna hit it once talk about it briefly and then hit it twice give you guys a score out of ten so try to keep it relatively short on these three second pulls so i got like a popcorn days the first the first hit did you i didn't to me this doesn't taste popcorny but it does taste exactly like the dissolute cards that we tend to buy which are cannabis terpenes and you know obviously a distillate um i'm not getting any kind of grape flavor i'm not really getting any kind of fruit flavor i'm really just getting this terpe distillate taste it's not botanical turf it definitely tastes like spicy weed yeah let me taste it again i'll try it again don't tell me don't tell me your score yet okay i won't i was just going to say it's not sweet at all no fruity-ness a little bit of freeness that i am getting on this last one tasted like fake fruitiness so it's really weird is it botanical terpenes is it cannabis terpenes does it say on the unbox it says cannabis oil and cannabis live resin this package is not child resistant after opening instagram and twitter and selectbetter.com cannabis oil and cannabis live resin so um cannabis oil generally speaking is distillate and then it says cannabis live resin so maybe they're going live resin terpenes with distillate a enhanced live resin experience when i think of that i think of you know they're not calling it 100 live resin they're not calling it just live resin and they're calling it enhanced uh very easy to say that yeah it's very easy to just label distillate and my resin terpenes as enhanced live resin um i think it's a little bit deceiving but overall they're creating a new product on the shelf with this you know we've got refined live resin from raw garden you've got unrefined live resin from other groups you've got buddies brand liquid diamond bread liquid diamonds and then you've got select elite live resin so i just want you guys to all whether you're a bud tender or a consumer even you here these are different products something that's 100 live resin will say that something that's enhanced live resin should be labeled on the back like this as cannabis oil cannabis distillate distillate whatever it is and cannabis live resin so i feel like that's all important uh there's a freight there's a place on all the shelves for these kinds of items when i think of a score out of ten i think this product tastes like a distillate product uh that doesn't have that grade of cannabis terpenes added to it it doesn't taste like any particular strain whatsoever so i want to give it a i'm gonna have to give it a you know a six six and a half maybe a seven at best the packaging and the product appeal all of that is really there solid there's actually a good amount of information on this terpenes and genetics need to be on there um it doesn't say if it uses cannabis terpenes it just says cannabis live resin so that's a big issue for me to be honest this is more an enhanced distillate product than it is an enhanced live resin product so i feel like that's kind of a shoddy there but um overall yeah i'll probably round out to a 6.75 final score uh i'll let the packaging and the branding that they do kind of you know boost the score a little bit but overall not great flavor not exactly clear what is it what it is i give it a 7.8 7.8 yeah i'm feeling that sativa high um all right y'all well we got varying scores i'm a little bit stricter on the whole live resin thing she based it on flavor and effect 7.8 6.75 fair scores jay ping here coming at you guys live man west coast we tour review jazzasaurus give her a follow on uh instagram at j-a-z-i-s-a-u-r-u-s super easy i mean you already know ma'am jp coming at you guys live go follow us on the youtube too please comment talk [ __ ] do what you got to do follow let me know what you think i'll see you all down the road", "YpziYHdrR_w": "hey guys this definition we're reviewing arrow pros live resin series particularly this is wedding cake it's a hybrid coming in around seventy nine percent THC so this is the new thing from arrow Pro that they're doing live resin now all the carts before were just really distill it and I got to say I really like this the flavor is more cannabis oil type flavor it's not as you know flavored with different kinds of flavorings like mosteiro pros are and i like those flavors - I gotta say mountain mists which is a menthol kind of flavor I like it as long as the the carts are clean and it's done right I'm down the flavor carts I've had some that just weren't that strong like the rad vape but I've never had any AeroPro cart that was not strong so I really do like AeroPro and again this live resin something I like as well it's it seems like the oil is a little darker color than the distill it it does not have any like co2 which kind of taste it tastes like a good live resin so people that like that live resin taste and enjoy the Arab for hardware might like this instead of their regular cartridges I probably would still just be hitting both I think strength wise they're pretty comparable so this new method didn't really sacrifice any strength and I found that even arrow pros at like in the high 70s like I've had mountain mists at 78 be stronger than some of the other carts out there at you know in the low 90s so actually I would take I've had an arrow pros at 78 I would take over a Eureka I had at 96 percent THC which was still a Eureka was great but the arrow pros a little better and arrow Pro they've sold over three million cartridges and not had a single health complaint so everyone's worried about oh cartridges people getting sick you know that's all vitamin E acetate and cuts and stuff like that arrow pro is a multi-state company you know I they do have individual people that I think it do something with oil in different areas but it's all like a very high standard and that's why three million units sold and not a single health complaint so I know I mean who safety teas but I'll be hitting AeroPro for for a while so let's take a hit take a look it looks like you know I didn't take the fattest hit here's about what mm-hmm yeah you're a pro hardware it's basically a magnetized automatic magnet I see so with the vibrating function puts out a little more vapor than normal I like it and take another look at that resin and this also has been vaping pretty slow and hit this thing a lot and the oil Dave's pretty slow so AeroPro live resin you got to say overall two big thumbs up and I got to say I kind of expected that from AeroPro everything they've done has been super high quality the only issue they've had is they've had some batteries that have failed and I know there was a bad batch out there so you did have that the information is on our site on one of our prove ease we'll put it there to get that replaced but that's the only issue there I Pro has had and they warranty it so besides that I mean everything has been so great about it the product is excellent it hits well the live resin takes good so our po2 thumbs up this dab connection thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "yeTp-8aHP5Q": "[Music] youtube what up your boy cushy here make sure you hit that like subscribe ring that bell we got the new select cartridge it is white sour and we are going to bust it open uh this is like throughout the past four days went down a casino i was in the driver's seat at one point not driving i didn't drive uh just so you know but uh here we

what's up hit this rod today and uh hit that like button and subscribe [Music] [Music] like subscribe ring that bell these select cartridge they're freaking phenomenal have such a great taste they're nice and smooth and you guys [ __ ] rock", "gqY_DHAQzVY": "[Music] what up y'all step [ __ ] can of meat ha I got filling today man [ __ ] today we gonna be doing a review about [ __ ] outcomes here okay now before we get into of course you know I'm gonna ask you [ __ ] subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody I got I'm at like 61 subscribers right now so you could be the lucky number 62 so anyway seriously I really do appreciate everybody that supported me thus far make sure you hit that thang so you can get a notification anytime I post some yeah so let's get into this [ __ ] man so yeah man we got the alcohol right here this is a seal - sauce okay while co2 extracted sauce that they put into the cartridge this is like my third one I got I know my I didn't wait for you guys I'm like I didn't argue went through these [ __ ] I like them sheesh it's a bomb I really do dig these shits in my opinion they're kind of like what I do when I make my own I'm sure they probably do some other [ __ ] too but I think it's kind of like something - the same thing like when I make my own [ __ ] fake [ __ ] so you can check that out in the box of how to do that on your own if you want to make your own baby juice but sometime I still have to [ __ ] with other people's [ __ ] anyway so this one that supposedly has no additives they also grow their own [ __ ] and as a matter of fact if you're trying to get your own extract company going you might want to holler at them because they also help other people develop their own companies so let's get into it let's see right here I got the sherbert which is a hybrid and cuz someone was asking me if I only do sativa sees Samantha I'm getting closer to the indica side I'm [ __ ] in because every once in a while but I'd be able to [ __ ] to do so I don't like to be sleep that's how I usually stick with like a city where I ever and I'm just the uppity mob like I like them yep I like that you know me have some energy in my [ __ ] so is what the inside looks like when you take the insert out I ain't gonna front I feel some of these companies are getting out of hand with packaging I just think there's more and more [ __ ] that they add again which means that you paying more and more for packaging versus what you actually are trying to buy I've seen some very elaborate about packaging this one isn't too bad though but I've seen some packaging out there just my buddy you came into the extreme but this one's pretty cool this one's easy and I know there's also guidelines that you have to follow for child safety when it comes to packaging as well but some of that [ __ ] is just [ __ ] you really so anyway all right let's see this is a half grammar here now look how thick this is I love the thickness of it nothing I don't [ __ ] all over the place so I don't know how well you guys can see that I don't know this [ __ ] helped by putting my hand behind that [ __ ] for it to focus but it is very very very very thick so what I like to do when I use this one is I notice that it's better if I use my rolled battery oh you like this [ __ ] I've got this little thing hanging on it so boom like a rocket where am i okay that [ __ ] is gangster right so what I do on this one I like to use the rope because it has to preheat setting on it so I can do a little preheat so I could make the liquid just a little bit more viscous for you boy so I can blaze it a little better so we're just gonna what is it two clicks yeah so we're just gonna use that so that could do a little preheat and you might even see it start to get a little bit thinner I don't know if you can see that but is work and I see a little bit of vapor coming up so I'm gonna interrupt the pre because I'm impatient I just wanted to get a little bit preheated so anyway my really high waves thing about the Vegas I gotta interrupt the video I forgot about some side to come back later and add the scent I didn't even read to you my magazine like the facts of the goddamn package like okay so this [ __ ] is testing THC wise at 63% so Lissa has about 316 milligrams of THC in there okay CBD less than one per one milligram so it's not really anything strong however I do like that they did put their terpenes how much how many how much are the terpenes right here so you have 30 milligrams of terpenes so you always want to pay attention to terpene it doesn't say exactly with what terpene profile it is I don't think no it doesn't say it doesn't give you a terpene profile but always keep in mind that the terpene profile is really really important because that's where you get a lot of your effects of your high a lot of people think is the CAC is not just the TAC two TAC is only one kind of but only from the plant that's actually taking effect on but you always have to think about the terpenes terpenes think of it like lavender how the eye lavender it gets you in like a more calm and restful mood you got terpenes to do the same thing that it gets you either more energetic like first you got mercy now this a lot o I'm not going to go to terpenes I'll actually do a video about turkeys alright so anyway let's get back to the normal video bottoms up [ __ ] beautiful tasty cool I can't do [ __ ] money well seriously I really think if you could get your hands on this [ __ ] you would really like it but I hate when I call the lot cuz it make my eyes are watery and then I get hot anyway yes it does taste just like sherbert sauce that because I've had some sherbert sauce for my caramel phil was dying back darn bagger a Artur place I can't remember anyway I had a [ __ ] sherbert sauce that was [ __ ] fire and it tastes very sure Bertie this one right here I would say on a scale of 1 to 10 the sherbert II taste is probably like a like a 7 which is good for me I don't like my [ __ ] to be all the way up out of 10 because I don't I always say I don't like my babes tasting like [ __ ] pretty pebbles and [ __ ] I'm growing as mother [ __ ] man so I do like my [ __ ] to have some of whatever we taste but I'm okay if they throw a little bit of flavor in there depending on you know how strong it is as long as it's not overbearing those are right here this is a very very good throat hit it's not like harsh on the throat or anything like that if you take bigger hits obviously you coffee but if you take a smaller hit you ain't got to worry about that the box actually suggests if you do a three-second draw exhale and then wait 15 minutes but [ __ ] out anyway no goddamn 15 minutes mother I got it so we about to get another hit but I can already feel it right now like it's already feeling like I can feel myself going up I haven't smoked anything today so this is my first smoke of the day I honestly love these shits I think they're like I think 30 or 40 aground for a 1/2 gram but there was a deal going on at my job where it was like you buy one get one so course your boy jumped on that one and so uh yeah actually was pretty bummed so they're not yeah so I've gone through some of them but I've been digging them big-time now definitely what this one don't leave his mother by gammac are you a supposedly nutty old waves in the car but this one I'm telling you because it when you know it's thick so it kind of gels up kind of like the rolls used to be where it would like gel up cuz it was so thick so if you leave it in the car I left I left one in the car on accident players [ __ ] up I know man I [ __ ] up all the time and I left my [ __ ] in the car and when I came back a lot of it was going it was like [ __ ] just picked up and evaporated or something I don't know what the [ __ ] happened I was like somebody broke in my car and just smoked my vape and then left I look like that like it just evaporated it was weird it didn't happen with the yellow but it happened with I'm Adam leave over the car so I definitely suggest do not lead these [ __ ] in the car like I say that's a rule of thumb with all banks but that is a huge one with this [ __ ] with the sauce in it because it will just [ __ ] pick up and bounce on yo ass and you'll come back like where my shaco and Italy you and know like I'm out of this [ __ ] so make sure that you don't leave this [ __ ] in the car but anyway man [ __ ] I guess that's the end of this one he must just say it's just a [ __ ] fake what else could I say but oh you know what I will say I have been [ __ ] with something with plastic tips where the tip would get hot when you [ __ ] taking drugs on it the tips on this doesn't don't get hot these are that fake plastic so you don't have to worry about that [ __ ] happening so anyway out of here [ __ ] that's the end of this [ __ ] I we'll be bringing more [ __ ] I'm done with my move pretty much so now was just all unpacking and trying to you know decorate but I got me a nice little production production room here so I got [ __ ] laying everywhere man I [ __ ] DJ equipment sitting around I just got [ __ ] all over the [ __ ] place so I got to get this [ __ ] cleaned up but I like I saying I thank y'all for sticking with me and being around so if you haven't subscribed please make sure you do make sure you hit the things you can get a notification at any time I pull some yeah this is your boy can of meek I didn't mean to say your boy I try not to say that this is just an amine ain't you

peaceful to one another I'm out of this [ __ ] kind of make peace the one I want to hit the sequel we in the jungle smokin let's go we in a jungle smoking legal", "h8XduReVYPA": "yo guys what's going on welcome back to another kart review um we back in the car I just picked up these cards that's why I'm reviewing them in the car I don't know I didn't want to do it at home so I have two cards here I'm only gonna review one you guys know the deal I've been recommended these a few times by a few different people I've never really gotten I could chance to buy them I haven't seen too many deals on them so I saw one today and I needed some so I was like [ __ ] it so the first one I got well the one that we're not reviewing today is the Select Ely these are the elite lives so like the live resin one this is the Death Star I got this one because you guys know I'm more of an indica or sativa kind of guy at least at the momentum starting to head towards indicas but um yeah this one's got Death Star in the name so how am I not gonna get it right by the way if you see me looking around it's because I'm in an abandoned [ __ ] mall I got these at jars cannabis MetroCenter which is the mole that's closing so it's like ghetto as [ __ ] over here anyway if you live in Phoenix you know what I'm talking about anyway the next one we have that I'm actually gonna review today is the desert lime right so this is a sativa you guys know sativas for me right now we're coming at 80 5.30% for the THC contents in the sativa and the hybrid earthy I'm sorry the indica is coming in at eighty four point eight four percent potency that's the potency I'm sorry the THC presents seventy-nine and then seventy-seven with some decimals anyway all that crap out of the way blah blah blah [ __ ] this we're gonna open it right now and take some hits always open it from the bottom I don't know why I don't you have to I haven't had a live resin cart you know [ __ ] minute guys I've had a select carton just as long cool so here it is you guys know the standard mouthpiece I select comes with it's actually really nice mouthpiece my personal favorite you guys know that I prefer it over this one right here sorry I'm [ __ ] mess so this is the Rove by the way this row of cart guys I love Rove if I see another deal I'll probably end up getting it because it is a very nice car highly recommend even this one feels heavier than the Select cart by the way I was mentioning that in my last video that this is a heavy duty cart it's heavier than the full gram or the half gram that's filled so just for comparison anyway got the half ass charged who's penny here go ahead and pop off this gay-ass cap throw it over there it's on the floor now my been alright I do not have any liquids in my car I was not prepared for this I was not planning to come here but I did so you know I got to live with my consequences here's the [ __ ] wax and you see if I figure out what a camera a little bit darker than some of the other waxes not too much doesn't move you know sorry you guys can see I'm [ __ ] sweating and if you hear background noise like a little whatever that is um it's a hundred and [ __ ] ten degrees out and I'm sitting in my car in my ACS only on two otherwise I tried it three is way too loud so bear with me guys it's gonna get hot I'm gonna [ __ ] die in this car right now doing this video but it's for you guys so yeah let's do another one oh wait another one I'm not even high I'm just stupid Cheers okay I'm gonna be honest with you guys tastes like [ __ ] and it tastes like battery acid I mean see that bubble that's right boy let me try to see through my fingers there see that bubble yeah that was already there before I hit it so I could be hitting out of that pocket but I taste it straight like battery acid and I don't feel anything yet so number two Cheers okay okay so it turns out it's the same [ __ ] taste all right it should dog doo-doo well who not a fan of the taste guys I guess you don't really go for a live resin cards for the taste so before you come at me in the comments I know that [ __ ] alright so if you've already comments it delete that [ __ ] but you know I do actually feel it no the cards would look out more well there's a bubble it's already a nice [ __ ] size bubble tune that's that's nice I guess yeah I like it not bad um to be honest I'd say I like the RO better already but I've only taken two hits so you guys know we do the traditional three here we'll take one more and then I'll judge let's see I have their seat right here I got these two for a deal normally they're like 50 bucks each which is pretty pricey but they are life resin so you guys know [ __ ] but it came out too yeah two of them before tax with 65 bucks with taxes 7059 so you're paying $35 for a half gram Carter essentially and it's not the best in my opinion I would say I'd prefer the Rose because they are cheaper by fourteen dollars I can't say anything against death star yet I'll try that one it's not mine I'm giving it to somebody who has their med card legally right no feds nothing it's all legal I bet um but I'll hit that one I'll let you guys know in the next video I might even review that one I might be able to do that I don't see why I couldn't so if that's the next video you'll see I have another cart already at home that I can review for the next one so it's not going to be too long for another upload because this one should be a couple days after the last one which is nice so yeah let's do one more hit here and then I'm gonna leave and go get some food because I am starving I get Chipotle so if Chipotle's watching the sponsor me too all of that [ __ ] sponsor me Cheers yeah so it doesn't even taste like a dab or anything it just straight tastes like you're hitting an empty heart and that's my problem with this one if you hate that battery acid taste do not get at least do not get a when is this desert lime try another one it's wait no this is a hybrid but I'm so stupid it even says on the box right there I'm gonna pinky that when I ordered it I swear to God I pick sativa I don't pick hybrids oh never mind I'm just even stupider they didn't have any hybrids it was hybrid sativa dominant and then okay I'm sorry guys so yeah this is a sativa hybrid that's the answer thank you John Trebek anyway guys I'm pretty joins I'm not gonna lie so this car for 35 bucks I'd say this car it's worth it there's a guy walking behind me I hope I don't stabbed yeah I'll let you guys judge for this one I'm gonna start raiding carts at us out of 10 yeah we'll do 10 I was gonna say seven for some reason but at its head I'm gonna give this one a 6 yeah it's a 6 for these live resins I'd say Rove since I didn't write it I'd say Rove is probably a 7 point 5 and 8 so you know I'll start writing them now that way you guys can get a judgment if you're interested so yeah this one's up in the air if you guys want to test it out I like you guys have said I've been recommended a few times not the biggest fan but you know glad I tried it any other recommendations let me know yeah other than that guys that's the end of the video I will see you in the next one deuces", "i8tpMASJXdk": "I know YouTube has been getting like a little strict on this before this video starts I need to say this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or have a medical marijuana card like I actually do myself I don't wanna show you my personal information hey what's up guys Ronnie ray back at you so this video I actually have a concentrate review for you guys so shout out drip right here at the brand rip they have some [ __ ] fire wax um I did some uh views on them in the past but mine did I picked up the diamond [ __ ] this [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire I haven't smoked this yet um dad a buy one get one deal Oh am I so originally I wasn't planning on making this reviewing video for this sided [ __ ] you why not I haven't done review videos in a while so I heard he smoked the other grand that I had it was a different strain than this one so I don't know I should have did a review on that but I didn't know this shit's [ __ ] fired now I smoked one grandmother diamond to you I'm excited to try this his this [ __ ] I don't know if I should look stupid fire like let me show you guys some close-ups in a minute and that's gonna be the judge of that but um the shout out drip like I said bro that [ __ ] looks [ __ ] fire so let's put them those close-ups and then I'm get into this review so all right so yeah let's just go over the packaging real quick and then open this up we'll get this smoking on it or I'll get the spoken on it I guess I wish you guys could smoke with me but and then I'll get to reviewing it after that you know what I mean so I hope you guys are smoking along but for the top of the box comes in this little box this is a little sticker that the dispensary throws on but just says I dripped one gram sauce diamond nothing really too important on that sticker and I mean so the box I really liked it um the logo drift it's like you can flip it upside down and it's like the same and that I'm saying and it has a color of gold I feel what you call that [ __ ] shiny letters I'm saying I had like all the box so [ __ ] fire he was like there are social medias if you want to check them out I doubt you again so I I just see reviewing that papaya no it's that wrong I'm pretty sure I don't know something like that so yeah papaya um leave us an indica so that's the box their presentation is fire you open it up you're greeted with this say I don't know I think this [ __ ] the packaging is like fire that [ __ ] looks dope police in my opinion I know you guys think down below you guys are getting the close-up shots but let me show you guys just again real quick cuz this [ __ ] is [ __ ] it's like white brother like that shit's crazy I don't know I'm excited to smoke on this one I want the key my really before it but they made this video but I didn't have any alcohol off it's a little bit dirty but this is what I'm smoking in all of this is over Cyclopes and crazy foot gets the job done we're gonna do a little taste test we're going to a high test and then I guess just like a smoke test the packaging I can give that a rating right now I'll get the packaging probably about like a 4.5 out of 5 patacoins [ __ ] fire it's nothing not like too complicated it gets the job done but it's like [ __ ] crazy it's dope you know and I mean they all give a like a 4.5 on the packaging and then I'm so we're gonna do a taste test a smoke test the way so it's probably gonna smoke crazy you know I mean the smoke test I usually like do like how how well it like blows clouds the only me if it smokes properly and [ __ ] I'm going into a high test a price point so this [ __ ] was $60 a grand actually but it was a buy one get one free so I didn't technically paid like 30 a gram but 60 dollars a gram if they don't have that deal going and then we're gonna do like a overall review it's like all those things like overall review thing that I'm saying so let's just hop into this I've been talking a little bit too long so I've been talking a little bit too much so let's just hop into this so yeah I drift diamonds [ __ ] on fire last look at it and I'm gonna get like a not a huge dap so we're talking both my carb cap the other day so I got to use this as a carb cap but it gets the job done so I'm what I was saying though I'm not gonna get the biggest tab right here and I guess what the older taste as first I'm gonna get get a close-up shot of me getting this wax and the dabber in a second like look at this [ __ ] the camera doesn't want to focus on it too well with that [ __ ] as though they're like almost [ __ ] white bro that's crazy yeah I'm gonna take this little that's actually a pretty fat dad but this is gonna be put a little taste test real quick so I don't know that [ __ ] looks crazy I can't get over the looks of this I can't get over the way this looks this [ __ ] looks [ __ ] crazy like I said I hope you guys are smoking along hope you guys are smoking something banking if you are and [Music] and also I don't know if you guys in my last review I did a northern might should be on these duchies I also had these what is this this is a purple dream if you guys want to see a review on these cannabis cigarettes let me know down below in the comments oh yeah so the papaya diamond life not libraries and um paya diamonds so kind of hop into this so we've done a little pace that's now so like I said that shit's [ __ ] so5 um so right off the bat there's not too much [ __ ] flavor it just tastes super [ __ ] clean like that's really all I'm getting right off the bat I'm not too familiar with this Drano so let me look up this strain on leafy and see what this drain sports the tastes like and I'll write in kind of um say if it did or not you know I mean but now that she was super smooth like you seen how that [ __ ] was hidden that [ __ ] like that [ __ ] ripped um barely I didn't even off you know I mean that shit's super clean super smooth so syndicate strain like I said cross with critical number thirteen with ice to to make their own fruit and not their own this is what the taste is similar to its tropical fruit counterpart but a spicy peppery side also becomes apparent that's what I was gonna say actually on I was gonna say it tasted a little bit sweetie like a little bit sweetie it's a little sweet I'm gonna taste super slick that doesn't have like that indica skunky like pungent paste what I mean that you'd normally get with in the goods as I go sweet like fire like clean paste that like super super fire I didn't really get that peppery side just like kind of like sweet tropical foods like I said definitely [ __ ] [ __ ] fire bro look let me get a close-up shot of me getting a DAB on I brought avert so setting that you [Music] alright so that was kinda hard to do with one hand like what the phone wasn't handing it to have another name of the fabric but you guys seem that [ __ ] it's like super crystal e the color brother that looks at this [ __ ] looks 5 out of 5 this shit's [ __ ] fired someone take a bigger dad now not the biggest but I don't want to smoke up all my wife's right now so we're gonna do a little bit of pretty big though so we're going to pick the high PES now I guess so let me take this pad - yeah how smokes and then get the higher rate [Music] another Shih Tzu just won't be like some of the best class I've ever had I mean my opinion I don't know like that at least took the best wives I've had in a minute that I can remember you know I mean but this shit's fire so um yeah we've got a pretty big tab here like I showed you guys so if you had this moving along walking shears and let's [ __ ] get it so [Music] [Music] super clean though bro like that ship obviously hurts my chest a little bit cuz I was like a really big dad but not as bad as you rethink your like how big I dad was a gosh it's actually like super clean um I should definitely [ __ ] fire the high out give that like I don't know I'll say it's the best looking box I've had but I feel like I've had more potent whacks um especially like THCA like I've had like that's just I mean well this might this probably is considered thta but um I don't I feel like I've had more potent wax or whatever you want to call it but this is like the best look in my opinion at least and it's why is this on still alive yeah but this is definitely up there though this is that me some of the best ways I've had it not the best um so yeah the packaging I gave like what a 4.5 out of 5 the taste I'm gonna get that a 4 out of 5 that shit's fired Mike doesn't it's not - it's not filled with flavor but it's like super clean like super super clean with like a hint of like sweet fruitiness I'll explain so let me get that like a 4.5 if not a 5 out of 5 because that [ __ ] is near perfect the way it smokes that she drips you see that I'm gonna get out of the street 5 out of 5 probably the high pilot a 4.5 out of 5 close too close to a 5 out of 5 just feel like a patent more potent or acts out there I feel I just feel like I've had more potent wax but not to say that this isn't [ __ ] stupid fire you know Stephanie stupid fire the price points exceed always a gram that's really [ __ ] expensive let's say I have like a buy one get one free deal I wouldn't smoke this on the daily but you feel like a nice little treat here I'm saying picking this up in the future but the price points $60 about this little high I'll get that like a 4 out of 5 the bottle one get one free deal five out of five like basically $30 grand you can't go wrong with that but if you're paying this rates they see that spend it expensive so the overall score and we get out like I did 4.5 out of 5 this is [ __ ] insanely father the one nice my one complaint really is just how expensive is this my one complaint is the [ __ ] price point which was a little bit cheaper you know I'm ballin on a budget out here but um stupid fire and I'm definitely pick it up if you see it in our area but besides for that you guys like this video a good a big

__ ] rock boom", "q7dowCeZCa8": "to follow down like what's up guys simplistic here back with another video it is another cartridge video and it's a it's a friend that I've tried like two three years ago when I like started getting into cartridges it is the Blum brand you know saying all that good stuff but it is their life resin yeah so like I said I'm not the first person to do this I've seen some videos online but I am gonna do my own rendition of a video you know I'm saying but as you can see it says live resin hundred percent cannabis no additives all that good good stuff and as you can see it is galactic check and I like to mention that this is the first time me blazing today so it is technically going to be a wake and bake so you know saying let's just continue on so we got Delta 9 THC I believe it's running at 71 point seven four percent and I believe there's also some THC a I think 13 percent yeah 13 percent just in case you guys can't see we're going in for a little bit any guys good [ __ ] alright and also this was tested by canna safe by us thicker so how you tell that most of the time when you get something legit they're gonna have a sticker separate from the packaging like it's another sticker that they put on that's the the testing sticker that they put on but as you can see tested by canna safe I actually could not go on I didn't go on there being I couldn't find the test results but I heard canna safe is a really really legitimate company testing company so we're just gonna take their word for it big oil also does the stuff for I believe Bear labs so that's pretty interesting but it says contains no additives PG VG or vitamin e acetate I mean it has a CBD and CBN but minuscule minuscule so let's open this get my trusty lighter bro you guys don't know what the light of bro is I'm excited whoo my breast this is only $40 I have the receipt guys so I have them see here see out the door so is 29 but then you add the tax so about 40 dollars total I would say positive s but I bought it last minute all that good stuff the bloom break it's a very raw garden esque look very light fairly light in here sorry about that guys so push this yes definitely this is library I'd be a lot darker no blue thumbnail here this is a raw garden part basically this new [ __ ] laughing jack I get freaky by the way this is the death bait retro if you guys haven't seen that video already very very dope battery cheese boys let's turn that up a bit so they recommend 3.5 voltage so let's just try that but very similar to raw cardoon Wow it's cheaper to buy like five books it's a very lemony taste as you would assume from galactic Jack right but very very raw garden esque I would say very very good I like it like if I took this hit and I looked at the cartridge I would have thought its raw garden to be honest that's crazy cheers boys damn it the taste is there it's like I'm just looking sucked on a lemon ooh not gonna lie I'm very impressed you know for something to be of quality of raw garden five dollars cheaper you really can't go wrong with it it's a different brand you know so I had to try it bloom form the other strains that they had were also sativa so I'm probably just gonna assume that they tasted very similar to each other but as far as this brand goes or this live resin cartridge both very very good it's a lot lighter than your typical live resins very reminiscent of raw garden so I mean if you like rock garden you're gonna love this but like if you're looking for that dark type of [ __ ] this isn't like if it doesn't matter to you you know the color of the the live resin or whatever and this is good you know 40 I believe I paid 40 exactly for this so it's definitely not bad you know there's buddies that cost 42 there's select that costs 45 raw garden that costs 45 this $5 cheaper in and the same quality of raw garden I believe so uh yeah pretty a pretty high in THC 280 three point six three you take one more hit for you and I will probably get an end the video I'm probably gonna blow it out there to see just to show you how much smoke we actually get so cheers boys all right there you have it yourself get out of your head out of your mind going flying don't forget what I said keeping a lot of shits are so good out of your head adding a mind-blowing I don't forget what I said I found all of you still having doubts now like how it the distance is so wait yo and the drone waiting for some booze back by my time [Music]", "rIFOf4R1oyA": "you know what is going on YouTube welcome back to a quick little banger by your boy semi g-men so a question that I've been getting ass lately a lot men so you guys know that I've always upload a cartridge videos pata videos anything that has to do with a portable you know dabbing device then I'm pretty much using it because I'm always on the go I can never find a convenience to just roll down I mean sit down and roll one up you know or sit down and just heat up my mic to my banger or you know all that stuff so I always feel like I carry a cartridge or a pod with me at all times just because it's that convenient so but the question that I get asked a lot right is which one do you like better semi which one do you like better man you're always chief in this chief in that do you like cartridges better or do you like pods better and I was just like when when I saw that question I was just like wait hold on man I had to think about it I was like I don't know I don't know if I like cartridges or pods better you know I don't know which one I would choose on because I have had some really really amazing cartridges and then I've had some really really amazing pods you know and I feel like each one has their own you know up side to it so I think for today's video man we're gonna get down to the bottom of what I like out of a pod system and what I like out of a cartridge system and I guess so today though we are gonna be chiefing representing the 510 thread cartridge side we got imperial extracts this one right here is a lemoncello sativa and the main reason I wanted to put this one in is because lemoncello is one of those strains that is super freakin fire right now so I wanted you to give this one a shot shout out to imperial extracts mint for it you should handing this out to me and on the pot system side we got the big boy right here that's dizzy sitting on the nice big battery all right men shout out to Steve and I thought you know these two brands right here man they they make some really really good light resin so I chose some of the best ones that I could find and I just really want to see what what what makes it stand out more than the other all right guys so to start off I feel like let's start off with imperial extracts sitting that I think we're gonna put this out a three point five right lemoncello that's going what do I like about a 5-10 thread cartridge let's find out oh dude that is so smooth oh that libraries and hits though oh okay so off of that first initial hit I'm obviously not gonna base it off of the oil itself it's gonna be more about the cartridge and what I like about it so I think as the first thing the most obvious reason that I like a 5-10 thread cartridge over a pod would probably have to be you see this thing right here the battery man the fact that I could switch up my variable wattage is on a you know when I'm smoking if I tend that cartridge is something that is very very underestimated a lot of people do not know you know I preached this a lot when I'm doing cartridges and things like that but you have to if you feel like you're not getting the right amount of turps the right amount of flavor smoke whatever the cases the chances are you had to switch up the voltage side there go a little bit higher a little bit lower you know you go you have to find the sweet spot on a cartridge just so you can get that overall well you know smoke experience man when you're sitting there you're gonna get the the right flavor profile you're gonna get the Terps up smacking you get the smoke and I feel like when using a battery like this like this battery that has variable wattage right here on the down on the bottom I feel like that's a big upside to the 510 thread cartridges because men I I want it if I feel like it's not hitting enough I can easily turn it up and boom I'm getting smack because it feels like I just took a dab all right so that would be the first thing that I like about a 5-10 thread over a pot and next up on the list we got the stage right here like I said competing for the pod side and let's go ahead and take a little rip about this see what I like about the pod see what I like it but I don't like about it right choose or what I like over the 510 thread smackers dude I don't know it's dizzy so good but the imperial extracts man I think that lemoncello that they made Veneto bro finito so what I like about a pot I feel like what the thing that stands out to me the most about ippolit system it's just about the convenience and the sleek design that they give you I feel like that is the first thing that stands out to me right then no hands you don't have to push a button to draw this like you can do whatever you want with your hands while you're hitting it so I feel like that is the most upside about the about a pod system itself is the fact that you know you don't need to use press a button to hit it you just need to pull men in the designs at that you know they'd be coming out with with the paws system it's just the fact that you have a proprietary battery so you can really match it up and make it look very very appealing so that would be the first thing that I like about the pause systems is just the convenience and the visual appeal so back onto the cartridge side man I'm getting smack Manny I need to do some water boys don't forget summer is coming up man getting hot you guys need to stay hydrated all the time right so what's going on a 3-point boo it wasn't at three point eight holy shoot damn dude I think the first hit that I did was a three point eight so let's go ahead and now hit it a three point five and tell you what else I like about cardizem whoo that is fire dude it's so freakin smooth that I forget how much smoke is actually in my longings in their eyes like choking up so whoo yeah lemoncello definitely is I feel like the next thing that I would want to speak on about the 5/10 third cartridges are itself is I don't know what it is but I feel like I get a lot more flavor from cartridges of themselves because I've had I I can't remember what company it was exactly I don't even think they're around anymore but they went from putting it in a 5-10 thread cartridge and I remember tasting it it was so freakin good and they made the switch over to a pause system because they wanted you know hop on the wave up on the Uni style that was coming out and it just did not taste the same it did not taste the same I do not know if it has anything to do with like you know the build that 510 thread cartridges have as opposed to this one I mean at the other day they feel like they're both pretty similar you know they both have wicks in there ceramic whatever blah blah blah but I always feel like whenever I'm hitting a cartridge it's just a whole different type of like hi than I'm getting a whole type of different experience and then when I hit a pod system it's just it's satisfying for a short amount of time and then I feel like it's just I just get tired of it so that's why I'd rather choose a 5-10 thread over a frickin pod system goes one thing that I think both you know both the pod system and a 5-10 thread cartridge have their you know their negatives also so I don't know if you guys know but when you get to the bottom of a cartridge I there's always a little bit of oil up and in the pods it's significantly less as opposed to 5 10 third cards you can either way you're still losing oil it gets stuck up up at the top and I feel yeah that's maybe something that both a pod system and a cartridge system you know can both fix because with the with the holes right there it's the same thing as a pod it has a small hole right there and there are times where you just get stuck in the little crevice in between the cartridge and the hole so that's kind of a downside of both of matches [Music] dude I don't know they nailed this flavor like I keep talking about this imperial extracts cartridge but it's actually so satisfying it's my first time ever trying this limoncello it's like this is gonna be my daily driver from now on for sure screech this guy's discreteness is something that a lot of people have to deal with now it is because they don't want people knowing what they're doing and I don't know I guess nowadays everybody knows because it's 2020 you know you can't really if they see it they are gonna know automatically what it is it's been all over the news you know the cartridges have been blasted literally all over the news so people know exactly what it is so there really is no keeping it discrete but if you if you somehow find a way I feel like the most one to keep discrete would probably have to be this one because you could kind of pass off if you put it on a little on the slimmer batter you can maybe pass it off as a jewel you know take the little California weed sticker on and then boom there you go it looks kind of like a jewel and there's something they actually do have paws that are actually very very clear so you know it kind of pulls you a little bit closer to the Julian type of [ __ ] so you can pass away with very very you know look at being very very discreet is what I'm saying at the end of the day it's actually really really hard to choose which one I like better you know paws versus cartridges but if I really really had to choose I think I would just have to go with a cartridge itself like I was saying because you can endlessly switch variable wattages on this one man the hits the hits on a cartridge just hit way different as opposed to a pod man my experience is you know I'm a big long time cartridge user so it speaks for itself man it speaks for itself cartridges are you know my go-to I know that's really crazy to say and people always talk [ __ ] to me about like you know I do why do you smoke so many cartridges and like I mean now now in 2020 I've actually you know slimmed it down quite a bit I've actually been smoking a lot more deaths and I'm weed but before that I was cheating on a cartridge almost I was going through cartridges literally like two to three days but that's how crazy it was so yeah I guess 5-10 thread cartridges wins for me of us over pot systems don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with the good old pot system you know they do their thing they come in clutch when when they need to so with that being said guys 510 thread being the winner let me know in the comments below what do you guys think which one do you guys like a better DEA's like 510 thread or do you guys like pods and yeah let me know if you guys have ever tried imperial extracts especially this lemoncello man is super freaking fire so I'm gonna go ahead and end out the video here if you enjoy the content do me one last favor and hit that like button comment back to me and most importantly smash that subscribe button alright guys catch you guys on the next one", "akyKHTB0qH4": "[Music] let's go youtube ministry boy man fellow signing him back with another video today I'm at Windy City cannabis it is a dispenser that sent home word you got to pick up a couple parts get wedding cake and I'm also about to grab our train Hayes or something like that but I'm gonna go grab two carts and then on my door review like usual although swaggy this way Corin C&I are some people like super cautious steel stick another wine but it's not as bad as when we go ahead last night he is why it shouldn't be much of a late a wait they got it like a little thing going on right now when you just you order online and then you get a time where you come pick it up at so I'm here at my time right now to pick it up I got the cards this is Ronald like I said wedding cake I'll just do some b-roll but another one ghost train hey that's what I got ghost train Hades I know something but I think welcome got like 81 percent to eighty seven percent I got both of them it was overall pleasant experience with the city Canada so give it like two thumbs up pretty simple I know this really fight doesn't matter to other people in other states it should like that because they're dispensaries aren't like that they don't operate like it's a banking [ __ ] but out here in [ __ ] Illinois act like the Spencer is our bank and you know there's like a security door behind a security door behind another security door what is good YouTube and we're back like I said I just got back from Windy City cannabis right now I got so this is what I miss using to smoke this is not a really cheap doesn't cost much at all pay my five bucks for it like I said ended up getting two carts I got like I said got wedding cake and the guy goes try and I used about 500 milligram how finally just short of what I usually do but this joint called and they don't costing me 65 on top of that I ended up paying my 75 attacks in other words so and I know what in other words robbery bro this is it right here waiting cake do some b-roll [Music] [Music] again this is Verano now use this sticks hit this [ __ ] that's that join us is it right here or on tone beep anyway this little thing screwed a [ __ ] in here reason why I got this one in particular could this convene I could just stick this in my pocket I'll take it with me looks to go it's smaller but yeah hey slow bro it's a smooth pen I just probably last me a month I use mine tickling too however they have much for you as far as like a player for flavor program which I taste this [ __ ] one more time I can't really taste much out of this I'm not really getting like a cake taste oh no matter like look up and let you guys know like whether that actually works I don't really taste nothing cake wise as far as like wedding cake but uh I do feel something is usually pretty instinct with cars it's just like this literally just like smoking flour which has been my experience still early just like smoking flour so yeah I just be starting to feel some already that first day I took what was pretty was pretty damn massive but yeah and that man I'm gonna let you guys know I like I said hey buddy taste it tastes just a bit sweet but I outside of that any taste nothing I'm for real but eighty percent THC it is a hybrid I saw an indica and sativa and yeah other than that miniature boy man I appreciate you guys supporting the content two channels still steadily growing steadily growing and I'm just nothing but appreciated appreciate it to you guys and I've been in my experience that Windy City cannabis I give it two thumbs up as far as like I had like a bad experience I went to security guard but outside of everybody was cool most people was cool just like one little bit it didn't really blow it I still recommend though they're cheaper than the ones are that's gonna say that cuz they have yeah overall great experience I give this to thumbs up with them filling it for sure outside that man should I pick although I'm out under that this pan yo and I feel like my face is melting off right now",

his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or I don't show you my personal information all right yo what's up guys Ronnie right back at you um I have another court review for you guys in this video I'm actually doing a kind live resin again if you guys see my like last review I did a Arnold Palmer this is [ __ ] fire I haven't really smoked on the car too much besides for when I did the review because I'm trying I'm if you got yeah if you guys didn't know I'm going to ET see you in like two weeks like what is it May 17th so Loki trying to save this car gonna feel others for you wanna go easy because this car is like I said in that review it taste so far like it actually tastes like Arnold Palmer like it actually tastes like [ __ ] you're smoking lemonade and iced tea like I don't know it's [ __ ] fire but um this video we're gonna be reviewing true Oh G and this brand I mean not this brand um this flavour or strain or whatever you really want to call it I know it's kind of been I don't know if you want to say it's there one of the classics or originals or whatever but I know it's been around for like a really really long time like I seem like a YouTube video somewhere I forget the dudes Shanno or I would shout him out but um it was posted like literally four years ago and he was a reviewing kind live resin and it was true oh gee so yes that's just like a little proof that the true og flavor has been around for a while but I don't know this is my review so I'm gonna give you my thoughts opinions my honest review everything I had to say about it the Arnold Palmer one was a hybrid I think that was like I said sativa dominant hybrid if I'm correct and then the true oh geez I got heavy indica up here and the guy so just looking at the two parts they can look at the two you can already see you can see huge color difference that Arnold Palmer it's like a lot more like clear a lot more [ __ ] yeah a little gold you know what I mean the true OG is like that darker I don't want to say Brown but like like dark gold I don't know this I know it's throw some fire whatever this lit because I don't know I've known about this brand forever so I know it's a fire this lit the only thing that I don't like about them well I don't know I mean they're a little pricey they're like what 62 bucks for the four grand quarter there's like this brand right here I have some of review out on these like if you wanna go check them out too these are [ __ ] stupid fires but there's $70 for the full Graham Carter so these are a little bit cheaper than these but these are definitely more fire in my opinion there was a those are stupid fire but 70 bucks for a gram I can't really justify buying that you know what I mean the only reason I even bought these was because there was a buy one get one for a book I'd rather because I can get two grams of like actual concentrate like shatter for the price of one of the years you know and I'd rather have like actual wax but I don't know these are just good for like when you're going to raves like concerts or you know what I mean it's not like oh nice but yes you know you see the color difference but if you want to see review on the Arnold Palmer one go check that video out but like I said with the one true orgy in this video so let's just go over the packaging a little bit I can't waste too much time on it kind libraries and Ruo Jie yeah pretty basic the side of it says organic blah blah blah and then kind that's new ritual every video I have to [ __ ] drop something but it's you guys but if you guys have been watching my reviews dude I don't know why but I [ __ ] drop my cards and have you [ __ ] video for some reason but if you guys want to do some more research from the brand its kind concentrate song right there so check them out then it has like that Arizona warning on the side apartment of services coming back I don't mean just all that [ __ ] it has to say to cover their ass and that was it see another sticker right here oh it says uh natural sources supposedly they marketed as natural and organic so that's pretty far I don't know how true that is says solvent free natural and organic right there in the bottom two I don't know one of the one of the cons like that like if you wanted to make like a pros and cons list about these cards I mean I guess it's not really too big of a deal but as long as it's a thousand milligrams you know what I mean but I always loved it one like like I said on this large carts it says the THC percentage on the bottom I always love that these um Clank these cards the kind I don't at least from what I'm seeing I don't see any percentages it doesn't say what it's what it's tested at I mean as long as it's a thousand milligrams I guess it really doesn't matter you know what I mean so also what I not just noticed too briefly real quick I'm gonna get this out of the way and I'm we're gonna open this card of this Arnold Palmer one where's a harvested on for eleven nineteen so this is like some fresh or all right here this is brand new this one right here is harvested on eleven twenty eighteen so it's a little bit older a couple more months old I don't really think that has anything to do with the quality of it but I mean that's just pretty cool know when I got a fresh card you know I mean yeah besides for that let's just hop into the rest of this video so let's open this up oh gee off the top then it comes in these little plastic things not the nose in the box that's weird so when you take it out of the box that's you're greeted with you get this nice nice looking cart also another thing that I really like about these cards I mean I know a lot of cards have them so it's not only just this car like a lot like a lot of different brands do it well I mean I don't know I guess it's just all personal preference and also kind of depends on the battery you have but they're gonna say like the white accidents that use just because like when I put it on them this guy pin that I have just like blue one white I don't know it just looks so sick you know what I mean but um here's the quality the oil real quick so you guys could see the clarity of it in color let me find the bubble so there's the bubbler that you can see the consistency of it right there so it looks pretty thick it looks like it's barely even moving um if you guys haven't seen my past reviews I always say tell me down below in the comments what you guys think of the oil to lucas's even though this is my review and you guys are watching my review I'm like really really interested to know what you guys think of it too so make sure you tell me don't blow me comments what you guys think of it oh I think the other one was a little bit like the Arnold Palmer was a little bit thicker than this one is this one it's actually like moving up slowly the Arnold Palmer one was barely even moving but this is actually slighted input I don't know it's still really big oil that's a really good sign this is what it looks like on the pen it's a pretty big pin though I mean like so yeah this is a pretty big pin that's like the only downside of it like especially when you have a four grand card on it it's like good like I don't know six inches maybe you don't [ __ ] know how big that is but um here's the quality of the oil one more time for you guys stupid clear like you see just a little dark that's literally like the only thing I could say about it but besides I mean like the color that the color has to do a lot of things you know what I mean it could do with the strain a weed they like the strain they used to make though or or it could do it there's so many possibilities unlike what could affect the actual color the distillate you know what I mean so don't really like just use that to judge the so yeah if you guys like to know just don't use that that's like your main source of like judging a car just like the color of it you know what I mean because there's so many different like things that could like affect that like so many different variables I could affect the color you know what I mean so so we got the trilogy no I don't know that is a little upsetting that doesn't have the THC percentage on it to be honest so but anybody from kind is watching this I mean I should say a little detail that I'll really cut like a lot more if you guys add it on your packages but like I said it's not too big of a deal but let's just turn this on and get our first couple hits I'm gonna preheat the battery up a little bit get it ready for us to hit it let me just uh voltage so I have it on like a pretty low temperature like just a little like 2 2 point 7 volts so pretty low so you guys are smoked if I didn't mention it I should have added it into the beginning of this video but if I didn't don't watch this video that's for 18 21 or whatever little you were ages Smokey's in the area or you have your medical marijuana card like I do oh yeah I just have to say that [ __ ] to cover my ass but you should hop back into this if you guys are smoking along with me Cheers um and yeah just get into this true OG client library and choose I definitely add that og wish taste oh yeah all right of it even though I'm not I'm not too old I'm not like a og I'm saying not how old I had a nuttin but I've been smoking for a minute um I haven't had a G cush for a minute so I don't know you don't really see too much like real OG Kush now anymore like in the area that I live there's so much like exotic [ __ ] and like I don't know I just feel like that's a new wave it's like exotic strains and that means you know you don't really see too much of the classic like Oh green crack like [ __ ] ogee curve like you know all the og [ __ ] you know what I'm saying you'd only see that too often no more you just see a lot of the exotic stuff so it's pretty like I'm nostalgic to say the least like the hidden some og [ __ ] like that it actually tastes like some fire oh gee it's some real live resin too which is really really like another nice thing about the car and just like the static of it like especially on this pen I mean you can put it even on like the average loss is my evo labs pan this is like a also one of my favorite pens I love this pin so much even on this pin like this [ __ ] looks [ __ ] badass like just black and white you know and this pen actually has on three temperature settings it has a low medium and hot so we're good I have it on the low temperature right now so I guess let's just move this we're gonna heat it up yeah it's preheating for me right now [Music] tastes Oh fire yeah the taste gets a five out of five right off the bat the way it smokes you see I'm barely ripping it I'm blowing clouds it gets a five out of five for the way he smokes it [ __ ] rips my smoked a little bit before I made this video but I'm definitely [ __ ] like I wanna hit this what two or three times so far I mean I'm already higher than I was when I started this video so yeah I mean it's definitely some [ __ ] hope we're not [ __ ] you know what I mean um so these carts should definitely fire but the price of them is they're cheap within the select parts that's a good thing but there's still a little pricey if they were about like 55 bucks I think that'd be a better price point but 62 was a little bit expensive in my opinion for a ground you guys ever tried on time live resin time we don't blow in the comments what you guys think of it and um I don't know if you guys are liking these like um Medical Marijuana reviews or like we train our views or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call these and you have any other recommendations or constructive criticism or anything like that you guys want to tell me time we don't blow in the comments read every single comment I try to reply to every comment I can or at least majority of them or at least like favorite them or you know let me do something I'm always trying to show as much love back to you guys as you guys showed to me because it's like honestly like without you guys that wouldn't really be [ __ ] I mean I'm not really the biggest youtuber right now but still without you guys I wouldn't be nothing you know I mean but so if you guys ever hit me put my Instagram you guys see I always hit you guys back and show as much love as I can so I mean yeah I really do appreciate you guys showing all the love and support you guys do like it honestly doesn't go like for like unseen like I really do appreciate it I'm not making that up but if you guys like really like these videos um the card reviews aren't stuff like that time we don't blow in the comments I've just been like [ __ ] so insanely busy it's been crazy working 40 hours a week trying to do this YouTube stuff keep my Instagram pages active like if you didn't know I have a page where I resell some FTP clothes in the street like that and there's some other stuff so I have so much [ __ ] I'm trying to work on at once while I'm doing [ __ ] 40 hours a week at work and then I figure I said I didn't know I got a [ __ ] DUI for medical marijuana so I got a I'm on probation for that so I'm doing dealing with a bunch of [ __ ] but uh so I'm just [ __ ] insanely busy right now but these videos are just kind of easy for me to record and get out like kind of fast you know what I mean that's what I've been doing them but um we'll have more reaction videos out soon hopefully so if you guys want to see them and you have any requests for us then we don't blow in the comments but definitely this car is definitely fires [ __ ] if you ever um if you ever see a kind live resin in your area I recommend definitely picking them up definitely if they are and if they have a buy one get one free deal like they have when I got these definitely pick them up because it's a [ __ ] steal I don't see why you wouldn't um don't smoke none of those fake hearts going around that's for sure we're all square I'll give this like a four out of five I mean what I said I meant to say a 4.5 out of 5 so like half a point away from a perfect score just for the fact being that they're like a little pricey like I said if they were around like that fifty five dollar mark that'd be a lot more like I don't know I just think that'd be like a better price point for them I mean I don't know I mean the worth is 662 dollars you know what I'm saying but just me personally I don't like spending that much money on just one gram because like I said I can get two grams of should have it for that price but I think 55 bucks should make it a better deal and I think they'd probably sell a lot more cards than they do now if they lowered the price a little bit but yeah that's just my honest review so four point five out of five that's the overall score pace five out of five the way it smokes five out of five I pretty much everything gets a five out of five except for the price point the price point gets a four out of five so that's the only reason it gets like a four point five out of five and I like I said I still have a couple other cards I could review there's a lot of other like dope dispensaries around me there's actually like a kitchen where they make like edible hamburgers and [ __ ] like that pizza so I can make a video there if you guys want um just really anything you guys want me to do is help me down below in the comments but yeah these carts are stupid fired four point five out of five final reading I know I said that a bunch so I'm in the video here let me hit this one more time to see if I have anything I want to tell you guys before in the video and then we'll just ended off that so the flavor on that is so good though like that it tastes so [ __ ] good just if you ever see them in your area definitely pick them up and if you ever tried them down below in the comments for you guys sing at them but 4.5 out of 5 like I said and besides for that it's been Ronnie ray give the video a big thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] it slides for that you already know peace out", "HrDbe_WPuHc": "how's going YouTube this is outs coming at you for TV TV in the studio with a very special video for you today I'm super excited about this one we have the best oil pens and 510 threaded batteries of 2020 a lot of your experience will come down to your battery cartridge and oil all working together in harmony but the battery is the thing you have the most control over so choosing one or even multiple batteries that match your needs is the most important thing obviously the better the battery the better your experience will be with your cartridge and oil also because these batteries are relatively inexpensive and you might find yourself with multiple carts it's perfectly OK to own up more than one of them I personally have three that I cycle through if at any point you like this video throw us a thumbs up would you if you're gonna go scrubbing your way through it at least leave us a like before you bounce and if you'd like to pick up any of the batteries I talked about today links will be in the description below without further ado let's get into it sitting in our number one spot this year is the tronie inline of 510 batteries trone ian landed in the market with a splash releasing a handful of batteries all at once the line consists of three batteries the neutron hITRON and tau tron and an oil cartridge called the tron pod they also have a disposable battery which I'll touch on later what I like about Rhoni and batteries is that they've nailed the space between budget-friendly and performance with a device for every consumer their units are versatile and calibrated to work more effectively with a wide range of 510 cartridges and oils the patron is one of the cheapest and smallest offerings of the Tyrolean line along with a distinct pen shape it also has draw activation which works with any draw activated cart so make sure you check the instructions on your cartridge before choosing a battery the Piton battery is built sturdily and can handle any size 510 threaded car it has 350 ml amp hours of power which is impressive for a unit of this size and price point and I absolutely love that there is a USB charger on the bottom of the device it couldn't possibly be any easier to use just screw your cartridge on and inhale the neutron is another incredibly budget-friendly battery and just like the patron comes in at under $15 offering a very similar pen shape the neutron has a one button three voltage settings and a preheat function the on-board voltages are two point six three point three and 4.0 volts giving you a large range to work with that preheat function I touched on before does a great job of warming thicker oils and concentrates it is universally compatible and should be able to power most carts you throw at it five tabs will turn it on two will change between temperatures and three will activate that preheat function it is no larger than a literal pen and can be completely hidden by most hands for some stealth vaping at the top of their lineup is the Tao Tron the Tao John features a magnetic adapter for your carts that you can easily screw on to the base of your 510 threaded cartridge that will allow the cartridge to slip completely inside the housing protecting your car from damage the couch on has been designed to automatically detect the resistance of your cartridge and is calibrated to accept almost any viscosity of oil when fully charged it has a max voltage of 4.2 volts when you draw from the tower on there's a light that illuminates at the bottom of the device to show that power is being supplied to your cartridge the design is just super clean and I love the fact that they have cutouts to show your oil levels which is certainly a feature I prefer for my batteries there's nothing worse than taking a dry head it is draw activated and features a 380 million power battery that charges via USB and even for the top of their line the tower on is extremely budget-friendly I like everything about this device from the size to the power I love how small the tower on is it's shorter than other pens it's smaller than other mods it just works and that's why it's my number one choice I know a lot of your experience is gonna be down to buying prefilled cartridges but for those who like to fill their own cartridge Choa nyan has also released the Tron pod the Tron pods are perfectly calibrated from the tronie in line to offer maximum efficiency they also offer better wicking than most cartridges on the market meaning less time waiting and filling and less dry hits I've also been told some oil producers will be working with Tony and to get these Tron pods filled so keep an eye out for that lastly TRO nyan does offer their disposable vape pen the alphatron the alphatron is the solution for anyone looking for a disposable pen that also has a childproof lock it is designed for one-time use and is geared towards those who prefer to fill up their own cartridges the battery comes pre charged with enough juice to finish the attached Tron pod considering you get an empty cartridge and a battery for the price it's not bad at all the literal only issue I have with it is the spelling alpha with an F come on people as a Greek boy I cannot stand by and watch this travesty happen alpha is spelt with a pH okay droning sitting in our number-two spot this year we have the vessel battery if you are a classy as [ __ ] oh no sir with a need for the top of the top rugged devices look no further than the vessel it is a seriously gorgeous device that comes in a plethora of colors to suit your tastes there are three voltage settings on the vessel 2.8 3.2 and 3.6 bolts there is a notable difference between the voltage settings as well and the vessel can handle any cartridge with aplomb I've been using mine for a while now and I've never put a cartridge in that it could handle if you have a wider diameter cart you will have to forego the shield but it's super easy to take off the vessel is a 240 million power battery that you can get about a hundred rips on before it needs to be recharged it is slightly larger than your average oil pen but it's nothing to write home about as it still fits in any pocket or bag and the included cartridge protector can stave off most dents and scratches and keep your cartridge safe I really like the performance and look of this device it makes me feel super classy as I'm taking ribs in an alleyway on my way to the grocery store the price point is a bit high but if you want a top-of-the-line high performance device the vessel is the battery for you in the number three spot we have the tried and tested and true pocket one plus a great device with a lot of versatility the pocket oneplus has a wide cartridge area and can accept almost any cart you throw at it don't throw your carts at it and then blame me and please just don't do it don't it also works with top and bottom airflow cartridges which is pretty cool the pocket oneplus is another solid device that protects your carts from breaking it also has that magnetic adapter just like the tower on the and it has three temperature settings which is just the icing on the cake it runs up three point seven four point three and five point one volts if anyone cares I use the preheat function quite a bit yes it does have a pretty heat function another thing to love about the pocket oneplus the pocket oneplus has a 660 million hour battery that should last you a number of days even if you're a heavy user ok this is not a challenge don't come back to me and say I hit it 483 times in 30 minutes and the battery died that battery tops up in about 45 minutes which is also pretty great the oneplus is a great size and the button placement is spectacular I'm laughing because I might be the only person that cares about button placement but seriously it's great 5 clicks will turn it on to will change temperature 3 will activate that preheat function it's just simple to use just like the vessel the price point is a touch high but if you're willing to shell out a couple extra bucks you will certainly not be disappointed coming in at number four the C cell battery lineup has two great devices for use with your favorite oil the palm is a great budget-friendly device that is built really well it protects your cartridge and features a 500 million power battery simply screw the magnetic adapter onto your cartridge and slot it into the base the palm fits easily inside your hand great chest and is a great buddy for a night out the silo is the palms slightly bigger brother it keeps most of the same features we loved about the palm like that 500 milliamp hour battery and the fact that it protects your cart the silo fits into any pocket and you won't be worried about any damage to your cart because of that card protection I touched on earlier it also has the little newer slot so you can monitor the level of your oil in the cartridge there is no voltage control to speak up on either C cell device but for the price point I don't see that as a big drawback at all I personally find the silo to have a slightly better form factor and I just like the way it fits in my hand either way C cell batteries are built really well and a solid pick for any user the only thing I would note the narrower cartridge opening means they are not universally compatible but again a minor issue sitting in our number 5 spot the Lynx herm\u00e8s 3 is a solid pen this ultra slim slick device does a good job of pumping out clouds but where it really shines is flavor the ceramic atomizer does a good job of pulling the terpenes out of your oil it has three voltage settings to customize the flavor and the density of your clouds the atomizer doesn't leak and wicks really well this is a solid choice for anyone who sources their own oil and wants a refillable device complete with a tank as the atomizer is really good quality and can handle being refilled multiple times the kit itself comes with the pen the USB charger and the handy carrying case which is really typical of links and just gives you everything you need also typical is their consistency with build quality as the hermes 3 is a well-built device that features a 290 million power battery it's super easy to use five taps will turn it on three will change voltage settings and as long as your buddy Jon knows how to press a button and inhale at the same time you should be okay to pass this around at parties without having to explain to anything I'll leave the choice on whether or not to do so up to you and that's it for this one guys thank you so much for watching this video I hope I helped you even a little bit to choose the battery that will work best with your favorite oil if you enjoyed this video if you learned something please tap to have that like button if you

avatar or avitas cured resin a cartridge all avatars as far as i know are single origin extracts and they make um distillates cured resin and live resin carts and pax pods as well so they're super high and super high quality from what i've seen so i haven't tried one before just do the price tag but i've been wanting to try one for a while so here's here it is and i'll give you a close-up and then try it out and let you know what i think [Music] let's try this thing out and read it um talk about it so forth so this is made by avatars which as i said seems to be a pretty high-end brand i've wanted to try them for some time um the strain is cherry og which i looked into it seems to be a mix of cherry thai afghan and lost coast og which all seem to be pretty old strains so this might be a fairly old strain as well this is single origin hybrid cured resin meaning it all comes from same grow of cherry og you're not getting a bunch of different growers people's cherry og so that adds to the price tag of these carts that's pretty exciting though uh that just makes you feel that much safer with what you're getting and know this proper um the strain and everything about it really it is cured resin i opted for cured resin over live resin because i'm actually one of the probably one of the few people who i think i like cured resin more than um lime resin i like i feel like generally a more complex taste and it has more more terpenes that live resin is usually overshadowed by like beta miracin pint um limonene a couple others like that where some of the heavier ones seem to stick around in the curing process and get more interesting ones so anyways um very nice looking packaging as you can see very sharp um these are i think 40 recreationally um i got mine i think it was like that'd be like 32 med and then i got 25 off that bringing it down to like i don't know what uh eight dollars off that twenty four dollars or so i know it's like 36 for the live resin then a little cheaper than both of these for they also have ultra which i think are distillate carts all of them are single source they're all a little pricey they all look really good so that's probably part of it oh okay let's get on the back first on the back you got cherry og one gram thc coming in at 82.3 percent or 823 milligrams for a container cbd is at loq um you've got 10 total terpenes in this and um okay and then you got thirty percent of that ten percent is beta cardiophiline i guess i'll just say that um what it is of the total thing it should be three percent beta cardiophiline one point nine percent selenidine one point one percent pinene one percent limonene one percent cedrol c-e-d-r-o-l i'm not familiar with that one that's exciting um nine point zero point nine percent humulene zero point six percent alpha cedrine and then alph um zero point five percent alpha terpenial so as you can see pretty complex and also a lot more terps that you don't really see so often oh weird anyways that's someone going down the street that's cool so this was made on what is seven um march april may june okay july i'm terrible with months sorry this was made on july 13th 2020 and tested on july 15th a little bit older than the other cards i've been getting but still not old at all really in the in cards i start wearing one they're about like a year older um you got light scale labs report id they even have the report id on here so you can look up their um lab reports how cool is that um and then they got the uid so you got everything there all the general info a lot of info on the terpenes which i like and potentially more if you look at light scale labs who they run a lot of tests or a test for a lot of companies around here a lot of the good ones especially i see use light scale labs and some lower end ones we'll use rose city but i don't think there's any real like correlation uh i think it's just a lot of lower end companies have a lot of like lines and brands like mana and lovely and um a lot of things like that so they probably just use the same people usually all right so when you open this up you got this which is super cool i probably should have showed you a close-up but i'll take a picture of it and post it in here too um let's see if focusing helps at all not too much but that's all right so what it says says avatars natural additive and flavoring free no pg vg or peg which is um okay i don't know i just uh don't remember the what that stands for but it's often used in vape vape juices and whatnot that says for best results store upright at 65 to 75 fahrenheit ensure the battery is fully charged for best taste use a 3.7 volt battery not recommended for refilling okay um and then you got same stuff but in like a little picture form got full battery 3.7 volts i think that's just the cart with a little up arrow saying store it up right and then at 65 to 75 degrees fahrenheit and then you also get this interesting thing definitely will know if you ever got a fake if anyone tried to fake these because these are pretty intricate little packages so you got that which kind of holds it up oh wow i'm gonna have to use scissors which luckily i have some right by yeah it looks like you gotta use scissors to open this there's really no easy way to open that might be able to find a way but i don't really see the need to so i'll just slice that and here you are really beautiful oil in there very very clean looking i know nothing wants to focus on this but that's alright and i'll take that sticker off like i always do very nice looking looks vaguely cloudy on the camera but it doesn't look like that in real life it's very very clear so again you get a jupiter c cell high quality c c-cell very no leaks or anything like that so all good jupiter is always fitting my vessel jupiter's fitting everything i swear those are some of the best cartridges you can get all right so it says for best results 3.7 volts which i'm 99 sure is going to be the um the middle setting on my vessel so let's try this out cherry og beautiful vapor production as usual with jupiter c cells that taste is so good damn that is a good good card right there it's already one of my favorites right now that's so good just an effect on everything so far or we'll see about effects i mean but like taste and vapor production that's smooth in the lungs and everything wow that is a solid cart high quality right there these might be like my new favorites a little pricey so it's hard to grab them as often but that is seriously good so it's a pretty clear taste too that's when you get i guess i don't know if it's from like single origin or just the quality of the production or what but i mean i have no problem like getting a good taste off that very very much like you got a very like earthy taste to it i lean heavily for earthy on this one which is weird it says it's mostly cardio filling um let me get that yeah now it's kind of like a not not very spicy because all the other terps and i don't know if it being cured matters at all but it's not a very spicy but it's very like earthy not very herbal but like very earthy um and then you got some nice cherry undertones see where they get the cherry from um yes i'm just like sweet cherry tom um i would say cherry because like usually there is definitely like a berry taste i'm not quite sure what ter what terpene it is but there's definitely like a berry taste that cannabis can produce and it usually reminds me of blueberry or like rasp kind of like raspberry but it's definitely like a heavier berry like a blue or something like that but this one's a lot sweeter and like a light way so it definitely reminds me of cherry i mean you can just see the vapor production on that that is intense it's got it they got it dialed in for 3.7 volts for sure that smells so good too that just like very light cherry after like an herbal tone or i mean a earthy tone that's crazy how clear that is so you know i buy a lot of i don't buy like a lot of low end cards except for the hushes but i don't expect flavor from those but these are just a whole whole different level um i didn't think about it till afterwards but these i think 40 bucks wreck we're a half gram these are four grams but we're a half gram half rock hash rosin cards i think it's live hash rosin that goes for 45 so next time i'm gonna buy one of these i might just go for a half gram live rosin to really get the best cart because but otherwise i think solventless these are some of the best cards their live resin cards are probably incredible um but i prefer cured resin as i said all right i'm close this video out thanks for watching everybody thank you avatar for making beautiful beautiful oils and great extracts like and subscribe um click the notification i don't know if you can do that do all this stuff that generally subscribers tell you to do i mean youtubers tell subscribers to do thanks and have a great day", "BOUWQvtjvTs": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to weights the marijuana review show where we help you find folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at a cartridge here on wheats a good old-fashioned 510 cartridge i've got my trusty battery here nice and plain and then the product we're actually reviewing which is napalm we are reviewing uh our first cartridge anything from the folks at napalm uh and this happens to be their napalm o g um strain so both the company is napalm and the strain is napalm og that we are taking a look at uh so i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach it is 43 dollars for a gram uh which is um about average maybe a little bit cheaper than average uh at this dispensary that i um pick up from um so uh you know keep that in mind with the review 43 bucks uh for a lot of people i know is very cheap for a one gram cartridge but not so much here in long beach um as i said standard 510 so this is no special pod nothing different or weird your normal twisty battery is going to work here uh so i don't know a lot about napalm i know this dispensaries had them for a while i couldn't really find a whole lot of online presence for them outside of listings didn't see a lot but let's go ahead and get this open um and on the back before we really get started here let's go ahead and take a look at the lab testing results if it'll focus up there um there we go uh looks like it's coming in at about 75 thc or so uh which is about average for a cartridge maybe on the slightly lower end but um which is you know maybe commiserate with the price so uh now we know our laptop results we got about our 75 thc let's figure out how we open this somewhat elaborate looking packaging here there are a lot of flaps on it that's glued pretty tight oh we've got a little um authentic holographic sticker here i'm not really sure what they think that putting a sticker that just says authentic on it is going to try to solve but you know i assume anybody can buy that sticker but maybe some psychological assurance uh let's rip that effing sticker off there we go pull it out voila here we are here is our one gram napalm cartridge ooh that is a very different design uh this is not uh this is totally unique never seen anything quite like this i'm not even sure what material this is maybe aluminum some kind of metal here on the tip the oil actually looks pretty good there gold rich um yeah it looks way better than i thought and i'm curious about this cartridge design it's just got the one big intake hole there better than that pretty standard looking heating element all that stuff so let's go ahead and plug it into our 510 thread here and give our napalm og from napalm a try here we go oh wow okay um that is a very different tasting uh strain than i am used to uh it is very extremely piney piney a little slightly bitter earthy um not bad just um a lot more uh aromatic than i guess i was expecting it's quite tasteful uh there's there's a lot going on there um and even pretty robust like bittery aftertaste i'm not usually a huge fan of bitter uh it's not terrible here it's that very earthy kind of bitter taste not sure i love the cartridge design kind of hard to get your like mouth around it it's very short little mouthpiece here uh you know most cartridges have a much longer sorry for the juvenile humor or uh images uh you know much larger place to put your lips and all that uh this is very small it's it's can make it tough to draw from it is unique wow yeah that is just extremely um terpeney there is just a lot of piney earthy bittery taste to it uh i usually like a lot of flavor this one uh i'm not gonna necessarily say it's bad i don't i actually don't think that it is it's just not the kind of strains that i normally go for um and this one is just heavy on the terpenes wow um the cartridge design again a little weird uh the draws are fine i'm getting draws okay but it's hard to sort of get a good seal but in terms of potency no problem saying this is 75 i've taken quite a few draws here feeling the effects quite strong um in terms of the that being the most important aspect is it really going to get you high uh that seems to definitely be true i think this is pretty good oil it's just um you're gonna if you're gonna go for this napalm og you better like the piney earthy tastes of the strains um because this one has it in spades yeah i'm just uh uh so far i would say i have mixed feelings about my napalm og experience let's get another one in here nice hit smooth um you saw i drew for a while excelled for a while and i'm not hacking a lung up which is a good sign um but again that taste is very strong wow uh so uh right now i'm kind of um up in the air about our napalm og experience uh i would say if you really like the napalm as a strain maybe give this a consideration me i'm gonna uh finish off this gram i'm uh looking forward to it actually it's it's a bit of a different strain for me but a bit of a different experience can lead to some fun new uh experiences let's hope maybe who knows um it is different napalm og um let's give it a little bit of a wait and see i'm gonna finish off this gram and then like all our wheat's reviews i'll come back to you guys in the i don't know five days or so it'll take to get through this and i'll let you know exactly what i think of this whole experience i am a little worried about this cartridge design it seems like it might get clogged really easily with this very shallow hole um and there's not like a lot of plastic or anything sort of protecting stuff going in so uh i could imagine this novel cart design having some issues but we shall see it'll take me a couple days to get through it i'll be right back here to let you guys know exactly what i think when we finish this napalm og in just a few days until then stay high stay healthy see you right back here bye guys [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been about four days a little over four days since we started our journey with napalm and their strain napalm og uh just a little bit left there so i could have one or two more hits to share with you guys like this one here and well i gotta tell you my thoughts experiences really haven't changed much in four days um i didn't hate it there's nothing fundamentally wrong with it it's just not my favorite cartridge not what i'm gonna go back to um primarily what i found distasteful was the taste um that sort of acrid vaguely burnty piney earthy taste of the napalm uh it just wore on me i never sort of grew accustomed to it as a matter of fact the more i did it the more i kind of didn't want to do it um kind of even had to make myself get to this point to finish this one off i would have moved on to something else um it's not that the oil is bad it feels like the 75 percent as listed it's just not the highest quality the cart design is also so top-heavy i mean most cards are top-heavy by design but this one with this like heavy aluminum tip it's just so hard to keep it balanced um and also if you keep it in your pocket it's guaranteed it's going to turn upside down on itself and it's got that shallow intake hole which got clogged on me more than once had to clean it out it's just not the best experience it's certainly not the worst experience uh you know it's somewhere in that middle of the road and at 43 dollars it's cheap but it isn't the cheapest um and i have had even cheaper cartridges that i have had that i've enjoyed more so i can't give this one a big thumbs up i'm not even sure i can give this one a tepid recommendation uh i do think that there is better stuff out there for you um i may in the future try to review one of napalm's other strains they're not napalm og itself and see if maybe i have better luck uh but that's only if you guys are really curious otherwise there's plenty out there to review we'll take a look at those and we'll take a look at those on our next review whenever that is sometime in our near future i hope you guys will join us for that one until then stay high stay healthy and we'll see you then docs",

please you guys don't go raw dog it's not worth it might be worth it at the time quick little test you guys don't know was good it's been a while since I uploaded a cartridge video I know a lot of people always tell me man like go find another cartridge every time I go to like the club I always try to look for a certain brand especially like a couple brands that you guys tell me to review or try to find and I could just never find them it's like I feel like raw garden 7/10 I can't even find the 17 last one about first of all let's choose ooh nice safe sex and paychecks all 2020 he doesn't it was good all right now I cleaned it let's get it cam done the best live resident cartridge everybody is these [ __ ] raw garden cartridges bro I've reviewed at least I like at least like my 11th or 12th cartridge I reviewed on this channel and man they gave me so lid dude I've tried other cartridges before and like honestly man it's just not the same like the shooters when a 2r is bro gets you [ __ ] below Shh every single time that when you're going like to the club and you want to get like a sativa they're all gone bro like the ste buffs are always ready they're just flying assistant Evo's do taste pretty good bro like especially like the like the sauce wax like the sauce diamonds Oh delish prolly delish and I got to get myself a new piece to a good amount of people that come here just for the cartridges and just for like the blunt and joint sessions you know when we're just rolling up some trees but there's also other people out here that come to this channel to watch me dive into

expensive either but I heard those are good man and either that or I'm an invest in a pub Co mmm that I think apopka would be [ __ ] great no butane no type of torching you know everything's like it's like you know I'm talking it's pretty much an email you know it's like damn and now that I think about it's like cuz when you guys take dad's you know we're smoking concentrates it has to be at the right temperature you know because if you take it too low you're gonna get a good head you're gonna get a good taste of it you know until you're not gonna get like the full potential and if you take it too hot that should just badger throw and it's just so unhealthy for you man I know a couple people out there that man they take dabs hot dance bra line you got that [ __ ] torching red red hot and the only way for like for four or five seconds for the like the redness to go in they take that [ __ ] and I can't bro that's how it's the best no [ __ ] that bro you're [ __ ] like [ __ ] burning your legs but that's so much damage now to get everybody look I checked this out all this for all this live resin smoky and all these concentrates trees all these Aryans were smoking yeah might not like do any damage right now you might feel fine like a month later or a month or two later but like I'm telling you guys right now the [ __ ] come now we're throwing into our bodies we're smoking into our bodies who knows how it's gonna affect us like they're 20 34 years down the road you know I can see myself when I'm like sixty actually oh no man cuz I dunno I have smoked with a couple elders believe it or not my [ __ ] mom at my managers like from this apartment so so where I live so I've been living at the spot for about like 10 plus years right so I got pretty cool with like that the manager is the owners and all that stuff right and then one time they invited us over for my good retirement little kickback right cuz they're retiring they're having a little kickback right and like bro they just start smoking pot bro crazy like oh my entire life I was just like damn these are like business people you know they're like professionals but like behind the scenes or Bo you had you had this like okay one of the managers bro she opens up a box and she has like five different cartridges she's like which one you want to hit ever like was the [ __ ] crazy I can read this dragonballs it and then after that you had someone else have like open up a little box and it's just like chocolate edibles and I'm just like brown what the passing that [ __ ] around right so they're passing the pen and then they were passing around the [ __ ] um a bunch of like chocolate bars right edibles so we're just like taking little pieces you know I'm eating I'm eating this [ __ ] I'm just like this is pretty pony you know it's pretty strong I'm in the pans you know and then they got like they bring out pints and then I go what would like which pipes you guys want to use and when I bro what though foot and they told yeah if you guys want to roll like a blood a joint just like roll it up right and we're like bro what the [ __ ] so we're just having this like massive session now also with a couple like the boys to a couple of my friends we're all there and we're just having it like this we're having like this mass and said I think I think even hostels day - I don't know I'm gonna have to ask I'm gonna and like another video but like it was just funny because it's like like they watched us grow up pretty much you know like I was like 12 years old when I moved into this far right and I was just like dude that's just crazy and we're just having this like massive sense like we grew up thinking the [ __ ] was like so bad and I go my god it's equivalent to like [ __ ] hard drugs and [ __ ] but I mean it's really not but definitely smoking any type of smoking is not good even bacon bro I prefer this over a jewel Eddie day one of those pop bars crazy because back then remember when they first came out people were like oh you know this is good for you it's nothing it's a little bit of like legatine and flavor you know natural flavors you know smoke like you're [ __ ] putting your face you know like those uh those big bake machines those big bake machines that shoot out smoke like on stage I'm like bro it's that in like a little like a tiny little jewel looking thing you know little rectangle barn bro I'm like Hannah now bro that [ __ ] is not yet bro nothing is good for you bro too much so I'm ready I'm already have a blasted okay everybody this is a podcast so you know anything goes interested but uh make sure you guys go check out my main channel - it's 120 k subs I just uploaded a brand new video probably down and it comes to follow me on all my social power follow me on all my social media down in the description and as I was saying like everything is like bad for your body like too much of it you know there's like a lady that died from water poisoning because she just drank too much water so - too much too much soda [ __ ] you up too much coffee [ __ ] you up anything brother too much beer [ __ ] you up it's crazy that's crazy so you just gotta balance it out man ain't no real [ __ ] though everybody 20/20 check this out man I know every I know a good amount of people that are watching this bro we all have she diets like let's be honest let's be honest like we all have shitty diets like for example I'll be eating the most I'm eating the most nastiest [ __ ] I still drink soda like what I'm trying to do what I'm gonna try what I'm going to try to do is I'm gonna minute I'm gonna just have at least maybe like one can of soda a week right a week but I'm definitely a try to drink a [ __ ] little more water I'm gonna try to eat more greens you know try to get some more natural green food in me you know like some spinach some broccoli you know [ __ ] it lettuce [ __ ] some trees you know [ __ ] I'm about to start biting my neck so I get greens that cows right you guys are known as good man like this channel is literally all educational purposes and all its like everything's just like a good positive bottom you know um because in reality reality with in reality everybody like I'm starting to get more live now you guys can do whatever the [ __ ] you guys want to do like real [ __ ] [ __ ] like it's crazy how people are you know I get you know you want to go to school get your degree you know do that man do it because that's sick you know even though you don't use your degree you could at least say you know I have a degree you know so I went through the whole process them you know like education right I finished my whole my entire education and even though you can get like a master's PhD all that other [ __ ] right it's like ask yourself this question before you go into a career are you going into it because of what people are saying because of what your family wants you to do and because of what society wants you to do you know like I was thinking about that like oh do I wanna do I really want to be in the sales job do I really want to be in this like behind the camera like I'm just the film guy you know I'm just the film guy come I'm just the camera guy type [ __ ] just in order to be accepted you know by family or accepted by a society if that makes sense going after this degree you know going after a degree I'm so later I make I'm making no sense like I feel like I'm making no sense right now but if it doesn't make sense a shout out man you guys are smart because it right he has like a degree in honestly you know I'll be talking up and just like asking him for I got advice type [ __ ] you know like he's older than me but like I think four or five years it's not a lot but you know he got his degree in all that [ __ ] right and I just be talking him you know I'm gonna do it so like what's up like what do you think and he was just telling me he's like honestly like this was like my dream job only because of like well my family and what society wanted me to do you're not coming since he's just like in the office right now no five I mean he makes he makes good money you know he makes he makes good money he's able to live on his own he's able to support you know his family and all that [ __ ] right so I'm like okay it's cool but in reality he's telling his I do it honestly like cuz you know he knows about everything he knows about my indica he knows my I'm country one you know he knows about like my channels and [ __ ] the [ __ ] that I'm trying to get into the [ __ ] that I'm trying to do you know pretty well I'm pretty much trying to say like damn it instead of him goin on like college and pursuing this office nine-to-five job he'd rather be doing what I'm doing you know it's trying to start my own brand you know who's trying to start my own stuff you know get my own days on you know be try to be self-made you know even though he I mean technically when you go to school and all this [ __ ] you're still selling made because you're the one that gets your ass through school you know you're the one that does it so technically you are still self-made you know but but it's like yeah but it's like in reality I'm just like in my and he was telling me he's like doing and honestly like my jobs not even guaranteed like all these benefits and everything is just not guaranteeing you know for us right this generation like back in the day in the 80s okay you know back you know it's just like like back 40 50 60 years when people are going to school and getting their degrees that's what it was like those words because you had a guaranteed job guaranteed benefits nowadays in this day is like 20 20 shit's changing you know selling your shit's changing and nothing's guaranteed that jobs not getting to you those benefits are just like they're not guaranteeing you know so I'm just and that's kind of scary you know and he was telling me about that about business degrees marketing to me he's like just everything you know you have to be like really yeah you got to get lucky you don't get locked into this business but at the same time even though when you're locked in he says it's still not guaranteed because he's telling me that who knows if Social Security is gonna be there by the time we retire right so it's just like for him in his head he's like he's like I'm just I'm relating on my career's benefits and like maybe like my 401k like a little pension his like say a life savings account right a little bit of investments you know so you should lying on that but it's like it's just never guaranteed and he was telling me is like for example me I'm creating my own brand like I'm going like for me I'm doing like three four different things right now so I'm all over the place I'm all over the place like I'm on all these like I'm trying to work in all these industries but they all kind of like help one another if that makes sense you know like I'm really getting into like digital marketing right and also what does YouTube technically this YouTube is like also marketing as well like anything you push out it's just like anything you push out like you're pretty much like an influencer you know creating you got people you got people to support you you know so it's like already that's that's already good for like the business you know the business marketing side of it you know so I'm just like growing it's just crazy because I really was thinking about like I don't you guys do know like I was about to transfer to SoCal to SoCal University and I was just about to pursue a degree in film right and the one thing I do think about it though is just like okay maybe like I was looking at the jobs I was gonna be working like for bro and it's crazy because I had a teacher in high school and I told what I wanted to do right and he's telling me sick honestly getting that degree might not be the best thing he's straight up told you so honest he was like the degree you're getting is not you're you're not gonna get money you're not gonna get good money and it stuck with me because in my head I'm like okay he's not saying it to hate on me he's saying it because that's like what realistically because he says he has a bunch of colleague or like friends people we went to college with they're in that they're in the industry and right now they're just kind of struggling and they're still struggling you know and that's just crazy and it's just like to me I'm just like Brad and I told them I was like alright if I don't go to school then then I'm gonna be stuff made you know do my own thing he told me he's like he's like he's like no honestly like you just go to school but just have that as like a minor or mark

video make sure that stuff too like a comment subscribe and I will see you guys in another video shadow my neighbors", "oHhzsm8OXVE": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy mixed up place you call your local dispensary today we are taking a look at a vape brand that is quite huge and one that has managed to escape our attention for some time here on wheats and that is the fine folks over at legion of bloom legion of bloom yes legion of bloon they make all kinds of different 5 10 um thread vape pot or carts as well as i think they partner with packs and make um different packs pods uh with their under their legion of balloon bloom line as well we are taking a look at their mendo breath indica 1 gram here today on the back we've got their lab testing results uh showing it coming in at if it'll focus uh 78 and thc uh and then as everybody's gonna want to know this comes in at 45 for a 1 gram but it'll never focus terrible at that 45 bucks for the one gram uh cartridge uh at a dispensary in long beach which puts it right smack dab in the average cost range for uh uh vapes at this dispensary mendo breath uh is a a strain that i'm not a huge strained guy but one that i do tend to like um and let's go ahead i'm a big fan of uh and by a big fan i mean i usually hate reading these sort of uh overly flowery uh pros that they these companies include on their packaging to sell you on them so let's let's lead you a little bit of the legion of bloom's story here legion of bloon is a coalition of eco-conscious cultivators with a deep reverence for the cannabis plant we carefully select terpene-rich genetics and capture their essence through solventless extraction methods combined with triple refined cannabis oil the result is a full spectrum experience unmatched in flavor and purity we invite you to join our legion nate let's join so let's go ahead and open this bad boy up uh let me go ahead and mention this packaging really beautiful packaging by the way uh it doesn't look that um crazy opulent either in terms of materials it's just very neat looking i really like the design it's sparkly and gold and i guess i kind of um uh you know um have the uh the sort of uh brain attention of a bird and like the shiny sparkly things gets my attention like this does uh i want to build a nest out of this legion of bloom cartridge packaging so we've pulled the little tab here let us slide open now is easy not too bad more uh marketing materials there and then in here we have got the thing itself wow okay a lot of materials nice thick plastic there and we're finally to the cartridge itself oh that is some nice looking oil guys yum that that oil actually looks incredible uh very thick looking uh incredibly pure oh i'm excited to give this a try this has got me really amped up uh it's got like the ceramic uh tip with that well it might be some kind of plastic it feels like ceramic um but it is a nice material i've seen a lot of uh the newer cartridges using this either higher quality plastic or some kind of ceramic uh it works a lot better than the cheaper acrylic tips so here we go let's finally give this mendo's breath a try hmm uh oh well my battery was showing that it was drying but i'm not getting anything let me try a different battery i have one here on standby let's give another shot well looks like i've got a bum battery sorry beloved um raw gardens battery you look like you're finally gonna have to join the collection in the sky uh but this battery works fine and this cartridge tastes great i forgot to mention they call this the monarch um with a hundred percent cannabis derived terpenes so this is uh triple refined cannabis oil and then all of the terpenes that are added back in are the terpenes from the mendo breath strain itself um it tastes like mendo breath that i don't know it's a very hard to describe taste almost spiced in a way i like it i like it a lot um and the oil itself is uh appears to taste as good as it looks uh quality wise so smooth um wow man that is quality stuff um yeah that just vaguely spiced taste that uh some mendoz mendo breath strain has this has in spades uh quite high already uh after those couple of hits you saw how smooth it was too i didn't really feel it at all going in um but rather big hits off not very hard draws as well um nice cartridge design seemingly as well from uh legion of bloom or they use a nice cartridge so far so good here oh wow guys i i i mean i barely feel it going in uh certainly feel it in the head as it's going out uh strong tasty um and just some really quality quality oil um this is a big old thumbs up so far for legion of bloom i can see why they have are a ten times award-winning company good for them uh great tasting not bad uh affordably priced right in the uh average price range at the dispenser i go to so so far this is a big thumbs up for a legion of bloom uh with their mendo's breath strain uh i am really really looking forward to finishing this one off uh as like all of our weeks reviews i'm gonna review the whole cartridge not just these first couple of hits because these things tend to leak they tend to clog they tend to break down all these things can pop up as you guys know so it'll probably take me about five days or so to finish this gram off uh really looking forward to doing that and as soon as i do i will come right back here let you guys know our wrap-up thoughts of this legion of bloom experience but first half so far so good anyways we'll see you guys right back here for part two in just a bit thanks for watching [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been about five and a half days since we started our journey with the monarch from legion of bloom their mendo breath strain this one gram 45 cartridge five days later my impressions are just as rapturous as they were before i really really really liked this one i like the quality of the oil like the taste of the strain that sort of spiced nutmeg cinnamony vague taste of uh the mendoz breath here was great um that oil as i said quality top to bottom never got that burnt taste never got that never started to burn that uh or get those big cloudy sort of vapor heavy hits nothing like that um just fantastic quality uh cartridge design worked incredibly well no clogs didn't have to get that like big first draw to get it going just a fantastic uh product really happy uh with the legion of bloom system not sure again why it's called the monarch it's got the mendo breath strain and the name the monarch but we'll forgive them we'll forgive legion of bloom we'll forgive the name the monarch because it's so good big old thumbs up here just as i had hoped and anytime we have a thumbs up this big we like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that is not necessarily weed related and you don't necessarily need weed to enjoy although this recommendation might want a little weed beforehand because it's going to make that penis all the better that's right we're talking pen 15 on our cherry on top a show that just entered its second season on hulu a phenomenal show hi thank you a phenomenal show that just entered its second season on hbo and by hbo i do mean hulu uh it is a one joke premise it is about two uh 30 something year old women who pretend to be middle schoolers around the era of y2k and they act with a bunch of 12 13 year old kids and say a bunch of foul-mouthed inappropriate things it sounds like it should get boring very quickly but it's actually hysterical and if you are like me in your early to mid 30s you're going to be very very at home in that aesthetic so check out pen 15 or as i prefer to call it penis on hulu and check out legion of bloom the monarch at your local dispensary two things that i enjoy having in my mouth a whole lot well", "b-dMFt2D7dY": "hey guys what is going on today we were looking at not a not exactly a cartridge but a disposable dad pen um these are made by nah I couldn't even I couldn't even find this um company myself when I was looking it up doing some research I could not find anything but certified loud Los Angeles harvest club I'm not sure if it's a really small place or something but these are half gram disposable soft sticks there's a lot of a lot of text right there if you that's something that interests you for some reason consume with care I'll make sure to do that before we look at the pen I just I really like this glass ironic see I think it's glass but I like this bottle it came in it has this weird stick inside to keep it in place which i think is good didn't it doesn't have it like just rattling around freely it could crack either to out like the container glass or the cart glass before we look at this certified loud as you can see or this is that visit led right here but as you can see this one's empty that's because when it was about it was about like this far down like more than halfway maybe a third of the way down and the pen died which was pretty confusing I tried taking it apart just top this top piece comes off you can pour it out like any like a normal coil but this bottom part does not I believe these are air holes on the sides see if I can get to focus but I really like the oil in these that's why that's why I took I took this out and then I I took the remaining wax on I put it in different cart just cuz I really liked it um if you've ever hit a puff coke peak it's kind of like that sort of taste where it's just like the raw the raw concentrate which I've had I've had cars like that before and I really didn't like it because it was like so over like it was just like it was like I'm [ __ ] tasting dabs right now but this was very these dabs were very well done like I feel like it was a perfect mix of good flavor but also taste natural and taste like dabs if you if anyone has even like heard of these like I don't I've never seen these before before recently um you know and if you have any info on the company they make other products or if you've tried these before I was a big fan I would definitely try these again if I find some but if you like cards if you like this video if you like videos like this my wanting to check out my channel drop a sub but got [ __ ] dumb kart videos that's pretty much it these are fire as [ __ ] I wish the pen was a little bit better so it didn't die I wish I had a I wish the pen was a little bit longer maybe that's pretty much it the wax is good very good I would definitely recommend these thank you peace out", "7ToVjMC-FlU": "what's going on guys welcome back to my very first video and first review today we're going to be reviewing the new roach pocket vapes these are pretty new from my understanding these are pretty new to the market especially out here in california so i thought we might as well make a video about it um i went ahead and pulled up the page of these new pocket vapes these roach vapes now i have not tried them yet so it's gonna be a first for me designed by tma labs in california tma lapse is a full service vape cartridge manufacturer from concept to manufacturing we control the entire process and ensure results for every client now this is the world's smallest fully disposable vape cartridge as you guys can see now this thing should have a battery and everything i shouldn't mean nothing with this thing so let's go ahead and turn back on the camera here it seems we've got some hybrid sour cherry pie and my addition is up there as you guys can see is two thousand two thousand eight hundred fifty one out of four thousand eighty eight so these are exclusive to an extent there's only about a certain amount per stream that they'll produce so let's go ahead and figure out how to open this up okay it looks like we got a pamphlet here love it toke it fill it pass it plug it sneak it rip it hit it roach it then recycle it okay i'm liking it presentation is good now in california it's not a standard to have a whole box beautiful set up like this but for the disposables i believe they do require it you can't just throw these in a bag now let's go ahead and open this up so as we can see we're going to go ahead and slice that open let's use using a little nail for this all right it's a little difficult to open up i'll say that all right all right now i gotta say that the name kind of throwing me off a little bit you know what i mean like some raid roach sprayer type of vibram you know what i'm saying but wow this thing really is small wow jesus and i mean that is some dark juice right there now i am going to take pictures of this for you guys as well and i'll display them in the video all right that looks pretty cool as you guys can see it's not that dark but it is pretty dark let's see if we can add some light on there wow that is badass and i mean that's battery included okay so we put some light up to the juice yeah it's pretty dark it's not the clearest but that does not matter let's go ahead and give her a taste all right so i guess we just hit it this now you guys may have not seen the hit come out but it definitely felt it definitely felt the peak when they hit flavor wise i can taste the sheer cherry it does take tastes a bit dark though like like an indica kind of heavy which ain't bad but you definitely have that indica taste with it now it is a hybrid we will take another hit for the video's sake but you know give me a minute there boys wow so far i mean i packed a punch in that hit if i'm not mistaken okay yeah this is sour cherry pie all right all right let's get real here one more fire now you guys are probably asking yourself how much i paid for this now these do go for 40 and i believe says 380 milligrams so i think we're looking at a half honestly but who knows how much wax is in this it does seem like quite a bit i will post in the comments how long it lasted me i'm not gonna go ahead and straight smoke this for the next couple days because i mean i plan on doing a ton of reviews for you guys i got a bunch of new stuff i got some i haven't smoked this one yet either bloom imperial extracts i have tried one of their cards pretty damn fire um i got cure pods for days you know we'll give them bad boys a shot it's all right and i'm gonna be honest with you guys if i don't recommend something i'll let you know none of this stuff is sponsored i do get 25 discounts to most of the dispensaries i go to because that's because i have a chronic health issue but needless to say forty dollars this packed punch now is it worth 40 dollars half a gram i'd say yes you know you don't have to have a battery it is portable now i'm not sure if you guys can charge these that's the only reason i never buy these is because you can usually run in the chance of them dying out on you now it is not common but i've had bad luck before but yeah needless to say this is the roach cartridge i appreciate all of you for tuning in to this video leave it a like for me guys and leave a comment down below if you tried this or plan to try it and subscribe to channel if you haven't already um this channel is not all about reviews i mean we're going to be hanging out too so i have a lot of stuff in store for this channel and yeah i appreciate you guys now i will recommend this cart to you guys if you need something quick on the go if you don't have a battery pick up a roach cart i mean you ain't gonna lose 40 bucks half a gram that is a bit steep but then again you got you guys got to think about it it has its own battery and it's the smallest bit we vape cartridge in the world right now come on i mean i say it's worth it let me know what you guys think down in the comments below i appreciate you for checking out this video give me your time and i'll see you in the next one signing out", "6aCL792CdOo": "two News has

traffic stop our estimation of Street values about six thousand dollars Fox six talked with Racine County Sheriff Christopher Schmeling at the time of the incident this traffic stop was initiated

much well", "W5c2hQqr8No": "yo what is going on youtube welcome back to another banger by your boy sebi g guys so man as you guys can see by the time i'm not even gonna sit here and just try to keep it going like you guys don't already know what we're gonna be doing in this video but guys getting straight into it man we got the legendary all right the long awaited buddies liquid diamonds live resin cartridge review all right boys so for those of you that don't know what but it is it's a liquid diamonds live sauce cart all right live resin cart you should say and pretty much there's no distillate no additives none of that bs it's just straight up live resin slash liquid diamonds you know this one in particular is legend gx watermelon skittles sitting at a 71 percent thc all right boys so by the low thc percentage i could already kind of tell you know it might be a true light resin because live resins in general re shoot really really really low and thc percentages for some reason so i'm assuming this is right on there man if it was a distillate cart it would probably be over 80 all right boys so before we break this in though i do want to let you guys know they do have a cannabis drive terpenes one so be careful when you guys go to dyspo's and things like that because i almost got that one that one does have distillate i believe it has this i'm not 100 sure but this one right here is the true 100 full spectrum live resin all right so on the side of the box right here let me go ahead and read you guys this out right it says our full spectrum liquid diamonds extract is harvested fresh frozen and processed at sub critical temperatures to preserve maximum with the fudge they did a little typo there to preserve maximum cannabinoids and terpenes all right boys so this is just a fresh cart bro so i'm gonna go ahead and peel this open go ahead and peel the little sticker back boom take the card out open it like this lift the little box out boom out comes a clear little tube and as you guys can see through the tube man that oil is looking a little bit dark right this one is looking a little bit darker but go ahead and take it out the tube it honestly looks really really good for some live resin men i've seen some live resins that are just super super dummy dummy dark and brown but this one has a little bit of a lighter tint to it obviously it's still dark but it does have a lighter tint to it man i'm kind of excited to try this out all right boys so go ahead and take the tops off make sure you guys have those on if you don't it's probably a fake man go ahead and slap this on the trust worthy ooze variable wattage battery all right boys so i believe live resins usually have to smoke them at a very very low temperature so i'm going to have this one the lowest one it goes to is 3.3 so i'm going to go ahead and just go in on a hit man i'm hoping that this is good i'm i'm hoping it falls under the same category of ursa diamond cartridges man you know they're both live diamond live resins so it should taste kind of similar all right the only difference is obviously bunnies has different strains ursa has different strains and i'm on the hunt to see which strain is the most potent all right this one is an indica like i was saying so you know your boy's a fan of indigos man i'm ready to get faded right boys cheers yo all right i think i'm gonna have to go in on another hit man because honestly i that was a very very very distinct flavor so i can't tell you guys what it is right off the bat but if i had to try if i had to try it tastes freaking earthy it tastes like very very earthy like i don't know how to explain it man some very very oh genius in there and i like it i like that first hit but we need to get into this deeper man a bit uh before basing it off the first hit all right guys so let's go in on another one choose yeah sheesh i'm telling you yeah that tastes like a freaking dab so for those two first hits man i'm telling you guys that the legends og it has a very very very heavy flavor profile in this cartridge okay so i taste a lot of the oh genius like i'm talking about as soon as i inhale like it's just straight up punginess straight up earthiness and it's super super good if you don't if you guys have never tried an og man they just have this very very distinct flavor and just smacks you across the face okay and this one in particular i've never tasted legends og but it's a fire strain off basing off this car alone and the watermelon skittles so far i haven't really tasted it man so maybe i just have to keep breaking into the cart so it's going on hit number three um honestly after those two first hits i kind of am starting to feel a slight head change nothing crazy but i can see i can feel like you know i'm starting to chill out a little bit more than i'm already i already am so that's upside that's definitely an upside that's definitely what you want to see out of a cartridge menu you want to feel the difference you want to notice the difference you want to see the difference okay so going in on hit number three man i want to try to take a blinker out of this i'm gonna die actually i don't know if i'm gonna die but either way let's go in and get even more faded man you guys could see it in my eyes just starting to progress slowly which is honestly really really cool it it all falls into the full spectrum live resin honestly and that's why live resins are just a whole lot better than distilling man so cheers guys the blinkers for the boys i'm gonna keep it real with you guys that blinker just altered my whole game bro like i literally just my head change went from like slowly progression to oh 180 bro i feel the high now like it's just setting tingling sensations down my body and it feels good it feels good i must say like honestly like all right when it comes to cartridges guys or any just weed in general okay depending on the strain you know and depending on the terpenes that it has all that stuff it just it it's gonna cause you a whole different high every single time man and this time this legends og slash watermelon skittles this combination their terpenes their flavor profiles is just an awesome conjunction of you know of like mixtures man and it it just it just tastes so good it makes your body feel good it's just the overall taste is like fire it doesn't taste like live resin you know like like i always complain about the the statistic of the tasting live regular tasting live resin man like stizzy has the same tasting life resin friendly farms has the same tasting live resin i don't know what other cartridges come to a select or is another one of those companies um their live resin is just so ugh like it's just so weird dude it's just the taste is just like it's not an enjoyable taste that's why i don't go to stizzy and cop live residence i'm sorry suzy i love you guys i love everything about you guys except you you're like resident pods are just man you know they're not the best friendly farms you know same thing they're like resin carts or man their flavor profiles on them like you'll get a cartridge every now and then that's all right yeah this is a pretty decent flavor but for the most part the flavor profiles on some most of the live resin cartridges they all kind of taste the same you know when you exhale you just get that really really nasty taste in the back of your throat and like for me personally it makes me want to gag and throw up i'm one of those who's like if i taste something nasty i'm just like oh no it's a no for me boss so this one does not taste like that one it has a very very distinct taste like i was saying earlier in the video um the legends og stands out a lot and on the exhale i do get a little bit of a sweetness i'm not getting a crazy sweetness you know so i'm not really tasting the skittles too much but the high man the high is just so relaxing so relaxing what so i'm going to hit number four because i just cannot stop enjoying this if this video speaks for itself you know when i keep hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting a car it just means that it smacks bro so cheers guys that's fire dude and i don't get that sensation of wanting a cough like i was saying with distillate i do get only like like for example today this is the first smoke of the day right it's currently like eight o'clock in the morning or something like that so i don't know about you guys but when i wake up in the morning my lungs are not they're not 100 you know ready to go because they still have to wake up take some big fresh breath um air and then um after that you know then you start smoking it's just more smoke going into your lungs and it's like i said it's the beginning of the day so it's not used to it and um it's just it just irritates a little bit more than it usually would you feel me but with this one i'm not feeling that sensation um i don't want to cough like crazy and the flavor is fire like i was saying but overall this this quality the quality of the cartridge is fire i just kind of wish someone will come out one day one day they're gonna come out with the live resin cart man that's at least the 85 percent thc bro at least the 80 i feel like i've never ever seen a live resident card that goes that high so maybe one day man any cartridge companies that are watching this please make it make your boy a 85 cartridger at 90. because you know i've we've only ever seen those in desolate cartridges and i we don't we know f with distillate cartridges no more boys we're on the live residence live ros and wave slash liquid diamond wave i think a lot of companies are trying to you know put diamonds inside of cartridges which is starting to work it's fire um like i was saying buddies i'm so glad that i was able to try this out i'm going on another hit i'm talking too much without hitting it boys blinker number two yeah dude that blinker just oh man you feel like like when you take the blinkers off of this you feel you getting more faded honestly like i'm just like stay i just stared off into space like i was like started thinking about like cartridge and food and stuff and i'm just like wait hold on dude i'm making a freaking video that's how you know this cartridge is hitting man because when i'm faded i'm just like i'm just uh in my own zone you feel me so with that being said guys this watermelon skittles legend og buddies cart fire the liquid diamonds i'm starting to appreciate them a lot more so i think soon if you guys make it to the end of this video man i want to see all right if you guys would like to see my top cartridges of 2020 since none of them are going to be really distillate anymore it's going to be all li resin live rosin it's going to be a banger video so if you guys want to see my top cartridges of 2020 let's go ahead and hit 600 likes all right i know we could hit over 600 likes easily

narrow this down buddy's cartridge fire um you know i'm sad that it kind of took me so long to hop on this buddy's wave you know i was just stuck on raw garden so bad but um that i just really didn't want to pay attention to this but now that you know this i know this is not distillate i know this is some fire i'm going to be definitely copying these a lot more copying the earth is a lot more i want to try a 710 um pod again uh tier one possibly and just see how how that gets me i could already like imagine dude just how fire that one would be right so 600 likes we'll get that cracking buddies super fire i love this strain legend og watermelon skittles even though the tc percentage isn't too high it still does what it needs to do the full spectrum high is on point and the flavor is fire too it's not the best tasting i'm not gonna say it's like crazy insanely good tasting it's live resin so but um for this one in particular it does taste pretty decent you know um and with that being said guys this [ __ ] is fire eight out of ten for me if it had a little bit more higher tc percentage you know that that would be the nine out of ten for me so um yeah we're ending out the

"y3Bjg6nlYyY": "what's up everyone john here from respect my region and today we have another west coast wii tour review and we are going to be doing a vape review we have a tomahawk 510 cartridge from napalm it's a live resin diamonds they're one gram cartridge so let's read a little bit about we'll see what they got on the back here it says tomahawk live resin diamonds vape cartridge 69.01 percent thc 0.78 cbd and one point seven two percent total thc um weight one grant net weight and then just tells you the total weight with the cart um twist the cartridge onto the compatible 510 thread battery and draw from the mouthpiece to start vapor flow repeat until desired effect is achieved so um pretty vague on the information on the box but the box itself looks [ __ ] stunning i mean look at this napalm it has nice raised edges you just like grab this and this really does feel like a luxury cannabis experience you know you buy this and you feel like you spent your money well i guess is the the best way to put this so napalm is partners um with exhibit exhibit is behind napalm cannabis and he fancies himself a firearm if you've ever watched excuse me if you ever watch exhibit on his instagram he's always shooting all kinds of guns and so the brandy napalm cannabis the grenade pre-roll it all kind of makes sense you know all kind of based off like military hardware um so i'm gonna go ahead and slide this open and a nice slide box boom and right there we got a nice nice the cartridge is beautiful with the green um some of these are orange too so it just kind of matches with what the strain is you've got the green branded flame look we can really see the color of the oil this is a gram cartridge i have smoke been smoking on this i was on vacation in wenatchee so um yeah but you can as you can see the color of the oil is really translucent really good definitely looks like live resin let's see if we can see it move that's the other key with live resin is you want to be able to see it move like with your eyes and yep it's definitely um moving in there you can see the the liquid is starting to go to the top of the cartridge so i'm going to go ahead and pull off these little rubber stoppers scroll this onto my battery you never want to over twist so once it's on it's just boop stop most vape pens click five times and it's on let's see what's up super turpy terps hit your back your throat you definitely i have no idea um what the tomahawk is what if that's like a into mix meaning they just took two different types of starting material and blended it during the extraction process i'm not sure if tomahawk is is a strain of theirs one of their uh you know flagship strains but i definitely get like a really florally earthy taste it's nothing spectacular but it's really smooth and yeah let's go down this uh the rating score 10 point that's a 10 categories 100 point rating system let's see what's going down presentation presentation i got to go with 10 it looks wonderful from the sliding it out with just the the little raised edges of the flames and the whole the gold trim it looks different it stands out and that's and uh you know napalm cannabis it's easy to remember it sticks in your head so yeah i'll give the presentation a ten product appeal nine um i i think it would get a little bit higher if there was a little bit more information about the oil in it about the the strain that went into the oil it says live resin diamonds but uh you know a lot of people don't even know what live resin diamonds are honestly so i would like to know a little bit more about the strain and stuff to to maybe get that perfect that perfect product appeal score color yeah you know you go with a nine it looks really really good the oil is just uh fantastic it looks really good nine color i did color smell um you can't really smell you know i don't really get like a turpy smell through the car or anything like that but when you rip it you just get like a basic vape oil smell it doesn't smell crazy terpe so i go five taste seven i said didn't blow me away by any means the taste uh i didn't really get like a potent terpy taste potency uh i would give this this is gonna get a good potency for i'd give it a nine um i started smoking this last week i ran out of dabs and i switched to my pen and this more than got me where i needed to go um when i wasn't smoking on dabs you know five or six rips of that and i was blazed for sure so high potency score experience um i'm gonna give the experience a seven i definitely didn't hate it but i definitely didn't love it you know i wish i just got more flavor when i think right live resin i just think of crazy terpy flavors and i just kind of got like a basic vape distillate taste you know didn't really give me the live resin experience more information they definitely give me all the basics about you know manufacturing packaging things like that i wish i got a strain lineage more information maybe about what live resident diamonds are somewhere on the packaging you know they have two boxes you could put some stuff right here just because uh you know then the knowledge around extracts is still very um niche in a lot of ways and so i would like brands to take that step up to educate the consumers more on their packaging would you recommend i actually would recommend this though i would give this you know not a strong mega recommendation but i definitely you know my friend hit me up was like yo what do you think about napalm cannabis i'm like bro you should probably get one of those you know live resin diamonds cards because they are nice they look cool the the cartridge itself is is awesome like the design behind this is very cool it looks cool so yeah definitely a seven on the recommendation and overall yeah stick with the seven as well like i said the flavors didn't blow me away but the quality is obviously present so i think napalm cannabis is definitely on the right track to um you know just absolutely crushing the game and that's all i have for you today make sure to like the video subscribe to the channel uh check out respectmyregion.com on youtube because we have a bunch of content coming soon video content and make sure everyone has a good day and i'll see y'all later", "2bq6nFZy8qI": "[Music] here we go everyone finally got them bear labs cartridges lemon sorbet yup they got their own babe cart now um i've tried their car their their concentrates super bomb stuff very very good quality stuff always very terpy um i seen a youtuber uh recommend this um that lemon sorbet this is sauce not no distillate no cut no mct oil none of that stuff straight live resin sauce testing that 87 total 92 cannabinoids packaged about a month ago oil's looking good as you guys seen at the beginning of the video color is nice i'll put the links in the description big bear lab 710 lemon sorbet full gram you can get it from 50 to 65 from what i uh seen online but uh yeah pretty dope artwork's looking fresh got your test results got your usual 510 thread cartridge i got my sport battery don't worry it looks big but you can control the watts i got it at the lowest wattage and the lowest temperature which is 250 perfect for carts now we'll go ahead and um put it on there i want to thank everybody for uh for dropping them likes and then and subscribing i really appreciate that so let's go ahead and get dabbing this is the first hit of the day i wanted to make sure i gave you guys the full effect you know i noticed that some people their biggest mistake is to get super medicated and then try to review a cartridge you know cartridges are for on the go you know you're not going to get the full full weed feeling so you know we want to go ahead and see what this is about so yeah enough enough talking here i go pretty tasty pretty tasty for a cart it's not bad i've been steering away from cars lately nothing against them but it's just very difficult to find a good flavor but i like this it's definitely good on the palate good taste love this little battery taste all your terpenes definitely that's a good little lemon flavor not too fruity which is good because then make you think about it but it does have a good flavor it's not harsh at all pretty good head change pretty pleasant i would definitely buy it again it's good if you're on the go you know pretty good flavor you could tell it's definitely made out of sauce um the high is definitely there overall it's a good experience [Music] i just say uh if you do get this make sure you vape it at low temp so you can get the best flavor on it so but i like it so if you see it check it out lemon sorbet pretty tasty stuff pretty good performance is there i agree i agree with um the person who recommended it one gram 50 to 65 bucks if you see it go get it it's not bad all right guys thank you for watching really appreciate that have a good rest of your day", "KzldyD5TcS4": "welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be reviewing a cartridge this is elysium field i've actually got a couple of these and i've went through one so far so i'm going to pop in a new one and review it i'm a huge fan of these these are mixes of live resin and distillate so they're like the best of both worlds they always got good potency and the terps are great on them personal in my opinion so um and the hardware is also amazing so let me flip this around i'll show you what they look like and what they come with and i'll try one out i'm a bishop the brandon [Music] i don't know here is elysium fields live resin crafted um the strain specifically is dream queen coming in at 74.9 percent thc loq on cbd but the terpenes got me interested the terpenes are at seven point four percent and it is coming in at one point seven nine percent selena dying which i've never heard of selenidine cylindering um or i've heard of that but um i've never had one dominant in that so i'm very interested to see how that tastes and then it comes in um at 1.78 just one percent or 0.1 percent less uh with beta myrsine and then 0.84 beta cardiophiline and those are the very standard weed terps so i'm hoping i can distinguish the taste between um between those terps so you don't got too much more info on the back other than just like production info um but yeah these interestingly enough the same i i want to say it's like the same farm too but um i don't know quite how it works but at least like the same group like runs or owns all of these entities in some form or another but there's like chalice farms which is they make the rxo among other things and the stuff that i gave probably an unfavorable review of yesterday they make elysium fields carts which these used to be my favorite carts like for a while just because or i mean the reason they're not anymore is because i don't live as close to that dyspo but like they these are really really good carts in my opinion so it amazes me like the huge range there but um and there's a couple other producers or entities in some shape or form that they also operate so just goes to show you know there's a crazy range out there um some people can really get everything out of the plant i guess and that ends up with multiple stages some high end some low end all from the same producer probably on the same farms and plants sometimes so i'm trying it there we go all right so once you get inside of it just a little window box and then you got that resting in there got the two silicone caps as usual and got this sticker which i'll leave on for now um one thing i love about these cartridges i said good hardware definitely meant it these use um i'll show you a close-up doesn't really matter there anyways um jupiter c cells these are some high-end proper like us-made c cells so you don't got to worry about any any unwanted stuff in there screw that in to my vessel and first i'll do a dry pull is just certainly an interesting taste yeah let's try it out and you'll see it's much more um it's much darker gold than usual for distillate because um it's got quite a bit of live resin in there all right i'll try to hit this again that's hard to place that's a good taste but i don't i don't really know i'm also not getting very much from it um this one reminds me a lot of like it's like a very like reminds me a lot of like not straight like leaves i don't actually know maybe leaves i've never tasted a leaf by itself um like just a lot of like green vegetables without a strong taste um yeah no this tastes a lot like some like fresh it also tastes a lot like weed um because there's also mirror scene and cardio filling so that also makes it kind of difficult but other than that reminds me of like kind of how like lettuce smells this is very like vaguely leafy green tasting on top of that just very interesting strain is dream queen which um i think that's blue dream mixed with there's a clean screen don't remember the other one but now for effects these cards are super good as well um well really for everything because it really has like the best of both worlds you've got a mixture of distillate and live resin so you're not really missing anything from either or um yeah and then the terpenes they got some interesting terpenes in there too and usually good amounts of terpenes i got 7.4 terpenes in this just a solid card all in all worth the price worth the price in my opinion so um yeah that's crazy in my uh just crazy to me how the same producer or same i guess like entity can have so many different varying like quality things and i guess that's why they have different lines like elysium fields and chalice farms proper and like that's similar to how oregron has oregrone's mainline a lot of pricey stuff and then they also have stay lifted down at like sixteen dollars or twenty dollars in that range roughly though compared to the normally like thirty five to fifty dollars for or uh thirty five to fifty dollars for oregrone stuff um they like to just i guess not associate their name with the lower quality stuff or that line i guess so that people won't stop buying it assuming it'll be lower quality as well so yeah elysium fields are great carts in my opinion so i'd say pick one up you won't be disappointed all right oh man let me do one more and see if i can't get any more flavor because i swear i'm like almost getting something from the celine dying and i wanna try and describe it for you all yeah i'm also okay so like it tastes a lot like turkish tobacco does to me i used to be a big cigarette smoker and smoked all sorts of types um got really like into it like similar to how i am with cannabis i guess and i really liked turkish tobacco um it has like a like a light vanilla e taste to it but it's definitely not like the same as vanilla which is like strong and almost like confectionary it's like reminds you of vanilla but definitely more like plant-like or you know something like that and then also you got the myracine and cardiophiline which do straight-up tastes like plants and peppery spicy type taste respectively kind of chiming in with that so maybe by itself it tastes a little more purely like that but that's an interesting terpene i've been trying to hunt that down for a while because i got a phantom farms cart back on like 4 20 and actually that's when i first started getting these was 420 um and i never i didn't have a channel then so i wasn't making videos but now i got this one down at least so and this terpene as well so um thanks for watching i'm going to try and pump out a couple more videos here because i got some really interesting cons interesting concentrates that i would love to show you on i want to dab it and i don't dab stuff till i make a video so um stay tuned for more thanks for watching like and subscribe and have a great day", "YynoXbI3O8g": "[Music] howdy folks welcome to wheats it has been a couple of months for me since I've done this so you excuse me if I'm a little rusty but we are back here and we are talking cartridges one that you guys have really been riding me hard about and that is raw garden we are finally taking a look at a raw garden there I'll try to actually get it in focus this is their SAP very OG in sativa hybrid with eighty six point two one percent THC and you can see the lab testing results there on the back everything you want to see right off the bat I actually really kind of admire this austere packaging there isn't much to it you're not wasting a whole lot and you're not sort of screwing up the environment by you know the super ornate packaging so III dig that fact and this cartridge it's a half gram cartridge and it cost me thirty bucks at a dispensary a legal licensed shop here in Long Beach California and this is a live resin cartridge which means that I believe it is just the distilled flower itself out says right here 100% whole cannabis flower oil 100% cannabis terpenes so no additives just refined cannabis not cut with anything no thinning agents nothing to make it less viscous none of that just just the good stuff so for 35 for 30 dollars rather for actual live resin cartridge is a pretty good deal uh so I will endeavour to open it here which I'm struggling at surprisingly perhaps not surprisingly boy this uh sticker makes it quite difficult to rip open as you can see ah there we go so you know well I take back all the nice stuff I said about the packaging because that was a pain in the ass but still just a small small discretion okay so here we go we have um like a childproof container there I've never seen a cartridge with these push down and turn this is just like an aspirin bottle I was really nervous that I was gonna [ __ ] this up but I did it I did it I'm just as proud of me as you guys are so here we go here is our cartridge traditional half gram looks like we've got some kind of very nice plastic herb some kind of material it almost looks like ceramic or feels like ceramic tip there I've had this quality before it's great I didn't generally don't like the plastic sort of tips but whatever material this is is very solid and doesn't give you that sort of gross mouthfeel which is a gross word in and of itself so a pretty standard 510 thread there oil looks great a very very golden yellow beautiful looking oil and we'll go ahead and attach it to my trusty 510 here this is the brass knuckles 900 milliamp battery it's been treating me quite well so now we will do the big thing the thing that you guys all came here for and that's the test so let's go ahead and take a draw here [Music] I don't know why I didn't see the vapor I certainly tasted it let me get one more and see if I can get a bigger sort of cloud for you guys [Music] whoa there we go and this is a taster guys I have never had SAP berry OG before but I think I like the taste Wow kind of fruity little yes citrusy almost very sort of refreshing almost kind of tasty apparently different than a lot of strains that I've had in terms of flavor profile which makes sense because it is as they say a hundred percent terpenes there's no flavor additives here it's just the terpenes from the weed itself so I guess it would make sense that it's super flavorful but I really dig um in terms of draws super easy no resistance was having no problem there and does not burn hot doesn't I'm you guys all know I have baby lungs no problem there barely felt it and barely felt it in the lungs really smooth consistent kind of hit let me get another one in here oh boy that is delightful actually and not only does it taste great but this [ __ ] is strong as [ __ ] um I've been on a bit of a tolerance break recently so I know my opinions gonna be a little bit higher than one that's it no pun intended but this is every bit as strong as they suggest which was what 86% I do not doubt it it feels every bit that 86% a nice clean head high I feeling giggly actually right now boy this could not have gone better you guys know your [ __ ] because I absolutely love this and as it for right now big thumbs up but but as you guys all know for my cartridge reviews I like to review the whole thing not just these first couple of drags here so I'm gonna enjoy this very much over the next couple of days and as soon as I'm finished I will come back right here with you guys and let you know all my wrap-up thoughts because as we all know these cartridges are not bulletproof they're they are prone to problems so I'll be sure to let you know if anything happens but you know I'm really excited about this one so guys that's gonna do it for this first half of this review thank you so much for watching and I'll see all you find folks right back here in a bit ciao [Music] hi guys welcome back to weeds it has been about two and a half days since I checked in with you talking raw Gardens there live resident carte SAP Barry oh and guys I am happy to tell you this one Rockets right to the very top of my favorite cards list this is a mercury I loved every little second of this I loved the taste I never got harsh tasted beautiful threw out every last drop in there is gone both because I wanted every drop to be gone and it was easy to extract it all um as I said one of the best tasting cards I've ever had and in terms of the high itself guffy quite high higher than most cards do I take I got up to a 7 after I maybe three or four good inhales and um the dye itself was actually almost kind of giggly in a way I really was euphoric it was a different kind of high but a very good one um one that I absolutely enjoyed and guys I am thrilled with raw garden I love that you guys suggested it this is gonna be one of my go-to cards just for personal use at 30 bucks amazing deal rock garden super super big thumbs up for me at this point looking forward to trying some more of their products so guys before I go here I'm gonna share with you a little cherry on top something you can enjoy throughout your week I've let that dog kind of go she'll do her own thing well maybe where you going dog alright well we got that dog now so uh cherry on top I want to share with you guys something that's a little bit basic [ __ ] I guess for me but something that I love doing my wife and I have a tradition every year where we watch a season of Survivor at like 20 year old CBS show we'll stick it on usually around Christmas time and we'll put it on Amazon Prime they have a bunch of seasons we look up which seasons are the best and we'll watch one a year it's a great tradition and if you haven't watched survivor since 1999 and you haven't watched any reality TV shows like I have since then you don't give it a shot there's a reason it's been around for 20 years it's a hell of a lot of fun even if it is you know on CBS well guys that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and then that's gonna do it for this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see all of you fine folks right back here on the next review I gotta get walking through these dogs are

here so we're gonna hop straight into this and while we're smoking I'm gonna be talking because there are some fake products that have been coming out supposedly cookies but this is a real deal man right here I'm gonna show you guys so you get the box out get the box out high flyers get the little thing out getting a little too bright see little cookies logo right there it's a little white tube got a little piece on the bottom holding it together as you guys can see right there London pound cake hopefully there's a verified cookie sticker right there at the back and then right here on the side you got pretty much everything you need to know I'm not sure that's gonna focus up or not right right there should focus at London poundcake total THC eighty point nine no cannabinoids I'm a no CBD and then it was its best by 11 to 19 so yeah toss that huh pull up the cartridge real quick show you guys the oil how it's looking there's a little logo right there cookies logo so they only sleeve a really really small air bubble right there it's really small and then it's filled to the brim which is a plus you know definitely when you want to be when you're spending crazy amounts like this you're gonna want little to no air bubbles so just to show you guys how to cyllage it here's a receipt at cookies right there it's probably not gonna [ __ ] it up but all right there Londyn pound cake let's get it you already know what's up and we're back to the video so let's get to this review man I'm so excited to be trying this [ __ ] set this off to the side if you got it and by the way if you guys like this new little setup right here I got a couch in my my work room so it makes it a lot more easier to make videos in here too so take off the plastic pieces pop the little bottom off has a little cookies engraved right there and then be like Jimmy Jam that dad man dude let me see you [ __ ] get any prominent flavors I'm not talking [ __ ] I'm just saying that's what he does but I don't really get any flavors I'm not sure like if that even works or not but it smells like very very dang let me get my raw garden battery out real quick and then I'm excited yeah I'm over here shaking but so let's get to it boys the cookies sitting nice and flush on the raw garden they actually used the same batteries cookies it's same C cell rebrand m3 and this one is so I'm excited man first impressions right here if you guys are 18 over 21 and over make sure you guys smoking along with I was going to say it hit that like comments up but it's not even that part of the video so go ahead and let me know what you're smoking or some cookies if you guys ever tried real cookies let me know so this is London pound cake in their high flyers cartridge so Cheers whoa there's not what I was expecting that at all who aren't that initial hit was literally straight up like gas like if someone opened a valve a [ __ ] propane just filled my mouth and that was out guess it was mmm whoo that's a very very nice flavor though I'm not gonna lie this is different way different than what I'm used to so bro holy Wow there's lemon pound cake is straight dude like it's literally tastes like gas in that second hey I got gas and mixed in with a little bit of um like orange let me just take another hit I'm gonna put this on the bat my battery it's also just all you do is just screw the bottom on the wrong side screw the bottom on if you guys don't have a battery like the raw garden one can just coo a little very very small and then just rip away a little lights gonna appear here in the bottom yeah dude that the very gassy oh no honey get some water yeah I can't keep coughing like this is too much for the video so so far oh that head changes starting to kick in after three little three to four little hits the head changes definitely starting to come in I barely got a very very small little air bubble coming up right there so that's gonna put a little dent in this and I'm not really feeling this big-ass battery I'm gonna switch it back to the raw garden because I feel like it gives you more flavourful of it and you guys aren't gonna be seen that it was battery in this video because I forgot to charge it my fault my fault I decided to not charge the best battery I could possibly have for right now so oh yeah like I was saying fake cookies cartridges man so some dude for my work if you're watching this bro he told me he's all oh yeah this weekend at a party I picked up with cookies cartridge I was like oh you need to bring this thing to work let me hit that like and then um he told me he told me I remember looking at watching a fake cookies cartridge video and then I asked him I was like a bro like what was the what was the cartridge like like what was the insides like he told me that the insides were plastic they're like it's a little plastic piece that kind you get cheap from very very cheap cartridges that holds it you don't get that little cylinder tube and then the outside is just like all white it's like a really really big all white in blue box and it says cookies on it and it's nothing like the original box like literally nothing like the original box it doesn't say high-fliers it doesn't have fists on the bottom it doesn't have the testing on the bottom and it definitely doesn't have the little certified cookie sticker on the bottom so I was like yeah bro it's kind of I doubt you got a real one but you know whatever's he said he got I'm faded I feel like everyone everything gets everyone no it is you this is like a very very like oh I'm getting that little poundcake taste in the back now maybe I just had to wake up the coil when you hit this a couple more times get that full effect whoo-hoo that that gasps like it lingers in the back of your throat and yeah this is definitely a government I'm kind of I'm very very glad I caught this like it's either you guys could see I spent one hundred and ten dollars 115 dollars on literally just bud and a cartridge but the thing is like the quality of the product that cookies provides is definitely worth it you know like I could get another booth cartridge like a 55 for a full gram and then it's it's gonna get me hot but it's not gonna get me as high as this and the flavor is not going to be as good as this you know things like that and with the raw garden um you know for example raw garden the after text as they come out to like 45 a half to 250 dollars a half so you you like P works that your period of time and why don't you just cover all garden it's similar price it's actually not similar price because you still from raw garden sells to only licensed dispensaries and then licensed dispensaries tax you of so much dude it's insane I don't even want to talk about that she's gonna give me a mint so I'm gonna take another hit off this man where he's gonna keep ripping and see if we get any more flavors and turps you know turps that's actually something we need to point out let's see what the turkeys are about mmm you bet very very chirpy it's not like overpowering like a garden it kinda reminds me of Le cush I'm not gonna live kind of reminds me of them the le cush disel it for sure and but this one this is just like super gassy the Le cush had like more of like a like a I had like a filler you could tell like the last one that I got it tasted like strawberries it's not supposed to taste like strawberries I mean but this I feel like if I were to go out and buy London pound cake right now roll it up in that in some elements rolling papers smokey I'd probably get the same exact taste and this is burners favorite smoke right now he said I think it's London pound cake cereal milk cheetah piss like but those aren't even out yet like cereal milk actually sir I'm oh just drop today I was gonna cop that but when I saw that it was like $70 and 80 I was just like I just I just shift my head but I was just alright never mind I was like give me give me some of that that sherbert octane man yeah all right so we're going it to the review of this video part of the video and the word you keep talking and the video eventually so alright so far I don't like how the freaking oil isn't going up to the top that usually with cartridges they should go up automatically but when there are some cartridges like West Coast care for example it does the same exact thing where the oils somewhat gets stuck and then it's just stuck then you have a big gaping hole right there hopefully that's not the case of this hopefully I just had to keep in here so flavorful mmm um I need a copy London town Kate like the bud a sub that might be the next cup [Laughter] rolled it up in a nice little Jaynes market way up again into the video I mean the review the Terps I would rate them a good seven out of ten it's not to Turkey but the Turks are definitely there you get a nice flavorful tur penis in the back of your throat the flavor wise gasps this is like no other flavor that I've ever tasted I can see why Berner likes London pound cake I never seen anybody else review london pound cake so i'm probably to be one of the first people on youtube at least to say this thing is pretty freakin good man pretty freakin good and then but I do like if I had to describe what the flavor it is I can like I really can't describe it I would have to just say like it's kind of like a gassy taste obviously like the gas you get from wheat but a very very high gassy taste you're not getting too many notes of like fruity things like that you get a very very slight taste of like like Patna pound cake like if you guys ever been to the gas stations and seen those little those little bar bar pound cakes the ones that are really really thick kind of tastes kind of like that and it's good it's a very very subtle though it's not it's not in your face so that's a very upside that it tastes more like weed than it does then it tastes like artificial mists and fillers and things like that and the hi I'm I'm pretty stun I'm Paige stone this isn't my first height of the day and I'm trying to regulate my high right now I'm trying to only limit myself to you things like that so the height is definitely 8 out of 10 it's not getting me too high I'm pretty sure if I keep hitting you know [ __ ] you kill me but you know we're not gonna we're probably gonna take one more trip for the boys so yeah definitely overall product I'm the price point is probably the only downside but then again you're paying for good quality stuff you know like this isn't something that you can get just anywhere in the world it's only just one section of the United States you know one part and that's kind of what makes it valuable this is very very exotic and it's not like anyone could go out and buy this and not everyone will go out and buy this even if they if it was disposable like you know right around the corner from them like people always are gonna go for the cheaper price and it's always good to just have a good smoke you know that's one thing that I've been trying to do with myself like instead of just smoking like mid mid mid like price [ __ ] and smoking it all day just limp and then just ruining your tolerance ruining the overall experience just go out buy something like this just take a hit in the morning take a hit in the afternoon take a hit at night that's three times you take two or three hits you'll conserve it like no doubt and you'll be smoking good [ __ ] so you take another hit probably in the video and you guys know the deal super gas by far I'm gonna have to make a top 5 distillate card soon or just cartridges in general if you everyone see that let me know and we're gonna end the video here go ahead and follow me on my answer here I'm at backwe daddy turn on the post notifications on this YouTube channel because I'm gonna be posting vlogs which is something different I'm gonna be trying to put them a lot more effort

i'm going over a strain of weed called sk skittles it's with the z skittles um it's by potter's cannabis co it is a cartridge um so it's half a gram and i got this for the full gram was 45 so half a gram was like 25 30 bucks so it's lit so um but it says it's going to taste like berries sweet grape and the effects are calm euphoric delighted so that's good as [ __ ] um it's tested at 86 thc and has a total cannabinoids of 89.44 that's great dude that's [ __ ] great um let's take a look at this [ __ ] okay bro obviously i haven't been smoking out of wax cartridges in a minute because they're coming in some vials bro what the [ __ ] you didn't even know this raw gardens did it they did it yes sir let's go this one's a little darker showing that it seems like it's been a little bit oxidated or they added something but um i mean it looks legit so it looks like it's just probably a little bit old but i don't know we'll see but other than that it looks it looks really good i like it weird a little bit dude it's all good though let's try this all right yo now let's attach it to our battery i'm using the imini it's lit yeah you definitely get like that grape taste oh yeah i [ __ ] with it it's like a grape you get what they said you get that grape you get that sweetness i don't taste the berry much but the grape is there for sure for me i [ __ ] with it is it dead what the [ __ ] okay let me get my other battery hold on there we go now we got the berry a little bit more still got that grape and sweetness dude that shit's fire man shit's fire dude tastes great all right yo i'ma let this settle in and i'll catch you on my final thoughts so my final thoughts on the wax cart i think the taste is great i think the effects it's just as labeled on the box calm euphoric i really know what delighted what they mean by that i mean i know what it means but like you know what i mean but for me i mean i definitely feel like the calmness like definitely like chilled out you know what i mean i'm usually like whoa but now i'm just like chilling right now so um i would definitely pick this up for like um more like an evening not night time so much just evening for where you want to like calm down and chill out i like it pick it up it's an indica chilling but that's all i got in this video and i'll catch you in the next one let's keep it money i want y'all to love it i can be a hero we ain't got to say he loves me let's keep it i want your love", "aEaoDC2EwM0": "it what's up guys it's your boy master blinky back again with another video today what we're gonna be taking a look at is this live East Coast cartridge cart I haven't really seen these around before I recently got one and I've been really excited to try it for you guys it says that it has one point four percent CBD eighty-two percent THC and six percent Terps I like that it has the stats like that and they actually seem believable real cards shouldn't really test above 85 percent if they have Terps in them um and having some CBD in there is cool too apparently it's supposed to give you forea um and give you an energized mood and it's a sativa hybrid so yeah let's go ahead and get into this card so opening up the cart we pull it out and we see that it is AC cell atomizer with a white ring on the bottom a lot of people says that that means that it's a fake atomizer but I also want to think that maybe it's because live rebranded at C cell atomizer they also put their logo on top of the mouthpiece which actually looks pretty legit not gonna lie so I'm hoping this car actually hits pretty nicely and tastes good as you can see the bubble is actually pretty slow it doesn't move too fast at all so I'm definitely definitely having some high hopes for this cart so let's go ahead and get into my first puffs of it alright y'all so I'm gonna take my first puff off this live mimosa cart I'm using my C cell m3 battery because that's the pretty standard battery that most car companies will sell with cards so either way let's actually check this card out Cheers [Music] okay feels very smooth cheers again [Music] when it comes to the potency of this cart I am already feeling effects I'm already seeing the flash very weird it looks like a star in my vision taking that blinker straight looks a bit rough on my lungs Matt go lie well I'm sorry I feel very warm as well I think I'm gonna be a fan of these cards oh of course I can't give my full opinion yet I always want to wait at least a day to tell you guys if these carts are good but before I go for right now I'm going to be taking a hit out of the damn cap so Cheers [Music] but I tell you that this part feels a little different um it's slapping a bit more than I'm used to not gonna lie like I'm for sure gonna take a night to review these and then tomorrow I'll tell you guys that these are actually yes but as of right now I'm like a hugger home it is just [ __ ] awesome all right yeah I'll be back tomorrow B's all right hey guys again I forgot to record a hit from the CBD [ __ ] battery so I'm gonna do that real quick I already preheated all we got to do is hit it Cheers this card produces such thick smoke oh my god bro also what you hear in the background is me about to record another gaming video in case y'all are kid get hip to my gaming videos they're actually kind of funny like what the [ __ ] are you doing also subscribe to the channel if you're not subscribed and leave a like I'm really high right now I love this cookie I'll get back to y'all tomorrow see it alright hey what's up guys I'm back so I've been smoking on this car for two days now and I think I'm actually a fan of it so after two days I've only used around 1/4 of my cart which is really good on those TKO cards I two days I was around halfway done this I definitely still have a good amount of uses out of as far as the highs go I don't think I could honestly get over 10 hits of this thing without having like take a break for a bit because I was just too tired or too high when I say too tired I don't mean like this car put me to sleep or gave me a headache or anything like that it's just after 10 hits I was like way too far gone to even know how to like actually function it was pretty awesome not gonna lie another thing about this card it's starting to get a little cloudy which doesn't worry me a little bit but I tried to do some research on it and I've been seeing that some extractions or like some people who extract their own oils end up with levy oil - and I don't know if that's something to do with the plant that they start out with but it has something to do with the extraction process but either way I'm not tasting anything odd that the current hasn't become harsh and it hasn't become less potent that's something that I do notice with other card brands that I've tried at least like dab was TKO sometimes even dank vapes sometimes after you get around half to two-thirds of the cart done they start to hit a lot harsher and then they sometimes change color actually with that with the dr. zodiacs bait card I reviewed the bottom of the cart started to turn a little black from where the atomizer was so those are signs that I look forward to seat bag carts versus this one which actually does feel like a quality and good kart I massage with it a little bit just to see if like maybe the wax is getting a little cloudy because of it just sitting so maybe after heat it up a bit it'll be fine so I'm gonna take around three puffs on it and then I'll do a wrap-up Cheers [Music] [Music] just a little - coughs from that but very nice vapor and very good flavor on it I forget what I said it tasted like last time I'm gonna take another hit right now just to see you again but it definitely does still have a very consistent flavor cheers again [Music] I really can't get an actual like opinion on how this car tastes it's so odd because I really can't like pinpoint the exact flavors of this cart I know that it had a around 6% turps in it so that's probably why I'm not getting like super strong flavors versus like other cart brands where they actually use like flavoring or they use a lot of Terps and that's why they're very runny this car isn't runny at all it's actually very slow-moving and it feels like it is I really think that's why I'm not really getting super strong consistent or super strong indescribable flavor simply because distillate doesn't have flavor um I'm gonna go ahead and hit it out of a rig though and see if that helps Cheers [Music] [Music] all right so we got a good amount of calls from that hit but I'm not gonna lie I don't know if y'all have ever smelled play-doh like if you had a little cousin who like played with it around you or you have like siblings but this cart tastes house this cart tastes just like how play-doh smells um I don't know how y'all will take that I think it doesn't actually taste that bad I'm not gonna lie but I've also never eaten play-doh so if anyone in the comments has tried play-doh go and let me know if it tastes good either way if I had to give this Curtis or I would give it an easy eight out of ten the wax did end up getting less cloudy once they eat it up a bit so I think that that's not really a sign that I'm gonna be worried about if I should be let me know though but yeah this card gets an 8 out of 10 potency easily a 9 to attend this cart is amazing I don't need to hit it a lot to get high it lasts a while um and the wax feels quality when it comes to taste I'll give it a 7 to an 8 out of 10 because I cannot really exactly describe the way it tastes other than how play-dohs smells or however I described it in my first it's a bit the atomizer is a real C cell so it tastes good it hits hard and you get good hits out of it versus seven tens which I don't think hit as hard overall I have never heard of live East Coast cartridges before getting this one but after getting this one I would put these above tank vapes or even kingpins king pens in my opinion are a bit overrated this is what a cart should actually feel like if you're buying it especially off the black market this is amazing so yeah 9 out of 10 this cart is great it's consistent and I would definitely suggest it to y'all if you see them around you um good job live East Coast cartridges so I'm in the video with two blinkers from the CBD 5

like share subscribe all that good stuff I'm out time to go to work you guys have a good day", "eDn3wTnbsE8": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got a much requested one for you today so do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe and give this a thumbs up if you liked it and tune in to some of our other videos to see if you like those as well thank you so much this has been great you have a nice day peace", "okC5iBIupHg": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive kind of think of it every day is a good day to be like alright guys back here for another video your boy so back in for the video guys I'm just chillin but to dip my feet in his mom freaking pool little quick guys and we gonna do this video right here guys so today if you guys can't tell them doing another dog review it's a diamond vape cart review and I picked it up not too long ago 420 and I just wanted to do a review for you guys before I get into that review I just want to talk about what happened just like a day ago my recent video got restricted you can still see the video but it's a dope restricted only certain people can see it and sometimes I guess now they only pops up on you know certain people's channels or whatnot alright guys what pretty nice piece I couldn't even finish that dad it was too [ __ ] big bro but since that's happening I want you guys to follow me Instagram snapchat cuz I have a snapchat guys and then I want you guys to also follow me on my second YouTube cuz then we can post anything on that one I can do stuff that's not marijuana related I can do stuff that is marijuana wave or whatever but it's just another back up YouTube just in case you play get a couple strikes on his YouTube so just make sure you guys follow like comment subscribe guys more content coming sorry like the contents a little bit different you know your boys but let's take a rip right now together guys if you can't get butter and corn to you I'm sorry about that guys but yeah I'm just smoking on the nut cart right now it's just another day but [Music] why not show you guys a new car so this is the eating card looks pretty good tree oil is like a little bit lighter than the car comes in a box like this [Music] hopefully you guys can see and it's a sauce Clark guys as the GDP so it's more like a lion president's not cut with anything they have other cars like this and you know how to tell the difference between the sauce and their regular ones their distillate rp1 these bits of gold tape right here in the sauce on it the other ones do not have that I mistakenly bought one that wasn't a sauce when I wanted the sauce one maybe I'll do a review on that one too but I was like damn I did not want to do that so I got the sauce one like the next day and I was like [ __ ] it but yeah there's also a difference between sauce and live resin which I am unsure what that is I'm have to do some research or you guys can tell me in the comments cuz you guys you guys are smart guys all you guys out there you always comment and you know you school meal and stuff and you give me the right information that I need but let's try this cheers guys also this has better air flow you see the little slits it has better air flow so you know when you're waxing clogged it's hard to suck this one's way more easier like apparently we're gonna find out though let's cheers Cheers [Music] I need no life boy that [ __ ] tastes skunky like it's super tank has a skunky a skunky earth earthy type flavor like with a hand of light I don't know I guess it's more earthy I was gonna say like more of a tangent an torini type flavor but it's more earthy than that but you get a kind of a sweet taste at the end on the exhale actually pretty [ __ ] good but it's expensive guys it's like 50-something a half after [Music] but yeah guys I'm just kicking it back today it's just about to be a low-key shouldn't be going out to begin with and I'm just hella tired from work and [ __ ] so I decided to just chill it's not really drive somewhere and go do a vlog so we just tail back at home and relax trying out a new eating card like you can find these guys eaten they're free they're freaking in Hayward they're in California guys if you're from California they're literally in Hayward they got their own store you got their own flower edibles and concentrate guys they also sell other things too but they got their own [ __ ] and then don't buy from know because nug is actually selling half grams of their stuff that's not sauce for pretty much sauce price and I got screwed that's how I got screwed earlier I should have just went straight to eat it I wish I would have went straight to eating it would have been way cheaper but it's a fire cart like I don't know it's a contender for sure because I just want to do a bunch of different cards like try a bunch of new cars that you guys haven't seen and that I even haven't seen because like I have never seen anyone try these if someone tried these let me know and [ __ ] let's just let me know I don't think anyone has tried to eat in sauce carts but shout-out to eating [ __ ] [ __ ] Firebird [ __ ] fire man tell me what you guys are doing man tell me what you guys are doing to cope with the quarantine what's going on if it's even bad out there where you're at like how do you feel about what's going on right now I know that's a random question you guys don't have to answer if you don't want to cuz I know you guys are getting sick and tired of people talking about just Kovich but I'm gonna keep this one short for you guys don't forget to Like comment subscribe more contest coming bro if you haven't tried just eating car yet make sure you [ __ ] try this out if you're from the [ __ ] Bay Area shout out to everyone from the bay that's all on my channel man [ __ ] shot knows a lot of y'all from the bay out there shouts y'all even if anyone from California shoutout to y'all but also set out to everyone else cuz you know [ __ ] everybody and I forgot to say y'all 500 Q&A subscriber video it's gonna be the next video I drop for god I was gonna say do that too so 500 subscribers I'm over 500 we're gonna hit you with a Q&A coming soon so if you got any questions put it down below [Music]", "_dwDGj43WRM": "hey everybody it's Jay again with a brand new video on how to fix a broken vape pen cartridge this is an extension of my previous video which I'll put the link right there for you that I made last year on how to do this exact same thing but in that amount of time I have learned a couple of new things which is going to be number four and number five and in this video I'm gonna go through everything that I explained in the last video but I'm going to do a little faster so hopefully that'll make some of you happy that don't like sitting through very long videos but it is important that I cover all these details so that we know what is going on so without further ado if you like these videos please consider subscribing I'm a stay-at-home dad and if you in these videos helped you out please consider donating to my venmo @j Andres or to my cash app j1 two to zero so without further ado let's start off with number one is the air flow disrupted let's check all four areas so number one is the mouthpiece right so our cartridge our mouthpiece on these particular cartridges these are the kingpin brand the mouthpiece actually comes unscrewed so if we do unscrew the mouthpiece we can see real easily it's not clogged so there's no reason to go any further with that one if you had a severe oil leakage your oil might be clogged up inside of there and then in that case just use a pipe cleaner to get that out of there or a little rolled-up piece of paper towel or something one thing I notice is I just knocked off this little rubber washer so I'm just gonna put that back into place there you go nice and sticky there's also a rubber washer right in there to go up flush against that glass to keep that that oil from leaking out so let's put that back together so area number one is the mouthpiece we just check that it's good area number two is the bottom air hole so the bottom air holes right there is it clogged obviously if it's not obviously clogged then we're just gonna skip that what we don't want to do before I go any further I know we have some different tools up here I got my little paperclip and I got pipe cleaner and all that what we don't want to do is please do not stick anything through the entirety of your cartridge because we have these little wicks that are inside of these two little holes right there and right there which are the same as these two little holes right there and there this cartridge the glass does not screw off I had to break it off for the demo purposes of this display here okay so is your mouthpiece clogged is the bottom air hole clogged number three of this section is the side holes near the bottom of the threading this is the bottom threading there are air holes right there so when we screw on our cartridge to our battery those air holes receive air from the fourth section the air flow slots at the top of the pen which are right there they look like little castle teeth air will flow in through here and then it will enter the side holes near the top of the threading and then also - it will enter through the bottom this is the contact pin that makes contact with this little plate of your battery that sends electricity to this and then this transfers electricity to your wick coils there are two four one two three four this coil is missing the wick because I took it out the wick absorbs the oil from your middle cylinder so all of your oil will be in here and then the oil will go into those holes right there into the wick the wick receives electricity and heat from the coils and it turns your liquid into vapor which you then inhale so hopefully that is a quick understanding of how that works where are those coils you might ask those coils are inside of the rubber gasket so the anatomy here is this center contact pin slides into this rubber gasket and then inside of the rubber gasket there should be two little fine wires which wrap around a wick on the outside of this rubber gasket there will be another set of two so there's two outside the rubber washer there's two wires inside the rubber washer what I believe is happening to a lot of people is that when you purchase these the cartridges unfortunately I think when the robots are putting these together at the factory the robots are putting the center contact pin back in for the final step of assembly and when they put this pin back in what I very firmly believe is this pen when they push it in there it is displacing the coil wires so that's point number two is the enter wick coil displaced and then not touching the contact pin that is the contact then this is the coil wire the coil wire wraps around a wick there should be two wicks which you won't see he should never see because if you see those then they're out of place those wicks again go through these holes they're right in the middle of these holes and this goes straight through you see that and there are two holes one two there should be two wicks inside of there nothing else if those wicks get displaced then you have problem number three so going back to problem number two is the center wick coil displaced and not touching the contact and what you would have to do is you would have to take your contact pin out like I did with my fingernails and then you would check no I don't know if you could see right there there are two little wires let me see if I could bring this closer in focus there are two little wires in there if you don't see your two wires and you only see one that means that one of them got pushed up out of place and now you only have one or maybe you like this better got pushed up out of place and there's only one wire because of the robots the evil robots now if they got displaced you can use a special tool which is use a special tool to recenter one or both of the coil wires what we don't want to do is when we're fishing in there for that wire we don't want to pull it completely out because it is not infinite length it is only this long and that long if you pull that out you're gonna pull the wick with it and then all of your fluid is going to go where into the middle air cylinder and you're gonna get a hard gurgling and you're gonna start losing a bunch of your fluid and there's no recovering that right so this is a tool from a sewing kit if you say we're threading a needle and you put this through the needle you could put your string in through that hole and then you would pull this through and it pulls the thread through the needle that's what this is from a sewing kit also - from my soldering kit I got these very very fine tweezers which are definitely going to be able to get that coil if you can get your tweezers onto them right if your coils are out of place then you're probably going to get a blinking error code when you go to hit this thing when you go to light it instead of it just lighting nice and smooth it might blink three or four times a weird color different colors and that is an error code letting you know that there's something wrong from the inner workings of your cartridge the electricity is not flowing properly do not pull the wires completely out or your oil will leak you might be missing a wire due to a manufacturer defect and if that's the case maybe go back to your local store and then say hey I think that there's a problem here I'm missing my center coil my manye for my bat my cartridge isn't working so hopefully if you live in a legal state you can go back to your store and you can get that replaced otherwise you might be out of luck and if you are out of luck in that instance then you might have to transfer your oil to a working cartridge like an empty one and empty working or non leaking cartridge so I always suggest keep these around when you're done with them when they're empty because if it was where if you had one that was working and you have say a brand new one that isn't working you could transfer the oil from this one to this one by simply unscrewing the cap and then you can actually stack these on top of each other if you have a steady hand and my previous video I did that so you could check that out you could put this part on top of the similar part and they will stack and all the oils transfer down the middle and go into the cylinder of your working cartridge so let's put that back on there before any more oil leaks out so that was number two is the center with coil displaced number three are your wicks out of place and now your oils leaking so you might say well what's the wick again that is the wick right there there should be two of them a wick that is wrapped with a coil and there would be another wick inside of this coil and those are inside of there those wires travel down the bottom of this cartridge and make contact with the center cylinder and with the bottom contact pin which will make contact with your battery contact plate all right so if your Center wick is out of place you're gonna know because you're not going to be able to draw a clean fresh smooth vapor out of your cartridge it's gonna seem to be stuck and you the tell-tale sign the very real sign is you're gonna hear a gurgling a slurping gurgling and that means that inside of the middle cylinder instead of this air and vapor going through you have oil leaking into these holes because your wicks are not in the hole they've been displaced so if they've been displaced oil is gonna go in the hole and you're gonna get a gurgling so if that happens that's number three while your wicks out of place transfer your oil your liquid to a working cartridge you can go to your local smoke shop and get a little ceramic tip we can get one of these not brand specific but you can get a generic one you can transfer your oil there it might take you some time but it might be your only option if you live in a non legal state number four these are the new additions did you try and screen your pen to increase the air flow well what what happens is over time the for air flow areas become clogged and it will disrupt your air flow so all we're gonna do is instead of screwing it on all the way nice and tight I found that sometimes all you got to do is just unscrew it a little bit and that will help increase the air flow into the side holes near the bottom of threading or it may increase the possibility of the airflow is going to go through the bottom air hole right there well minus the pen or a minus the contact pen so try unscrewing and to increase your air flow number five is your cartridge just getting old and clogged this is vapor it's sticky liquid and as you continue to use your product to the point of completion residue is just going to build up in there we all know that from smoking our tobacco pipes screens need to be replaced different cleaning solutions need to be used whatever we need to do to make sure that we can get air flow and these aren't any difference so as your a cartridge getting old and clogs so what I do is I actually inhale some fire lightly through the tip and blow out the melted wax so what do I mean by that is in my with my tip here I will just inhale put my mouth on the mouthpiece there and I will very lightly very lightly just a little mouth drag like you're hitting a cigar like a little give a little kiss and get kissed that the sticky oil in there with some fire and then blow it out below that sticky oil out right let me see if I could demonstrate this so not so much came out but maybe I could do it with already took these off anyway it works just try it out if you're not hearing if you just try it if you have this off and you try to take a mouth drag off it and you don't hear clean air going through it's clogged in there and that is very easily going to be your problem if it's if it's just getting old and clogged it might be new and clogged we don't know but just inhale a little bit of fire through that tip and then below that sticky wax out it will be hard sticky wax also turn to melted sticky wax and then you can blow it out let's see also - we can use the lighter to gently melt the thread wax on the cartridge so this is the thread the threading here that might get some sticky residue so we could just melt that and then just wipe it off and you'll get something same thing - with the inside of your pen just give a little just a little quick melt and then get inside of there and clean it out there's gonna be something and that something the threading if that threading gets all gunked up here and here then you're not going to get any airflow through the bottom hole which I should probably put that back so again one if we since I'm doing this let's talk real quick about is the center quit the Senator wick quill displaced when the robots are putting these back together when they push these in there I believe that this contact pin is pushing the wire is out of place and/or just snapping them on like snapping a heart sorry about the focusing on this camera let me see if I can fix it tada all right so when this is getting pushed in at the factory I think it's snapping these off or just moving them out of place so hopefully this video helps you out I've been I've been noticing when I've been using mine as they get older simply unscrewing them a little bit helps out a lot so just unscrew it a little bit and that should increase crease your air flow and then also to use the lighter trick to get them from being clogged all right so that's that hopefully this video helped you if the previous one didn't again sorry about the focusing issues I was unaware of whatever focusing issues were happening again if you like this video just subscribe they'll help me to get paid so you don't have to donate to me but if you do want to donate that would be super dope because you know I'm a stay-at-home dad so thanks again my name is Jay have an awesome rest of your day", "Wxzu9YvbhI8": "yo hey guys and welcome back to my channel it's your boy real maddie smokes and today

right so i ended up going back over there ended up getting a pink runs cartridge and i was like you know what let's give the boys a good old cartridge review like usual right so i'm gonna go ahead and get this all set up and we can finally sit down and get a good old cartridge session going all right before that though make sure you guys leave a like comment and subscribe all right guys so we got the pinks runs cartridge right here let me go ahead and show off the packaging for you guys so you guys know what a legit one looks like and for the battery that we're going to be using we're going to be using this one right here it's called the ooze vault all right so you're wondering why is it called the vault not only is it a 510 thread cartridge battery but it also has this attachment right here which is a dual quartz wax tank all right all you got to do is just put it on top of here screw it on and you can start smoking wax and if you don't want to smoke wax you could just use your 510 thread so i'm going to be doing both the cartridge and also the white runs sauce or i'm going to be testing both the features on this device and open it up for you guys real quick fresh new unboxing i have not tried this out so boom comes in a little clear tube as you can see right here but boom there comes the cartridge and as you guys can hope come on focus up boom it has like a really really amberish goldish tint to it so i'm hoping this is fire man i'm hoping this is as fire as the waxes over there all right guys so now that we're sitting down we could go ahead and screw it onto this battery as easy as that you guys already know by if you guys don't know i already know how to screw on a cartridge i don't know what to tell you anymore man i'm pretty sure i've done it enough time on the enough times on this channel so you guys can know how to do it right right so something about this battery on the bottom right here this little knob hopefully that's focused in you can go ahead and switch the variable wattages anywhere from 2.6 volts to all the way up to 3.8 volts okay to start off since i really don't know what kind of car i'm just assuming that this is a distillate cartridge i'm not really too sure or what they put in this i know that people have told me that their cookies cartridge is like live resin mixed in with terpenes and things like that but i'm not really too sure all right but we're going to go in at a 2.6 volts going in on the pink rent runs cartridges all right guys so cheers let me know in the comments below if you guys have ever tried any runts products cheers oh it was it was turned off right one two three four five gets you it turned on and then two clicks i know is like the preheat function i usually never personally use the preheat function i feel like the preheat function is best when you got a clogged cart but 2.6 volts let's go ahead and hit this cheers okay so right off of that first hit this tastes exactly exactly like the wax taste okay so the white runs has a very very distinct familiar taste for me the way that i describe it is it tastes kind of like a rosin dab honestly it's very very weird to hear that when you know it's bho extract but it has that it they do it where they capture the whole essence of the plant and it just tastes fire it just tastes like just some straight up butt but that was the first hit so i can't really base it off of the first hit and tell you that it's fire but so far i do notice that the oil is not super super liquidy but it is more on the liquidier side liquid area is not even a word i know but you know what i'm you know what i mean you know what i mean it's a little bit more runny than what i'm used to which means that this could have a lot of terpenes in it because if you guys don't know this elite does not move distal is like super super thick and i'm talking about after you hit it even a couple times it will not budge right so this one it could be really a live resin mixed in with terpenes and so far so good that we're gonna go in on hit number two i feel like 2.6 volts is actually a really really good setting so we're going to go hit go in on hit number two sorry about that boys [Music] yeah so it's actually not bad at all it's not harsh at all it tastes really really freaking good i'm not gonna say you know it tastes better than uh ursa or uh actually it tastes better than a buddies but not an ursa i think i can actually compare it to in ursa it has like that very very distinct like i don't know what it is i feel like they put like some type of live resin in here because when it comes to live resin it has like such a distinct flavor to it and i feel like if you if you've achieved enough cartridges or live resins you kind of know when you get a live resin because of the flavor itself okay so that was hit number two i'm gonna go ahead and turn this bad boy up to let's go ahead and do a 2.8 to three volts just to just to you know get the flavors in there man so with that being said so far this cartridge i'm not even mad that i bought it it's actually really freaking tasty the high that i'm getting off of it two hits in it's not really a crazy high it's like very very mellow but i know as soon as i keep hitting it more it's gonna you know keep hitting me 2.8 to 3.0 volts let's go in man this cartridge is actually really freaking tasty and i'm just hoping that i get a little bit more of the effects as we keep chiefing so cheers the flavor and the vapor production that i'm getting is actually phenomenal but like i'm saying it's not like a punch you in the face type of hit it's like very very subtle the cartridge is actually smooth all the way from the first hit to the xl i don't get any of that disturbance that i usually get with distillate so that leads me to believe like you know it's kind it has to be some type of mixture between like a liquid diamonds liquid like resin or something like that mixed in with terps to get give it that extra like you know flavoring but it's not actually a fake flavor it's not an artificial flavoring like some cartridges have it this actually matches the strain itself i'm hoping that they use strain specific terpenes in this and that'll pretty much just boost the cartridge a little bit more i kind of like when cartridges don't use different type of terpenes if that makes sense so you got your strain for example and then some companies like like raw garden they mix in different types of terpenes in there to give it a certain type of taste and kick and that's why most of their cartridges taste the same because i feel like they keep adding the same terps over and over and this one i got on the preheat setting holy shoot i'm over here burning the cartridge oh no i don't know i might have just been clicking it by accident but like i was saying this one it doesn't come out to believe like maybe they did use um white runs throughout the whole process from you know the actual live resin to itself to the terpenes you know it's all of a pink run strain so it's actually pretty freaking fire so with that being said i would rate the cartridge itself maybe a good seven out of ten i'm not getting a crazy you know effect out of it i'm not getting a crazy head change i'm not getting a body high or anything like that but i'm gonna go ahead and take another hit okay this is gonna be what the fourth one so this is gonna be the one where it kind of you know sets the score whether it's a good cartridge or it's a bad cartridge because you could have a good flavoring but if it doesn't get you faded then what's the point of that you know i'm gonna go ahead and turn it back down to 2.6 volts because i'm going to try to go for a blinker man we can't make a cartridge video without trying to go for a blinker right boys so we're gonna go in cheers if you got your cartridges with me go ahead and you know you know what to do boys cheers [Music] wow the flavor is just phenomenal dude it's so good so i'm going to show you guys how to use the attachment with the dual chamber so you can smoke your wax pretty much just unscrew your 510 up there it's literally as easy as this guys screw it back in i'm having a hard time because i'm trying to focus on the camera but literally just screw it in and then boom you're done literally all you got to do is just screw off the top mouthpiece and then as you can see right there there's some coils in there all right so you just load up your wax and then boom you're ready to freaking go all right boys for this one i'm gonna start it off honestly uh three clicks turn it back on i'm gonna go ahead and do this at a 3.0 volts all right boys all right so we got the runts wax right here i'm going to go ahead and load it up for you guys show you how easy it is pretty much just take the top off like i said and then all you're going to want to do is grab a little tool grab your wax and then put it right on the coils all right boys remember this isn't this isn't going to be like getting a dab straight from a rig this is solely for the purpose if you know you might want to keep it discreet you live with people that don't really you know like weed and stuff like that so you can't keep any rigs around you this is the perfect sleek device for that to be able to still take dabs and be able to use a 510 thread cartridge on it or the other alternative is you know when you're out on the go with the boys or your girls or whatever the case is you guys are out hiking you don't want to be carrying your 300 puffco peek or you're rigging your torch and stuff like that boom there you go this is this is your alternative right here the ooze vault like i was saying i'm gonna go ahead and put this start this off like at a 3.0 it's going to be the green setting all right guys it's going to be the middle setting so i'm gonna go ahead and just slowly inhale it that's usually from experience i like to slowly inhale i don't like to pull right away because i know that it has to heat up the wax and create some vapor so we're gonna go ahead and give you guys a first try right here cheers [Music] try to keep it level [Music] holy smokes holy smoked i did not think that was gonna work as good as it did but your boy got a freaking huge dab right there and that was barely any inhale so i'ma slowly unscrew this and dude the freaking diamond is still in there bro well at least we know that this thing can conserve some freaking oil so i put a nice little dab in there not too fat not too small but it literally conserved that i still have a fat rock in there so i'm gonna go ahead and heat it up one more time cheers everybody [Music] yeah you definitely get a decent enough dab like this is without a doubt more than enough when you're out on the go [Music] yeah dude my diamonds are still down there bro i'm gonna have to push it down because i got another fat cloud but for some reason there's one stuck on the side right there and oh my goodness dude all right so i loaded up a nice another one in there i'm starting to get the dab sweat to do i'm not gonna this is a lot of wax in one sitting so all i'm going to do is turn it up until you get to the red setting which is going to be at like 3.2 to 3.8 so if a green setting which was the middle setting i got a pretty decent cloud i'm kind of scared of what the red setting is going to do man i don't want to over burn it but you know i got to test it out one time so you guys really know how it's rocking so with that being said red setting on the ooze vault this thing is a banger dude i can't i can carry this definitely everywhere i go so cheers yo [Music] [Music] so as you can see right there that red setting it definitely hits the spot it kind of makes me feel like i was hitting a cartridge in a sense since it's a shape of a cartridge like literally when you inhale it you can hit it and ghost inhale just as a cartridge it hits you pretty smooth but when you keep it in your lungs you're like holy crap this is a dab as opposed as to just a regular you know hit from the cartridge um so that's why the last one kind of smacked me i was coughing a little bit after that but we recuperated this thing definitely hits man so just to pretty much wind this all up together guys the the fact that you could put a 510 thread cartridge and smoke wax out of this this little tiny device literally it fits in my palm i could literally walk around every anywhere with this and it actually packs a punch you know it's not one of those creature those crappy cheap ones that supposedly gives is supposed to give you a dab but it doesn't even give you any vapor production this actually does a job the fact that you can switch it all the way up to almost 4 volts it gives you a lot of power all right so with that being said um to give you guys a breakdown and a review of the cartridge itself the pink runs is actually pretty freaking fire honestly i like the overall flavor of it it's just it tastes really freaking good it tastes pretty good i had no fake terp like flavorings in there i feel like it was all just straight up runs in my opinion it didn't taste bad at all there was nothing that i could complain about you know other than the fact that it was just like pretty watery and runny um but other than that it's pretty good if the high was not the best but it is on the lower end of the thc levels i think it's sitting like at 68 or something like that but overall for what it is it's a overall great product i definitely can see myself maybe copying one in the future if they come out with a limited edition strain so if you guys would like to see any more um runs reviews uh especially the strains man oh my goodness i've been trying to go um get the strains for you guys but they literally sell out all the time i apologize for that um but whenever i can get my hands on some of the strains i'm definitely gonna drop a video for you guys because i know a runt is a very popular strain so if you guys want to see more of them and you guys already know just drop a like on the video so with that being said overall um this was an enjoyable video man we got smacked we got faded this device is dope runs is overall pretty fire at least the wax side of it i haven't tried the bud and um yeah overall great video i'm baked i'm happy and we're gonna end it out here fam so if you guys had a great you know if you guys enjoyed this video man do me one last favorite hit the like hit the comments i try to respond to everybody and last but not least help your boy reach 40k subs man hit the subscribe button alright we'll catch you guys on the next one", "fSNDZ9HQnQk": "[Music] all right guys what's up simplistic here back with another video i'd like to mention that randy is filming this whole entire video on his camera so the video quality is going to be a lot better but if you didn't see from the b-roll all that good stuff i do have three buddies i mean you've already seen it but uh basically i bought a distillate one and a live resin one but the distillate has live resin terps and uh it is a form of live resin to me so for those of you who say it's not realized to me it is all right but uh one of these are actually ben's and we're gonna give him right here thank you but he's also gonna be in the video shout out to be legit also subscribe to rj eats and i'm saying the link will be in the bottom description below all that good stuff but for this video we have two batteries we have a stick battery from the chill and we have your typical box battery uh from the brand das vape so we're definitely gonna try both of these these are both sativas as well one's clementine one is train wreck and uh for those of you who want to see the differences this one the green one is actual live resin this one's distilled with live resin terps and as you can see this one has ten percent more terps or ten percent terps while this one only has uh four but what this lacks inter uh percentage they actually have a lot more not a lot more but more thc see as you can see right here total cannabinoids like 80 something this one's like 70. that's the difference between distillate and live resin live resins generally 70s maybe 80s if you're lucky with distillate being 80 to 90. so um i'm going to open these and uh i'm just going to take some hits i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe buddies live resin and distill it live resin terps i don't know what i would call it but something along those lines and uh just let me know in the comments how you liking this video quality you know what i'm saying i appreciate mandy for uh filming this whole episode with this stuff i don't say but right off the bat opening this smells very lemony i believe the prominent oh wait i thought it was there right so put that in you can see the color of this the color of this distillate with the live resin terps is generally going to be a lighter more green or yellowish color i mean it even says in the box right look at the colors compared to them the live resin right here is uh generally going to be darker but distill it with live resin terps gonna be a a yellowish greenish color yeah got it got it so yeah did you take the first hit well this is an action i don't know autofocus is pretty [ __ ] fire okay yeah standing still is a little harder but moving around like it's i'm wondering that's how it's gonna work with the app too because the aperture you can lower the aperture a lot further down on that on the 22 millimeter that i have yeah so this one's the captain kush this was what ben chose as you can see let's just mix them up and [ __ ] damn that's fine let me see oh [ __ ] yeah very good that one's a live resin on the right no these are both the distally with the live resin terms [Applause] but you'll see the difference sorry about that broke this box this is the [ __ ] that [ __ ] all right right here get that see you can see the colors oh yeah yeah the one in the middle yeah this one has 10 turfs these ones have four percent but these have a higher percentage in thc or cannabinoids so uh this one's yours before i forget and we're gonna just take it take a hit off all three i'm saying who's calling me cheers [Music] hello no gotta give one to the camera man um yeah i got it um it's auto focus yeah i'll do it for you oh [ __ ] that's dope go no wonder you're far back yeah i was like what the heck that bigger crop it's it's uh uh just randy oh my god it looks dope uh yeah damn you can feel this glance working when the it's shaking so we have to switch the spot real quick guys because the kitchen is being occupied but randy just took a hit off the train wreck cartridge how'd you like it it definitely hit right definitely hit yeah honestly you're paying 28 for a gram of this right yeah that's why i bought two more i mean uh this is like my third one that i bought of the white one because some i don't know why i i seem to like the distillate live resin turps better than the live resin one and i don't know if it's just me it's a lot cheaper too maybe that's uh it tastes good to me i don't know but ben hasn't taken a hit off this this is the clementine i mean trainer okay what's up alexis oh i still got a pretty good angle of it because i got in there in time i was still uh like last time i thought it would turn out i was like so no we got the live resin one of the clementine so if you're not awake all right so i'm gonna take a hit of this off this battery you guys know this battery hits okay oh this is a good shot holy [ __ ] this one's a lot smoother the the library is a lot smoother this one uh i feel like it hits a lot harder maybe that's what adds on to the harshness to it you get a fatter hit off the distillate one because maybe distillate is a thinner oil even though it's still thick it's a lot thinner i gotta get out the shot that was kind of weird there you go i love the cart whose was this one this is the the clementine with 10 turks one was wet last one was i need to try it again this one's good though i don't know i like the this this one tastes good though yeah it tastes more like natural yeah okay and then we're going to try tastes like actual dab now so since this is his he's going to try it first and it's going to be a winker cbs can you bring his calling no yeah [Laughter] this is actually ben's so when we went to authentic today i i came with the idea of buying a liquid live resin or a live resin one and a distance live resin turf one and then ben also came along and purchased one as well because he tries he tried my buddy's car before and he liked it you know and it's 28 you really can't beat that but yeah i'm gonna try this now um the total for all three of these was only 86.50 that's pretty good that's hella good usually that's like almost grabbing a half maybe that ground and 20 quarters i mean a quarter that 20 that 20 quarters [Music] and you can see his pores and [ __ ] oh [ __ ] dog though all right so [Music] so oh this one's a lip do you change the brightness yeah did you die it still look nice change it oh go hold on we got to fix that though no it's cool it's cool looks good it's not too bright no it's better now but the other one wasn't wasn't that bad it was still bright but you guys hear that joe rogan in the background you feed me that's the biggest [Music] all right so um uh all three you guys like the live rest one better uh probably the what was the first one that was the train wreck i like that one better yeah but the close that the second one is going to be the live resin one that's my birthday um but to end off the video guys i am going to take a hit off both at the same time and uh i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe somewhere along the lines blinking both buddies parts i don't know something like that um but yeah look at both legs clicking both buttons so cheers [Laughter] [Music] that's for you guys we're gonna end it off with uh randy taking a hit i'd like to thank you guys for uh watching the video and also randy for being a part of it and using his camera always also be legit for taking those blinkers even though he didn't want to and uh you know what i'm saying i can obviously i can really tell the difference between my camera and uh randy's camera with the the landsat oh [ __ ] you don't have to hold it in bro [Music] all right guys so as you can see it's about done so cameraman has been switched but we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video just another buddies cartridge video i've been buying them a lot lately because i really [ __ ] with that they're really affordable and high quality at the same time you know i'm saying i don't care for these 80 gram cartridges or fifty dollar half gram cartridges and i could care less for that but yeah other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video like it subscribe all that good stuff and see you guys [Music] you", "2eNWJ5aQ2UA": "so what is going on YouTube it is your boy 7g back at it with another video for you guys man dang I've been grinding out some content man I have I have a dentist appointment coming up and I might or might not have to get some wisdom teeth taken out so I've been grinding out videos man actually I've been trying to record as much as possible because when that time comes I know I so I've heard you're not allowed to smoke or like drink milk or [ __ ] like that for like a week or two so I was like damn bro that means that I'm gonna I can't I won't be over to make up videos for like a week or two so I have to you know think ahead and start recording ahead a man so here's one of those videos men I thought for today's video guys it would be something to go it would be something special to go back down memory lane and bring back to you guys the first cartridge that I have ever bought alright this was the first cartridge that I bought I think it was like what was it like three years ago four years ago I'm not too sure when I even bought my first cartridge but I do know that this was my first cartridge because I remember when I got out I tell you guys the whole story right the FIR the whole story on this so today guys we are gonna be chiefing on an Alpine they used to be live resin but they just switched it to premium cannabis oil guys right here we got the Northern Lights sitting at a nice eighty four point ninety seven percent THC guys and this one right here has a thousand and fifty milligrams and imma just basically touch it down on all on this product in general man because this guy has been I mean as of late you know because there's been a lot of more a lot more brands that have been coming out with live res and you know cannabis drive terpenes blah blah blah it has just been blowing you know desolate companies out of the water so but ya guys Alpine live resin or Alpine premium cannabis oil was one of the first well actually is the first one and it is the Northern Lights was the first one that I ever bought - so as you guys can see I got this one right here I did open it already man I did open it already probably took a cater - just so you guys know and yeah man I was just it was like basically when I went when I fought when I bought my first ever cartridge right I was how old was I like eighteen seventeen I don't remember exactly - too much but yeah man I I was feeling for a cartridge because I had all of my friends all my cousins buying cartridges and things like and I was just like man I wish you know I could just have a cartridge so it could be convenient for me to just hit that [ __ ] in my room and just be getting hot without anybody without me having to go out and you know you know smoke some weed and getting getting caught up and blah blah blah all that stuff man so when my cousin told me about Alpine here's a yellow Brahma go to the disco you you need anything cuz my cousin was one of the first people that what me and my cousin were one of the first people to ever get there just their medical record licenses so you know he went he was like yeah I'm gonna get a cartridge you want me to buy you when I was a heck yes man heck yes so at the time Alpine live resins were the ones that they were smoking a lot so I was a man caught me and how pine because when I tried him you know I was a yellow I love it I need one of those alright guys so right here we got the Northern Lights Alpine let's go ahead and take a hit for you guys Cheers this thing smacks alright guys so basically I'm a touch down on touch base with you guys on how how it went man so after my cousin got me my cartridge man I was like so excited you know it's like a little kid just getting his [ __ ] brand new ps4 or whatever the hell the case is Xbox you know et Cie and just being able to just know that anytime that you want you're gonna be able to just play that thing you know that's the same thing that I'm getting right in that I was getting at that moment it's like yes man I finally have a cartridge that I can hit whenever I want I don't have to be going to my cousin's house or asking my cousin it you know hanging out like this I finally have my own all right ma'am and so basically like I remember at the time these things were called alpine light resins now like I showed you guys on the Box there I guess they got busted cuz they were calling it live resin but you guys know that when you make light residence flash freezes the the plan you know and then automatically squish it and that's pretty much live resin and what they were doing was just pretty much getting disel it and just putting it it tasted way different than it does now I'm telling you guys the truth I don't know what they were adding to it if there was like Terps to make it mortar PT you know because live resin is a super super Turkey so I think they were just playing the community at that time they were like you know alpine light resin cartridges for sale and this was literally the first time I ever tried a live resin cartridge man I remember I used to be oh let me take this here real quick oh there's some massive clouds dude hey guys and I remember I used to be hitting this cartridge right and I used to be like oh my gosh should I have some live resin this ain't no normal bunk cast distally you know blah blah blah I used to be bragging about it like my friends my cousins used to smoke breast enough cuz I'd be like I got the live resin on deck but you already know the deal so but then I come to find out they switched up their packaging switched up everything because they got busted and they got busted for pesticides and a lot of [ __ ] too and let me tell you at this this was three to four years ago four years ago I believe three three or four years ago and so at that time there wasn't that many regulations on cartridges right so you know people could lie people could frickin put whatever the hell in cartridges and no one would know up until it's it's fairly new that a lot of you know companies have had to you know put testing on their products and things like that man because it was getting out of hand man it was getting out of hand that was the first ever time that you know I got scammed for something that wasn't what what they marketed it to be but it's okay because I was still getting smacked at the time like those cartridges I had better distillate in them then most cartridge companies that I know now you know sorry for the stuttering right there but yeah if you guys have ever tried Alpine Light resin cartridges you guys remember it back a couple even I think a little over a year ago even they had the metal tips it was the metal round tips and all the way through and those just looked a lot more satisfying and I liked I liked hitting those like they were like the brass knuckles but they were just silver all the way around and they were just so nice to hit man I don't know what it was about those cartridges but I love those a lot more than the than the plastic tip ones for some reason but yeah guys right here this Northern Lights just smacking me I'm not even gonna lie out for those two hits I'm already getting a change I'm regaining the head change the body changed all that good stuff and it brings back memories man the taste it doesn't taste exactly like the live resin one that I that I used to have but it tastes fairly fairly similar so you know it kind of it kind of still makes me happy that there's that they're adding the same ingredients in this I mean I'm hoping it's the same ingredients you know because if it tastes as good as the same as it did a couple years ago then I'm assuming they haven't changed much up other than the fact they're not live resin anymore I also forgot to mention though anybody watching this video you guys must be 18 or 21 and over it whatever it is in your legal state I cannot stress this enough guys because YouTube just been on every we tubers ask you guys if you guys follow anybody other other than me man you guys know that they've been on Edwin Sparks they've been on mr. TC Eric on indicate all those people man so shout out to all of those dudes grinding it out but yeah man YouTube just needs to leave us alone like if we're being honest YouTube I don't know what the hell you're doing about but I'm nice and stone right now I don't even know what to say anymore this Northern Lights got me smack there's there's not a lot of cartridge companies that even get me this smacked off with such little hits man but then again I haven't been smoking cartridges a lot lately it's been more joints a lot of more joints and dabs lately so it's been phenomenal man I have so much more videos for you guys to watch and I just can't wait for you guys to see them then so I just want to say though if you guys have gotten this far into the video make sure you guys hit that like button one time and if you haven't already most importantly it does subscribe one time for your boy chews can't even hit anymore dude I'm done I smoked a nice boy early and that was about it but now I'm just way too stone like I'm telling you still good though Alpine is definitely some of the best distillate but that I've had over the course of my years you know and you know shout out to them for always for always hooking it for always like being there for your boy you know growing up and um it's smoking and smoking them they got your boy through a lot man I'm not gonna lie like there's been times where I was like I always had a Alpine to get me through the bad times I'm not having a lot so yeah guys I hope you guys enjoyed this video man I have really have nothing else to talk about I

smoking a lot of designer [ __ ] cards lately hey I can't explain it you know what I mean I just I just I can't help it Semien brands like friendly farm alien web-connected cuz I know if it's new for me is new for some of you guys this isn't adventurous and experienced shut the [ __ ] up so very excited to let you guys know what I can't today what I can't today is being I don't want to say a controverse I don't want to say it's controversial because it's not controversial but it's a it's a topic of discussion here at the site when I saw that friendly farms was releasing a full gram cart which was knit which is a new thing for them you know what I mean which I had no idea I'm relatively new to friendly farm hindsight 20/20 if you don't have to sell the full grams don't you know what I mean like and the surprising thing is is that this was pricey but it wasn't you know it wasn't like the 50 $60 half gram and this is still connected cured residents now they were known for the live resin whenever they did to collapse this is cured which if I'm not mistaken and it doesn't take a scientist figure that out cure it I'm sure is what just cleaner live resin and it's one gram brand friendly farms came out with a 1 gram cartridge right now when I had heard of that I was just like damn I hope it's not as expensive as half luckily is really not as I think they actually lowered the prices this was $60 almost 70 same for the half gram the biscotti cross with gushers biscotti cross with gushers open this bad boy up and give it a whirl shall we man use my have a letter print the definite was some kind of you know message oh it's right here on the background you deserve better or just give you a happy force you know what I mean just quotes to make you feel a little bit solace

that's a relatively new strand that they came out with connected you know what I mean and this is for me like I love bass I feel like it gives you the actual taste of whatever that is whatever that strand is and I just I like to taste it you know what I mean I like to taste what it actually tastes like you know what I mean and this is everything I mean listen this is live residence it's all natural from plants a pen no additives distillate free distillate freak [Music] funny thing about the gushers and the biscotti strands of connected is the both have gelato because of the gelato 41 in the regular gelato that's oh my god there's four different crosses in this so it's really hard to you know for a person with a TD to really remember it all but look it up it's actually like a very interesting combination of things [Music] not too much on the dry bulb on is the biscotti Crossman gushes brand-new full Graham Karcher by so I want you guys to take this while I present this

because I knew that they were coming out with full grams because I remember I got a comment in the comments and it was a Chaz I mean I believe it was somebody from connected and they had said that they'd be coming out with 4 grams soon so I was very very very interested very interested so I made sure to count mine I made sure to come I was a [ __ ] to try to find though I'm not gonna front it was very annoying at first but I'm very happy that it worked out I'm very happy with the price point being $55 with tax came down to like 65 66 which is not bad you know I mean you got to pay your tax

bakery brother yeah no problem yeah actually thanks for showing up at the concentration celebration you know that was so much fun thanks for having us hey guys [ __ ] crushed it over there man has some beautiful contact UK cheesy all entered yeah that one's a great one it uh it tastes like a blueberry muffin and it's about like a like a 50/50 hybrid yeah it has us just [ __ ] is this man that's the banana couch livers and cartridge yeah this thing's fruity is all hell yeah that's why I invited him over I asked him he's got a fat has anything interesting going on and he says you got to taste the live resin cartridges and I've actually recently gotten into these I started buying a few different brands auditioning them but it's just Turkey as a [ __ ] and thank you so much as I'm surprising because I don't normally get super high off these and unfortunately I got super high before we're doing our interview so yeah let you know how it works but yeah delicious man the libraries and then that is a hundred percent pure uncut we don't put anything in it and we just keep it that way I'm gonna try to match like the turkey and profile as much as we can it didn't help me out with okay so the first cartridges that came out I completely dismissed them cuz I tasted on my taste propylene glycol I was at an event last night down in Denver and people were showing off their their new technology and I tasted a cart and it was just it tasted like bait juice it tasted like you know and I was just like dude I don't think you know I mean I don't want that [ __ ] yeah unfortunately like when when vape cartridges and pens are getting really popular if that's all you were tasting this PG and then people start cutting with dislike because of it cut similar right it was not as like harmful to your body as PG but now it's the point where we can have libraries and cartridges and then our next step personally is going to be a solvent cartridge as well all right interesting now now sama I hear these solvent lists newts all the time man that will only do solvent list and everything yeah I like them both I really do we do - honestly well most of our lives smokes butane or not butane but BHO and then a lot of us also smoke live rosin or don't let me hit this I'm gonna be I'll be too [ __ ] all right so what's it explain to me just because I'm trying to learn about cartridges I'm sure other people are what's the difference between the cheap cartridge at the dispensary in the AO and the $50 one it's all about quality there's a lot of companies that are more about quantity so that's the peak those are the guys that are cutting it would probably glycol and that kind of stuff yeah it's a lot easier it's a lot easier for your resin to get into that liquid form when you're cutting a PG or distillate so I could smoke it without it buttering or sugaring or crashing Lots inside the cartridge but we found a way where you don't have to mix it with any of that and you can just literally pour the live resin right into the pin and close it and give it to the customer a sick and that that's when these things have really evolved now I went to a concert recently just two nights ago and I'm normally used to having a bowl or a one-e-and and some container for flour or even if I have one of those pins you know if I got like a goby or something like that I got to go be I got the shatter that I'm loading it with I got something to get the wax off my fingers yeah these are [ __ ] easy and they're a little too easy but I just thought I was gonna hit one now I can easily smoke one of these cards she's just like sitting at home or right if it's the Durbin poison and writing like all the dishes in my entire house or love it you know all the tours so so this is just terpenes you get to like get to back to my education so when they when you distill or I'm sorry when you run something through a column you get what the I don't know how to like what they pick the Diamonds out of the terpenes and then they use the terpenes to make this sauce is that right or to make it live these parts with the with the live resin we're able to pack the column the shoot butane through the column right so what you get is the butane the cannabinoids and the terpenes and then you pull that butane out of the terpenes that cannabinoid right so then that's what we put into the pin so you're getting everything that you would get if you sucked like the diamonds and drank the sugar if you salt the butter anything like that but it's all in a cartridge now Varian just okay I love it I'm starting to get an understanding here so you said pull the butane out what's that wood residual butane and all that stuff is that something you got to worry about it's nothing that we have to worry about too much we've been in the game for a while over a century now and so we have over a century over a century and we're there for a hundred years no not centuries I told you these things it was him and Henry Ford it's our decade yeah no we actually have been in the company for a decade now and what we've been doing is like fine-tuning that tech so now we don't have any of those issues that's cool I mean it doesn't taste like anything but but turps honestly thank you yeah it's actually we try to match the exact terpene profile that you would get with the actual cannabis plant interest like a banana cush there's the Michelle gross banana that's what the banana cush is actually tasting like 1980s that's when the plant was produced and so that's why they named it banana cush because it was that banana that was hard to find at that time and when you say matched herpes I don't understand what that means um so when you smoke the plant or when you smoke the bud and it's like even from like the from the original breeder you're still gonna get around the same terpene profile sure and so what you smell in that grow is what we're trying to capture and keep inside that cartridge is what it's like a recipe um it's not a recipe it's like a it's like a natural recipe that the plant produces okay so you thought we're trying to keep it the entire time while preserving the terpene profile I'm not adding terpenes no just now I get it don't add anything yeah excellent makes sense man so we were talking about the big word the buzzword in our industry is vertical integration are you vertically integrated men and all that means is that do you have everything from your own grow to your own processing facility I guess sometimes it means your own dispensary right yes we're completely vertically integrated we do have outside processing on the side because you've good adding yeah so what doubt side processing means some growers ask you to process their [ __ ] yeah so we have a lot of companies similar to like it cut above where they will give us our fresh frozen and we will process that fresh frozen for them right and send it back to them so they could sell out their store but at the same time we also process our own in-house and that's about 95 to 90 percent of our in-house or all of our processing is in-house and so with that in-house then we sell all that wholesale throughout Colorado God so if I wanted a natty Rams cart I should ask for him by name though if you want an atom's car I suggest following us on Instagram you can sign up for a newsletter where we drop every week where we drop all the cartridges that's enough for a newsletter to get one of these made come on you got a store fine or something we also have a sore point deal that makes all right so as far as managing a grow as far as managing quality control I'll be I want to tell you a story that I got some edibles I've been getting into and actually going back to the dispensary recently got me some carts and got me some edibles and I tried this I said what's the most bang for the buck for edibles like 2000 milligrams in this tincture well I tried and it's bunk you know I mean just had nothing going on it and I'd [ __ ] drink half the bottle there's actually frightened for the first hour thinking it was gonna kick in I never did yeah it's all about quality control but I mean so and actually I went back to the dispensary who's my local dispenser really cool folks and I was like hey I want to show you guys this stuff seems like it's bunk no you can't even bring that in the store holy cow I can't give you a refund and it was like you realized what a yellow hour our hands are tied on doing business you know even the advertising credit card processing it's so difficult in business you know definitely well even as far as quality control how do you guys handle that well from grow all the way to selling and processing and getting it out the door there's always quality control so we start from the clone as it's growing there's always people checking it right and sure all the plants look good then as it's getting harvested and getting frozen there's another quality check and then as it's getting processed and then as it's getting created and then that's getting packaged in years out the door there's always the quality control check it's just even kind of corporate here man do you got white lab coats and stuff no it's not it's not very coke right it's more just the whole team cares like we all look at it we're always inspecting it even if we're not told to so you're hoping that we're just like naturally looking at smelling it making sure it's like the actual thing and it's not that we have that issue but there's so many different strains and there's there's always like different phenotype we'll checking making sure it's like everything that we want man I'm thinking I have a bamboo nursery a 20-acre bamboo nursery down in Florida can we do like 20 different varieties like I'm 20 different strains and I just think about the quality control that we have and what it really comes down to is if we lose a thousand plants that's a thousand plants you have to fungus or something that's a thousand plants that those guys work their ass off on it's also a matter of pride they're actually producing something so there's a you know it's just a inclination a pride to actually produce something amazing yeah we try to keep that tegrity and we tried to did you say tegrity yeah I love it a farm no but there's a we always try to keep that Tiger tea and we always try to make sure we give the love that each plant deserves just as if it was one of six plants in a basement so I guess it is but as you expand it's like you have to make sure that you are that efficient precise and so then you can slowly grow with the rest of the company yeah yeah you say slowly grow as the rest of the company yeah I know a bit gonna dunk your time I know about growing but I'm always interested in what's going on with this industry as far as what's going on like I don't know as far as I see Oklahoma blowing up now there's all the Michigan blowing up I'm a little bit confused about the state of the industry nobody gets to do interstate commerce anymore or ever I should say what do you guys think about that where do you see the industry in five years so they gotta open that up and I kind of national legalization what do you think I think it's gonna take around like three to five or even more years just for like that to switch over and basically because of the tax code that's with federal government right now is that way you know the more I think about it and the more I study it the more it just has to do with money or how they collect the money you think it'll take that long they're pretty good at figuring out how to collect money I don't know it's like since the beginning they always had a way for them to collect money even if we thought that all of our money was going to the public and it was going to for Denver is going to the homeless look even if we think all the money is going towards that they're still making good amount of money she's messed up in the in the system or in the industry then you get a fee and that fee is like out the door grabber aegis yeah yeah I've heard stuff goes yeah I've heard stories so a bedroll legalization who still stinks five years away four or five years away um I mean we're not holding our breath for right now right um it would be great if it did happen you all were looking forward to it yeah most companies I talk to her like hey and I'm doing just fine in this in this niche I just had a lot of money to get here yeah I'm not looking forward to competing what sold out what do you think about competing with I'm pretty confident that we can compete with them as we're growing we're getting more excited and our coffins is getting like bigger and bigger and it's been more than 10 years and we have just been sitting back and like making sure everything is exactly the way that we want it right we're out trying to jump a gun too quickly and in the next six months or so it's gonna start building a little bit bigger and then after that then I would in about two three years we plan to be in multiple states so yeah that's all it takes that long to [ __ ] expand huh yeah I mean I guess you got to get a grow set you got to get a location you gotta get like successor is that what the big the big hang-up is licenses yes they give you a license you can [ __ ] hit the ground running yeah it's just one of the first tube so you have to jump through just a interesting man so a dude if so if you could change anything if you were in charge of cannabis policy man any ideas man could you fix this get any big ideas if there was one big change I would try to have like all the companies in the cannabis industry try to work together cuz right now it's a lot of competition right and if we all actually work together and talk together then I think it would be easier for all the companies individually and how do you do that one it's such a hard product of just English you got such an that's hard it is tough I mean we try to set up as many meetings as we can with different companies and try to collaborate with them and like become like one solid team the beer companies do it though yeah the beer companies aren't all at each other's throat you go to a tap room and there's 25 different taps from 10 different you know 15 different breweries so here we're figuring away everybody's got to have their niche these are interesting it's y'all's niche yeah uh yeah I think I like it yeah yeah he's a nice easy chair everybody like said there's not even a button on it it's just one pole it's easy to get in man it's easy to get into a show or something like that anywhere you want let's go for concerts and events yeah obviously as a as a professional company because it's just that like you bring into a concert or anything like that but like it's the perfect thing all right I gotta ask man everybody's always even dreaming in prohibition land if I could just go to Colorado or California Michigan and work at a cannabis company man that'd be amazing that'd be living my dream almost like like winning a lottery don't yell don't uh don't wish for things that you don't understand yeah so is that something that if if I went to a cannabis company do I get to just smoke all day do I get to dab all day is it [ __ ] yeah no tell me about it first and then dabs later okay um we we always go in like early in the morning hit the ground running um just so we can get as much work as we can right into the end of the day and then after that you can relax and you can like with that we usually hang out with each other after work sure um but yeah we can hang out we could smoke and all that kind of stuff but yeah when it comes to work it's very straightforward we get stuff done he makes sense she just fired up what time you guys fired up in the morn then I got enough I was talking to because I was talking to an extract artist yesterday just ten hour shifts [ __ ] yeah our shifts on the rig this for personally for me I think I wake up around like 3:30 4 o'clock in the morning such as that and then guys are dedicated oh yeah yeah I start checking my email probably like around like 5:30 all right get into the grow around like 6:00 6:30 and then I'm there and sometimes until like 7 8 o'clock at night Jesus Christ man what happened out yeah geez how do you keep motivated like that it's insane well just like honestly it's great working in like our facility because everybody is like integrated so there's wrong in the lab and everybody works together around the same place so like if you look over and you see like a seven-foot plant I just got chopped down that goes by the harvest sure then like obviously like that's gonna get you hyped up because right oh man that's going straight to fresh frozen we're just gonna concentrate which might go on are these pens so is it ironic but you have to go into the bathroom and sneak some cokes to the pen then no just [ __ ] yeah kind of like the office with how many cameras are set up at the Grove for like yeah yeah oh it's actually some place so actually somebody put a meme up that was like you know back I deal 10 years ago I was hiding in the woods to try to smoke a you know a bowl with my friends yeah and now it's like you know 2019 it's like should I hit this pen and target yeah I love it the Internet is just probably like I'd say like the Internet is thriving just as much as the cannabis industry is right now share this from the tools we get are absolutely amazing you know like that you know being able to use Instagram being able yeah was that a kind of professionals association I don't know how they that man knows a bunch of cannabis professionals and I didn't have any business cards so just like nah just follow our instagram oops I need to do what's your Instagram I'll catch you there yeah mine's actually digital about sushi that's my personal llama but then I also run the natty rooms underscore Colorado beautiful Instagram page beautiful man beautiful so it's [ __ ] cool Manfred enjoy hanging out thank you though thanks for having me I got the chief on one of your pens all in Oriya delicious man I'm gonna go find one of these brother you can have that one deal I'm gonna go find another conclusion it'll find that part now I'm gonna go find another good hanging out thank you for having me so much goes for a rat natty rims yeah [Music] little break [Music] [Music] it says to do [Music] true medicine [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "F20EmG4W9Vk": "oh it's not above to make me change like a castaway you know you pay that you bought the cooler today hey guys I just shot this entire video and I wasn't even recording man so I'm stoned as heck right now having to rerecord this for you guys but it's alright that's alright so without further ado guys my name is Teddy G welcome back to my channel for today's video guys we got something crazy we got a freaking comparison all right guys from two of the biggest brands out on the market right now we are going to be testing out this dizzy live resin and we're going to be comparing it to the raw garden refined live resin alright guys the only reason we're doing this is because I felt like you know these are two of the biggest brands on the market right now in terms of cartridges so it would be just fun to just see what's that what what is the difference between these cartridges you know what is the taste difference what's the why is raw garden refined light resin and why's dizzy luck regular light resin and we're gonna touch base on every single detail as to what each company brings to the table and just so you guys know man who is the best live resin out there right now before this video starts though I want you guys who are watching this video right now let me know in the comments below spam that [ __ ] let me know what do you guys think is better we got this dizzy live resin or we got the raw garden and refined by resin so hey let me know if you guys have tried any of these and let me know what's your favorite and why alright guys so without further ado man I think the only thing there is to do now is to test these out get an ice and stone and let you give you guys the full rundown as to what I think is better alright guys so we are going to be testing out this one right here which is the key lime pie it is an indica and we are going to be compared - the banana slim from raw garden which is also indica the raw garden is sitting at 85 point 95 percent of THC and though it is e itself is the seitan at a nice seventy nine point seventy one percent THC all right guys so the difference is already you know seven to seven percent differential in the THC percentages is it really going to make a difference I feel like it all depends on the product itself man it all depends on the strain it depends on you know yeah I think it just depends mostly on the strain and how much smoke consumption you can get because obviously if you're not getting enough smoke in your lungs then you're not getting hot so I don't know which one to test out first geyser so we got the key lime pie plus the sour gorilla which is a hybrid I'm just trying to compare both of the indicas though so not that we go with this dizzy first alright guys so we're gonna take a big fat blink of a note off of this dizzy and tell you guys the full flavor profile what kind of time it gets me get to be right off the bat because with the blinker man you have to feel something right guys so cheers boys if you guys are over the age of 18 and 21 man that's all I'm saying choose the initial flavor flavor that I'm getting I am getting a little hint of like select a line like Elvis citrusy which is pretty freakin cool man none to say the least but I uh I'm also getting that natural like if you guys know if you have ever smoked live resin you guys know that it tastes kind of like it doesn't taste burnt but it does taste like like obviously something very very earthy that like you know it's something completely different than the within what you're used to if you smoke raw garden something completely different man this type of live resin you know is actual live residence how it's like you know the industry standard of live resin and that's what's tizzy puts in the pot so comparing it to the refine light resin though so pretty much what raw garden does what they're refined light resin is they take out any extra lipids and things like that carcinogen I mean I'm not really too sure if it has carcinogens but if they take out pretty much any extras that they really don't feel should be vain alright guys so compared to this one this one might have NEX some extra lipids just from the process of the you know squishing the plant itself as opposed to this that it's gonna take out all that extra stuff so that's why you also get it so clear right so it's just refining it that way you get a better end product it's basically what they're trying to do so without further ado guys I think we should just go in for a fat little toke and yeah choose [Music] oh my gosh dude the raw garden blinkers literally they kill me every time I like I used to when I first started smoking these I used to take blinker after blink after blinker but by now man I don't know what it is but they're just so like so much harsher now and then what they used to be it's out there so much harsher or it's just my lungs they're you know slowly decay ting but either way man it doesn't matter yeah take touch base on both of these though man off the first two initial hits like this one right here I got it was it wasn't as Turkey is what I'm used to to the to the raw Gardens but they that's what sucks about these is they always change man I mean the base flavor profile Oh is always the same you know it's always usually the similar taste but I'm talking about the Terps you'll get some that are really really really chirpy and gassy and they just like you know expand your lungs and destroy your lungs and then you'll get something like these that are kind of kind of subtle like you know the Terps are very very subtle in there but they these always have more Terps in my opinion compared to these live residents from ste I like the the ones from Suzie honestly they're just like very very smooth and they're not too harsh on your throat like I said like I could let you guys saw me take a blinker and just take it like a champ right okay as opposed to this when I was coughing like a little bit after like these are a lot smoother the live resin is they give you the full entourage effect so the highest completely completely different guys all right and that's what I'm gonna touch base next after after the flavor profile so yeah this is like a more plant-based you you're not really getting too much Terps it's more of just getting you the full entourage effect and what that does is basically give you a full spectrum hot alright guys as put to this this one it's just the flavor puffs on this is just turquoise tantrum and likey there's nothing else to say about it I mean not this specific regarde in general you know they're known for being gassy for being therapy and yeah man so flavor-wise I do like the raw garden a lot more so next up on the list though like I was saying we're gonna go based on the highest and I know I'm not I'm not basing the highs as a right now I'm just basing the overall highs that I've had in the my past experiences and I'm gonna just let you guys give you guys the full rundown all right so with with the Stacey live resident I do get the full entourage effect all right which is basically I do feel like very very soothing it's a very very soothing high man and it's not if you take a blinker you're not gonna really feel that high right away it's a high that progresses so every single time that you take a hit you're gonna get more and more high and it's not really a very very rapid high at least for my personal experience is it is a slow high but once you reach that peak level it's a very very enjoyable high as opposed to the raw garden where I feel like this one man you it's just in your face it's just very very in your face but the thing is it doesn't it's like quick it's a quick high you get me so you'll take a hit of this you'll take a blinker hit of this so you get a very very stone you'll feel like like oh my gosh dude like I'm stoned right and it'll last at least for me it'll last for like 20 minutes at most and you know I feel like I have to take another hit to get that high again and it's just not it's not it's not a soothing high as opposed to that how this dizzy is right this one is just like I said like I was saying it's very in-your-face and it's a very being rushed high so you just like you just like oh my gosh you're like I'm a high like I'm super babe and then um you don't really get a chance to just chill out in my opinion you know it's a very very like dude like I'm afraid and I have to get like you know experienced the highest opposed to this one you could just sit down and chill and enjoy the full effects of the plant and how it's supposed to be soothing you which is really really weird man it really goes to show you know the different types how different types of live resin waxes things like that affect your body affect your mind and things like that so take it from take it from my point of view guys you know give different things to try don't just be stuck on one product because you enjoy that hi you know there's you'll probably find something else that you might like a little bit more you know so I think the only thing we we talked a lot right now but I think it's tough to get nice and baked so Cheers [Music] like I'm super bagel I was saying in the beginning of the video I made I want to say it was at least that eight to ten minute video guys for you guys and it it was going so good in my opinion who is it was really really good but I'd like this one's probably gonna come out a lot better just because I picked out my flaws on the last one so this one was just kind of just donating rolling rolling rolling but yeah that kind of pissed me off a little bit but we're already started so really couldn't be too pissed off but I'm just enjoying it I'm enjoying doing these videos for you guys I love the support that you guys have been showing to me man if you haven't already what are you doing man go ahead and hit that subscribe button it supports me more than you think alright guys so let's go in on this raw garden hit next Cheers [Music] therapy super therapy we tell you guys like the flavor profile from the raw garden is just completely different from this dizzy man and I feel like that's what that's what's gonna really make this decision hard is the fact that I feel like these two even though they're both like resin I just feel like they're two completely different things you get me like right here we got a very chirpy pen that's just a very very completely different high right here is something that's very very subtle but it gets you it's a very very soothing high and yours you're getting the full flavor profile from the plant as opposed to this one I mean I don't know I don't know it's like you get me if I smoke the plant well it will it give me the same high is what I'm trying to say it's like I don't feel like I'm gonna get the same high but I like with if I smoke the plant from this but if I were to smoke the plant from this I feel like it would be around the same high you know and it's kind of something that that I don't know if that just kind of brought it to my attention is the fact that you know and why how much can the highs really change from the bud look at that bud state to the wax date you know and it's very very crazy man they're very very crazy guys so I'm gonna be honest with you guys I am NOT gonna be able to decide who's gonna be the winner because like I was saying there are two different completely products and I'm gonna need your help for this one guys all right so let me know in the comments below I want every single person watching this video to comment down below if you've tried these products which one do you think is better and would like tell me why tell me why do you think they're all arms are better tell me why you think this dizzy is better right I want to know your opinions I want to make this interactive video and hopefully you guys are down for it so because I can't really choose I'm gonna need your help on be 100% honest right so I'm gonna drop this video today and you guys are gonna we figure out which is better than what so without further ado I'm gonna end out the video go upload this and so you guys have something to watch alright guys hope you guys have a blessed day don't forget to leave a like comment and subscribe and we'll catch you guys on the next one we practice is a great function on the ground buddy know cuz I've been super buddy I'm some to the runaround are you sending me are you coming now cuz I'm post on", "OPQsOwH5jeM": "ny Li cannabis come in with a cartridge review from juice house and a diamond baron collab this pen is a HTE saucepan meaning high Terp extract the package says juice house and the diamond baron combines triple distilled cannabis oil with the cleanest live resin and from what I know the Terps sauce is one of the most potent and flavorful ways of consuming and extract the fact that they have put into a pen is great from the first pull on the pen my thought was this is so flavorful and tastes just like a dab the potency of this product passes any other card I have tried so far one nice pull will keep you going for a little while this is definitely the most flavorful and potent pen I've tried only downside is the product seems to go a little faster than I would have thought but that's probably due to the fact that they use no additives and is all straight Terp sauce", "tEsMD-d72_g": "hmm so hopefully this is centered guys but what's going on YouTube today guys I just wanted to make a quick little video because honestly it's been a long day so I'm not really like in the spirits to make a video but I do want to make a video you know I want to have a video made for you guys tomorrow because I've been keeping it consistent so this is my attempt to making a video on a lazy day well even though it's been productive so into the introduction to the video topic today guys I'll be showing you guys my favorite baddie battery baddie for short [ __ ] and then we're gonna be show it we're gonna be going into higher def of the Alpine live resin cartridges we're gonna be hitting both the gorilla glue number 4 and the true OG it's just gonna be a chill sesh imma be telling you guys what I like about these products and why I choose the stick it was battery over other batteries because as you guys know I have had the opportunity to try so many batteries as of late and they've been great there's been a lot of great ones there's been a lot of bad ones so I want to tell you guys why I choose this one over the other ones that I've tried so far so since it is already gonna be night time I'm gonna go ahead and hit this with the indica first I shot my head with the hybrid first gorilla glue number four and then we're gonna go straight into the true orgy right after we're gonna had a piece of lint in my freaking mouth so right here guys you got the girl the glue number four not sure if that's focused in or not but gorilla glue number four and got the battery fully charged dude so go ahead and screw that on here and man it's kind of hot it's it's spring time already yeah like I think it officially hit spring and it's starting to get hot the worm is starting to kick in man and it's finally not cold which is cool you know even though I enjoyed the cold I definitely didn't enjoy the days that it was so so freezing to the point where I had to be covered in two blankets but if you guys are 18 you know where 21 over make sure you guys are hitting this along with me let me know what you guys are hitting in the comments below man it has been a long day my mind it's kind of like scattered right now like I said I didn't I wasn't going to make a video but here I am for you guys the dedication and consistency so whose battery my resident Alpine gorilla glue number four cheers boys ooh there's so amazing about Alpine vapora has to have by far the best gorilla glue number four in the world dude they nail it to the point to the point and for sure so when taking another hit and then I'm probably gonna [ __ ] do you know I'm probably gonna just turn the air on for a little bit oh sure I just cracked the window it is a beautiful little day-out pledge crack the window a little bit this one too and we're gonna take another hit and I'm gonna tell you guys why I like this battery more than any other battery that I've tried so far so I'm actually packing it closes because there's people playing music and I don't want their music to overlap mine so just gonna have to stick with the air on us can barely hear anyways man that is amazing right already starting to sweat man these summer days these spring and summer days are so amazing it's definitely one of my favorite seasons to smoke in by far I do not enjoy any other season than summer scene the smoking like just being able to enjoy smoking at any place like outside especially dude that was the biggest hurt of the winter and the cold season I was not being able to smoke outside so onto the importance of this battery man so this battery it costed me I think 15 bucks I bought this myself this isn't sponsored at all by use this was a hundred percent me I went to go buy to smoke shop when I was waiting on some other batteries survive and they didn't arrive on time and I had some product knowledge like you know what I dude I'm just even go out and buy a battery because I want to hurry up and try this so I never go into my local smoke shop and they had this battery and it really stood out because I have seen I had seen him around but I thought they were just cheapy batteries and then honestly this was this was the best quality one at that smoke shop and then I was like you know whatever just give it to me give it to me 15 bucks isn't too bad so I bought it and when I opened yeah I was like I was like oh wow like it wasn't as cheap as I thought it was gonna be so I looked in like I got it looked into it and then the material is very very nice the finish is the kind of has like a matte finish they have different colors obviously I just chose the green because it was the best one that they had and one thing that I like about this the first thing that really caught my attention was the variable wattage is on the bottom the turn knob so for $15 the fact that you're getting variable wattage with a turn knob is amazing dude bad batteries out here charging literally 25 to 30 dollars for something like this and they're ugly they're fat batteries and this one is just so thin and so like clean looking and nice and it goes up um it's from 3.3 volts all the way up to four point eight so that's pretty nice who is you really did a good job man they have the little holes right here that you could put any cartridge on this no air flow airflow restriction will be added on so like I said man this this is a very very nice battery and this is why I like it over other ones because you could fit anyone it's stealthy light not like the other ones you know it's nice having it's nice having the other batteries that you can do cool stuff like the preheat function but when do you honestly need a pre heat engine if you're using a cartridge you should always have it upside upside no matter what or else you are already like not taking care of your cartridges because you as if you do know you're not supposed to be having them upside down because you're losing oil so girl Lagoon report amazing dude it gives you such a heavy and nice high actually not even heavy just such a nice high the the notes on it is very very piney very very like a little bit hint of citrusy but more of the piney scent and it's very amazing if you guys don't know gorilla glue number four is my favorite strain by far so we're hopping into the true OG a heavy indica right here oh gee for sure so slapping on the battery and then the for the Alpine you're supposed to be hitting them at 3.7 I'm hitting at this one a 3.8 even because that's where the little dot is that and we're going to turn off the air and then when they see what kind of how massive hits we get at this so true oh gee live resin here we go boys Cheers Oh yup I don't know about you guys but obviously every og is an OG for a reason right so but I don't know if this is just me but or if you guys can tell me but I taste in every og I taste this kind of a similarity which is weird because I've tried strains that are like have the same strain specific strain in it and it tastes different you know you can barely or you can barely even taste it so the fact that they can consistently get this flavor across although g-strings for me personally is pretty crazy but true OG definitely a heavy hitter man whoa just those little hits right there you got me free a super hit highs right off the bat it's a little bit more of a dirty or high for me I like the girl igloo number four it's perfect for me true og is definitely like yeah an indica a nighttime because I'm already feeling down luckily I'm not gonna drive after this I'm just be chillin at the skate park right now for a couple hours go to and then after that just go to Target get some waters go home get ready for work tomorrow continue the grind that continuous grind guys actually have homework to do tonight so we're gonna be doing that also so grind it all the time so cheers boys this is for the people out there working hard every day to make [ __ ] happen I got the water man stay hydrated all the time I've really been taking health until like into more of like way bigger dude way bigger I've been enjoying it a lot more I've even thought about getting into bodybuilding because I've kind of been getting bored of just going and lifting weights just to look good you know I kind of want to challenge myself and do something so I might be getting into bodybuilding I'll see what the world like how hard it is because I already have a hard lifestyle as it is so but that would be pretty fun I mean I'm six foot one six foot two whatever I don't know double check that but six foot two I currently weigh 210 and I want to be honestly at a solid 190 so but just really lean muscle so we're almost there I've definitely definitely been seeing the results like coming in and it makes me happy no consistency is key guys so we're going to take this last hit and we're gonna finish the video because I'm already faded off my ass and then so cheers boys hi I'm not gonna let it go I'm gonna talk over it so I hope you guys enjoyed the video I hope you guys make sure to leave a like comment a sub don't forget to share with your friends do all that good jazz you know we keeping the positivity keeping the content coming the consistency every

description below you guys have an absolutely wonderful day and if you make it up the Pacific Northwest make sure you try one of these kin of clouds cartridges brought to you by dab X out of Oak Harbor Washington you guys have a wonderful day thanks so much for tuning in we'll see you next time this has been John I'm just a tea connoisseurs piece", "BL60ox4I_Kw": "[Music] ladies and gentlemen it is time it is time that you found out if the new cartridge brand that you purchased is a real company or just a package supplier [Music] so this information comes to us through DAP connection comm none of these are of my own investigation unfortunately so thanks to those guys who have no idea I'm doing this so forgive me and I thought it would have been a good idea it was too good of information and just kind of let go and doing my research on these guys that seems like it's pretty legit info but before we get started consider subscribing and punch that like button in the face if you end up staying or half of the video at least so that a deal deal okay so I'm not sure exactly how to do this [Music] you know what I'm just gonna the bran heads roll well I do a little ranting stay hydrated look I'll tell you right now that I've tried spotting faked packaging and it's always like the Mandela effect sometimes you're just like one comma away from being right and one comma is too big to risk a dead cart so I'm happy that these social medias are getting ahold of testing and sharing the information that we need plus a lot of companies are putting QR codes on packaging as well so you can see that they're legit also most legit dispensaries are posting QR codes of their license so you can check to see if those legit yourself as well the bottom line here is that anyone can make counterfeit carts anyone can make counterfeit packaging it's our moral compass that's the problem why are we gonna be lured in to buy something just because there's like a cute 4/20 nurse in front of us and we don't want to look poor there needs to be a change in the system to help professionals and everyday users identify and trust the brands no one seems to own these packaging companies like Mario karts or dank vapes the trail always seems to end somewhere in China it's too bad because there's a lot of great growers out there who make top-quality stuff if you want to feel safe and you want to be able to trust your purchase then I wouldn't buy from anywhere that isn't regulated I'm seeing way too many people unaware of information that's out there I seen the comes below that people just want to learn and grow and then comes another person it makes fun of them for how little they know this is a time for justice a time for parler everyone should be on the same level of information when it comes to legitimacy so as a bonus I'm gonna show you a few brands that pass testing now I'm not here to say that any of these are safe but they did pass phase 3 testing so do your research and what I mean by research is you know go to the brands website they should have authorized retailer on there and is that place that you got your cart from is it on their authorized retailer list and if not email them or message them on IG you know that's what I did with this cart you know this is a the Jade cart and you know I asked them if you know I got it from ie twin palms and the Inland Empire it's it's definitely a little cheap place to go but you know I mean I'm just that places license you know Jade Jade is licensed too so it's just like I mean everything's everything smells like like like a legit brand you know so plus these insights that display test results helps as well but what if research on your particular brand hasn't been posted yet just because it's a new brand doesn't mean that it's not legit you're gonna start seeing new brands popping up in the next few years a lot of older dealers are gonna start going legit with newly formulated newly tested and labeled content I want to make a video on what to look for when you visit these regulated dispensaries I'll have one coming soon but until then I hope this video was helpful things seem to be getting bitter and more ways for anti counterfeiting is on its way like share subscribe for more videos like this and as always stay safe do research and never babe underage peace", "G1VQlA7A9R8": "what is up YouTube family boy Vasquez here gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys those who are new here I really appreciate you guys for subscribing to the channel and those who've been here you guys are awesome you know I really appreciate you guys taking the time out your day and watching my videos you guys are the MVP for that and if you guys have any questions and think about it you know you guys just want to talk [ __ ] you know I'll reply to you you guys know could probably be friends you know just comment down in the comment section and yeah guys but let me know what you guys been up to it is Sunday afternoon I'm just kicking back today you know I'm gonna be chilling at home so yeah guys if you guys have any good shows on Netflix let me know as well but today we have a special cartridge that like I've never thought to be honest when king pen came out they're really really popular but now they have a live resin like they kind of fell off you know cuz there was a lot of fakes and there was just I don't know they were just bad you know a lot of people they really liked kingpin but there are pretty good cartridges but you know I assume that they came out with the life resin line so I definitely had to go down to the shop and pick them up now they're half grams so I don't know if they have full grams yet but the packaging on these are [ __ ] amazing like you know it's like a ten by the tin box you know so it's really cool but yeah it's a half gram I've got it for like 30 bucks so let me give you guys a close-up on the on the packaging on the back the THC level is like sixty it's 61 percent guys so it's not as high so I mean the taste should be spot-on you know life residence should be always be good but you know kingpin a really shocked me when they came out with the light resin you know I was like what the hell because I thought pink paint just you know was regular distillate which it is but I don't know it was kind of weird seeing they came out with some light red and so some people had said you know to go check it out and they're pretty good so we're about to find out right now so the manufacturing date was January so it's a pretty fresh cartridge still I had paid $30 for a half gram so it should be good you know cuz the full grams gonna be like 60 bucks so you have this little sticker on the bottom and I grab the biscotti flavor because that's the one that stood out the most so we're gonna open it so has a little sticker in there where you can fi your product and [ __ ] like that and we're going to spill it damn it's really excited you nod I thought King pin fell off you know a lot of people don't really [ __ ] with king pin because there was a lot of fakes and they were just I don't know some people said they weren't good but to me they're a pretty good cartridges I really liked them a lot so the pill the little stick off I'm just gonna open the little thing [ __ ] here we have this little thing that came out pretty sure it's just like information you know it says the counterfeit the counterfeit prevention program ensures your product is authentic using a kingpin iZON it's the website where you can go check to make sure that you think is authentic your cartridge I should say which is pretty dope you know and yeah you guys can give you guys a little close-up on it it's cuz kingpin there was a lot of fakes and telling you the streets were flooded with kingpin a lot of black market and I'm pretty sure you guys know appreciate guys I've gotten one before so I personally have gotten a fake one before and it wasn't as good so this one has a little digit code on the on the little sticker we just ripped and you just type that up in little computer and you know it shows that you have an authentic pen which is pretty dope you know just to make sure so we're gonna go ahead and open this up and bam that is [ __ ] sick right there tell me now that is not dope right there guys that is like fancy packaging right there I've never seen a cartridge that came pretty sick like that you know it looks like something something that it looks like something expensive you know what I mean so that looks pretty good right there that's the first indicator which this is gonna be good so we're going ahead and take that out and there's nothing else so I'm gonna keep the uh I'm gonna keep this little box you know can probably put some doozies in it I'm in a couple joints you know take this [ __ ] off but this is what you guys came to look for so it's nice to man I'm also keep that it says kingpin on it and and on the back says made with a hundred percent recycled plastic which is pretty cool you know they feel kind of different which is pretty cool so we're gonna take that off I'm really excited about how they're getting the look and how they're gonna taste so I don't really expecting pet to come out with a light resin lines BAM that you have it guys it looks kind of little darker couldn't a live resin so we're gonna take these little rubber caps off and it says royal on it so I think it's like a collab with Roy I think it's like a different company because I seen a had royal on it so I didn't have kingpin so I'm pretty sure it's like a collab which is pretty dope and I was about time kingpin did something you know to come back but and they came back good with some live resin cards which is not bad you know and we're you guys close up and I'm going to flip it over and see if it's some nice thick oil this is a nice little day in there which is the half gram you know I'm pretty sure the coil absorbs some of it and it does not move at all guys and we're going to dry hit this yeah it's pretty weird cuz on the thing it doesn't say kingpin it just says row as you guys can see but I mean I don't care so we're gonna going that dry hit this and I'm going to see there's some flavors if I get some flavors off it this one's a biscotti so a biscotti is like how can I say to me a biscotti is like a cookie a cookie cross with something I'm not sure how it is if you guys are familiar with the biscotti straight let me know in the comment section below would really appreciate that I mean I smoked it before but I'm just like I said I'm not familiar with the cross it so you guys know and I'm not gonna lie to you guys this thing tastes like a cookie you can get you to get that nice clean Wow it's it's amazing guys it tastes like a cookie honestly if you guys ever had the the strain cookies exactly it tastes exactly like it so I'm really excited about that and I think we're gonna go ahead and hit it out of the yo can okay if you guys have if you guys are ever looking for a battery you know I'm not you know then there's sponsor me or nothing but you guys ever looking for a battery get a yo can you know order on their website or just go to the smoke shop any smokes just have it this shit's a [ __ ] [ __ ] beast you know I've dropped it in water it dropped so many times open beers within it still works you know it comes with a little magnet you just screw on bottom of the cartridge so we're going to do that I'm really excited man cuz it was about time [ __ ] kingpin came out with light resin which I've never thought they would you know I thought they would just stick to their normal distillate so here it is we got their magnet on there so make sure the battery's charged guys and let me know what you guys up to on this Sunday afternoon what kind of cartridges you guys smoking on and always don't forget to let me know in the comment section what kind of videos you guys would like to see as well so I know you know what what you bring out for you guys you know because there's times where honestly I go to the dispensary and I don't know what's a good cuz I don't like getting the same cartridges I mean I would but you know I like bringing out a new concept for you guys but if you guys would like to see some new some some of the different I mean some of this same cartridges are over and over just let me know you know I'll do it but yeah guys if you guys are smug along with me go ahead and do so we're about to get high so I'm going to drop this in and I'm gonna drop it in in the battery BAM so cheers guys if you got to smoke along with me go ahead and do so yeah really excited man hopefully hopefully it tastes good right like [ __ ] wow wow wow I'm not lying to you guys this [ __ ] is fired for kingpin a dual life resin honestly I thought it was a joke I thought it was gonna be as good because you know kingpin literally either solis people to come out with live resin and this [ __ ] tastes good it kind of tastes exactly like a raw garden but more of a Terp flavor in there like a strange Pacific flavor like this one's a biscotti and you really really get that cookie flavor him you know that earthy cookie flavor in this fire wow it tastes really good I'm going to hit it longer to see if it like chokes me a little bit so I can get high now I can explain to you guys how the high is it's just making me drool damn yeah this shit's fire guys I'm not you know I smoked a lot of cartridges since ever since I've been smoking I smoked a lot of cartridges before I ran through a lot of them and this this has to be one of the best life raisin cartridges I've tried i'ma have to compare it with the raw garden one day man this shit's fire it tastes exactly like would it like the strain if you guys had a biscotti it tastes exactly like cookie it's like fresh earthy clean taste - it's so good now the high you get a nice good of buzz you know I'm feeling good already I've smoked it in the morning I smoked a blunt but I kind of sobered up so that's why you know I decided to do the review so I can explain the high man but I feel good you know afraid for being 61 percent THC it's not a lot but it it also depends on the strain you know you also get different effects the THC level doesn't always got to be high to get a good feeling you know what I mean that's what a lot of people don't know cuz just cuz you hear it 90 or 80 percent doesn't mean all I'm gonna get high as [ __ ] it's not like that you know well some people it kind of is but to me like some strict like the strains you know they all got their own high so whether it's 60 80 per se you know just gonna is gonna get any hot so I'm feeling good right now you know I'm getting a nice little buzz so I'm going to hit it again just to you know the cartridge tastes good it tastes so good I can probably smoke it in one sitting but I'm gonna try and save it a little bit for the weekend so I'm going to hit it again before I take off gotta go to the store man I'm we're stuck I already booked and these things are so big if you guys ever see the kingpin man you guys you guys got to give him another try if you guys said [ __ ] kingpin before this is the time to give him another try man this [ __ ] tastes so good I'm not lying to you guys they had like four different kinds of flavors but like I said the biscotti ones the one that standard out the most so it is really good you know you get that nice cookie taste to it so do you guys ever see these you guys got a copper you know they're $30.00 1/2 gram right here in California in Modesto California that's where I'm from so I don't know they're probably gonna be twice as much over there from where you guys are from but over here at medical and recreational prices are the same so so yeah guys I really appreciate guys appreciate you guys watching my video and you guys stay tuned for more guys and uh hope you guys stay safe don't do no dumb [ __ ] and yeah just like and comment on the videos and don't forget to let me know what kind of videos you guys would like to see and you guys have a good day guys", "xkB4784SOOM": "hey what's good everybody jay ping here checking in respectmyregion.com here today to do a quick taste test live resin vape review featuring the pineapple muffin live resin vape cart from orchid essentials so this is their gold live resin product line cartridge by pure tech project vapors are the world's first cannabis cartridges emissions tested at afner standards the highest standards in the world puretech ceramic is higher quality than competitors and offers superior flavor and user experience the pineapple muffin so we're gonna check this out i'm pretty excited because i've never had this brand before i was just introduced to it recently so it's gonna be just quite an experience so let's dive in shall we interesting enough i've been having trouble getting into some of the boxes oh there we go okay here we go so easy slide up nice big cartridge here check that out that's the oil and then just gonna twist it on to the battery that i have there they do have a custom nice powerful battery over here and then five four three two one you guys know the rules one hit wow off to the races with that one man that is delicious you've got this beautiful gold live resin inside there i can tell that it's not disliked because of the consistency and there's like this film over um you know over the glass kind of like housing for for this device um let's see taste on that first hit absolutely phenomenal i won't sit here and say that it was extremely pineapple but it was sweet it was piney it was earthy spicy citrusy and i'm definitely energized after that first hitting so second hit there it is there it is you really get that pineapple on the second one okay so 84.6 thc point two percent cbd this is a half gram uh cannabis oil cart delicious manufactured uh what is that july 23rd 2020 score out of 10 for the taste i gotta give it a really high score i'm gonna give it a 9.5 i need to know the terpenes to know what's going on somewhere here change it up make it smaller bigger whatever you got to do i got to know the terps and that kind of lets me know what exactly it is that i'm tasting otherwise it's a perfect score 9.5 add the terps to the back i know what i'm tasting it can for sure uh kind of prove what i have going on in my mouth the high that i'm probably gonna experience bam taste test through and through for that really good um there was a slight metally taste but i believe that it's just because of this battery being as powerful as it as it is so that would be 0.25 for the terps and 0.25 for the battery if there could be something different maybe there should be but i don't know at this point really solid experience very impressed score out of 100 i've got a number in my head already 95 on the taste test the packaging a little tough um one second draw cartridge contains 75 servings cannabis oil distillate and terpenes so ingredients it says cannabis oil and then in parentheses it says distillate and then it says and terpenes so is this live resin or is this a distillate in terpenes i'm not sure let's check the other one it says the same thing we could have a labeling inconsistency here um because of that i gotta give it an eight out of ten because now i'm confused and this would definitely turn me off if i were buying it because now i don't know for sure what it is if they don't know what it is i don't know what it is but aside from that 95 on the flavor the effects the potency the product appeal all those things very high but there is a major packaging and presentation issue going on causing me to drop the overall score to an 80 out of 100 so definitely be sure to tune in uh for more taste test reviews big shout out to orca you guys have a really solid item here let's figure out the packaging and get the numbers up and help the consumers understand what's going on at a higher level so they can trust what's going on here i really appreciate everybody for all the love and support be sure to

dispenser you always has 30% off like the cells everyday so it's pretty it's pretty packed you know when they have like a 30% off at the dispenser so this I seen these around before the sublime cartridges I don't know if you guys have seen them before they're like they're out of Oakland California it's like I'm like an hour and a half away from Oakland which is pretty cool you know so these are pretty these are pretty cool I had a get one they're called sublime I'm pretty sure you guys I see them around I don't know if they're popular or not or if they're fakes or whatever but you know these are pretty cool they're uh these are new boxes like if you go on their website on the Instagram I should say learn new boxes that post it on a post about them that you know they have any boxes and whatnot so how did it get this cartridge cuz it's a Sour Diesel you know all the cartridges I've tried I've never had a Sour Diesel before so I was like I've definitely got to get it and this is a hybrid sativa hybrid so I'm really really interested in it so on the back it says ingredients premium cannabis oil with terpenes in this so hopefully it's pretty good now the price on these guys

just pulled it and it should come right out like that so the box is pretty neat as you guys can see has a little artwork on the side it says reel reel on it and so the cartridge itself guys is [ __ ] amazing as you guys can see the top it's like a round it's like a dang babe cartridge sorta way you know like the top is round it's not like a like a seashell cartridge I should say which is pretty cool because I liked those round tips you know they it makes the cartridge more appealing so we're gonna go ahead and take the cartridge out and yeah at least these things look pretty damn me the cartridge look fancy so we're gonna take this little rubber thing off and yeah this is like a ding babe you know it has like that round tip like I said I really like those kinds of cartridges that have it they just make it more appealing like I said and and this was a Sour Diesel so it's a sativa and we're gonna take it off we're gonna got to do the bow test flip it around my nose our little chalk excuse me good nervous and just like chew my nose I don't know it's just when I was kicking him so pretty thick oil and I've never had one of these before so I'm really really interested in them already got another dry hit it I'm gonna get a little sip of my iced coffee real quick then me uh I'm go ahead and dry hit this um see if I get some flavors off it I always do this should I try to hit it but the [ __ ] I've always forgot to get the rubber seal off so now we can try it now first of all you do get like a little citrusy taste to it but I'm gonna be honest it's not like a live resin tastes like a clean it's like a like a fake fake taste which I don't really care I mean it doesn't taste that bad it you do get like a little lemony taste to it so we're gonna gonna get my battery I have my yo cat with me today badi is one of the so it's pretty good battery I'm not gonna lie you know I'm not promoting nothing like that but it's just a really good battery itself you know it lasts is a [ __ ] a while so you guys like to vape along all day in [ __ ] you should get definitely get one of these your calves you know they're pretty they're pretty cool for the price of like three blokes so it comes with the little magnet you just screw it on the bottom like that and let me know what you guys smoking on a get smoking are karcher smoking some weed while watching my video really I'm curious about that and I like to know what my subscribers of smoking on smoking some dank or what but yeah guys I got the little magnet screwed on there and it's on so where did I just drop it in

dispensary so it should should be good right if it's from the decision we're gonna see Cheers Wow first of all guys you really really get a piney taste to it like if it would be like a jack rare well this thing really surprises me it tastes like sort of like a dizzy like honestly it tastes better than this dizzy for for being a sativa hybrid Sour Diesel I'll definitely I'm probably gonna go back and buy like two more of these [ __ ] that's how good it is I'm not over exaggerating on the flavor nothing but to be honest for twenty-five dollars a gram guys this is a bang for your buck right here these sub-sub line they had a dad like done' you have like ducting three flavors or four it only have like a sativa stiva hybrid indica indictor hybrid or just straight in dicta you know and those are only like four strains so it's not like they have a [ __ ] or sativas but they only have the specific sativa hybrid one and the how to get it's a Sour Diesel and you guys know I love my sativas you know and its really good the flavor too it's like it's not nothing fake it tastes pretty good like some natural terpenes in there I'm going to hit it again and see if I can get a good profile flavor profile for you guys wow this thing tastes really really limiting doesn't it taste like like some fake Terps you know like a fake cartridge with taste like but this thing is [ __ ] great this thing's bomb you can still like you can taste lemon in your mouth still once you blow the big old clouds out but for the high the THC was like 70 80 80 70 % let me see 84% and these cartridges were made in October so they're pretty fresh cartridges guys and the high for my first high of the day I'm loaded already this is my waking big you know how to [ __ ] you get the V there goes like a smoke man but I'm gonna hit it again for I cut the little short I just love tasting up the vape you know it just tastes so good let me know how you guys if you guys do it the same you know you guys take a big hair hold it in try it out it's fire I like doing that you know you really really get the whole taste to it now these cartridges are they're not bad guys I thought they were gonna be like they were gonna be good as good as they are you know these things are [ __ ] fire if you guys ever see these you come across you guys go ahead and [ __ ] these I'm probably gonna buy some more but different flavors like an indica ii show you guys different flavors i have but for the quality on the oil and for the car to just solve look at that it's a pretty nice gold oh you know with the little round tip you don't really see those a lot and then these are [ __ ] nice $25 guys out the door and but yeah guys be sure to LIKE and subscribe and let me know which kind of cartridges did you guys like to see I also do like some roll a blunt smoke coupling with you guys know should I catch you guys just let me know in the comment section but yeah guys I hope you guys have a good day good rest of your day no don't get no [ __ ] be good and you guys stay tuned peace", "nxlld7RYbgk": "hi welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be reviewing the buddies liquid diamonds live resin cartridge strain on this one is sherbert or sherbet i don't i don't know not really sure if they spelled that wrong or what but buddies liquid diamonds live resins are pretty much my go-to card as of right now they're very good quality i would say like gold standard of quality for their price um you can get slightly better stuff but you're gonna end up paying part uh prices that i i wouldn't consider worth it anymore so these are a very good cartridge itself very good oil inside it's very consistent it's very terpy and has a good effect every single time so you know what you're getting so let's get into the packaging and then i will open it up try it out and we'll see what i think all right so here's the packaging up close as you can see i buy a lot of these they even give me a bulk buff for them um let's grab one of these out here i've taken the sticker off so you can see they put the price sticker over these so not too much being missed on these sides luckily so i'll toss that aside here so we got what are we looking at here it's 72.27 percent thc one point zero seven percent cannabidiol um seventy eight point five percent total cannabinoids in indica but um if you ask me straight names or indica steve doesn't need anything anymore with cross breeding we'll get the side information let you pause that and read it if you want to and then you have nothing on that side nothing on the bottom buddies logo on the top and then i love about these is you got the terp profile well at least top three so you can kind of know what you're going to be getting into some more info there the verification that rc number um i got this one because it has humulene in it i've been really looking for that but you'll find a lot of these that's not a good example but a lot of these are much more terpy let's see if i can find i've had these come up to 16 turks and it was just like ridiculous okay it's funny now i can't even find them so maybe they are average i would say six to nine percent terpenes for the distillates closer to uh like one to four percent there we go there's those are two so yeah this stuff's pretty terpy it's good stuff though i'll get to open it now all right let's get into it my vessel rolling around here pop it open here i don't remember what that says when i focus then you got that which just fell out but that's all right um you got the tube that it always comes in pretty sure it's upside down which will list a thc enabled cbd instead of cbg then card itself it's a very nice looking liquid live resin i found this stuff which i think is usual for live resin can occasionally be even like a little bit liquid at room temp flowing somewhat freely and stuff but i believe that just um was with the two that were extremely derpy like 12 to 14 percent so i always take the stickers off here i'll finish up later now let's pop it in excited to see what sherbet sherbet is like and right away that's just such a smooth hit the pool has like some nice resistance you get amazing vapor from it so i love that draw tip it's really pretty slick all right so i mean taste wise the last couple i had were about almost like double the terpene yeah terpene content so this one's kind of weak for me but really hard to pin down actually it's very neutral but um i would just say it's like it's it's vaguely vaguely sweet vaguely herbal that humiliating adds something i'm trying to describe it because humulin is what is in hops and beer so if you know that flavor that's what i'm getting from this you'll see a lot of this stuff you'll probably um if you want to look into terpenes ever you'll know that a lot of other foods and stuff have these terpenes so you can get an idea of what you're going to taste which is what i love about these carts they show you so yeah we're getting um cardio filling which is like kind of peppery it's almost the same amount with limonene so those are matching up with a kind of citrusy taste and then it's kind of complemented by like a a hoppy taste which i'm not a beer drinker and especially whenever i was it was nothing hoppy at all i do not like ips or anything so i'm not familiar with that i can't really like explain it well but that's what it would taste like if you know that so really really a good cart for thirty dollars i paid um thirty six dollars for recreational users i have my med card definitely recommend that i recommend at least trying it if you usually go for a distillate card or any other ones this is like my go-to so hope you enjoyed the video i'm going to be trying to get another one here because i picked up some distillate syringes and i'll be getting those once my ceramic cartridges come in so hope to see you then thanks for watching", "IR-IrBoR1QI": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive all right guys back here for another video and your boys out here in nature just chilling i decided to get out the house today guys like i wasn't i didn't really want to come out today just because you know sometimes guys work gets to you sometimes you're tired you just don't want to get out you just want to sit back look at some netflix and then do that same routine over again but you know what we're gonna stop that routine we're gonna we're gonna start getting on the vlogs on the daily guys and this is the start of something new so today guys you already know from the title your boys got a cresco i've been looking at these for so long and your boy has finally got one i was recommended these by someone one of my subscribers shout out to you i see your comments guys i don't remember your name but i see all of your guys's comments and some of them i do remember you guys name but there is a lot of names guys so we got the cresco it's a liquid live resin it's an endica guys it's tangerine kush uh liquid live resin so let me just tell you the thc percentage real quick hold on 76 thc guys that's what it's sitting at right now let me just open it up real quick because i can't hold this camera and open it at the same time okay guys i opened it up and it comes with a little pamphlet guys liquid live resin cartridge and on this pamphlet guys it tells you the experience that you're gonna um likely get in your um your cartridge the terpenes that are in there and as you can see guys there's a lot of different terpenes um that they use and [Applause] [Music] i'm honestly not a big fan of terpenes that come from actual plants like yeah i know it's just a plant and marijuana is the plan but like from other planets other than marijuana like i feel like you should be able to get your terpenes from the actual marijuana plant and put them back into the cartridge but they use terpenes from um all sorts of plants as you can see you know floral lavender earth bark pine herbal and then they have the um scientific names of set plants on there as you can see but it's a nice little thing they show you um but honestly guys [Music] i'm the type of person that i like mine derived from um from the actual cannabis more of a full spectrum cartridge you know what i'm saying that's actually just strictly from the bud you get terpenes from the butt because that's that's another way people make cards is they actually put the terpenes that are actually from that flower back into it so that's actually cool though that they show you what you have and for this cart let's see what kind of terpenes are in this cart it's a let me see it says m-y-r which is herbal and then it says tpe so it's a herbal pine kind of taste guys um [Music] like a herbal kind of like a tea i would say or something like herbal floral pine sort of flavor you know what i'm saying but that's definitely cool how they do it how they put um they label the terpenes from the actual plants but like i said i like those terpenes straight from the actual strain guys so let's check it out i'm gonna put it down so you guys can kind of get a close-up so you guys can see what it looks like feel me that's what it looks like guys it's like a nice dark color compared to raw garden because raw garden is redefined live resin and this is more of the natural live resin but they added terpenes i like this car guys because it's perfect it's a perfect circle guys for taking bong ribs guys so you could stick this in your bong bowl or whatever and it's like the perfect way to hit it so i like these tops but there are also tools out there that you can use for your vape to put into a bong and you can hit it nicely but i just every time i get a cart like this with a circle i always use it so boom your boys got the raw garden you already know what it is i got the raw garden on it when i ordered this um when i ordered this card it came with this lanyard and the lanyard goes onto the cart guys it's hella lit you guys probably seen me freaking use that all the time like i always use a lanyard for my cards usually in a lot of my older videos but i lost it so some of my videos i don't have it on me but i've always had one so i think it's hella dope that cresco is you know giving these out to give to customers and whatnot but before i try out this one let me try out the raw garden real quick like raw garden is super good but it's always like cool to switch it up guys try something new so check out cresco but you guys will see if i like it or not i'm unsure if i'm gonna like it because of the terpenes that derive from um different plants but it might be good i don't know it doesn't have much of a smell but that's a given because it's a live resin guys that's pretty much a given some live resins just don't have that smell a lot of distillates have more smell for me but hell yeah this is my view guys the sun is about to set so i got to get this vlog in for you guys hey y'all see what it is this is just a little half gram let's see what it tastes like [Music] i definitely can taste that earthy pine taste [Music] like i thought that this tangerine one would be more of a citrusy um terpene profile but they actually put like more of a pine taste but it's cool like it's cool it tastes more more on the side of a dab than on like um you know some concentrates actually taste super sweet and you could taste the limitiness and this is more on the side of just the pine dank ass dab concentrate type [ __ ] like just that earthy concentrate but it's not bad it honestly gives me kingpin vibes guys like it tastes very similar to kingpin but your boys out here you know what it is but yeah where i'm at guys right now a lot of people out here they throw these frisbees and there's these spots i'm not sure where they're at but you can like throw this frisbee into those spots like and it's cool like just watching them do that [Music] but we out here guys i hope everyone is vibing right now more vlogs coming soon i'm pretty much just gonna chill here smoke some more actually i'm gonna ride around smoke some more see what people's up to and then make it home make this vlog and try and edit and post it tonight this whole week guys i plan on dropping a vlog and the reason being is because next month i realized it will be my one year with this channel my one year mark and on that one year mark guys i at least want to be at 100 videos i want to i want y'all to have some videos so y'all can go look back on and go vibe to at any time some videos that you know you save for later and you freaking you want to go and watch it later and just vibe out with me because you already know i'm just here chilling with you guys i'm just love seeing all your comments and everything guys like so don't forget to like comment subscribe and i'll see you guys soon love you guys peace", "GGGW1xP3Uyg": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video and if you couldn't tell from the title this is overall garden video I mean got the sweater on as well and I got the cartridge as well and yeah like the title says this is basically like a video just letting you know that there are fakes when it comes to raw garden it's it's so stupid in the cannabis industry once you've been like once you become like an established company people are just trying to like make money off your name they're trying to sell fake products under your name and basically with your heart the hard work that you put in for your company is just easily easily used for another person's gain you know and that shit's not the business you know and we're gonna be talking about the fakes when it comes to raw garden I have a few pictures that was taken from raw Gardens Instagram let me just pull them up right here so I'll also be putting it on the screen right here so you can get a better look of what I'm gonna be talking about and another thing I'd like to mention is that I guess my packaging is a newer packaging so it's not gonna be I don't know like here's a thing with raw garden and with other companies that do the same they're gonna constantly keep updating their packaging because like I said people are onto their [ __ ] and they're they're gonna just keep you know they're gonna keep at it so you just got so we're gonna bring it up right here and right off the bat you can see that the font is different and actually the color is a lot different especially the the font on here it says like I'll post on the screen don't worry but basically you could tell from the font and where the positioning of the flower is I guess so right here I got the tray clip good I bought this from flavors I'll post it right here I mean they have it on their website as Walt rock garden if you go it on raw garden the raw garden up farm you can actually search up all the dispensaries that have it there legally so I bought mine at flavors as you can see right here all that good stuff let me just so I'm guessing that they had to update this because they just pulled over the QR code but I mean you can go and check all these I actually don't have a QR code like scanner oh I just download one real quick so we'll see this [Music] basically running the same but the numbers are a little bit different I mean it says right here eighty one point zero three zero five and then this one's eighteen point eight six so I mean you gonna have to take my word for it I bought it at flavors I do not have the receipt on me but if you didn't see that video previous from this I showed the receipt in there exactly not bad just gotta be careful with the raw garden you should go on their Instagram also to basically check out how to tell the real from fakes you know this is it right here very very clear stuff and yeah I mean I've been hitting this already and it tastes very very good it does not taste like it's some fake [ __ ] you know and you guys know me I've been I've been getting raw gardener for years now and honestly like I would know if I had a fake [Music] good stuff this is the chill battery very very good battery for itself for what but like I said check out the photos or the pictures that rawr and put on their Instagram yeah it's a little bit different actually it says four right here it actually has the percentages right here as well but I guess they switched up the new sticker so yeah I don't know they just keep changing a [ __ ] every time so at the end of the day like unless they update those pictures it's gonna be hard to tell you know because they gotta keep switching their packaging because each time they [ __ ] get settled in these [ __ ] people just trying to fake the cartridge fake the packaging and all that stuff another thing that I've noticed from the pictures is that that ever should be on its own column or its own row so the other ones they actually has no additives ever in one single line so that's another that's like the biggest difference that I can notice just by you know looking and scanning at the box ooh and if you guys haven't seen Shaka x4 20 video on the subject already please check it out it's a dope video I posted it online community posts so if you guys haven't checked that out already you should really check it out does good content similar to that of mine so you know if I don't upload you know I'm saying you got more other content creators to go and check out them you know so shout out to you Shaka X 420 shout out to you your boy should be some cool collabs if that were to ever happen but yeah I'm gonna take one more hit and we're probably gonna end the video here be careful with the roll of iron cartridge you know I like when they was first brought into my attention that raw barn has fakes or had fakes and stuff I was really like hesitant like I was like no I'm gonna copy raw garden you know because like I don't know I just I just didn't think that they would and sitting here now knowing what we know like anything can be copied it's crazy so if you're an upcoming like cannabis company [ __ ] I don't even know how to like avoid this you know maybe like some really intricate into your kids ass packaging that is alike cost a lot so therefore they wouldn't buy it because it costs a lot I don't know who knows but I'm gonna take a million hit for you guys and we're gonna call it a video and uh I just had plumbing service at my house and one of the plumbers actually watches my videos so whoever you were I forgot your name but it's a small ass world and it's crazy like he came up and he was like it simplistic you me what you do videos so I was pretty interesting but yeah shout-out to you thanks for doing a good job on our plumbing you know I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and we're probably gonna end the video here [Music] these are guys [Music] [Music] you", "TRemOATxyUQ": "[Music] welcome to the cartridge comparisons season 1 finale this also marks the end of season 1 of p2 peeps so season 2 starts real soon guys anyway instead of sorting these into tears like you know by their grades like i had planned i'm going to be giving out season awards the reason being is that the first few episodes of cartridge comparisons did not have a grading scale and since they didn't it wouldn't be fair trying to sort these out based on their grades if more than half the cards don't have any in the videos uh you know that that means i'd have to go back and try to grade them and it's kind of odd you know not grading them when i don't have the cards anymore so this is how we're going to do the awards there are three categories distillate cured and live resin and then all which is a combination of them cured and live resin are together only because the only cute resin cards i have had are the friendly farms cards and there's only two of them and it would not be fair to put those in a category of their own you know once again guys these these aren't all the cards that have popped up on the channel these are only the cards that have showed up in cartridge comparisons so these are the possible awards for distillates best distillate best taste most potent slash strong favorite high best deal and then two personal favorites for the live resin category best live resin best cured resin best taste most potent slash strong favorite high best deal and then also two personal favorites and then for the category of all of them there is only top three favorite flavor best taste and favorite high so yeah we're going to be summarizing a total of or not summarizing we're going to be looking at a total of eight episodes of cartridge comparisons and now these are the cards that we'll be showing up in this video raw garden space fox number two raw garden triangle cake raw garden raspberry punch americana black lime og old pal clementine chronic creek straw nana chronic creek ak-47 friendly farms oreo cream friendly farms gelato 41 himalaya vanilla sherbet liquid live resin buddies liquid diamonds live resin banjo buddies distilled oilable with cannabis derived terpenes legendoji and watermelon skittles or x watermelon skittles i should say sorry honey leaf northern lights and platinum vapes animal cookies so there you have it guys that's the list those were the awards and now we'll get right in to it so for best tasting distillate um i'm gonna have to actually go with a surprising pick here for some of y'all maybe the old pal clementine um compared to all the other cartridges it just had the deepest flavor you know it it really tasted a lot like an orange creamsicle and that was really really nice i really liked that so yeah best tasting went to goes to the old pal clementine congrats uh most potent slash most strong i am going to have to go with landon vapes animal cookies that was good stuff you know i'm not much of a sativa guy but that was definitely some strong stuff it was a little hard to uh think about it and you know looking back at the videos in my notes and trying to decipher you know trying to decide but i i definitely think that since it was hit it was hitting me harder and it's a sativa which is something i uh that's not my preferred kind of high so you know that's why i chose it for the most potent it's not strong i was feeling it a lot um now we're going to go on to favorite high um going with the buddies the buddies cart yep that one might have been uh you guys might have seen that one coming you guys know i really really enjoyed uh the buddies cartridges when i was reviewing them and when i had them on stream and yada yada it's just really good stuff one of my favorites uh best deal here i'd say is going to have to go to the americana black lime og it's about thirty dollars thirty five dollars per the gram and you know for that price point it's combination of taste potency is uh pretty good pretty good you know uh the only thing that would probably come a little bit cheaper would be the uh old pal clementine but uh you'd have to find a full-grain version and normally you you just find half gram versions so that might end up making a little bit over 30 if you you know we're shopping uh somewhere that you know had tax so yeah now we're going to get to my two personal favorites you know disregarding everything um you know all other categories and opinions and things like that uh i'm gonna have to say the old pal clementine and um the buddies cart you know i really like the platinum vape part but uh that old pal clementine cart just really shocked me at how flavorful it was so it really really stands out to me as uh one of the favorites there uh and yeah for overall best distillate you know i narrowed it down to uh the buddies cart platinum vapes cart and the honey leaf cart um didn't include the old pal in there just because uh i can't really call it best dislike overall if it's potency isn't up to up to par and the three ones i mentioned just now you know the buddies the platinum vapes and the honey leaf they're they're all pretty close in potency but i think uh best overall is i'm gonna have to give this one to the platinum vapes animal cookies you know combination of flavor potency and all that stuff guys i mean it was most potent and for best taste it came very very close very very close so yeah that's what we have for uh our distillate awards and now we'll be moving on to our next section [Music] real quick before i start the live resin awards i am going to be including raw garden in this section just because the live resin terpenes they use are pretty close pretty close to like actual live resin terpene flavor um and it's a lot farther ahead than i can say for select elites live resin terpene distilled oil line whatever it is so um that's why i will be including them only for this season finale in the live resin awards section so after this season you know in season two broadgarden will not be in the live residence section of awards so i just wanted to let you guys know that um and the reasoning behind why they're here in the live resin section and so now we have our live resin awards and uh we'll go down the list of what we have to choose from right raw garden space fox number two triangle cake and raspberry punch chronic creeks straw nana and ak-47 friendly farms oreo cream and gelato 41 himalayas vanilla sherbet buddies liquid diamonds banjo so those are the ones that we have to pick out for our you know our card comps awards here so we're gonna start off our awards like we did with the last one with the best taste and then most potent and strong then favorite high best deal two personal favorites and then we'll choose the best live resin and a best cured resin so for best taste uh this was a really hard choice i narrowed it down from the list to three choices the buddies banjo cart kart himalayas vanilla sherbert and uh friendly farms gelato41 and sorry i didn't mean three i mean four and the chronic creek straw nana um and after thinking about it a lot [Music] uh i i narrowed it down once again to the himalayas vanilla sherbert and then uh the friendly farms gelato 41 and you know i gotta i gotta choose i gotta choose the vanilla sherbet so this isn't necessarily what i liked the most right but um this is just i think the deepest flavor you know the the best taste of the strain you know what i mean and i'm not trying to knock away from any of the other cartridges here you know it was obviously a really hard choice but i really liked that kind of like fluffy vanilla pillowy flavor that you could get in that vanilla sherbet cart that was really really nice um yeah but you know the the friendly forms gelato 41 that that comes very very close second like that's that's like like a half step down maybe not even a half step like a a quarter of a step down so it was a really really tough choice for me but you know i have to look at both the videos like i said and uh the notes that i had and you know the vanilla sherbet definitely had better notes on it like a lot of a lot of things i guess well not a lot of things but yeah that's just how i determined it so sorry if it doesn't make sense so now we go on to most potent and most strong um i think this one i'm gonna have to give it to uh chronic creek actually their straw nana was really really nice i remember holding on to it for quite some time and i really enjoyed the flavor and all that stuff you know i thought it was a great deal um but yeah i think it got me when i'm looking at my notes um it definitely got me the most slumpy sleepy so uh you know there's that and now we'll move on to our favorite high i'm gonna go with the uh friendly farms oreo cream here now in my videos before i said that the oreo cream was tastier than the gelato 41 but uh thankfully i still have the two so i gave them a few goes and i definitely think that uh the oreo cream kind of it's not it's not it doesn't have more flavor but i did enjoy the high more so there there you have it that's my personal favorite high and uh out of the live and cured resin cards and for best deal i'm gonna have to go with the buddies liquid diamonds banjo so i know the chronic creek is the cheaper one out of all these here but i thought that the buddies liquid diamonds was a better deal because it had a better flavor and um you know it was it's a sativa high so i don't prefer it but it was very potent too so i you know i thoroughly enjoyed my time with that one and uh for about 50 50 bucks you know 50 55 bucks i think it was you know a little bit five bucks more than the chronic creek i still think that the buddies cart was a great deal so yeah i know my two personal favorites out of this bunch is probably i'd say the buddies liquid diamonds and i'll have to take the chronic creek ak-47 as two of my personal favorites there for best live resin and cured resin cart overall though i think i'd have to take that gelato 41. now i know i chose a bunch of different things everywhere down the line whatever but uh i think that the gelato 41 you know it was just a step below and in that flavor department and most potent in my head list it was at like around number three and in terms of best deal it's floating around the same price as everything else on the list outside of chronic creek and buddies so yeah that's my reasoning behind choosing that and now we have i guess what some people might call the most important category the overall category all of them the one that combines everything so we're gonna go ahead here and start with favorite flavor then best taste then favorite high and then we're gonna have a top three just chose we're just gonna choose it so my favorite flavor out of all of the cartridges in season one it might have to be the friendly farmer's gelato 41. now that buddy's banjo actually gets pretty close there same thing with the himalayas vanilla sherbet but i love gelato as a strain and it's my personal bias that's that's working in here right now and uh yeah so gotta gotta choose it gotta go with it so yeah that's my favorite flavor you know so now we go to best taste what tasted the best so there's a difference between favorite flavor and what tasted the best because what i mean best tasting i also more so mean depth of flavor and richness and things like that favorite flavor doesn't necessarily mean it is the best right so let's see the best flavor out of all these i'd have to choose the buddies liquid diamonds banjo it didn't win the award in the other category you know and where it was in the live resin but i think it is technically the best tasting you know everything like the vanilla sherbet from himalaya and the other friendly farms cards they come super super super close but i really like that lemony piney flavor from the banjo and i thought that it provided a nice depth of like it gave a really really nice deep derpy flavor um and not to say that the other ones didn't but i just tasted the banjo one a lot more so that's why i think this one's you know the banjo comes away with best taste um for favorite high out of all these cartridges this one might be a little bit surprising for y'all but i'm going with chronic creek straw and anna i really like straw nana as a strain and um you know this one kind of got me a little slumpy so i love that and now we're gonna choose our top three of season one and uh this will be in no particular order just you know just gonna choose uh we're gonna go ahead and stick our friendly farms gelato 41 up on there that's one top three in the top three there uh the buddy's banjo cartridge another one in there and finally himalayas vanilla sherbert yep i was going to put platinum vapes animal cookies but honestly the vanilla sherbert's flavor was just too good so it has to make it there and i have yet to get another himalaya and i've been searching for one so that's another thing that factors into the fact that i really really want to try another himalaya more than i want to try uh a platinum vapes and you know no not to platinum vapes because i still will be trying something else soon in the future yeah that should about wrap it up for uh the season one of cart comps the finale they were the awards all that stuff oh yeah thank you guys for watching i hope you enjoyed and i hope you guys are excited for season two of p2 peeps alright well don't forget to like comment subscribe and you know all that other stuff p2 out peace [Music] you", "S_PLcfNv_gg": "[Music] p2pt [Music] what is up y'all p2 peeps welcome to season 3 everybody and for our video here today we're gonna be checking out some himalaya super sour diesel for the most part i don't really like distillate stuff right but there are some good distillate brands out there and himalaya is for show one of those so i had their live resin first if for those of you who are veterans of the channel you guys know i did try out uh something a long time ago but before we go and more into that let's go ahead take a hit y'all thank you guys for joining me for season three and uh once again is that super sour diesel from himalaya vapor and i got that battery from him too right here so cheers up everybody hope you guys are enjoying your day or whatever time it may be when you're watching man cheers [Music] it's a tiny little hit there just because we want to get that flavor so a big thing about these this himalayan distillate cartridge so far is that flavor man on the box here it says terpene rich you know what i'm saying and this is for show terpene rich this tastes phenomenal like out of all the distillates i have had this definitely sets in the smoothest you know hits the smoothest and i'm not getting too much scratchiness from my throat there and it definitely has the most kind of like cannabis kind of taste if that's a word kind of busy but um you know it doesn't taste like artificial flavors or fruit or anything like that it just tastes like some really good terps like you know that you could probably you know find you know your normal flour and all that so that's that's what we're rocking with here man i know i didn't say the percentages but here we go we got 91 total active cannabinoids in this one so this cartridge for show can pack a punch so that's the good thing you know they're not really listing out that thc percentage which isn't a bad thing for me that's normally a good sign when i see cannabinoid percentage over thc percentage you know we all want that you know uh uh entourage effect you know full spectrum type of high and uh you gotta appreciate it with a product like this man so let's go ahead and take a blinker now and i'll talk more about what i'm tasting and [ __ ] so cheers everybody [Music] oh man now that hit packed a freaking punch man so this is a sativa strain not exactly one more like my favorites you know what i mean like uh sativa is not exactly what i prefer to smoke on but a super sour d is a classic and i am digging the flavors we're getting here pininess some sour there not it's not too crazy of a sour um i know sometimes when i try super sour diesel that limonene sticks out hella tough and it makes it taste a lot more lemony instead of like just regular kind of like like a sour tinge and that's what i'm getting here you know i'm not getting too much of a citrusy sour i'm just getting like a quick little undertones of it with a little tiny little bit of sweetness but mostly that gassy kind of piney flavor so that's it's good stuff man it's real good stuff okay so for those of you who are curious man we're working with about 431 milligrams thc 1.2 milligrams of cbd well that's that's all i can say about this you know the cartridge so far guys i like the flavor it is indeed terpene rich 91 total cannabinoids this thing will smack you and um you know it's just a smooth cartridge man unless you're taking a fat hit you're probably not gonna cough much off this one it's really smooth so we're gonna take one last hit here end off the video and i hope you all have been enjoying it and i hope y'all go check out some more himalaya products man they make great great stuff and be sure to watch out because guys let me go pull this out real quick we are going to have another himalaya product pop up soon this one is the blueberry muffin live resin cartridge i've been waiting a long time to open this one so thank you guys for watching let's take one more hit here and before i take this hit guys don't forget to like comment subscribe share the video whatever you want to do all that [ __ ] man but yeah thank you guys so much and [Music] cheers yes this [ __ ] is guys michelle so this has been p2 peeps and i hope you guys are going to be enjoying more content and things coming soon from me man so p2 out

we've got an exciting one for you today all right so a lot of you have asked me how can I get the oil out of my broken cartridge well if you've got an exotic card or a dead bank card or one of the many other cartridges that use this style of vaporizer cartridge I'm going to show you how to get the oil out of it first things first let's take it to the deck and introduce you to what we'll be working with all right so here we are first things first let me go over the utensils that we will be working with today this is a stand that I made myself to hold cartridges in while I filled in these are a couple of varieties of syringe that are available this particular style right here works adequately for filling and emptying most cartridges that you get on the market today specifically 1/2 gram cartridges and 1 gram cartridges this will generally empty most of those now this tip is a little short and as such I'm showing a few of the available sizes this is approximately 1/2 inch one inch and a one and a half inch tips right here in varying diameters for filling no next to it I have a 1/2 gram or 0.5 milliliter and a 1 gram or a 1 milliliter cartridge these are one-time use non reusable disposable cartridges these are also 0.5 milliliter or 1/2 gram and one milliliter or 1 gram these are refillable and reusable the mouthpiece screws off where these are a press fit and they have to be forcibly removed now these are the two styles that I recommend when you are replacing the oil into another cartridge as you will see the exotic cards uses a slightly different cartridge right there but I prefer when I'm refilling to go with a tried-and-true cartridge to ensure the failure does not happen again with that in mind the first thing we're going to look at is these tips now as you can see this is a one and a half inch tip right here this is an half inch tip right here no this is a half milliliter or 1/2 gram cartridge as you can see this tip would work adequately to recover just about all the oil in that cartridge very well in the 1 gram cartridge as you can see you would be able to recover most of the oil except for what is stuck around the chimney right there for that a longer syringe such as this is a much more adequate okay now that I've shown you a couple of the utensils let's get these cartridges open real quick and we can see what they look like all right here we are so this is a lemon berry Gang babes cartridge with a C cell with a pronounced THC of 90.9 9% here's a little bit of a close-up if you'd like to pause that to get a little bit of the idea of the flavor then this is a C cell cartridge right here just like it states C cell right there this one right here this I believe is an eye crusher cartridge and this is some fruity pebbles from exotic cars this has the hologram I'm right there and this is a hybrid this one here says it's been 80 and 85 all right okay and here we are now please bear with me this may take a minute for some of these I have found that on some of these cartridges this perfectly round tip right here does not always work and I have modified one slightly so that it is slightly oblong to fit down around that chimney a little bit and that's what I want to be using right now to ensure that I'm able to reach cover as much oil as I can I'll be working with this first one this is a fruity pebbles from exotic karts I believe this is an eye crusher cartridge what we're gonna do we're going to start off with just removing the lid it just twists off just like that right there you can see set that to the side now I have a custom-made stand right here that I tend to use to hold my cartridges when I'm filling them if it tends to stay pretty pretty good right there right and you're going to take your syringe and just insert it and start drawing up right as you can sort of these have both been warmed up a little bit to ensure that they do flow decently I definitely recommend that as you can see you want to try to get as far down into that that edge right near that hole right there as you can get and then lean that the cartridge as far away as you can and just try to recover every little bit that you can and don't don't be afraid to suck a little bit of air up in there I mean you really want to you want to be able to try to recover everything that you can there for sure all right there's a little bit there what I recommend you do at that stage is just set it on the side and let it gather on one on one side real quick heat that up a little bit let all that oil gather on that opposite side and then you can stick this back in there and and utilize it that way well this is warm I'm gonna put this into another cartridge real quick just to ensure that it flows pretty good like I said then just put this tip right down in there this is able to go actually down in there like this to recover oil from one of these are necessary and then all right there you go sit that put Leon that and remember this let these sit for a few minutes that then oil bubble down in his holes and if it's good and warm like this one is it'll get down to those holes no problem alright and that's basically how you do that one as you can see on this there's a little bit gathering down on that edge we'll just gather that up as much as we can right there and uh this here just set it right off to the side with the cap there and uh that's basically garbage now with the dank veins it's a little bit of a different different different ballgame here you've got to remove this mouthpiece this mouthpiece is a press fit on here it does not just come off so what you're gonna need to do you're gonna need to grab this with a pair of vise grips or a comparable pair of pliers and there you go alright pull that mouthpiece right off of there now we take our syringe we insert our syringe all the way down and get just down there see how far that went in and then we slowly start to draw that all out of there all right we want to put the syringe on the bottom edge and start drawing there we go he's just taking all that oil right out of there all the way down until there's almost nothing left in there she'll be able to empty that thing out completely alright and there you go that's basically one done unit that point you can get comparable unit exactly basically the same unit brand-new these cartridges can all be purchased at vape art smart comm there is a link in the description you simply take that cartridge you take that syringe you put it right in there just like you four set it right down near that inside down there just like that there's a fill up in there all right and there you go put the lid on that get that near the old vise press that in and WHAM bulb Lambo there you go let's get this back on top and I'll tell you guys how this works out alright folks well here we are back on top with the new cartridges we got the fruity pebbles crammed down into this bad chicken right here this is a refillable csail cartridge available in the description below at Bay Park smart dog on go ahead give them a click and I'll go check that out the syringes that I use also available at Bay Park smart dog but go down there give up click on that link in the description and go check them out we've got the lemon berry from dad baby sitting here on another non refillable press-fit sea cell cartridge those are also available at vape arts marcom click that link in the description if you're interested in those all right well let's strap this on this old battery and see what see what she is Susie it's like Shelly all right yeah yeah that's what I'm talking about all right well there you go you guys have an absolutely wonderful they think is so much for to me and I started to appreciate it if you learned something and you enjoyed it but like on the old thumbs up down there make sure you share this so other people can also benefit from the knowledge and you have an absolutely wonderful day thank you so much for tuning in this is John with CMC connoisseurs peace", "hdQt-Ej-2Ho": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentim420 this is a florida medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 and medical marijuana patients all right like say hi to everybody out there if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button down there leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know how you're feeling tonight what you're smoking on token on what you're moved in um so today we got the token tim's mad scientist lab we are going to be making some rosin vape carts on our own save a lot of money um i will like give a shout out real quick um i got some of that girl scout cookie now this stuff was only coming in at 15 it was minnie's i couldn't see that online um and i'm not a fan of girl scouts but this stuff totally changed my mind this stuff's real good um nice flavor to it nice high to it not quite a sativity ah as sativa leaning as the last stuff i've had that was the girl scout cookie so like i said not bad at all all right so we're gonna make our own rosin vape carts now you guys know i've tried true leaves i just went and got another one we got the skunk ape blue river rosin we tried both of them for cure leaf i left the other box in there from the select um some people was asking if this was live resin or not to me it didn't really taste like that tastes more like the terpene like the cannabis infused terpene vape pens exactly like them so if you could find those vape pens cheaper i'd go with them but we're going to show you a way to do it real cheap and i tell you what they taste amazing all right so we squirted a little distillate in there i got i was trying some of them i got a little tore up had to take a break my water cooled off so it didn't work so this is take two on the video honestly um that's that papaya cake rosin from move or from true leave sorry um in there and then the distillate we're using because it's an indica uh the indica uh bubba kush coming at 78 percent so all i did was microwave some water and a shot glass put it in there you don't want to get it up past the stopper there you don't want to get back in there i want to get this part done before it cools off again so there was probably about three left in here on this syringe it's got a little bubble but it was about at three i put a little bit in there already so when it's warmed up it's just gonna go real easy in there yeah i guess we're gonna use all of it all right that's all of it are all that we're gonna mess with getting out at the moment now if you notice the pad i'm using is that five dollar baking sheet which is silicone so it's the same thing as a dab mat that i got on amazon it was like five bucks or two for five i can't remember videos if you go back as while back i just cut a piece off to fit the table so i didn't have to clean the whole table off so now all we're going to do is we're going to take this and we're going to mix it up now i have made a few of these before i did warm the rosin up on the one and then by time i got out here it was just kind of like a hardened back up more like a caramel just letting it sit out at room temperature seems to work better let me pull it off the view for a second and make sure i got it mixed evenly sometimes the distillate wants to stay on the side but as you know the rosin carts are about 60 bucks apiece and they're only half grams so this distillate i believe was 60 bucks from grow healthy which truly has them for 60 most everybody's around the 60 mark for a full gram so this right here will fill two vape carts um and then the rosin's uh 75 gram so you basically for 135 you're getting two grams um which you would only get one gram buying it by the vape cards like i said these are half gram vape carbs these aren't full grams only half grams if you also notice on true leaves the thc is always really low i'm using 80 distillate and 80 um rosin so these are still up in the 80 percent so we're gonna use our um we had some la confidential co2 cart which i got another one of these so we will be reviewing it later then all we're going to do is unscrew the top here now i will say that it helps to have a decent dab tool the dab tool i'm using is the one i got for five dollars uh from banger supply and if you use code token tim you'll save 10 at banger supply they got these for like 5.99 so try to keep it up here in the camera see what we can do so mainly what we're going to do is we're going to take the flatter end um or either end the flatter end kind of works better towards the end and we're just going to get a glob out there like that this stuff's stringy and looking in the camera is a pain in the butt all right we'll hold that there and then what i do is just press it around the stem and then put it down in there so let me go over here and do this where you guys can still see it but yeah you guys can see it there now i'm gonna go ahead and use the flat end just kind of scoop out a big scoop like that and then smooth on that thing and it's easier just to push it right down in there you guys can see that just kind of pushing it down now it doesn't go real good um so there is a trick we'll use here in a second once we get it pretty blobbed up all right trying to it's hard for me to focus i need new glasses so i keep pulling it off the frame to me to be able to see it now i'm just scraping all the gunk out of the jar real good i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna go over to a clear spot each time and just wipe it off on that and then take the tool focus there we go and slide it down that thing it's not wanting to focus if it does go on the outside just scoop it back up all right we've got about all of it now the first one i tried to wait for it to go down and it just didn't seem to go down quick enough so i'm gonna take a little torch and i'm gonna heat the glass down in here i'm not gonna heat the concentrate i'm just gonna do it like that without burning my fingers off hopefully so i'm just going to slightly warm the glass going around you can see it's starting to drip there where we warmed it up so just real quick that one bubbled on me and then it starts to it'll just start to run down in there then go ahead and take the tool and access there's a little bubble there we're going to pop that scrape all that off on there try not to get it inside there for sure we've already got it about half full it doesn't take a lot um a lot of concentrate that is you can see i only had about three in that syringe and i only put a couple dabs in there it really wasn't a lot so again we're going to take a little bit sometimes with this i can just scrape it right across the glass or like i said just roll it around that and whatever's left there the mouthpiece fits real tight over that silicone ring and it just pushes everything else down let's get a real good scrape on this jar real quick and then i'll show you the other ones i made and talk about them a little bit now i will say the flavor on this stuff is just amazing it tastes just like just like doing the dab let's scrape this off of there real quick all right now i could play around and get some more out there but i want with you guys i'll just dab that out with my dab straw later so we're going to stick that on see how it just squishes that on through there and we're going to screw that on now i found with some of them you'll have to go back again with your torch and this one's a little thicker you can see it's still thick so i'm just barely going to heat it if it starts to bubble you want to quit so i have to look at this real good and it'll take a second for the heat to transfer through to the glass still a little creamy there's still some up there at the top there we go this one must be a little thicker glass than the other one i had we're just going to hit it a few times now if you notice when we did that it kind of cleared up a little bit not a lot but so you can see the little holes down in there now where the wick is you'll see how that cleared it up some and i didn't bring the battery out i told you i got pretty medicated all right but we have made a few other ones um so i made one yeah this is it i used the move vape pen and this it worked great for about two days and the battery died and if you can see right here at the bottom it's got little um holes i thought i could take it off with a battery i grabbed it with some pliers and apparently i couldn't so i shattered it what i'm going to do is unscrew the lid i'm not going to do it now because i want the glass to fall off and then i'm going to heat the banger up and i'm going to put it in there upside down like that and just let all that wax come out now this was the um i used the skunk ape and the bubba kush um the skunk ache ape was from move or true leave again sorry i don't know i got move on the head now i did put some of the thca powder in that one also and it was really really really tasty tasted just like the skunk ape tastes a lot better than the skunk ape rosin car which we'll get we'll have a video on that later but like i said really really really tasty um and the thc is going to be up there and it's a cheaper cheaper thing so i'll show you the other one i did but first we got to do it sorry it's alive all right so i did make a live resin vape cart um this is with moves rainbow train wreck and you can see how it's cleared up a little bit more i hit it with a little bit more of the torch um but it tastes amazing there's a little clog there that's why heated this one up it was clogging a little bit but man it tastes amazing and the high on there i'm telling you the high is better than any of these vape pens i've had yet and i gotta write what i put on this one so i don't forget that's the rainbow train wreck which we know it's live rosin because that's all there is um but the skunk ape one i'm telling you you know vape card even these i hit these um you know 10 good hits off of them to catch a little buzz um i was only hitting that skunk ape three three little hits and i was blasted i the dying i made that i rolled up a joint um and after my three hits i had like this much left of the joint and i looked at that i'm like hey no way i'm lighting that thing back up so it tore me up pretty good so if you guys want to give it a try like it's not really messy you do have a little bit of residue left in these so you could either take a bud and roll it around in there and then roll in some keep and make your own moon rock or you could just take your dab straw and hit it you could also take a hair dryer and melt it down so it would get it in a corner better to get a little better dab out of it but if i mess around with it with like this one that has that little scoop on the end i can pretty much get everything out of that jar there won't be anything left and especially it's starting to cool off now because it's getting ready to rain here but especially when i'm working in a hot garage and it pretty much stays warm here anyways it makes it easier to work with it's not coming back up so it's easier like i said just to push push it all the way around to the corners i just take this one the longer straighter one and get the sides like that and what i'll do with this is dab it that's what i do with the other stuff that's why i mark the charge but i think it rub keeps rubbing off with my fingers so that one's uh we just made the papaya cake so that was this one we're just gonna put a pea on the jar so i remember but yeah that's what i'll just use when i come out tonight i'll scrape that again you can see like i said i just got that little bit i wiped off on the edge there just by taking it around a little bit and just keep scraping it back on the side and then when you get enough to take a dab you just take it all off of there and dab away and like i said with the other with the rounded one it works a little better getting everything out there real good this one's not bad but the other one's better so like i said it doesn't take long to get you a dab and then just drop the dab tool in the dab rig and you're good so that's my take on making my own vape cards um the live resin i did use the co2 true clear the sherbert so i figured it'd have a nice cleaner flavor but this stuff here wasn't bad um i haven't tried this one i just made yet of course i didn't bring the battery out um but i used it with a skunk 8 but that skunk cape's got such a strong skunky um smell to it it's hard to for anything else to come through so we'll see if anything comes through on this one but like i said the thca powder worked great in there too it didn't clog that one up that one worked you know it was almost all the way full and you can tell see there's not much left in there i smoked over half of it in a couple days it was so tasty and like i said the battery just quit on me so i don't recommend refilling those the reason i refilled this one and like i said we got it filled with just that little bit i didn't use a lot i'll show you how much i used on that um but this one's got the charging port on the bottom so hopefully we can recharge it when it does die now i only use this was a full gram i did lick a little bit and but pretty much i just used two i pushed it from where it was at the one to maybe just past the eight so maybe three milliliters of this stuff but closer to probably the two because it did fill that pin up and it's only 300 milligrams so like i said it didn't take much of this to fill that vape in and i did dab a little bit in my mouth dabbed a little bit in the banger just to try it the flavor wasn't bad the banger wasn't real clean so i couldn't get a good flavor on it so we'll save that for a review hopefully too well that's going to be it guys if you have any questions just leave them down there in the comments like i said this is an easy way you could also just put the distillate straight into the vape pen without the rosin and just make a bait pin that's what pretty much they're using is distillate but like i said with just a little bit of that rosin it makes it a real good flavor so you don't need a lot of that even you could probably just put maybe two little dabs in there mix it around put one in there see how you like it next time add more if you need to but like i said they tore me up good so i definitely recommend those of you who are feeling your own give this a shot let me know what you think of it that's going to be it guys we do got some more videos coming tomorrow we got a delivery coming and then we'll also do what's new in the florida mmj we got some new things

keep on toking my friends", "OAeayndHR_I": "so serious let's go I know YouTube has been getting like a little strict on this or before this video starts I need to say this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or you have a medical marijuana card like I actually do myself I don't wanna show you my personal information yo what's up guys you're on your money back at you so this video I have another cartridge reveal for you guys but first off um I'm sure you guys like all heard about like cartridges getting like um like banned in certain states by now and like people getting lung infections and passing away and like all that [ __ ] you know what I mean so I'm just like really curious to know what you guys think about like all that it's like go look everything going on I'm curious to know what you guys think so tell me down below in the comments um yeah I'm thinking about making a video on the subject myself so if you guys want to see a video about me talking about that subject let me know down below in the comments - yeah I don't know that whole thing is just like crazy and I just wanna know what you guys think about it so but besides from that um in this video I don't know if you guys seen it or not but we're going to be reviewing the branch rib and I've actually reviewed this brand before if this [ __ ] wants to focus please yes I've actually as it upside down yeah it was is I've actually reviewed this program before in the past but I never reviewed the own the live resinous aren't sauce cards so this is sounds fire especially this rate I got too banana and cream sauce like banana and cream sauce I don't know that just [ __ ] so inspired at least to me in my opinion like banana and cream sauce live resin sounds fired as [ __ ] so if you guys seen that it's tested at seventy seven point four percent THC 0.5 percent CBD at point almost point one for almost one percent CBD m5 CBN which I'm not going to familiar what that is if you guys want to educate me it is leave a comment down below some will be some over the packaging real quick I won't waste too much time on there and then we'll open this up we'll get to smokin on it if you guys want to see more reviews I like these pods let me know down below in the comments too cuz I was looking spots heavy um besides from now yeah just happened to the snow so the front of it is said um this drip or nose extracts live present sauce bait my huge five point eight milligrams suppose that happen yeah it's a half a gram part I don't know why this [ __ ] doesn't want to focus right now there we go just so yeah drip see it decide take this little sticker off its own on this time she said some premium quality drip extracts and oils so a pretty simple packaging you know to me the bad just has like the Arizona's Department with that department of health warning all that good [ __ ] that they had to put on it you know what I mean test results on this side you know I mean then you just pull it out like this yeah you just slide it out like that and you're greeted with this so the first look at the cart of bananas and cream sauce [ __ ] this sounds fire to me my opinion so I'm expecting this to taste like so yeah I'm expecting this to taste like [ __ ] amazing so the way I usually like your beauty videos is I'll go over like the packaging to the packaging I'll give this like I actually like to like this package in a lot is just like not too much details on the package and like about the actual oil itself not I mean if you guys want to you can go on the website and check them out whether it's social medias right there yeah go check them out if you guys want you definitely have some fireeyes products but I wish you just have a little bit more information about the oil one strain on the packaging but besides from that it's I like it on least like I like how they put like the shiny letters and I don't know it's just it's dope you know I mean I don't know I just like the package inside if it had more details on like more information about the the strain and like just the oil itself I'll probably give it a 5 out of 5 but but since it's like lack and the information a little bit I'm gonna give it like a four and a half out of five but that's just like the packaging so the packaging pretty dope next we're gonna go over like that the looks of the oil slick not like that the quality or taste there anything you're gonna mean just the [ __ ] the looks of it so this is looking a little dark but not bad I mean it could be like that the comodoro could be big but it could be due to like this trillion it could be good like how they like so many [ __ ] fact there's there's so many different variables I could look at that the color the oil but the clarity in like the assistance these like the most important or everything else this oil is a little bit art I'm not gonna lie the consistency is like fire though this it's not movement as you guys see the clarity is there I mean you can see straight through it there's no like fogginess or no white [ __ ] in it you know I mean so that's a good sign they mean it someone it's medical dispensary I buy [ __ ] drip products all the I know about fishes I know this is some fire I know it's not no like booty juice in here so I mean it's just I never seen like the oil this dark or that's interested but like I said I never had those sauce cards before but besides from that [ __ ] to my battery um there's gonna be smoking this off of um my CB v so yeah we're gonna be smoking this carted off my CBD 5-pin there were nice too nothing to send me this pin and actually [ __ ] with her a lot whatever pens I had yeah um the looks of the war dodo one out of five the consistency is definitely there like I mean like this [ __ ] is like no I'm moving at all that's not for have an hourglass right there the clarity is there you can see it like how dark the oil is you can see straight through you know what I mean but I don't know I'm not really liking the color too much I wish it was a little bit lighter but everything else about is fire um I was gonna say 4.5 out of 5 but if it's only because like the strain that is this color I've learned I can't really give it a negative rating because of that so I don't really know yet maybe I'm just gonna say 4.5 out of 5 when it looks a bit so now we're gonna do a little taste test so I'm gonna turn the song I happen in the lowest temperature so I'm gonna take a couple small hits real quick see what this tastes like and do all good [ __ ] I'm gonna put it like a little high yeah I'm gonna put on the higher temperature take a couple of batter hits do my little smoke test and like a little high test yeah they're not available I'll go over like the price point with you guys a little bit and then um we'll just to like overall review and then I mean so yeah stuff you guys are smoking along I hope you guys have spoken up the bank and you guys are Cheers let's get it again we're just I'm gonna taste this first so Cheers yeah yeah I barely hit that [ __ ] that [ __ ] ripped that [ __ ] like definitely has that lung expansions in yeah so that should definitely if you like one one expansion in your chest um yeah blow me going for another hip dose I don't really get too much taste in that here so um yeah Cheers so it tastes more like this like this strain I should have expected this I don't know why I was expecting to taste like some like them what does it bananas and cream yeah I was expecting that tastes more like the flavour bananas and cream rather than the strain that doesn't cream um if you guys know that the strain but how does in cream it's um that's a cross between like blue dream banana hoji and like a Ocean Beach oh gee it emits like a strong note of orange and like experiment in this thing yeah so has like a like I'm strong like a orange and experimentation know what I mean and that's definitely what this tastes like you can definitely taste like that um the orange you like it's like minty flavor I don't it's like definitely like a weird unique taste kinda hard to describe let's think I guess that's the best way you can describe it it's like an orange like mint taste kind of it's not the most tasteful I'll give it like a three-and-a-half four out of five that's not the worst tasty car it's [ __ ] fire it's definitely probably um I'll be going from one wearing it don't put on higher temperature and do that little high test so Cheers yeah definitely fire though but I definitely taste like that strain more than my passion but and isn't cream flavor but yeah I'll give a like a three and a half or four or five somewhere around there but let me put this on the medium I'll put on the medium temperature in the middle temperature so I'm gonna take a couple fatter rips now I'm probably thing up when hearing it this time so so yeah let's see all the smokes now and then we'll do a little high test to it so Cheers if you guys are smoking along again let's go that's definitely fire ooh when you think of that rip with that you can definitely feel that in your chests like almost like a [ __ ] tab like um um definitely [ __ ] fire um let me go for one more hit and then I'll give the higher a little taste but let me go a little bit hit you know I'll get the higher reading but the way this smokes I think I make of that like a 5 out of 5 because I just moved wow you guys seen issues so the way smokes 5 out of 5 I guess that also kind of depends on your battery you know what I mean and the temperature and a whole bunch of [ __ ] but the way I'm talking it's 5 out of 5 but let's hop back into this so I'm gonna do one more hit then we'll do a little high reading and then we'll go with the price point [ __ ] so series and let's go oh definitely a fire card here's another look at the oriole focus there's no last look at the world pretty far I mean it doesn't look like the most potent oil with [ __ ] away trips yeah this is fired it away smokes think I said 5 out of 5 at least for the one smoking for me right now but the high test I mean or the high reading I should say I'll get the high up for a car that's fire I'm not gonna lie I'll give it like a four point two out of five it's a pretty fire car but I've had better parts that were more potent obviously out there so it's not like the best part I've ever had but it's up there with some of them the price point it was $45 which is a little pricey for a half ground cart but considering this is like made without real live resin I know there's a lot of brands out there that claim to use live resin but a lot of them really don't I know for sure this is this company like they actually ain't there one of the friends that actually like they do that they actually do use live resin you and I mean so for the quality you can justify paying a little bit more but forty five bucks for a half a gram or that's kind of a lot you know I mean I can get almost like two to three brands of wax for that price so the price point I'm gonna give that like a three and a half out of five maybe three-point-eight out of five I don't know it's somewhere around there I still I've been saying this forever but I feel out of cards need to get a little bit cheaper they just they're good for the convenience II like the portability and how easy they are the smoke but like I feel like to put the price point on them grow like I mean if you did it like if all you do is smoke cards like if you bought it's like a half gram card last seems like a month when you buy a half a gram of wax that [ __ ] will probably last you twice as long as a cartwheel and it's pretty known it means so that's the one thing I don't like about cards when I go to a concert or something like that you know I mean all right did he discrete that's when they're like really really helpful and like come in handy I still feel like I'm gonna get Reapers you guys agree with hear it disagree with me let me know down below in the comments but the overall score on this car 45 bucks for this own Nana cream live resin sauce card reading on this like a overalls for a four out of five a fire card but the price point is a little bit expensive like I was just saying um there's a couple of other brands out there that are around the forty five dollar price point out honestly me I'd prefer to kick over this court but not to say that this part isn't fired but I just I don't know these brands that I'd rather have in this brand but it's still a fire car you know that means so I'd still be picking up I mean I don't know the main I saved on a lot of videos but mainly only pick up arch and a half I won't get one free Thea was going to me because I feel like that's when you get the best bang for your buck not to keep this video stretch um yeah I don't know if you guys want to see some more car reviews and videos like this we've spoken and [ __ ] like that I'm gonna down below in the comments and you guys are you know I'll do that ship uh besides for that I feel like the Lighting's in a little bit [ __ ] up in this video I apologize for that but give the video a thumbs up comment like subscribe like that's [ __ ] you really know what to do spend your money ready peace out", "m_5KAkbiqSY": "in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand new video today we got a special cartridge of you we're gonna be looking at some of this right here some moxie so I've been hearing a lot of good things about maxime and I heard this [ __ ] is like something fire I heard it's like some legit it's like the concentrate is a lot different than regular oil wax pens so let's see a little bit about this so I'm actually got this recommend until it's liquid moxie they said it's like live resin in a in a cartridge so I'm just like oh okay so that's kind of dope you know everything in the back oh by the way everybody this is Maui wowie I had again I had to get a crazy flavor I had to get a crazy player for you guys some guys somebody said to get these Moxie cartridges I I guess these are really good so we got a 5-10 thread bate cartridge okay that's usually the universal the regular you got the warning signs all that stuff could cause chemicals all that [ __ ] just so you guys know you guys gotta be careful man we got our smoky and these cartridges man you guys got to be careful alright so a little bit a little bit about it here this is some information about it it's a hybrid and all I know this should as far as 80% I'm not gonna lie when I cop this off the club I was just like okay this is kind of safe this looks already kind of cool so you can pop it off just like down boom you guys know me man I'm like trying all the cartridges and stuff like that so we have to do is you have to kind of hold it so we have to do is all right look at this just a little bit like this comes in a little container isn't that dope comes I got a little container so you just kind of pop it you push it that's kind of I guess to push it right there well well you have to kind of grab it push it just a little push right there you see that are you see that you gotta kind of have to push it you see that kind of push it by hand look at that that's sick huh oh that's sick but yeah this is no ordinary wax cartridge you guys this [ __ ] is gonna be some [ __ ] largest oh [ __ ] that would be actually really nice no no thumbnail look at that oh actually I got a good idea for the thumb no this is gonna be sick for the donor I'm gonna be like this I'm gonna be like that Moxie can you see it me up mark see just like that right there boom we got the thumb now you guys make sure you guys makes you guys drop a like makes you guys drop a like a comment subscribe you guys you know this is a pocket we kick them back just talking about random stuff just really kicking back but today it's more of like a little review so let's pop this [ __ ] open you guys already know me we got a check we got a check you guys see that right there so by the looks of it it just looks like your ordinary wax cartridge look at that life gets better oh definitely does if you guys are right now man if you guys are feeling down anything like that just no nightmares do not last you wake up eventually I'm trying to find if there's like a little bit of information about it but I guess doesn't really tell me much but yeah it's definitely some white resin inside this wax cartridge it I mean it looks the same you know the color and all that stuff it looks the same but [ __ ] let's try it out you guys Maui wowie oh that straight-up tastes like a candy like let me see if there's a way if there's anything that I could like um anything that kind of tastes like this it tastes like a fruit loop kind of like fruit loops yeah it's like oh it tastes like a grape like if you're eating a fruit loop not approve of fruit rolls my fault a fruit roll is a candy I think I sort of toss fruit roll let me answer this call okay it tastes exactly like it smells it definitely has a little punch to it the taste is great like I feel like the taste is really good in this and like I'm telling us it tastes like a grape fruit roll-up like it has like a really distinct taste definitely definitely we're gonna have to get another flavor like it again there's no matter I'll be right there I guess this makes a lots of clouds and Moxie is I guess one of the most popular wax cartridges around I guess at that club but I mean I feel like so far rock garden rock garden and heavy hitters is kind of like the way to go I mean that's how I see you know the rock garden and the heavy hitters is so far but Moxie this is like the first time you know it's funny I just hurdled I literally just heard about mossy just this morning like I was just going through the dudes entirely because I wrote it thoroughly I go to thoroughly the club here in the Bay Area and we I usually just go on the internet I check out you know like the menus and stuff try to see if there's any deals any good stuff and I seen this I was like at oh by the way this is $25.00 half gram $25.00 so you cannot go wrong with this [ __ ] man the flavor is great I literally took took I took two hits and I already can't talked and technically I mean if you guys look at my face it's my eyes I'm looking a little bit late let's take another yeah there's some spire like this one it's good it's the Maui Wowi - there was only like four flavors that were at the club at that time but it definitely does have a great taste telling you tastes like like a fruit roll-up with a little bit of grape with a little bit of grape but that's just me though I got some sometimes I'll be having some like weird as like taste bud you know sometimes I'll taste [ __ ] I'm back I'll smoke something and I'll be like you know what probably this tastes a little like weird like it tastes like for example I'll be like dude this tastes like a burger this tastes like spaghetti like my mind is so weird it's sometimes like the taste buds I'll smoke something I think a bloody stump I'll take a hit Oh black little blind on she's like but why does this taste like candy why does this taste like this but it's like the trees like I know it's something on my brain but Moxie this past weekend I didn't really make a video but I went to Lake Tahoe so if you guys follow go follow me on snapchat go down at the description I got my snapchat down there so I posted a lot of my snapchat you know for everyone to see so you guys could even if you guys want to ask me something or anything like that a question you guys could hit me up on snapchat to my my snap is open so you guys are able to you know watch my story you guys could DME anything like that but yeah this past weekend we went to me and a couple of my boys and [ __ ] we went to a we went to Lake Tahoe and I'm an eye shadow I should have logged the boat went to Lake Tahoe and one of my boys had a gram of frog garden Robert and something it was a it was a wax cartridge boat but it was so clear and I kid you guys not man this you took one single rib and it made a produced a fatass cloud it was so crazy 1 2 3 it was crazy I was like dude why and one hate was just that probably like what $55 Graham again you guys I still got to make a video and talk about these wax cartridges cuz man I'm not I smoked the by one or two wax tortured baked cartridges when I don't even know and I found out to like kind of like you could say recently maybe like a month or two ago when I was like dude man there's a lot of fake cartridges going out there so it makes you guys get your stuff from the club dispensaries all that stuff and meets the same [ __ ] but still alright we up that a match and this is honest reviews these are honest reviews like I literally everything I cop is something that I'm gonna enjoy you know if I look at something I'm like I'm not gonna enjoy this I don't even cop it so I like to review stuff that it's just like I find appealing you know I looked at I'm like it looks kind of the same but at the same time I'm not like a crazy ass like fanatic though I can tell you know every what what it is by the look of it you know it's like there's so many concentrates out there you guys are so many [ __ ] out there that's why I feel like you guys gonna be like smoking on like stuff from like the club dispensary man because your local drug bluesman they got the plug I know they got the plug man you know they got the cheap [ __ ] all that I mean not cheap [ __ ] you know they got the they got the good stuff but it's cheap but sometimes man I feel like me like I mean I could trust them depending who they are but if it's just something like some random dude you know like just selling to like random people then I'm just like [ __ ] bro I don't know but let's see if we can make up that cloud Oh wasn't like the fattest but for me that was pretty big [ __ ] oh damn [ __ ] loaded I stay getting loaded in all the videos oh wow I just looked at the boxes at the bottom it says you guys want to go check them out information about them or anything like that it's mmm Moxie 7/10 calm oh [ __ ] 710 710 labs yo you know what I wonder who actually made these come on I really got to do that research I want to see exactly who made these Moxie cards at moxie we think of ourselves as something far more than simply that the leading producer superior quality extracts what we do is a service of a much larger and critical mission driving the research and education critical to ensuring that the valley cannabis is in society is respected and the rights of those who need us we need as most aren't protected and all that stuff I want to see what's like inside this stuff man I want to know what's in this um like I want to know exactly because they're telling me it's like rosin or light resin or some [ __ ] there's different oh I got the Maui Wowi Strawberry Fields liquid moxie we got Mel Mellon rec liquid moxie oh wow these those ones about better ratings the Strawberry Fields actually got a four point nine the melon drank liquid moxie cartridge got a four point five and then the malware we got a three point five so out of all of them oh and then we got Black Diamond og Oh so let's see what they say about this this card should let's see what the online world has to say now I was a classic sativa whose tropical flavors and stress relieving qualities will float you straight to the shores of Hawaii where the string was originally born and raised you know yeah hell yeah that's how I'm feelin I'm [ __ ] chillin bro I'm on a boat I'm just chillin I'm just I feel like I'm floating like like I'm awake you know like I'm looking down like - I got two monitors are hearing I'm just looking at us I'm looking both the stuff you know makes you guys go subscribe to him cut you one down the description that's my logging channel I'm looking at this pronto I'm just like I'm [ __ ] late and I'm super relaxed like I'm not mad I'm not stressed no nothing let's look at the reviews bro I purchase from Mission PA for $40 they got different $40 you know what I don't know if it's I don't know if this is a I don't know if they got a full grammar I love this train back in the 90s nice fruity flavor it tastes tropic yeah that's what it is it has like a tropical taste very uplifting I recommend in early morning we can bake with this do not to try this for the we can make oh somebody left the two stars this did not taste like cannabis to me effects are very nice though so don't write it off I baked it always expecting something that I tasted like great cannabis I try to find out what exactly Dan what the [ __ ] I'm [ __ ] like I got a chill my guess is that my Wow there my farm ghost in puberty my guess is that the product is built from THC natural okay to me it tasted like almond D slightly floral handsome huh the one thing you get in the gas station restroom oh [ __ ] I nobody's talking about I should say that [ __ ] smells great what I don't know what he's talking about that gas station soap is fired I mean yeah the gas station soap it's not that bad it's like the pink one you know that what smells break that [ __ ] smells good alright one two three all right let's get to the highest sensitivity everybody again this is some Maui I hope you guys enjoy these podcasts you know they're just little reviews honestly they're just kind of my review you know my honest opinion of this again everybody I usually have good of good good reviews and and all that stuff for almost all the products that I have here on this channel but it's just because I'm not again I'm not gonna buy a product I'm not gonna enjoy you know I'm gonna look it I'm gonna I'm gonna read about it you know I'm gonna look at it you know I'm gonna read it I'm gonna see if it's like a sativa hybrid indica I'm gonna see if it's like some fire you know maybe it's a wax cartridge I really get wax cartridges the ones that you guys you know [ __ ] offer me if you guys notice it's only been like heavy-hitters [ __ ] king pen and rock art and this like and probably like what like the newest one that we tried or maybe we tried different ones I'm not sure but it's we tried like known cartridges so copies obviously they're gonna be good you know because I try to go for like good flavors so cheers you guys damn I took like a little hit and I made a [ __ ] pretty nice cloud wow it's nice verdict because I think that's what you said or in conclusion in conclusion you guys the way the way you guys open this it's pretty shitty Megan I like you guys could see that right there right I was like little like a little pattern in the back yeah this goes in here this is pretty sick but I'm not gonna lie this definitely will make your cartridge now break or anything like that and it's not gonna get dirty or anything like that it's just perfect I think that this thing it just looks sick you know looks cool like oh I got a wax cartridge looked at on my huh very interesting but down for $25 half gram I give it a thumbs up man and I got anyway I mean I had to take by like a couple heads six seven heads but if it's like you know it's if it's if you guys are 18 or 21 and over and if it's legal you're safe to smoke these wax cartridges these ones 25 dollars you cannot go wrong you know what that was nice little hit gas station soap nap that's all in his head that [ __ ] i get i get a tropical taste like it's if i if i would have oh if it was a drop okay the tropical fruit loops the tropical the the tropical fruit roll-ups that is exactly what it tastes like a tropical fruit roll-up I don't even know if that exists but I can already just like taste it you know cuz I got you know I got some fruit roll-ups in the kitchen you know and I've been eating those I've been grabbing on those for like the past like I the past two days I grew up like a total of like three and I'm just like dandies are good at somehow smoking this [ __ ] I'm just like probably this kind of tastes like thank candy I'll leave you know and like let's take one last shirt make sure you guys drop a like a comment subscribe I hope you guys enjoyed this review like always everybody then you guys you know for tuning in to the podcast you know [ __ ] but make sure you guys go subscribe to the main channel as well you know me I'm gonna probably must I posted in that

it's not green anyways you guys he shares it up like a comment subscribe I'll catch you guys in the next video if you guys wanna see like you guys want to see a certain cartridge a certain strain anything like that drop it in the comments down below again this is an 18 and up [ __ ] late [ __ ] it wall more y'all that's like what like the 20th rift that I take and I took I'm dead Moxie you guys if you guys want a cop fire", "86vKJe4EKvo": "[Music] [Music] once about simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title this is a white widow cartridge yes I repeat a white widow cartridge and for those of you who don't know what white widow is I'm sure most of you do know what what white widow is what would it was like a really really old stream like growing up this is the strain I was smoking in high school you know and that was like 10 15 years ago you know I'm saying so it's definitely something that stuck out to me and I was pretty cheap it was 20 350 for a one-gram cartridge and the company is free cannabis company I've tried them before I seen them at Halle flowers and I purchased one of their cartridges for it but believed a dollar or something you know something cheap because those at Halle flowers but this was 20 350 or $23.50 for a gram and yes it's I mean before you don't even need to guess it's gonna be distillate I believe I mean it doesn't say on here at all anywhere on here but I'm sure it is and I believe it has life to repeat air life resin terpenes is what it said on weed maps so yeah white widow in a cartridge man I haven't seen white widow in like flower wax or a cartridge in like ever I don't think like I don't have any off the top of my head I really can't think of a brand that really just brought a white widow flower or in a cartridge or wax but let me know if you've seen any brand use white widow I know why what it was very subtle after strain right now you know if I can get it in flower form in wax form I'll definitely pick that up you know I'm saying so off the bat you can see right here just get a closer text I don't know right off the bat you see free cannabis company see it's 84% - you see with 4.5 CBD not bad let's just open this we're gonna be using my chill battery oh yeah this was 2350 I authenticate or nine it's not gonna be the strongest cart because it is distillate based it's not full spectrum live resin or anything [Music] I get a really piney taste from smell right here it's cool right here so that should be the thumbnail yeah you can look at it right here very nice very similar to that I've select it is plastic I believe yeah it is but this isn't flat like select I've already tried the the blueberry one pretty good [Music] it's a weird I've actually tasted this kind of taste before it's like that black licorice kinda but very uh it's very minimal taste in the other ones not too bad but definitely not a taste I really like but as you can see the vapor production is there I really enjoyed the blueberry one better than this this will taste funky but then again taste is a preference thing you know some people don't even like blueberries you know I'm saying so you might like this but it's kind of a weird taste but I've tasted it before and if I had to compare to something maybe like a light black licorice taste then again I don't really eat black licorice that much if not at all so I wouldn't know I mean it tastes some more similar to that it's like a weirdness to it so take another hit for you guys see the cloud smoke \u00e4j-- [Music] you know what I like to do I like people on the fan as well but let me just tell you about this again so basically if you haven't seen that video already I mean which I've already probably uploaded before this I picked up two cartridges of these and two grams of wax because I wanted to prepare myself for what's to come within the next few weeks you know I might not be able to get a better selection than I would have two days ago you know I'm saying so it's better to be prepared I don't know when this video is gonna come out maybe in like a week or two from when I film it but hopefully you guys enjoyed it I'm gonna take another hit for you another thing Pizza guys [Music] you", "379D9Lepa5U": "five metro boy vasquez we're gonna be doing another cartridge video thank you guys for watching you know i really appreciate all the support all the love i've been getting um if you haven't added the snapchat or the instagram go ahead and do so i'd really appreciate that but other than that guys i've been pretty good myself my bad on the um uploading videos you know just my schedule is kind of [ __ ] up and i'm gonna be out for like about a month month and a half of work i best pump out a shitload of videos for you guys but today guys um i read that on my cartridge um i've heard of the cure company i was smoking a cartridge of it and kind of ran out so decided to go get another one but if you guys haven't had these cartridges guys they're so fire they're this is the cartridges but the taste is spot on like the quality it's so good it tastes like actual weed you know and the cartridge is ceramic which is dope so that's pretty nice but um i ended up i ended up getting a buddies cartridge guys uh those who've had buddies those who've tried buddies before the cartridge let me know in the comment section of how it was i've never had buddies before the reason i ended up getting it it's just um there's like a couple people that will always comment on my videos saying to try buddies that it's so good this and that so so the good thing about these cartridges that really caught my attention is that their terpene profile they have a label on there um you know um telling you what specifically is in the cartridge which is dope you know to me that's like some good packaging you know really catches my attention you know because i like to see what's in my cartridges and here you have the nice um it tells you what kind of terpenes you know you have in there so that's pretty dope so the total thc on this cartridge is 82 which is not bad for a live resin cartridges because if you guys know live resin ranges from like 60 to 70 percent you know it's not like this lower distal cartridges range from 80s to high 90s so that's pretty dope so here we have the i was looking at the flavors and [ __ ] and this was the one that caught my attention it's a peach flambe pineapple upside down cake that sounds hella good right so that's one of the reasons i ended up getting this cartridge is just like really caught my strain really caught my attention so here you guys have it it's not like a dark amber color like other live resins are like dark amber color like the ursa cartridges or like a moxie live resin you know it's not as dark but it's really clear and it has a nice little tint to it so i'm gonna go ahead and try it out for you guys i was hitting it earlier but you know i'm gonna decide to do a video today uh for you guys because um i'm gonna be going on my little run today i'm right here at a park you know do a little jogging get some runs in you know but other than that guys cheers hopefully you guys are smoking along with me let me show you guys the quality on it it's pretty good you know so we're gonna go ahead and try it out the taste on it it's like spot on it tastes like actual weave that's a good thing about live resins you know um if you guys have these in your pockets after hitting a couple times this thing is going to stink up here man like if you're like in the office or like at your job site or something be sure not to have these in your pocket because these live resident cars just do stink up your pocket and you know people are gonna think you have weed in there that's how strong they are but it tastes really good guys i'm going to take another hit guys to get extra bait you know cheers now the taste to be honest guys it does taste like a little peachy but at the same time you do get the fruitiness of a pineapple which is pretty so the flavor is a little bit peachy and you do get like a nice fruity pineapple flavor to it but it's like a really good clean pineapple it doesn't taste like a fake like a distillery type of flavor you know it tastes really clean you know i'm really satisfied with these cartridges they also have some uh besides the cartridges they also have some wax which i've never had before but i'm definitely gonna have to try them now because these cartridges are fire guys so this is my little label that i got you know my dispensary so you guys can see i don't want to hear another but other than that guys um i've been pretty good myself and i'm just kicking back let me know in the comment section what kind of cartridges you guys would like to see but i'm gonna be getting into like more weed videos you know like more pre-rolls and [ __ ] like that you know just like i said i've been really busy guys but you know i'm not gonna stop making videos you know what i mean this is this is something i enjoy doing so i'm gonna keep doing it so and also you know let me know if you guys love these types of cartridges these sea salt cartridges are [ __ ] good you know every cartridge option they always hit you know with these cell tips they're like the best ones you guys can get cheers guys i'm already like high as [ __ ] like before i got to the park um i was hitting it like two three times so i'm already loaded so hopefully you guys are smoking along with me man now for the price i ended up paying like thirty five dollars for a full gram cartridge of live resident buddies that's a good as deal guys all right here we go you guys have weed maps look up the shop uh patient care first or just type in pcf just type in pcf and they'll come up and you guys can just literally look on the website and the prices you guys see on there it's the exact same price but just maybe like five dollars with tax you know so it's just [ __ ] cheap everything like cartridges but not dirt dirt cheap but compared to other prices in other cities it's it's a bang for your buck so yeah i'm just trying to get baked that [ __ ] before i go on my little jog [Laughter] it's mandatory you guys get paid before you guys do exercise that makes it so much better i don't got the crawling guys i'm just coughing but other than that guys i really appreciate you guys for watching my videos and if you guys would like to see more videos like this go ahead and leave a like and don't forget to subscribe if you guys are new to the channel i would really appreciate that and don't forget to add the at the instagram and snapchat guys i'm more active on snapchat but i'm gonna try my best to get more on the instagram so let me give you guys a little close up right here other than that guys thanks for watching peace", "AKy6CXaqESI": "welcome to community cannabis review today I'm going to be reviewing a Mojave brand live resin cartridge I'm doing a quick little video which I did as well with hush because quite frankly I just want to get these cartridges in my beep and same with my girlfriend she once said as well so I'm just gonna get a review down because I don't have these on my channel and I don't know that I'll buy these again as I already have a couple favorite brands and if anyone was wondering what they're like how about we show you this much so you know so I bought this for 1916 that's how much it is made I believe it's like $22 rent something like that this is made by the same company from what I've looked into as hush the hush Brandon carts are just distillate and little canvas terpenes you get I get this for $16 out the door these ones are live resin mixed with distillate from what I can see on the ingredients they're also they're both made by A&M company or Co or what have you but anyway as I said on the hush brand ones I used to not get these because I could swear they used non cannabis dr terpenes which i'm not a fan of and now it appears that they've changed with a flavoring ban so that's the that's the whole thing I'm trying to get this open gingerly but stuff I'm not working oh this tape that's why I'm not destroy this package there's oh you know what we make sure that you all can see the info before I get to undo it so that's the strain information sativa Kim Sour Diesel seventy six percent THC two point five since CBD down with something like eighty seven percent total cannabinoids decent amount herb septic the one with the moose terpenes actually now I don't believe I did there's one that's slightly more here's any other info on the back I know before I'm going to a legal state I just loved watching these videos to look at stuff like this so I want to try and make sure you all can see as much of that as you can very cool stuff comes with something awfully similar to hush so another giveaway I just do a same brand but you can just check the back and it says well alright so it's not a bad looking live resin cart nothing glaringly bad about it and grab my vessel Georgia pop it in and see looks like a good standard see so um weird no thought it wasn't screwing in alright so we'll start it add 2 2 point 7 volts for flavor getting Sour Diesel oh yeah 3.7% Terps isn't terribly a lot for live rising compared to some of the buddies liquid diamonds live resin you're seeing stuff like 14% terpenes it's out there I mean it's ridiculous really good stuff but for $20 $19 or what-have-you this is not bad really not bad not on the same level as buddies but my med price for the buddy's liquid diamonds live resin is 30 out the door so I get to save some money here and lose a little bit of quality but I mean it's totally passable I avoided some budget brands before entirely I would just not buy them but these are good in a pinch I wouldn't be against using these at all me bump up the voltage and try one more cloud before I jump out of here 1 2 3 I have trouble with it sometimes solid cart solid cart so um thanks for watching hopefully my next videos will be slightly better quality put together a little bit but as you can probably see it's a million [ __ ] degrees out here and we have yet to get an AC in our apartment so a little insufferable right now but I wanted to just get two quick videos out there because I wanted to make sure that I put these on the internet in case anyone had any questions before I just go through these in the day and then never think of them again and soon you guys if I can never get our stand dabbing which I'm not a greatest fan o Keeffe and for some reason of I got a whole lot of stuff to review review lots of live res and lots of diamonds diamond sauce you know I just want stuff so stay tuned and hopefully I'll knock out some of that pretty soon here", "yNTdkF34xVs": "what up YouTube it's your boy chirpy Tom I'm gonna do a quick review here for you guys Cresco code blue code blue lineage and code blue a san diego cat piss times face-off oh gee alright you guys know I had to code blue the live sauce right that's right here which I still have a little bit of it left you guys see all right still got a little bit left I've been nursing on that jump I think this is kind of get a little tough money's getting tight you know I gotta get my card redone which is I got an appointment set up for next Wednesday that's a hundred fifty bucks at the good old pocket which I really don't have to redo this card so might be a little shy on some reviews okay with that said let's get right back into this thing so lineage the sandy San Diego cat piss times face off oh gee I hope this don't taste like cat piss I'm joking there it did not taste like cat piss this was was [ __ ] pure just loveliness okay let's see Cavanaugh at cbn 0.15 THC 69 point 23 THC a 2.79 CBG 0.6 CBG a 0.28 CBC 0.23 total 83 point 28 terpenes alpha pioneer 0.85 campaign 0.04 beta pining 0.27 beta marcin 5.21 sr i won let's see deeds I mean 0.87 oops I mean 0.32 Terpening 0.2 0.0 to see our terpil in zero points there were four Finch owns over 2/3 linen lose 0.12 there's all kinds of one I see I'm just gonna go back to total total eight point nine nine percent terpenes eyes this was packaged on the 13th to 3a to 1328 of course you guys know I have not broken to it I don't break anything and if I do it's because I [ __ ] up on the first recording alright so let's get it man all right boom there it is alright colors look I'm really good of course you guys know I [ __ ] with the Cresco all the time good blue I'm thinking it is going to taste just like this let's see yep I'm sure it does has that greenery that greenery tastes like I was saying last time yeah that that's [ __ ] amazing like that greenery cushy kind of just earthy like yeah this is this is gonna be nice so of course it's a 50/50 hybrid 50% to save up it 50% indica so this is going to be a good anytime cartridge good for falling asleep good for a stayin awake just a good mix of whatever you know it depends on how your day is going I guess the Pens home when you're smoking it unless you can see there's a nice nice little bubble there look you know that's how they normally are you're not gonna [ __ ] about that too much right let's hope not alright as you can see I'm a little faded right now I've been been smoking on this MPX that that Mandarin cookies live rise and sugar that I did a review on yesterday or the day before so yeah I've been getting on this so but let's give this guy rip and let me see if I can tell you the taste which which I already told you to taste but let me see if I can get anything never in here hmm it listen what that hit reminds me of right there okay imagine remember when you as a kid and you and your brothers foot or whoever [ __ ] was your bad I don't know would go out and write the front you're the backyard and and you would make a pile of leaves and you would jump in those leaves that that that smell that that's kind of flavor I guess you can say that's what this is reminding me of yes so it kind of thirty earthy levy kind of taste that's what this is reminding me of and it's actually bringing back some taste in memories as the kid breaking the leaves and my brothers and jumping in and [ __ ] like not bad not bad at all code blue I I think you might be up here one of my number one favorite cars this is very tasty it's not a bad taste at all and of course it's a hybrid I love hybrids high bridge is one of my favorites because it's the best of both worlds in my opinion yeah so there is a guy's code blue [ __ ] it's it's definitely a winner for me San Diego cat piss too how about that yeah San Diego cat piss huh that's pretty cool I want to give a shout out to everybody in in a lot in John's live chats super cool people's man meeting some super cool peoples just that said I hope everybody's being safe my paws is kind of taking us around with this whole one appointment said he he works us a couple days a week which basically puts us over the limit the file for partial one appointment so therefore you get nothing for unemployment so therefore you get like a 14-hour paycheck but yet you're like over your limit for [ __ ] I'll appointment is ridiculous you know what I mean and the reason why I say 14-hour paid - because our pay periods got Thursday Friday Monday Tuesday Wednesday on the point goes Monday Tuesday or Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Friday Saturday Monday Tuesday Wednesday a Friday Saturday Sunday or some [ __ ] like that whatever [ __ ] you know so basically Sunday starts a new [ __ ] day so Sunday Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Monday to the how it goes okay so our [ __ ] like just doesn't add up like this so if we work [ __ ] one day Friday and then one day like out of Tuesday or Wednesday we're only getting that to day paycheck so now if we work both Thursday and Friday that same day we only work one day that Monday Tuesday Wednesday we're only getting those those two days to paycheck we're not getting Thursday and Friday but we worked that week you know what I mean so therefore on appointment is picking up that Monday that we picked up Plus this Thursday and Friday so therefore it's showing that we worked three days but on our paycheck we only worked [ __ ] two because we worked one day last week and then one day this week so if [ __ ] us it's confusing but yes it [ __ ] us and like it it's it's [ __ ] guys I'm gonna tell you another trip for the boys I'm gonna do a flanker y'all for the boys I

cartridge from papa's herb so it is running at 72 thc and it is a indica so i already took off the sticker that had my name and all that but we are going to go ahead and give it a try so i already put it on and all that so let's go ahead and focus him on this so you guys can see that there's oil nice and thick and then here is the cartridge itself or the i guess the wrapping or not the front so we're going to go ahead and hit so these cards have so much flavor forbidden fruit especially i love the terpenes it has it's crazy good and i want you guys to make sure you guys like and subscribe because it really helps out the channel and we are also in a new setting today i'm trying out and see how it looks hopefully you guys like it let's go ahead and take another hit for you guys like i said this cartridge is amazing so we are hitting it off of the toki 510 [Music] thread so this battery is really good simple plain or not playing but it looks looks pretty simple but it's way better than like a regular battery this is only on two out of three hottest and it's hitting really good so how have you guys been how's the code been with everything this card's amazing cheat i think that was like one my fifth hit and this chord's got me i'm feeling really good i'm already messing up on my words but today i'm recording on my sony a6000 so this is like my really good camera and not my phone so hopefully you guys see the improvement and quality so and i'm also going to be adding this one better so hopefully you guys also see that the improvement in that so i got this battery from toki 510 thread either they sent me this over so i really do appreciate it and this is the papa's curt pop-up herbs um forbidden fruit cartridge so i really do like these i'm in florida they make them here for around 35 where i'm at it is a half gram and it's a really good card so i'm going to take one more hit i'm probably gonna end off the video so that's gonna be it for the video thank you guys so much for watching like subscribe comment share the video and make sure to check out my social media links down below in the description thank you so much for watching this ethan signing out peace [Music]", "sPWKiIBOdwU": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive all right guys back here for another video and this video was probably posted you know a little bit later and this is in the archives guys but we went to the a dispenser or what was it called again phenos phenos we went to a dispensary called finos if you haven't seen that you'll see um a link to that blog up here and in the description so go check that out because i got some inside footage even though the lady was being kind of weird rushing [ __ ] for real though but we got the uh super silver haze i don't know if you guys can see that but i'm gonna give you a quick close-up of the box 72 percent thc or no that's all total campbell right here oh it's pretty low 57 actually well it's because it's just because it's live resin guys and um that doesn't determine if it's gonna get me loaded as [ __ ] so but here you go ingredients cannabis duh like you already know but it has different terpenes guys you can see the terpenes the miracinolene and then be carefully yeah guys but a lot of my subscribers told me that it's freaking dank it's freaking good and it's worth it for the price too like simplistic told me that the price is decent how much was it um well it was 37 today but it used to be 35 so i don't know maybe this strain specifically is two dollars more than others but uh yeah 35 37 yeah and it's a sativa guys you can't see because it's super bright right there but it's a sativa and boom so uh that's what it looks like there's another buddies cart right here with uh this has about 13 terps 13 and this one has how much again uh eight eight percent yeah but uh this is live resin as well so i really don't know when it comes to uh the i don't know because um the more terms maybe the yeah the lighter yeah but they both look beautiful and we're gonna get higher here take a hit we're gonna take a hit hit [Music] blinkers oh i didn't take one blinker for you guys and damn this is a tease i don't even smoke sativas guys but this actually actually has a very good flavor to it does that tell you the fruit like it could have the fruit on it they should tell you what it comes from is that the plant really i think so or like what it's also found in though but damn it's good though yeah yeah i'm [ __ ] with it i can't wait to try indica because this actually tastes good the sativa i just like to be like you know [ __ ] just chilling kind of good though extracts in a way yeah it has like that you know like fruity that fruity orangey yeah citrusy yeah the citrus venus but yeah guys this [ __ ] is smackers and so this is your first time trying well this is the second time he's actually tried this one already yeah this is the the second one he's tried and uh what do you think of it um for the price you know when you can you try that one this one the price the battery oh yeah i'm gonna try both and see which one i think tastes better but um i think they're good they're hella good yeah you know the price for the price they're super good and i think it's just good quality concentrate period i might have to go with this one more because it has more more yeah it has more terps but it's not bad it's not this one's not yeah it's uh it's also less in thc as well compared to this one this one actually has like 70 70 to 80. yeah so this is a bit lacking when it comes to it but um super silver haze in a cartridge you know dude it's fire and if you're trying to get you know that kind of day because it has this dank side to it too like it has that you know citrusy side but also it's pretty dang you know don't you think so yeah it's pretty caught up you definitely can't smoke this around like a cop or something you know even though it tastes like oranges and [ __ ] you do definitely have a weed smell coming from it you know like this might still put me to sleep i feel like yeah it might you know even though it's a sativa but yeah guys we're just um kicking back we already made like three vlogs and we're just chilling you know smoking and we also got the ursa extracts but on the lookout for that on is another upcoming another video coming and it's og kush telling you we getting those og strains on the cartridges we got the super silver you got the oh it's gonna be dank as [ __ ] i can already tell i haven't tried ursula in so long i just can't wait but um what will have you tried urza when it was a ceramic cart yup when it was ceramic it's not ceramic no i almost want to open it just to see it's not the label yeah you're right dude but a lot of people still are like [ __ ] with it regardless of the ceramic you know but like there's just maybe some some people that try it and then they're just like well once i've had this i can't go back you know like some people can still use it i don't know i'll let you guys know if if it's any different yes yeah you can basically title the video you know you tried yeah i've seen your video on her so you tried here so i've i have tried there's a i tried two of them uh when they were ceramics and then i've tried the another one which is all right um this one guy uh this restaurant in the back dude yeah another hit yeah we gotta take more hits we're just gonna take some blinkers right now no i'm just gonna take a regular hit no you already said it but not bad it's not bad damn these are sir uh yeah i [ __ ] with the buddies ceramic as well and it's liquid diamond oh yeah and you can see the liquid diamonds kind of on the on the cart and the inside you can see it guys i can't really show you i'm sorry but you can see the diamonds on there it's kind of like a ursa because ursa you can see the diamonds

tells me when it it like vibrates when you're hitting it and when you and when it stops yeah it'll just stop when it's a blinker it's not even enough it'll stop vibrating yeah it's not it's not even a blinker it's a vibration hey that's kind of weird but yo guys peace and go uh subscribe to simplistic like appreciate it thank you [Music] you", "sktSKm0j5bs": "yo it's going everybody just weed them boys I'm here bringing you a quick little review on a great little product I have today uh I'm vaping and I'm vaping with who's peeing with a special little cheap pink bunny vape shop like maybe 10 15 bucks I'm like that but the real thing is this a bad boy right here this is a this is an Alpine half cat half gram cartridge excuse me on this one I'm smoking on are vaping Islam the believers Platinum Girl Scout cookies real good apparently not one sound labels like an indica as far as like you know which more more city is more that was like more indica dumb and I guess the in the cover here and then here's another one I got these are the half grams I'll show you how they look this is a Alpine live resin real Queen they have these in two sides to the half ground which friend anyone from make twenty five thirty books and the full gram which you'll see around maybe fifty five all the way up to sixty five bucks to pen usually see him for sixty but as I get to I get the full ground for fifty-five shows you like you know the warnings and the test results of stuff it's funny though because I noticed that basically the test results all the same usually this like little difference even in the different strands was kind of weird um this one is the more than light strain and the kadam inant tells you all the good stuff because you know handcrafted premium campus to go little higher standard he's a really cool line I'm gonna tell you they're super low key they got like zero to little smell um it has more like the tiny snow sometimes like lemony depends what strain you get cuz actually each individual strangers have a different taste for a cool minute I thought they're just using the same old you know resin just for naming it and selling up the noise each of these individuals a little strains has their own unique taste so this is a this is pretty good this is a half gram usually they're filled up pretty well they're not filled up all the way to the top which is you know just what's what it is what it is but I mean really just live rather stuff it gets you comes a nice little packaging what comes from some instructions and this someone yeah there we go and real basic instructions with it like this some little tips that gives you and like say if it's not burning right or if it's not or if it's burning too well so you know the children install it proper baking technique which when okay got the home technique that 45-degree angle I see you it tells you once we have the saturated with mister one two to three second drill wait yeah so I mean it tells you some real basic stuff like this like you really really wouldn't even know they also give you some pretty cool like things and some tips and stuff yeah it's pretty legit usually don't see stuff you know cartridges come with a little structure like that so let me know pine put some extra mile cool little box it rips right here to stake opener at that point I just open it from the top and boxing pretty cool themselves it keeps in there but after why just like you'll need them in chrome away yeah they have a couple different strains I've seen them they have northern lines that have the Gorilla Glue I believe number four they have on Girl Scout cookies I think they're platinum crosscut cookies they have true G and there's a lot more other strange but those are the ones I always see in my local shop so free baffle box I'll show you stick a couple vape hints with them so like a sidewalk a new spin with a bigger larger batteries for longer life but so cheap pencil doesn't last very long still goes all the way up to 4.8 but at that point you just there's no taste you can't you don't get that taste tastes all burnt so I keep it on three points so I get nice you know cloudy milky hits but still tastes you know keep that nice taste of the string we take a hit for you guys second excuse my messy car so you get some pretty good hits off of it and it's clean I mean a nice taste it's well for most cartridges I've tried they really don't like they're not satisfying enough you know like they don't even get you like a little you know you know not they don't get you : basically like I'll plan every time and most part like I'm always happy without plan I think there's only one so I feel like isn't getting me at first but took took me a second ago [ __ ] yeah my favorite sells out Pines I've tried as the Northern Light which is a this one right here I love it so motive lights in the come on I've barely tried this one for the first time the Girl Scout cookies and this one is I gotta say this is going to be one of my favorites too now usually it's the ending come one to Gorilla Glue than before Girl Scout cookies well now the cross-hall cookies too and the Northern Lights under sativas I've seen them they had like super Silver Haze I think it is and they've had a jackhammer but this is Teebs I really don't they gave me like you know that's the Tebow way which I didn't really I feel it differently I like how the indica feels better I guess when I'm vaping it be as you notice here gets you that the Moorhead high so you definitely alert but you know I usually like smoke when I go home after work so just chilling and it's really like around like 8 o'clock so I rather sit in the corner Maxine well being the the bedrail sleeping let's take another hit three point a voltage let's go and so I mean it's clean hit they milk the clouds I made them for like maybe four or five seconds so I don't like to take two big kids because then I'll die super quickly by me no so full 15-second hit off of this you're going to feel something shows me um now you know on the higher on the higher voltages of course 3.31 brands much they won't get as much of a milky but I feel like three point on my opinion Oh perfect temperature get that nice big hit but still keep the flavor where it doesn't taste like burner nothing the only the only downside so applying well of course is the conversion so I mean this is part of the whole thing it's not the downsides of it's more you know like the side effects I get like con office [ __ ] with vaping this so i right now you care like my my lips are getting a little dry it was good carry some chapstick when I'm vaping this bad boy keep a ball walk clothes for you because you will get thirsty as [ __ ] well um I mean there's not much else to say I mean I'll find just [ __ ] awesome I like it I love this I honestly like I wouldn't go back to cartridges I went to like you know once you try Alpine I'm pretty sure you'll love it um okay let's take a Bama pretty sure you love it but I would recommend it myself I there's no guarantee that you'll love it but I from my choices I really like does look like pure ganks before or rape did but that's just like it's it's Malo it's alright but not saying about your like no I stood there doing things and then let's try some other ones but for the price it is it's worth it I mean this is half gram 25 bucks pee organics half gram 20 bucks yeah so if you ever guys are in your shop local shop looking you know pick up baby try some I would say definitely try out the half gram first um if they have it if they have the full grams I would say if you want to try it just make sure dedicate cuz you prior to jumping in one for fifty five six five bucks on that fulcrum one depending how much your shop charges yeah there's not much else to say so hope you guys enjoy that review let's take one last big little hit little 50 second 15 second one and show you how lovely this you could get all right that is so much time fee", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if

I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you all enjoyed make sure to check out all the links in the description make sure to share the social media do all that [ __ ] like the video comment a subscribe do all that [ __ ] I'll see you in the next video we're just gonna be on I'll see you in the next

zulu and if you're new to the channel welcome man this is my channel shaka x 420 and i'm back here for another video guys shout out to everyone that was in the live stream yesterday guys i went live yesterday mainly because you know i just been blagging a little bit this week on the videos i think i only have like two vlogs maybe posted this week or something or like one vlog posted for this week but your boy wanted to hit you guys um with at least a little something to show you guys i'm there um because i don't want you guys thinking that i forgot about you guys or anything because i never forget about you guys because you guys are what make the channel i know you guys love just vibing to me but no matter what way i look at it man i wouldn't be here without you guys man shout out to getting me to 3k and we're only going up from here guys so let's go um today we're going to do another cart review but um this weekend hopefully we're going to switch up from the car reviews we're going to get a nature session and hopefully a hot box test so stay tuned for that guys this weekend hopefully if it doesn't rain um the nature session will for sure happen hopefully and then um the hotbox will always it'll just happen i'm just gonna try and make it all happen this weekend sorry if i don't make it happen but i'm gonna try and make these videos happen because i've been really wanting to make uh those videos for a long time and i just you know time just got away from me and i just uh forgot about them but um today guys we got two cards we got a solvent-less rosin cart and we have a live resin and we're gonna put up um and we're gonna put these two up against each other just because they're both lemonade flavor and we got the low well [Music] low well pink lemonade live rosin or just raw i don't think it's live i'm not sure how you would say it and then we got the ursa extracts live resin guys shout out to them and they're both pink lemonade so um i wanted to do a cart review of verses to where it was more more of an even match they're both like kind of the same strain coming from the same flower because i'm assuming that they both come from um the strange the same strange stained flower to make the pink lemonade whatever it's crossed with or whatnot but um so for the for the low well rosin it's sitting at 53 thc and for the ursa extracts it's a little bit higher it's sitting at 68.6 uh thc guys with um no cbd in that one and then the uh the low well has point 32 milligrams of thc so we're actually doing a pax pod 2 versus the 510 thread guys and honestly the only reason why i think people don't like the pax era is because um you you can't get the app for apple iphone i think you can only get the app to change the temperature for android and then they don't know how to change the temperature um by themselves because they also have these preheated settings that if you know how to change it you can just change without having the app or whatnot so you can get fat clouds because i feel like a lot of people want to get fat clouds with um with that you know with the packs but i love the packs because you can change the temperature to that low temp because that's where you get the most flavor um out of your cart so i'm gonna open these up and i'm gonna try and get them out if i can alright guys we got the ursa extracts open you guys seen this man it's in a ceramic freaking cart guys shazam and then i'm going to pull out the uh pax limited also just so you guys can see the quality of the oils right up next to each other guys so we got two different oils let me get a close-up as you can see the ursa extracts is actually a little bit more lighter you can kind of see it and the low well it looks light but it's actually not light it's actually pretty golden it's actually pretty similar to the ursa extracts actually but it looks a little darker in here all right guys so i gave you guys a close-up real quick i got the popper herbs on my neck right now guys so we're going to hit the pop-up herbs real quick hopefully this vlog isn't ruined and you guys can actually hear me but there's a lot of loud noises going on right now so hopefully you guys can hear me but [Music] i can't even [Music] cheers guys if you're not smoking right now so this is just the papa herbs ugh wax just came off and onto my mouth that's so disgusting i hate it when that happens guys when the wax comes on the tip and just gets into your mouth but hell yeah man we're gonna take this one off the bat and we're gonna put on the ursa extracts guys let's go because i haven't tried the ursa extracts pink lemonade but i have tried the low well pink lemonade so i'm gonna test this one out and we're gonna move guys we're gonna move because i can't hear myself talk and i'm the type of person that likes to hear himself talk while he's doing reviews [Music] i'm digging i'm digging the pink lemonade right now i can't lie it's not bad it's pretty dank it doesn't have much lemon flavor or anything but it tastes pretty dang it tastes like a dab it has that ursa you know that ursa extracts tastes like that typical ursa extracts taste but it tastes pretty damn good guys i like the oil and i'm just shutting the door real quick because people can just see in my backyard so we shut the door and but cheers guys i hope everyone's smoking right now so let's try out the packs man let's try out the packs we gotta we're putting this up against the packs guys and people will be hitting on the packs so let me just put this on the battery real quick put that on the bat shazam and let's go see right there guys you can see that the pax is a ripper i'm telling you right off the back though guys i'm starting to get more of a sweeter taste to it other than just you know the dab waxy taste um it's a lot smoother than the ursa extract the ursa extracts makes you kind of want to it makes you want to cough i mean if you're not coughing you're not getting high guys but it makes you want to cough way more than the rosin but i think that's just because um the rosin is made solventless and ursa extracts live resin isn't is it's not solventless but um it's still pretty damn good like ursa extracts on a scale of one to ten i'd put ursa extracts got like you know probably the pink lemonade at like a eight and i'll put i don't know i put actually i'll put him at a seven and then i'll put the low well rosin at like a nine it tastes better it's it tastes better it's a better product but ursa extracts i still love ursa extracts live resin man that's some some good ash good ass oil [Music] but yeah guys it's just been a chill day um i got off off for work i thought i was gonna take the vaccine today but i decided and i don't know i just decided not to take it just because um honestly i would be real with you guys the only reason why i didn't take the vaccine is literally because they wanted me to make a copy of my insurance and i didn't want to do it i didn't want to fill all this paperwork and stuff and it was easier just to sign the paper saying that i don't want to do it so i was a little bit lazy so i'll probably get the vaccine eventually guys because i want to be able to travel i want to be able to get out of here i want to go to the uk i want to go to canada i want to go to japan those are some of the big places i want to make sure that i get to uh before the end of my life you know not saying that i'm gonna die anytime soon but those are definitely some of the places that um are on my bucket list to um travel to let me know what your guys's bucket list is your travel bucket list is down in the comments guys because i know we all got freaking dreams guys we all got dreams and we all want to um you know live out our freaking dreams man and i appreciate you guys for freaking watching the video guys and um always interacting with me and helping me follow my freaking dream man seriously guys you don't even freaking know how much this [ __ ] means to me but um i hope everyone enjoyed the video i'm gonna end it here um in this video i'm just gonna be real the rosin is way better than the pink lemonade live resin but that's just because it's solventless and i don't know it's just smooth i just like i like my smoothness i like i like it when stuff isn't too harsh but like i'm not saying that um i'm not saying that ursa extracts is super harsh it's super bad or something but it's definitely harsher than the low well the low wells way more smoother but at the same time um ursa extracts is way smoother than like other live resins or other distillates out there like papa herbs that i was smoking this is way more harsher than the ursa extracts so you know sometimes it's just up for you guys to decide on what you guys want to freaking smoke but shout out to everybody thank you for watching the video more videos to come more live streams to come guys man i freaking love the live stream so make sure you guys i just dropped my packs make sure you guys freaking stay tuned for the live stream make sure your notification notification bell is on i know sometimes the notifications don't pop up but still click that notification because you never know when it will work and you feel me and when if it does work you want to know when your boy is hopping on because sorry guys um you know i know some of you guys hop in the live late but you know sometimes i just i've already been on the live for an hour or two and i just been high and smoking hella products so i just we want to get off and chill for a second um so sorry for the people that come in late and miss it i'm not ending the live just because you come in or something but um thank you guys man talk to you guys soon see you guys on the internet in the comments on the lives peace out you can zoom in whatever [Music] is [Music] what is being free if i can no longer be me you don't like what you see so you rub up on my energy i just wanna be me smoking on that end of wheat so i just close my eyes because i know [Music] heart you see all my scars you see all the love that i push in the dark i always felt alone so i hop in my car push button start i dream every day as i look to the stars spilling my heart while i'm spitting these bars [Music]", "oMshsLsw0UA": "make sure to subscribe because all this is coming up soon and if you like this you're not going to want to miss what's coming up next enjoy the show hey you welcome to my quiz review a juvenile spells this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now instead of show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles is coming at you with death bubba live resin vape pen so let's open this up and check it out and give it a nice review so as you can see it has a very nice looking box and if you can't tell by taking a quick look at my channel my thing is kind of skulls i love skulls i got a big old collection of skulls here's just a couple of them but so you know i had to so you know i had to get myself the death bubba fate pen to try out sorry so instead of my ass talking all day let's open this up and take a nice look at it so it is a very nice classy looking vape pen it has a very nice design on it and if you take a look it says unicorn hunter certified so after this we might have to go up and get some unicorns you know what i mean just playing obviously of course nobody call peta or anything like that i'm just playing we're good so let's take a nice puff of this and see how good it tastes so i can give it a little bit of a reviewing so it has like a very nice sweet taste i'm sorry we had a little bit of a glitch there so it does have a very nice sweet taste and it does have a very nice like it's not like rough on the throat it's kind of like a nice like smooth hit and it does look like a pretty nice account nice gram inside so i paid like i think it was like 55 50 or 55 for this so it's not really a bad deal when you usually pay about 35 to about 40 or so for like live resin chatter stuff like that anyway so i'd say it's definitely worth it and i noticed that there's this little hole and if you push that you get like a harder hit quicker than without it it like stops the air from going in it to like i don't know kind of like like takes the air away so you get more smoke i guess so and i didn't mention that it has at the bottom a plug to charge it up if the battery dies on you and you can unscrew the top to unplug it so those are some really good quality features about it as well and it says that it's 93 to 98 percent thc so that's pretty good you can't get much higher than 93 to 98 unless you go to the one something percents just just joke no no so i know my humor is a little lame a little dry sometimes so i hope you all get it just trying to keep you on your toes you know what i mean so what we'll do is i'll give a rating of i'll give a rating of 4.5 for the taste and for design and packaging i'll give a rating of an overall five because i mean come on the packaging can't get much cooler very nice box to store it away when you're not using it so the kids don't get at it or something it's easy to put away without losing the pin itself so i guess i'll just give an overall rating of 4.5 to 5 out of 5 to the death bubba fate pin that is a very good choice and it does taste very good so if you ever get a chance to try it out i definitely recommend it it gives you a nice buzz too i'm already feeling pretty good so i definitely recommend it so if you ever get yourself a chance to try it out go get that and i hope you all have some good [ __ ] to smoke at home and i hope you all doing good and i appreciate everybody that comes and spends time spends time over here at juvenile styles and i hope y'all doing good peace now it's time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go now that we're all getting stoned but i got lots more videos so you can stay for show so bust up some more close to roll and watch another show you", "FEDCHb49ei4": "HAS.

just chill but anyways i got a special review today we're going to be going over a 10 cartridge versus a 50 cartridge i know a lot of people they just want to they just want to get high they just want to get high really quick discreetly um and for cheap which is understandable that's why these 10 cards used to be really popular back in the day i was even hooked on these 10 cards for a while just because it's it's it's cheap it's cheap cheap to get high but that has changed now i don't cheaply intoxicate myself i smoke the very [ __ ] best best that i can find so first off let's give it a look it has this um kind of like iron type titanium look to it some ridges um looks cool distal it's flat not moving let's get a little puffer nothing to really complain about i mean ooh this is something to complain about cannabis extracted with butane so i don't know how many uh ppms is in here i don't know how many parts per million uh is left over of butane in this in this cartridge but that would turn me away and that's probably one of the reasons i don't buy these i didn't actually know it was extracted with butane but now i do but yeah now we got uh some dab logic um that tasted okay there wasn't really too many complaints about it it's not like i full on tasted butane dab logic nice little uh laser laser print around this um it looks like it's natives or aztecs or something has dab logic written across the bottom take this off and snap this on now right off the bat i can it can automatically taste a more it's a more natural taste uh you're not gonna be really be able to tell maybe if you're like you know not used to knowing what quality tastes like if i were just a noob coming in here these would both taste very very similar it's not like you can taste heavy butane in that or anything it's just me knowing that this was processed with butane what turns me away but that's you know it's ten dollars worth of butane now what makes these so different why is this ten dollars why is this fifty dollars a big part of this is gonna be extraction these guys oil they're in the market for wholesale they make most of their money off distributing large quantities to dispensaries they're targeting the market that you know is wanting to and toxic intoxicate themselves for a lot cheaper now these guys these guys are marketing more towards the connoisseurs uh this extraction this was not extracted with butane uh there's a process i'm not too sure how it goes down or how they get it into cartridges but i know there's lots of ways to uh extract and get solventless you can do a fresh chop wash that in a bucket of ice water extract those tricoms in a ice hash then press that and then here comes your rosin i don't know how they liquefy it or what consistency and uh temperatures they do to get it to this consistency in this cartridge but they do and it works so what you're mainly paying for right here and why this is so so much more expensive is that is that when people are washing this and uh when they're extracting uh from this method you yield also a lot less from just blasting a can of butane through a whole bunch of weed this process you actually your yield is a lot smaller um but you have a higher quality so that's where the 50 dollar price mark come from but you know a lot of people really don't care but a lot of people do care and this is this is the main differences sorry you can't see the table the camera's up a little too high uh but yeah anyways uh i hope you like this video i hope i covered everything um and there's like a lot more there's like a lot more there's a lot more labeled on this solvent-less solvent-less vape and for those of you that don't know solventless i had a friend ask me i've explained rosin to them but sometimes people don't remember solventless is processed without solvents like butane co2 what else do they use um that's all i can think of out of my head those are the main ways that people use to extract those are solvents this is solvent less solvent less is the way to go your lungs are going to be a lot happier your high is going to be a lot better and you might say well [ __ ] i don't want to spend 50 on a cart i'm going to stick to 10 that's ok but also you have to keep in mind this is going to pack a harder punch because it's way more purity in this than that other cartridge i didn't mean to be a dick i shouldn't do that i'll [ __ ] it uh but anyways i don't even know where it went it wasn't too far anyways it doesn't matter but yeah those are the main differences a 50 card versus a 10 card i know a lot of people see it in dispensaries and they're like why the [ __ ] is that cart fifty dollars well now you know uh glad i got to do this video a lot about to see you guys uh subscribe uh i'm gonna be doing some merch drop soon so you know stay tuned turn on those notifications uh and i'll see you guys soon uh probably my next video i'm gonna be comparing some of the weed i grew and some of the weed my friend grew and we're gonna put it up against some dispensary weed and show you why potentially home growing could be better than commercial growing that's not always the case but for 99 of industry it is um peace out guys take care let me know in the comments what other videos you want i love uh i love getting suggested new ideas because sometimes i don't know what are good ideas and i just go off top but thanks guys for watching peace out", "Y7BRhEtOlx8": "hey guys what is going on today another cartridge this raw gardens now this is a company that has been faked like an insane amount so if anyone of you have experience with this company real or fake let me know let me know how it looks different from yours whether you think you think or know for a fact that yours is real it does have lab results I scanned it it brought me to the raw garden website except one thing one one little discrepancy I noticed the batch number I typed it in and it was for a different string it was not dojo cush but and then I typed in dojo Kush and I looked for the one gram one and it was like a two V two to three or something so I don't know if it was a typo that's mad weird what if it was fake why would they even put in the effort of putting a batch number that was two away from the real number why not just put the real number many questions you can pause that it and read that if you want to manufactured bang bang Best Buy bang 21 we're good ingredients you can let me try to get it you can pause that right there if you'd like to read that let's see Oh God a lot of writing composite right there if you would like to read that why they skipping spaces here I schedule 1 controlled Oh am i bugging contains cannabis like no spaces bro come on you're gonna turn the font-size down one the [ __ ] anyway eight hundred ninety six point four milligrams comes in this nice little childproof container here die here out of here I have chief Don this quite a bit as you can probably tell I'll get comments like bro your plug was hitting your [ __ ] it's like I I have to I have to hit it to review it some just some I hit a lot some I do not hit a lot but I've been decent I don't have any weird feelings about the cart itself even if it is fake I believe and normally live what's called raw Gardens usually clearer than most carts and that this is it looks more yellow on camera but this is clearer than most carts I've seen recently see if we can't get a nice like this so I think this I think this is legit it tastes very clean bro when I when I got this and I was like just named my car and like I left the room and came back and it like smell like weed so I thought that was kind of a good a good sign like it smells good and tastes good it tastes like tastes like bud has like a little bit of lemony I mean yes to it I would maybe if you if you're going to grab these I would definitely just scan it on the spot before you even grab it just scan that [ __ ] see if it brings you to a legit to the right and then you search up the batch make sure it brings up to the right batch you don't want to be smoking Bunco you need to stay safe especially now our lungs are particularly yeah at risk at the moment so make sure you're taking care of your lungs I am probably not gonna smoke any more of this just to stay safe but hope you guys enjoyed if you like this video I got a [ __ ] ton of videos just like it weed carts wax I also have a gaming channel [ __ ] forgot about that yeah peace out", "TvaJzRbbaog": "[Music] you know you're gonna say what it do what to do [ __ ] boy blaze I'm done and this is license of smoke yeah yeah so we're uh to cannabis enthusiasts here who are trying to help the cannabis community find the best smoke without going broke with that being said we're back with another episode here we're just letting y'all know about some of the products that they'll be having at the embrasure de SEL that we'll be attending here soon and but this is a smokey show so get your papers your pipes your blunts whatever it is you use to medicate the smokers and we're gonna go over these cards bought to carry has a pretty special part here and their carts are awesome they have great flavor they have great potency they actually do their job what they're supposed to do and one of the best things about them is they're no fillers no additives no nothing like that this is all from the cannabis plant ya know that's one things I like about it the most yards is like it's like you're smoking the whole plant when you hit this I mean it tastes like a dab and everybody's into distillate and whatnot but I mean this is usually made from trim this is meant from the whole plant you know the meaning less potent didn't like a Vista your normal distal it would be but it tastes a whole lot better it's like you're dying in your stuff and the reason it's less potent than additionally is the fact that the terpenes were preserved so this is THC with its natural terpenes nothing's added with all its natural oils and this is the essence of the plan of the cannabis plant this is all the good [ __ ] that you want so this is to me the closest to getting in a cartridge to actually smoking flour I mean they're full flavor there the potency who cares you got those terpenes to take you where you want to go via the live resin full flavor no additives no fillers best out there I mean to be honest like I mean yeah I'm sure you can find a dank card on the streets it's one of the books but you may end up on the news like some of these other people yeah I mean these dudes don't put anything extra and in their carts these live resident carts is where they're at I mean if you're gonna smoke carts I would highly recommend a live resin car or distantly card from an actual dispensary you never mean stay away from them Street ones y'all in the real me yeah health is more important than a little bit of a savings and as you can see I mean you could take some big rips off for this little bag yeah I mean just a slow steady puff is all you really need I know a lot of times people want to regulate as hard as they can but there's I mean there's no need to just didn't like normal I like these little pinched if you haven't gotten a palm pin you might want to think about it because they're pretty dope syllable they hit real good there's no button you just need to draw on it gonna be guys hit again these are apothecary extracts ambrosial cartridges Ambrose the cards you name I mean this one here is the Pez head Oh G taste fire I really like it highly recommend it there should be something you'll be able to pick up at their days check it out find out one that that is pick up an ambrosia cart you'll be set the whole time here there they do the job yeah the dope they're clean you might have to I mean they've been around a while now you know these kind of regulated carts they've been around a while so yeah they're a little bit more than a street cart but yeah I'll pay for quality and it's all tested you see what's exactly in your your product right here on the potency on CBD the total cannabinoids you taste it you feel it bros your cards yeah yeah well you know what that being said I mean this is just a quick little video letting y'all know about one of their products here we'll be back next week with one of their other products and again we're just trying to help you find the best smoke without going broke so with that being said I'm your boy blaze and I'm go and this is licensed smoke stimuli kitty oh yes still medicated [Music]", "wnA8RonpTcc": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we got a good one for you today so if you keep up with my channel you'll know that I review a few different cartridges well in the last week I planned on going hiking so I picked up a couple that seemed to be good quality I picked up a pure which is premium ultra refined extractions limoncello alright this butane processed 89 percent for a total of 90 so it's a 90 percent THC cartridge or you know basically alright it's all it says and I also picked up a brand that I'm really happy with this is a Jack Herer this was a sativa from canna clouds hashtag kin of clouds 502 and this one here ninety one point seven percent THC or cannabinoids with the THC of 83 and TCA of 7.5 worked it out that's good cuz point twos right there alright this is persue stand produced and processed by eh farms this was done by eh o alcohol solomon extraction okay so we've got these two different oils we've got a butane processed oil we've got an alcohol processed oil both of them seem to be good there's one ever the other difference this cartridge right here is produced by C cell this is an M 528 Jupiter okay now this came from the can of clouds very nice this particular cartridge here this came from the pier this one as you can clearly see is an AV D cartridge I think we can see the model number underneath it looking at AV d 0 6 to 9 RP 1-800 - okay now well I was hiking I was utilizing both of these cartridges as they have different flavors and different effects and I was enjoying them immensely however I noticed before too long that my AVD cartridge which you can see right here this actually has a little bit of oil on the end right there and see it's actually caked all the way around the base of it here no for comparison we can get the C cell right here no oil in any of the pores the draw ports very clean very nice no you may think that this one was used quite a bit more than this one and therefore that may have been the cause that's not true I was utilizing them both through this vape mod battery it has a very simple magnetic connector you screw onto your 510 thread cartridge it is draw activated works very nice big clouds battery stays good most of the day not to worry now this cartridge which is only my second AVD cartridge that i've gotten recently has started to leak this of course is a C cell cartridge if you watch my videos you will know that I get C cells regularly for an example there are some of my cartridges from the recent days this is my only other AVD as you can see something is inside that cartridge I don't know if that was done when it was filling by the processor or if that was something left in there in the construction of the cartridge I'm not sure but this is my only other AVD I decided not to utilize this because that is an unknown factor it could either be from the processor or from the manufacturer but that being said these are all C cell cartridges they all work exceptionally well see cell C so C cell C so C so so that being said a VD I'm afraid I'm gonna have to buy another one and see if it does the same thing I am very happy with the quality of the can of clouds cartridges there were no massive temperature differences maybe 2025 degrees they were not sitting in the Sun at any point in time nor sitting in a freezing area this is something that does happen and it does occur so shop around a little bit watch some more of my videos and don't just watch my channel watch some other channels to see what they have to say about different cartridges that they've had experiences with because not all these companies are available in all the states that being said this is John with C&C connoisseurs you guys have a good day and I look forward to seeing you again peace", "rJMjnifYgts": "hey guys what's up my name is Mary I look like [ __ ] right now so I'm not really going to show myself but hello I'm here anyways so I'm going to be doing a quick little review on the King pen cartridges the strain one is trainwreck and let me just firstly say how disappointed I am I tried their cartridges before I didn't have that big of a problem with it I thought that the concentrate thought was in there was kind of thick that was kind of I guess a little indicator that there was something up with it but this the current time that I needed another one alright this is only one I could find so this is what I was dealing with and it was a lot worse than last time so mmm let me just show you I guess what this looks like as you can see instantly this looks just absolutely disgusting this is something that you clearly don't want to smoke let me focus game clothes do you see what is in there can you guys tell me what you think that is I mean this is clearly some type of like DIY cartridge or something that someone have [ __ ] me over on like Ivan like look at this color separation right here in this like air bubble that's neither floating up to the top may I tell you like this has been in the year for about nine hours and it has not moved let me flip it upside down nothing you can see it is slowly hardly moving at all but it is just so so alarming this is clearly my fault that I purchased this I got it for about $50 I don't know I'm just very upset about it I don't really know what is in there like I said if you guys know if you guys ever seen thing like this please tell me what you think this could possibly bleep like be cuz I'm actually scared too I smoked it a couple times clearly not that much because it's uh I didn't notice it until it got down to this bubble like how bad it was so yeah guys please be careful with the stuff you buy you never know what's really in it and that's the truth so yeah if you guys can just comment down below and let me know what you think what is in there cuz like I said clearly it's some some [ __ ] and I'm trying to figure it out yeah yeah", "DUojSc4O-K8": "okay so you take the cartridge you simply unscrew the lid very simply you then take whichever oil you decide to fill your cartridge with okay take your cartridge take your dispenser insert it fully into the unit and begin to dispense your oil okay as you can see the oil gets pushed down into the unit simply walk yourself around the unit slowly filling it up as you go leaving yourself some room at the top to put the lid back on okay at that point your cartridge has oil in it you simply take the mouthpiece slide it on begin to screw it crews right down just like that all right", "468eEqu9mmU": "hey guys what is going on today we're looking at another cart another TKO Sox cart I did another video on these except it was the makers of GG for flavor but these are very good um one of my favorites for black market carts anyway I want to make another video because pretty soon these tubes are going to be changing it's not going to be this child block thing it's gonna look like the normal TKO tubes just like a darker color so if you see this after that after they're released that that's just what's going on but um I think this straw Nana flavor I think it's I think it's better than the other one I reviewed the gg4 and I've hit a few other ones and I do think this is the one but the best one by far but um if you look at the wax or something I think it's pretty good it's like I'm it's a very natural dab flavor which is kind of what I look for in a cart to be honest in TKO you know obviously as we've gone through a lot of stuff right now but still very high quality product I'm not a fan of the know they're normal carts but these soft carts I think there are some of the best black market carts like out there to be honest there's not another kind of cart that's not from a dispensary that really hits you like this does and really tastes like natural dabs and I'm sure it's not the most safe thing I'm sure there's a lot better alternatives but before if you're on a budget and you don't want to go out of your way stand in a really long dispensary line to wait weeks for something if you just need something immediately I think this will definitely get you through the day or the night ever would after you use it for if you do pick one of these up I definitely recommend strong Anna for sure or the choclo that one was really good too but yeah they this company they have a website or I thought they did but cuz they keep their Instagram kept getting taken down and so I thought they made a website but I just cannot find it so I'm thinking maybe that got taken down to these carts and may not my my assumption is that these these guys are not going to around all that much longer so definitely try one but definitely stay safe make sure it's real compare it to other compared to this video compared to Instagram if you see them on there I think they're there Instagram but back up at this point but make sure it's real if it's fake if it tastes weird if it tastes this is gonna taste natural it's going to taste kind of like dabs very earthy I guess you could say if it tastes funky to you if it tastes if you get a bad feeling about just throw it out just just save yourself the lungs ear lungs and your in your heart just throw it out please for God's sakes there's so many horrible carts out there and horrible fakes and you could make the argument that TKO in general is fake the whole company's fake because it's not the ones that are in Cali in the dispensary but if you are getting this branded TKO be very careful and that's all for this video I have a discipline sweetheart video didn't come and sooo now no when whenever I feel like making it but yeah drop a sub for more", "AB9UI2RomnI": "ny Li cannabis come with a review on a HTE saucepan by CST certified select team this is a high Terp extract sauce cart which means that they produce the extract from flour and then they allow it to separate the THC a produces crystals at the bottom and the THC is the sauce on the top which is then poured directly into the cartridges which makes it a pure cannabis product without any additives this company's motto is culture and patience over profit which you can sure see in their products once again CST did it again with another amazing product", "90WDhrnrSZA": "what's up airbrush - boy you had them here for how cannabis live and we're back with another review video make sure you like subscribe and watch to the end for a chance to win a free prize also check out my website that be dead without Ohio canvass live.com enjoy the show [Music] what's up everybody employed mastermind here in Valhalla cannabis light and we have a very special review today this is the botanist has now put out products and they actually did a project with you guessed it would word make a fire rock and so now they've created a vape cartridge this basically fire rock or woodward flying cannabis flower or trim and they've used this to make TAC baked cartridges so here's some material that I received when I purchased my product and it says here the botanist babe Carter's art strain specific makes feature complex cannabinoid profile is crafted to unlock the natural benefits of the cannabis plant this is a targeted recipe our craft extraction techniques achieve a uniquely potent and truly flavorful product only one ingredient cannabis the botanist cartridge features a highly refined distillate based enhanced with a complex minor chemin of cannabinoids I can never say that right kind of annoys viana TC unlocking minor cannabinoids our distillate is refined using a proprietary post extraction process that captures beneficial minor cannabinoids that enhance the effect of the TC resulting in a smooth and highly potency product mmm purity no fillers or botanicals our base will never use any harsh fillers like vitamin E acetate or I like this one both technical terpenes I learned a lot about those recently our oil contains one ingredient cannabis okay this is single source terpenes stay true to distrain each botanist vape highlights the natural turf pain profile of its cannabis strengths our small batch extraction process gently recovers her opinions truly reflecting the plants full flavor profile in the finished product traceability know what you're buying our oil is made using ingredients that can be traced from sea to sail to ensure transparency testing results for our products are always available ok botanist and here's a close-up of the card now you can get this at the botanist I'm not sure if in a dispensaries had this yet this product costs fifty four dollars with tax in Columbus Ohio I purchased two products I purchased wedding cake cuz we've all heard of wedding cake right and I purchased the sunset sherbert we've all heard of that too also another great fire rock wood wood product so let's talk about the expects here the specifications the total THC on the wedding cake is three hundred and forty eight milligrams of THC 0 milligrams of CBD and then the other cabin noise it says CBG 11 milligrams this was manufactured on April 24th and packaged on May the fifth so this is literally just hit the market so you know today is May the 6th so this just got put in the box but it was also tested back on April 29 so it was also recently tested on the Box on the front it says 348 milligrams and it also indicates this is sixty nine point six two percent THC these are half gram cartridges so basically for $108 you'd have yourself a whole gram and you can obviously mix and mingle that and get a couple different ones now they also had another strain there which is by Buckeye relief called ninety two cookies I didn't try that one yet because I haven't tried to flour yet so once I tried to flower from Buckeye relief on a 90 cookies then I will try the cartridge so I can give you a review on that also one let you know that there are some other products that botanist will have these are the tinctures and that will be in a different video so we're not going to go too far into it now but I will tease that for you my car got a little wet you know how it be it happens when you're trying to wipe it down with with a wipe so you don't get any germs on it anyway so I have not opened these so imma let you guys get the same unboxing experience then I'm gonna have we're gonna experience this together and like I said I'm gonna hold this back so you get a little bit light on it but like I said I'm gonna turn this here and maybe we can see a little bit better and there's a little wood there on the box so there's a tab here and then there's also a seal there I don't know if you can see that on camera now but there is a seal there and so I'm gonna go ahead and open the one I want to open the one I've been rushing to open is the wedding cake so I'm cracking this seal baby doc at this crack with my nails and then I'm gonna I'm gonna pull out this little brown tab here I'm assuming that's what you're supposed to do so we're going to try this together folks and no-knock whoo-hoo now here's a surprise guys here is the cartridge interesting enough they have put a piece of styrofoam in there not sure I think that's just to stabilize it so that it doesn't get moved around I think that's good to keep it from being disoriented up close I could show you check it out now there is a washer on here which a lot of you familiar what this is for a different type of battery that has a magnetic mechanism on it so I'll show that again and then obviously this just screws off okay now it's just a regular 510 thread many of you asking me about that this is it guys this is a cartridge only product surprise no battery oh my gosh how are we going to hit this thing so we have a couple of different options first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to try to use a battery that came with the Cure Ohio cartridge for comparison here's a cure Ohio oil half a gram and here is the botanist Woodward oil obviously there is a color difference don't let that concern you oops good thing I didn't break that would be all that so many of you know the cure Ohio battery is reusable so I'm just going to screw this on here and we're gonna find out if the wool it's a work for us so here we go wedding cake by Woodward processed by botanist and here we go it does work impressions this is smooth it is not harsh I can taste a little bit of wedding cake but not a whole lot so I like the packaging I think it's smart to have a little styrofoam in there to keep it stabilized so it doesn't fall around in there and maybe get turned upside down the package is designed to hold it so that it doesn't have anything going on with it as far as its orientation I mean there are a few little bubbles in here but honestly folks that's not uncommon with vape oils especially when they're loading them hot so there could be able to few little bubbles I am but it is a very smooth bait but I'm looking at terpene taste and flavors I'm not really tasting any wedding cake terpenes that I'm familiar with and you know just for reference I currently have some wood wood wedding cake folks so I'm sure I'm not tasting turps on this so we've went through that one and you know I don't smell in terms either but what I could also do is I could put this on an aftermarket battery just to be sure and see if we get any difference because those batteries are pre-configured at a certain voltage and I've learned that sometimes having something at a different voltage will affect your experience in your taste so I have to set at three point five volts it's still very smooth it is a very smooth like this doesn't hurt your throat this is very smooth but I just don't really taste anything so I'm set that aside for right now this is a vision to spin our battery by the ladies man these are like tanks the next one we're gonna go ahead sunset server so I again box is the same same packaging specs comparing it to the Woodward let's see the total TAC for the sunset server is 346 milligram point 95 346 point nine five milligrams and also the CBG is 11 milligrams I will talk more about what CVG is comparing to CBD in a later video so or you can just you know look it up we'll talk about CVG and CBN as well okay this one package exactly the same way the oil quality is the same a nice clear gold color and I'm gonna do the same test I'm gonna put it on the trusty cure Ohio battery but you before I do that OPSEC removed a little magnetic adapter which comes in handy if you have one of those devices that has a magnetic battery and I go guys now lift the sunset server I taste I taste it I can taste a little bit more Terps terpenes with the sunset server it reminds me of the flower so I would say both of them hit smooth I would say there's even maybe a little bit more I mean this again maybe a little bit more of a bite then with the wedding cake feel a tickling my throat a little bit but is it art trying to sit on this and hit this all day probably so yeah I'm gonna do the same thing before I'm gonna swap it with my vision here and I'm gonna see how it tastes with the vision like I said and I've got the vision at the lowest voltage was 3.5 volts if you want to know I have no idea what the state has their batteries and hopefully set could be higher could be less we'll have to find out so here we go okay did we get our malfunction well that's interesting guys it's not working so let me try to turn yourself and this is a fully charged battery so let's see okay there we go interesting I had to turn my battery off and turn it back on all right so it's been a couple minutes and let's talk about effects so what did I notice because I'm familiar with both of both of these strains personally overall I don't have any immediate psychoactive I'm not overwhelmingly getting a head rush type feeling which is good I don't want something that's just gonna take my head off and make me feel like I'm getting ready to have a headache so I want a balanced effect not looking to just be you know out of my comfort zone I want something that makes me feel comfortable when I I'm very picky about fake cards and if you know me and watching other videos how many babe card videos have you seen so I don't do very many so whenever I do do one is because I want to find out if things are improving or if I'm gonna learn something about it and so other bait cars that I've tried I don't quite remember them having the CBG in it and so I need to do some more research about CBG before I start trying to tell you about CPG so I'm gonna do some homework on that and when I come back with a 92 cookies fake card that's when I'm gonna have a little bit more information about the CBT other than what I currently know now which is what it says on Wikipedia so I want to know some more about it and I want to have some more experience with this product that way I can tell you a little bit more details about what I'm feeling overall over time but immediately this definitely helps me with a little bit of my anxiety and this is actually a little bit relaxing to me and that's what I'm starting to feel as this video goes on normally I will take a break and come back but the effects are more immediate with this cartridge so there's no need for me to take a break and come back I'm already feeling some positive effects of the product so what I think the feedback will be is that the packaging is great I'm very satisfied with the packaging I think this is just big enough I like the slide out factor you just have to get used to pulling this brown part out to slide it out I think that was smart I think putting a little piece of styrofoam in there was a smart idea guys so if you guys have the botanist owners of the botanist if you're watching this I think you did a good job with your packaging the only concern I might have is that if we have a lot of these stacked up like this depending on where they are in a dispensary that the oil is gonna lay down and then you know I guess we need to find out it's getting this box stand on its own and I don't think that it can and so what I'm thinking is well let's see yes it can't stand us home so part of with for me I keep all my oil Carter just a nice write up so you know the easiest thing you could do you know is take maybe one of your other containers and just take your battery and set them in there and this is an easy way for people to keep your cartridges from being like you know all weird-looking when you pick them up never let your cartridge be stored laying down sleeping so I think botanist is showing me right here as I'm moving them around on my desk that this cartridge box can stand up on its own and so it's a product good idea when you're not using the cartridge maybe keep it stored in a box standing up near where it's not gonna have a lot of activity you know I'm a bum push it up against my desk I'm hitting my desk and the cartridge does not fall that the box is not falling over and so you you're doing better than I thought bottom this with the box I mean because size and dimension matters when you're trying to have something stored and something convenient so the box is standing on its own even though it's empty I have a good thought that it will probably do the same thing even if we put the cartridge in there so my opinion I think this is a good product for you to try if you're a person that likes bait cartridges if you are someone that is looking for a lot of flavors I think there's still some room to roll I think that they should work on adding a little bit more terpenes I want to really get that cake flavor when I hit the cartridge but at the same time I'm very satisfied with the effects of how I feel the house affecting my middle and I'm glad that is not overwhelming me or causing me to feel like I am just so impaired that I can't speak properly and I'm glad that is helping me with my anxiety and also with a little bit of focus and concentration so with that saying I'm gonna recommend that you do try these products and give them your honest review and your honest opinion and you can also send in your reviews to me at Ohio cannabis live at gmail.com or you can send me your videos through the messenger and I will happily share any videos or be glad to do an interview with you / zoom or Skype or messenger so that we can have an honest discussion about how you feel about this product because that's gonna be the new thing now as we're gonna start doing things together since we're all at home or on limited restrictions in some cases we have to start doing more stuff to interact with each other instead of just watching videos on videos are great but just the one sided video can get kind of boring so going forward we're gonna try to have some interaction and have some more people in these videos besides just me and I want to hear what other people's feedback is it's not all about just my feedback but your feedback matters too and that's why I added the feedback section on my website wlky.com and you can go there and give some growers some feedback and let them know how you really feel and I think that's important for the companies to grow so make sure that that like subscribe button I'm gonna go ahead and wrap this video and we'll see you again next time [Music] [Music]", "qPPSe6zEzEU": "let's go everybody Cuban chronic here another cannabis video / review here we got the bubbleman trinity pin by Marcus from bubbleman Richardson a big fan of his everything from his bubble bags to his dry sifting methods are definitely beyond any you can find anywhere else so you can always take bald man's word when it comes to concentrates in my opinion he came out with this fine bait pin unit see here oh this way it says bubbleman right on it nice silver always been my favorite tone was this nice metallic silver on the bait pin batteries he's got bubbleman B and bubbleman on his cart really slick little unit not gonna go through all that right now but this is mainly just to show how to fill a vape tank in this case of the bubbleman Trinity tank so in this case both man's got this really nice glass borosilicate glass or something like that outer and it's uh it's definitely it's able to take a lot of heat compared to most baked in so I go ahead and what I do take the cap off and you got this little opening here like most vape pens even the disposables look like this from brands like select other brands like that in recreational states I like to just heat the outside and you have these little glass syringes either come with select dabble bowls you get distillate and stuff from this from the dispensaries and outlets in little syringes like this also the blue river terpenes I believe come with a little syringe like this and you just mix your tips and your concentrates in the little glass syringe sometimes you gotta heat it I use my email and just kind of wipe the vial around on it just lightly heat it to get the oil to go where I need it to go and to use these that's all in my how to mix a sauce video you might want to check out but I'm gonna make this video as quick as I can here's the bubbleman Trinity tank I'm just gonna put my Enel coil around the edge and just heat this glass to a deist in temperature to where when the oil hits it's gonna run to the bottom I'm gonna show you guys how to load this without having the needle like they show in the bubble man Trinity videos this is for people that just don't have this is called a luer lock needle that would go here on the end and that's just for the dabbling hater and actually the terpenes come with the needle I have an eel but I'm gonna show you guys today how to load it with fountain one so you had this little tip here it's all glass these little dab of wool syringe containers for oil and I just heat this up on my email as well so I'm gonna heat both of them up and heat up the outside of the Trinity tank and I'm gonna heat up kind of the outside of my little syringe here full of turps and OG shatter his og chirps and Oregon Diesel OG shatter so so you can see when you have these syringes the oil starts coming out gonna suck them back so you don't lose any oil anyway I'm gonna show you the procedure around this little edge you see that hollow you just stick the dab locator end just right there against it and I just slowly press a nice bead around the edge of it and just keep it there against the seal and the edge of the container and since it's warm it's gonna just melt right into that space and I mean this is just for people that don't have the little luer lock needle that the Terps and things like that come with so you can see that oil is just dripping around there I'm just gonna heat it a little bit yeah I'll be really careful just little dabs of oil around the edge you really don't want to get ahead of yourself there we go hopefully show you guys a little view of this you can see the oils dripping down into the tank already it's looking pretty good so we're gonna go ahead add a little bit more around the edge here it's too crazy literally just wipe it off on there you know you learn to manipulate the oil a little bit doing this you'd see it's just draining down right into the right into it so let me see if I can get this a little bit closer for you see that oil is dripping down straight into the chamber see it slows down so you just kind of wipe it on the email again you can use a lighter on the outside and and just gently melt the oil down so anyway that's that's one way and some people be against it cuz you got to heat the oil a lot you can see it's just draining right down where it needs to go a little bit of oil left on the edge here and we just wipe into the pin here okay so well that's dreaming I'll show you guys one other method and that's with a luer lock needle and that's what these little dab locators have on the ends of them show you a sec this little needle off real quick so yeah you got these little luer lock tab locator your needles and so this this little lock that goes on the end of it so they just kind of slide on and off they twist on and off depending on where you get these from but that's what this locks into so these little needles come with my terpenes I ordered and usually get a little dab locator like this it really has to be heated to go through these needles and lock securely or all the oil kind of blow in between here but they work really well for Philly debate cartridges I'll show you now I'm gonna heat the oil good though and also heat the needle just a bit so that I know I'm gonna get a good run of oil through the end of it so I just heat the needle on the outside just a bit on my email lightly I don't want it too hot these are terpenes here and you can see it'll fit right in between that little space in the vial and as you've seen in probably other videos you can just just squeezes right in just see it there squeeze it all in there I fill the whole thing up use all the church sauce in there squeezed in there real nicely filled it up nice yes very nicely filled bubbleman Trinity pin and uh some little instructions in the Trinity says right here stand tank upright for 30 minutes to let after filling before use so anyway that's a little warning for you just kind of tells you what's gonna happen and if you're getting a boil around the edge like I said just heat it up a little bit make sure all your oil drains to the bottom I like to leave it open for a while with the cap off no matter what unit you're using if your units plastic definitely do not heat it it's not gonna work for you I recommend getting a glass one that's refillable admit to be refilled like bubbleman spins here I don't know if you buy those cheap ones I don't know if they're glass or not honestly people but bubble man's is definitely completely non-toxic materials all that stuff and I will say this is from a company that's called a w-9 tech or up tech and they are a great company any troubleshooting they're definitely there to help you they know a lot about their products so their customer service is on point and their shippings fast all that stuff man there's not a problem that I can understand why bubbleman chose that company and anyway there's the pin go ahead and just put the cap back on very nice I know I might as well just show you how to use the bubbleman pin click the button five times clicks on and now the greatest thing about the bubbleman pin is you can hold that button for up to 10 12 seconds but just take a rip and you hold it for 10 seconds don't even take her up and then hold it under 10 seconds and then start ripping and you'll get a huge rip but the the main process of using these from what they've told me is puff press and then pop so you let off the button afterward and clear the thing to suck more oil into the chamber to be burned for your next hit and it's a really good unit I've had it leak a little bit they sent me another cartridge and said hey man maybe it's a seal they just sent me another cartridge no questions asked they're great company so check them out a little demo for you so I'm going to puff press pump takes a minute to prime the oil but you want to let it just stand for 30 minutes so that it all that air bubbles and stuff come out but I like to heat the oil and it'll all just kind of exhaust the cap here and there and watch the bubbles come out of there and I mentally get all the air out and you can just hold that button literally watch it it's blue it'll turn off when it needs to do you get all that oil tar in it that's how you take a hotter DAP you see the size the hits you get me Trinity always cool it off afterward just by general inhale sorry about that coffin that's just how big it hits you get off this thing so anyway Cuban chronic this is the bubble man Trinity check it out at a w-9 tech or fresh head ease calm I gave it a 10 star review myself I mean I'm sure it'll be it'll be improved in the future who knows but it is definitely one of the best bait pens I've used as far as ripping first us stoners that's what we like nice good hits whatever hits we want light hits strong hits fill your own vapes there we go Cuban chronic dads ahoy everybody peace out", "A3ZFodq2bIY": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand new video today I got yet again another select wax cartridge I got you guys man you guys been doing these like wax cartridges I went for the hybrid I went for the cherry pie and so a little bit about this it's a hybrid I believe it's more than a sativa science I'm pretty sure because sometimes when it's yellow it's kind of like a sativa hybrid you know so it is cherry pie and I've tried this only like once or twice just because I throw this and I I bought this and all we're having at me and some of the guys were having a sesh so we just kind of threw this some rode oh and man like this man I only have it just a little bit enough just to kind of show you guys look at that all right right there so like always everybody we got to select you guys see that right there we like it that I just like that 83% zero six eighty three point zero six percent THC and it's some cherry pie you guys know was good I'm completely sober right now so we're gonna see how many hits it takes for us to get lit so cherry pie everybody again welcome to another podcast I hope you guys are enjoying these also everybody makes you guys drop a like the comment subscribe 18 another educational purposes like always everybody make sure you guys once again actually let's take let's take the first shrimp so on there's if we got a brand new pen this pen is actually a little bit different the red is actually the lowest setting the blue is like the medium and the green is like the highest so I'm just like wait what cheers everybody see if I could get like a taste okay so it does kind of become like a bit like a little cherry like a little cherry aftertaste like a little punch like a little cherry punch hmm see the cool thing that I like about select cartridges and regarding cartridges is they don't really be adding a lot of flavor sometimes when they be adding flavor that shit's kind of like a bad chemical you know I mean I'm pretty sure it's a pretty bad chemical you know if they were to add some flavor on it might be not too harmful but I mean if you guys are damn [ __ ] you guys are heinous [ __ ] all day you know it's just definitely bad for you but these happens man these are coming these be coming and going like crazy so look at that we got the little select logo um I think there is a couple pink ones bro like that strip tap fake select I feel like nowadays man they could probably make anything bro literally anything for example like again you guys know this I already tried on fake brass not though I seen fake King pens I've seen what other fake it's mainly brass knuckle I've seen a couple fake heavy hitters and it's just like damn people are thinking like man I'm getting the jug but in reality you guys are just can that custom that home that custom made oil could be a little bit cheap who knows some plugs can potentially make some good fire stuff so who knows but let's take another first hit select does not disappoint I mean out of all of them out of all of them I feel like select is top 3 I gotta admit top 3 when it comes to like actually getting lit again select does have like a little meaning like a point 3 cartridge which is like an ax it's in high 90 percent THC and oh my god roll you take a rip of that 1 or 2 a deer man but it's not around like 40 50 bucks just for that little piece of like super concentrated THC it's crazy but a cheers OH I think now I feel like I can probably tell the difference from a lot of wax cartridges like this definitely has select I'll written all over like all of them have like different tastes if it's crazy the raw garden one you can tell right away like bro if I were to close my and I woulda hit a wrong garden and if I were to know if I were to hit a rock garden I'd be able to tell it's like you know chewing out a piece of leaf you know piece of tree piece of bush and that's the leg type I got that it's so weird I'm not I'm horrible at explaining especially explaining a taste but it has like this let me see if let me see if I can explain to you guys definitely I think select cartridge is a lot better than a Moxie but the Moxie does have a really great flavor but again you know that's what a lot of people say you know when it has a good it has like a good candy type flavor and yeah it's definitely not good for you you know because they'd be adding stuff for the flavors because in reality it's like okay if they were to press a certain tree huh you know what there's just so much to it man I there's so much learning to this to this industry you know like I just I just keep thinking about it like it doesn't make sense because sometimes when you don't taste something I'm just like okay cool it's legitly the concentration you know it's literally the oil from the flower you know it's nothing else added to it which makes it just taste like like literally just one single taste which is kind of dough same with raw garden that's what I figured you know Rob garden it always has like the same flavor that same strong flavor with like maybe a little hint of something and you can tell but it depends on the flower like the natural flower you know but sometimes we have like for example I'm not saying heavy hitters brass knuckles and all that stuff sucks or anything like that I'm still gonna cop some here and there but I'm saying like the flavor is too artificial like it's not artificial but it definitely for me I feel like they could potentially add some something to it just so I could get that flavor you know but I could be wrong you know I could be wrong that's just my thought but again everybody I'm not saying to not buy those brands you know because in reality they are you know proved as long as you guys are like like legitly getting them from like the club or the you know the dispensary and stuff you guys aren't really getting them from your local drug dealer cuz your local drug dealer listen to this you guys I talk about this in all pretty much all my wax cartridge videos because sometimes you know these guys they could probably make the wax you know the oil pretty good and you know what hey you got yourself a good cartridge homemade wax you know but at least it's like nothing crazy you know but then there's also other cartridges you know for example like in my experience what I had is like you know I poked out in a couple times and they just turned brown and I'm just like yo this does not look normal yeah it was like a thirty dollar brass knuckle you know like it was definitely fake it was not it was not the real brass knuckles of faith it was a fake brass knuckle but that's one way you guys could see and sometimes let's chop the other sensitivities 1 2 3 I think it's just good 3 oh wait a minute green as the middle one look at that that green is definitely the better wood yeah green is definitely the middle one tastes a lot more made-up fatter cloud and I do see a couple people sometimes like there was this um I had a friend that they came to visit me during my lunch yeah my old job right and they were like eh like you smug and I was just like well I mean sometimes you know not all crazy she's like they're like oh I got a I got a wax pen right I'm not gonna call them out or anything but like yeah I got a wax Maran I was like yeah that's good so they took it out right and I looked at it don't like have a halfway smoke and I was like what is this it was like some off-brand you know wax cartridge right and I was like I like bro you're selling your smug on some fake ass [ __ ] didn't it was just like so black the oil will you see this right here the oil it's like halfway through maybe like they smoked it like right here no no maybe like right there like literally get halfway and I guess what they said was that it just started turning black and I was like dude you know that's like when that's when it's fake and I was like what kind of car is it was like some designer brand not a designer brand I come it was some type of brand where I'm just like - right off the bed I'm just like yeah man you got to turn me little your local drug dealer huh you know my head I'm like why you know 1 2 3 all right let's try it off in the in the max um setting well I have your cloud the taste it's not too gay Don the highest win oh not too good this pen is to spit it's $50 pen don't get me wrong it's a nice pen but definitely not for Lake we tried a couple well we tried a couple um we tried a couple of these select cartridges already I liked select so it was literally like the first one to go to like this is the one that I wouldn't always like gay you know it's really good brand you know but right now the brand that I've kind of uh have been buying lately there's a lot of regarding rocker and is really nice rock garden is a good one but don't get me wrong rock garden and select are way different and they're both good so you know you could either go this router this round or you know cop one of each but definitely switch off you know mine I'm definitely gonna cop another Moxie cart I really like the flavor I mean it's some light resident in a wax cartridge you know and it's it's only $25 1/2 gram this one was about $35 1/2 gram I believe or 25 no no no I think this was 20 bucks I think $20 a minute there look at the thing dude half gram was like 25 I believe 25 um so it's not that bad whatsoever you know I like it it's a hybrid it doesn't have me all slump or like super awake I mean I like that super awake feeling you know the sativa that way I could be very productive but right now it's almost gonna be 9 p.m. so might as well you know just hit some in because and stuff like they're you know such it's pretty good oh one thing that a lot of people do not know and then my dumb ass just remembered especially here right here let's check this out so the directions or suggested serving a suggested serving which is one serving is three seconds so this is one serving I think I went a little overboard at three four seconds but three to four seconds is one serving and there is a hundred and twenty five servings so it's so let's see so let's start off it says right here look one three second draw and close cartridge contains 125 servings so what one three second draw is a so three times 125 so if we were to drag this it would take 375 seconds and if we were to do that and be around six or seven minutes so wait a minute so six or seven minutes of you pump that makes sense because if you're just gonna go sir like four minutes you'll smoke the whole thing hmm six eight minutes of hitting and that's why I love having baby hits - oh okay now that - that was just like a little fact that I just like read from the back a lot of people don't really know but yeah usually it's like a three to four second scene and I'm different once I'm pretty sure it's for all of them it's for the 510 thread the the pens or whatever but um um so three to four three to four seconds is one hit yeah but you have around 125 settings so if you were to take at least one serving a day that's literally a 125 1/2 gram of this but that means you have to be like super lightweight you never had any type of th in your blood whatsoever you know oh and another thing too that I'm just spacing out at this point what at this point pretty much what you want to do is I guess one of my boys put me on actually shot up oil yeah shout out chicken but pretty much when you hate when you have a pen you want to hit it right you hit it and then you have to wait I think maybe like 30 second I believe I freaking forgot but he said 30 seconds or more you have to you want to wait like 30 seconds in between that way it kind of cools down you know because if it's too hot the coils it might not burn right you know you might not get the best like the full potential of the hit you know so you want to make sure that you wait at least 30 seconds let it kind of cool down is that way so you can get like the best you know now I'm gonna try to tell everybody that because he told me that I'm just like dude I see people just rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out past I see a little person rip it blow it out and I'm just like damn maybe that's all the wax is being over burnt and it's not even like I mean at the same time it's it's gonna get burned you know it's gonna file but if you want to have like a perfect hit that's when you have to wait at least like over 30 seconds that's what he told me you know and in my head I'm just like yeah it makes kind of sense but let me know in the comments down below what do you guys think crazy stuff man but I just said bad but man but if you say man isn't but right out it just sounds like Pampa that's crazy so there we have it everybody we have some elite select cherry pie hybrid wax cartridge I hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure you guys drop a like a comment subscribe again this is the podcast thank you guys for tuning in like always let me know the comments down below if there's any cartridge or

kingpin Skywalker oh gee goof we got a lot of them oh look at that better mode you better off fire yeah fire", "wWN8KL2KLvQ": "although friends have we doing it's been a decently long time since I did a video I apologize for that you know it's just like anybody you sometimes you struggle with content that one of release really good content so it's just been a few minutes since I release and stuff today's video I get a lot of questions about is what are we going to do with your leftover carts and we get a lot of these you know questions about these cartridges there's so many of them there's a bunch of different ways they connect together and really but it's really quite simple you can definitely get inside the carts even if there's a lip just a little bit of oil less than that we want to make sure we're using all that yeah this is a very expensive program and using all your medicine efficiently is really what's going to make that make or break it one month to the next without further ado you're gonna need a few things so I got what I did is I put a hook up excuse me a couple different cartridges together just show you different brands who we got here we got standard forms brand cartridge we got GTI brand cartridge and then we have a Terrapin brand cartridge right these are simple they just screw off they're not hard I'll do one for you right now this particular one is GTI and you just squeeze here and rotate righty-tighty lefty-loosey real easy to way to remember don't you get that off that's your trash this is what you're going save now some of you might be wondering what in the hell are you gonna do with that that that's gonna be worth my medicine there's a got a lot of things you can do you could soak it alcohol you can soak it in warm dump MCT oil or like tonight what I'm going to do tonight is I'm gonna heat up a little bit of high fat milk on the stove and once it's up the temperature I'm gonna drop like no no like 10 of these and there mix it together you'll start to see the milk turn like you know an amber color if you use the llars or the co2 carts how about them light tint to it that's your indicator that nicely you know this is already smoked up you know and you just kind of stir it in there you know not overheat this is something we made out of so it does get warm so it's okay to begin something that is warm you know you don't want to go ahead and throw them in the milk turn the milk on high and boil the cart in the metal together I don't recommend that I always heat up my milk and one for my milk is that temperature which is just slightly similar in our a little bit of bubbles I'll go ahead and throw it in there I'll mix that together add a few little bit of a chocolate then I'll mix that together but that's in a different video we'll do that specifically for the other brand cartridges like let's see we got here like your moxie carts or your LLR carts yes Koecher tangi whoa love it best corn ever and then you got your where these that's your outage this is your another one of those Cresco carts as well all right so we got that banks are you know what to say in a christelle cart this is actually a grassroot cart so these three carts here have compression fittings and this is why you're going to need these two tools and the two tools I'm speaking about today it's just like pair of vise grips pair of needle-nosed that's all I'm going to show you how I'm going to take this apart let's move this camera down here to see these guys are able to see what's going on on the table alright so once I've worked with a lot are these crest coats like I said kosher tangi you know sorry everybody all character changing is my favorite cartridge in the whole program it's amazing if you haven't tried it I highly suggest you check it out we're gonna want to do this right where that strip is you're going to get that in your vice grips now if when you initially put that down there I can't squeeze that it's too tight you don't want to squeeze it too tight so then you're just gonna loosen this up which is gonna allow you to lock that end see that and without holding it it's gonna not fall out and we want it to not be able to be wiggled either because if this is you can wiggle this that means it's not tight enough even if there's a little bit of play in there we want to make sure you got as much tightness as possible you know without squishing it okay so that's how that's going to look and then you can try a couple different ways you can put it on here and just work your way back and forth slowly but surely you don't want to squeeze this metal piece here bat metal piece if you squeeze that a bunch of times you're gonna make it hard for yourself I come out here or what I do another good trick is to stick your needle nose inside there put a flap down on the table and just give it back and forth little Wiggles stabilize your base of your car just so if it becomes an issue you can get it out what I like to do is increase the tightness on the court remember you don't want to squeeze you don't want to squish it and then and as you can see I'm squishing the crap out of the top of that but sometimes that's what's needed if you just wiggle back and forth boom off cam your piece and as you can see the end is good and I squeezed out of there and now I can gain access to all my compression fitting carts with all my medicine in there and that's what that end piece looks like I know you ladies are gonna ask me where I where I got this sweet little robber thing for the car actually a buddy of mine and 3d printed it for me my man Eman you're the man dude thank you so much that's awesome all right so just dump gonna do one more a couple one more here with these twisties just so you can see it up close just kind of twist it that's it if that has a bunch of stuff on there you can even throw that in just don't throw any rubber in and buy rubber you'll see like that sometimes I had this little rubber piece or they come on the bottom you don't want to go thread up and there don't kind of get in your way I know another one of the carts that have a big problem is these Moxie carts I'll do one more of these just to show you squeeze it right there clamp it down stick your partner map there we go squeeze the crap out of that hmm actually the moxie was easy easier to get often the crest Gallic has like it's like a little rubber piece so it just kind of flexed off on me which is nice that's pretty cool now you just kind of repeat this process until you get a bunch of carts opened any stuff you can move away from the top you feel free to do so but all that hot liquid is gonna get inside these carts so you can just leave these open like that and believe it or not there's another thing you can do now I don't recommend anyone just doing this but you can definitely get one of those extractor kits with the hollow needles and just suck up as much oil as you can honestly this is I've did that before this is still the best way I've ever figured out how to use my empty carts it's very efficient people are gonna ask me what's your dosing size generally when I do this I'm doing this on a Saturday or day I know I'm gonna have off I'm gonna do about five to ten carts that have a little tiny bit of oil if you get one like especially the standard forms ones oh wow I caught that you see how much of that is up there that's a lot of will right so maybe on this batch if I have something that has that thick that much oil at the top caked on there I might drop it down one or two carts just cuz I know it's gonna be pretty strong that day you know and then you know like I said I'll be making more videos and I want to definitely make a video on how to actually put these in some form of edible or drink and I will definitely be doing a video that in the future so thank you every much everybody thank you for watching take care of yourself and each other and hang loose", "h2TK4YnrakI": "what is up can a fam so for this video I'm gonna be reviewing this star duster the live sauce 1 gram BHO made by Willamette Valley alchemy and cultivated by Fox Hall of flora and again this is live selfs so this is like a live resin and I'm assuming it's Aussie because you know it is sauce and so I'm assuming it's kind of like a Terp sauce live resin mix something like that along those lines anyway let's first get into the packaging on this alright this is a nice cool little packaging I like the box I like it you know it looks professional looks neat everything's well displayed I like that you got the people that cultivated it box olive flora right here on the side shout out to them they make some good products then of course you know Willamette Valley alchemy right there on the front and then we're gonna open this up oh got a coin got a wooden coin here that's really cool comes with like a little wooden coin so like you get the more fancier stuff they make sure that they show you a little bit of appreciation here I wonder what it says our library also steaks extensive planning with producers often sacrifice that is true all caps true to its name live resin has become a Willamette Valley alchemy specialty product it has been created with you in mind so that's cool that's cool best letting me know that hey they take a lot of time and care and creating this product or made the consumer that's also letting me know that they're you know they sacrifice a little bit so therefore you know that's why it's a little more expensive a product so this comes in recreationally at 48 dollars a gram again that's rec and then for medical would be like 42 to 40 depending on what the you go to and get it at this one I picked up at kindly dispensary in Pendleton Oregon so that's Eastern Oregon highly recommend that dispensary much love and then yeah that's that's it but it's still a cool package cool container this is glass it's got the safety top you got a push down to open and voila there is our amazing looking live sauce oh you got chunks in there just nice little chunks oh and it smells great that's smells delicious I just want you know what I mean like that mmm man okay so I'm already hooked huh I love it already Oh also this is coming in at 75 percent THC with little-to-no CBD and they don't tell me anything else they don't tell me like terpene results or anything like that so I know whatever but sup we're gonna try it out anyway and to be honest the way it just smells you can just smell it it's Turkey as hell ma'am you just want to live in there just curl up and just anyway so alright I'm just looking at seem make sure I didn't miss anything I want to make sure I tell you guys everything that's about this product that this package has to display and again this is the star duster unsure of what strains make this I'm pretty sure this is a hybrid although it doesn't tell me I don't think [Music] no does not tell me if it's a hybrid or not but I'm pretty sure it is ibrid what side it leans more on the sativa or indica side I don't know I wish I could tell you guys but I don't know never heard of this strain before so this would be my first time with this strain and this is definitely not my first time with some live resins although this is my first time with any company that's called it live sauce we about to get sell see in here drop a like if you're getting saucy with me drop a like if you like the sauce the Terp sauce and let me know if you're a church Church [ __ ] in the comment section below right because god bless those Turks well alright [Music] Oh 302 oh one alright we're gonna let this cool down here because we don't wanna be taking no hot dabs in the meantime I'll show you guys so this is the UV reactive in the woods rig I call it the in the woods burg I don't know the technical name but fully UV reactive I mean it's got beautiful pink in there one thing I really love about this rig I don't know if you guys would be able to see it at this front facing camera but those mushrooms those other mushrooms in there they glow a nice blue color saying with that nice blue I like that UV reactive blue it's really beautiful yeah then with the water and the tree and the mushrooms and the grass it just ties this piece all together Oh also we got the their CV there's UV and then up here is Oh pink UV alright so there we go again one gram live cells let's take her let's take this chunky I don't know if you guys can see it but there's like a good size like a little diamond chunk right up here we're going to take that coming with me [ __ ] there's a meeting at the fire pit whoo and we're gonna get some of that Oh Terp sauce of course in there so what I'm thinking is and this is just a theory I don't know what I'm thinking is this is live resin and they squirted some turk sauce on top of it so and that's just I don't know but that's way it kind of looks like because all the Terps are kind of just over here you gotta kind of scoop them up so [Music] all right I think we're about where we want to be on temperature-wise and again much love guys I hope you guys are having a good one thank you for watching this video and be sure to check out my lab at Valley alchemy on Instagram so you can stay updated with all their great products that they got coming out all right here we go left off wanted to take this really low so I could taste those chirps [Music] oh man that taste so great that really does it's like a super smooth I gotta say that right off the bat it's super smooth normally I call but I mean it's just got this sweet almost like lemon candy flavor almost he did it's fantastic I'm gonna do a little bit of a reheat here although I'm not gonna do it too long [Music] all right [Music] nice taste really good dad is really good the highest grade instant dealers again live resin is always great I always love forever my present at this stuff well lament I don't know if you're watching this video but if you do end up watching this video will lament you guys killed it all right you guys killed it with this one this stuff is a-ok I give it two big thumbs up two big thumbs up and let me tell you why because a it's a great product like overall like it looks great it smells great I mean it's live resin and it's uh you know the turkey is [ __ ] next would be the the test results it test results good 75% it's good it's not bad that is definitely not bad especially when you want something that's a little mortar P than just straight loaded with THC oh then um next number C or letter C sorry oh hi I'd have to give you for the price point alright the price point is great $48 for rec which is a great price point for this this is live resin which something like this from other companies that I've seen have gone you know sixty to eighty dollar range for a gram so the fact that you can pick this up at rec price for 48 dollars a gram is fantastic in my opinion and of course you know medical you're gonna get a cheaper but that is another you know just in my book you know like just check check check great stuff about this product that I really like and enjoy I will say this that I do not like that they put it in a glass container just because I wish it was like silicone or something like that be a lot easier to get every last little bit however if you're one of those people that have a glass container with dabs in it like this or you know maybe something that looks like this see how this is glass you've got a bunch of whatever tabs that you're you know tool isn't gonna get all you got to do is get a straw like a drinking straw for like a soda and then you know maybe if you have to get your container a little warm with like a lighter you're not gonna actually heat it up just get a little warm and you can scrape all of it off with that straw all of it you can get every last little bit okay and then all you do is you take your damn stick out of the end of the straw hit the down BAM just like that that easy example um anyway this is the star duster alright live sauce 1 gram BHO by Willamette Belly alchemy

news news [Music] hey guys i'm christine slofani for tnm news and welcome to costa atlantica and punta cana dominican republic unfortunately i'm not here to report on the legalities for marijuana in the dr which by the way cannabis is not legal here but while i am here i did think to bring along my weed pen and this morning i placed it on the counter i turned my back for a second and it rolled off and broke and i'm heartbroken but it got me thinking about a few ways that you can salvage the oil in your wheat pen if you break yours of course breaking it accidentally is not the only reason a pen will malfunction sometimes when dealing with weed pens atomizers burn out from turning the temperature too high on a battery or sometimes the battery just won't hold the charge at the end of the day the majority of the vape cartridges are not made with the best quality batteries and technology so they're bound to break from time to time one of the best ways to remove oil from a vape cartridge is to take a small syringe similar to the ones they use to put the oil into the cartridge the mouthpiece on the majority of the standard pre-filled cartridges can be unscrewed once the mouthpiece is unscrewed you can then tip the tip of the syringe into the open cartridge from there it should be pretty easy to pull out all the oil next all you would have to do is just purchase an empty cartridge from a vape shop or online once you obtain that you can simply push the oil straight into the empty cartridge and you're good to go [Music] now if you don't have an empty cartridge to refill but you have a syringe full of oil well then it's time to do some dabs you can use any dab rig that you would normally use with the concentrates that you purchased from a dispensary just simply heat the nail or banger on your dab break let it cool and slowly push on the syringe until a drop of oil falls out and then inhale the smoke now if the oil seems to be too stable to push out of the syringe then try and heat the syringe so that the oil becomes more viscous but don't over heat or burn the syringe hot air from a blow dryer usually works best or you can even use hot water as long as there's a strong sealed cap on your syringe [Music] now the simplest way to salvage oil that you pulled out of a broken marijuana cartridge is to eat it that's right after you pulled the oil out of the cartridge you can actually eat it you can add it to any meal or drink to consume the concentrate since the distillate does not have thca there's no need to decarboxylate the marijuana as it's already ready to consume the moment you pull it out of the cartridge the other ingredients in vape cartridges are generally regarded as safe to consume by the fda so you're pretty much good to go and you can add the oil directly to any food or beverage risk-free another option for you is to simply put a small bit of oil on top of a regular marijuana flour bowl now you can use a pipe a bomb a bubbler or any other smoking device just put a few drops per bowl and that should enhance the flour you're smoking some people even like to put some drops of oil in blunt wraps or on joints um and it works like a charm and it makes the smoking experience just a little bit sweeter i think anyways now if you're thinking of using the oil to make your joint a super joint well then i recommend putting the oil on the outside of the joint after it's rolled then if you want to get really crazy and you happen to have some keep saved up in your grinder then you can actually roll the joint into the key basically making your own moon rock joint and lastly if the oil you have is thin and might have already been cut with polyethylene glycol or something similar it should work in an e-cig or an e-juice vaporizer and there you have it making the best out of a bad situation i hope this video helped you figure out a way to salvage the oil from your broken weed pen obviously you want to be as careful as possible with cannabis products because sometimes accidents happen but marijuana is expensive so don't waste it if you don't have to for more cannabis news visit us at tnmnnews.com don't forget to give us a follow

guys p2 peeps and continuing our uh you know fake cartridge exploration we're going to be taking a look at some real fake cartridges so um background on these i have tried these before i have tried uh two of them before and now when the time i tried them uh they were definitely a really cheap price and i was thinking to myself like yeah dude i trust my plug these you know looks great oil looks like a good color and um you know it hits okay and i'm getting i'm getting loaded so it's whatever you know 15 a gram it's cool but uh now that i'm older and wiser i know that's kind of dumb like sure you could trust your plug but dude if you're not actually getting the lab results or anything that's really scanned or verified or you don't or like you know if you know or you don't know i mean if you don't know uh what is inside of the cartridge like you didn't see the person fill it up um then don't trust it that's just the rule of thumb here guys like when it comes to concentrates and um cartridges and things like that you might be thinking no one's got time to fake any of that stuff or whatever whatever but honestly they do got the time people make a killing off of these cartridges off of killing people so just be careful what you put into your body and if you're buying cartridges off the street please make sure that is not any any dank vape stuff or any of those weird you know cartoon graphics on the the box just because someone's got a box that's got like a graphic on it doesn't mean anything so guys um i'll show you guys first the worst looking cartridge of them so this is the uh container they came in this is a clear kings i'm not sure if anyone's ever had a real clear kings or anything like that but if you guys have please let me know down know down below in the comments and you know let me know how that was for you so it says here on the front store at room temperature exposure to direct sunlight may cause cartridge to leak or oil to discolor that's something that i thought was going on with this guys this is the cartridge we're working with you see those black splotches and stuff all around it that's that's not supposed to be there you know we see that the black spot just here down there and um you know let's just take a look at a thickness test i'm just going to turn this to the side look how fast just look how fast that oil is traveling that's not that's not natural for your regular oils yeah grab my cart right here real bear lab stuff look at that nothing it's barely moving on this one but look at that it's already almost separated entirely to the bottom see nothing's moving still from this nothing yet and yet in only about 10 to 15 seconds this is already dripping to the bottom so that's another thing that threw me off about the cartridge you know the color and um how fast it was you know moving down and things like that but when i first got it guys it was not this color it was not this color it was like a golden color so let's read a little bit more here on the label and packaging i'm not sure guys if this brand is exactly like a fake brand or not you know i don't want to call them out because for all i know this could be a real brand that's just uh you know getting getting under fire um or getting copied but yeah see this whole thing has you know all these uh labels and websites and you know warnings and things like that but those are really easy to print on to just about anything nowadays so you can't always trust your plug stuff just because it's got a label like i was saying the ingredients here let's see it says distillate and fractionated coconut oil uh on the ingredients there so um yeah that kind of threw me off so when i was first hitting these their flavor was uh the thing that really stood out to me i definitely tasted that little coconutty flavor so that's why i when i first had these i was thinking these are all right you know these aren't too bad i wish they could have better dirt flavors but you know for a small cart brand this isn't that bad 20 15 a gram that's that's way too cheap you know at the time of course i didn't really think about that so yeah this is definitely not good oil definitely not you want your oil to be thick if your oil is moving around this fast it is not all oil this has definitely been cut with something else and that's why it is super liquidy you know another reason why a cartridge may be super liquidy and move around fast is because it's it might be you know surrounded by a lot of heat things like that but in this case it's about room temperature in here guys i've been keeping this in a drawer this is not this one specifically has not seen any sunlight at all so the fact that it has turned this color is definitely alarming so that was this cartridge this uh wedding cake one and so now we'll take a look at the next cartridge we have from the same brand and uh i'm sure same source this one is a runts cartridge so like i said before it's the same same brand and all that stuff so it should have the same ingredients etcetera etcetera but the surprising thing about this one is i've had these for just about the same time and this one still retains its golden color uh it still looks pretty decent you know um one thing i'll also say guys about uh fake cartridges is the rod size so uh here let's actually do another direct comparison between this one and the bear labs car so as you guys can see this cartridge on the left here is a lot thicker in the rod the middle portion than the cartridge on the right here see the rod on this cartridge right there it it's a lot thinner you know it gets thick to the bottom base here but for the most part your cartridges from the dispensary or legal sources are going to have that a lot skinnier rod and you can see here it's just thick all the way down through there it doesn't really get too big towards the bottom there uh when you see the bottom you know what i mean it gets a little bit wider but not by a bit like by too much where as if you look to here the size of it gets a lot bigger towards the bottom so yeah if you see um cartridges with just rods that are way too big down and you know the ones in the middle that's another sign that you could be dealing with a fake cartridge so these rods uh the thicker rods here allow for less product to be placed in so typically you see these on the street because uh street plugs can just short you easily they can just give you like .75 in a cartridge that's supposed to hold a gram and it'll still look full because uh you know the rod's bigger now one thing i'll say is that sometimes uh oil gets stuck in the wick so when you do buy from dispensaries if something looks like it's a little a little under it's definitely just some stuff that is stuck in the wick of the cartridge so yeah this is the same exact thing you know same exact cartridge except for the oil now let's do the liquidy test here and as you can as you guys can see it's a little bit thicker than the previous one but still that bubble is moving way too fast guys way too fast so if if you're if your oils are doing something like this in just the span of like five to ten seconds i highly suggest you put that [ __ ] down because you have just no idea what's going on with that anymore um so yeah look i know there's some people out there who uh your plug might be your only cartridge source or um you know you might be in a legal state so it's just a lot harder to get legit things but um i just have to encourage you guys to please be safe these could these can like you know fake cartridges can literally kill you or destroy your lungs if you don't want it you know if you don't care whether you smoke more or you know like every day pretty much for the next 20 years then go ahead and smoke more fake cartridges it's definitely gonna bust up your lungs like i said guys i tried two of these i thought it was okay but on my second one i knew something was fishy because my throat was getting scratchy i was coughing on hits like that were not supposed to make me cough you know i was taking small baby hits of a regular flower and that [ __ ] was making me cough my throat was itchy and scratchy for days i wasn't breathing right for a little bit and that was just off a few puffs of a second cartridge so you know i'm one you know wondering what would have happened if i had continued to smoke that cartridge all the way down to the to the end you know some people will smoke their fake carts and feel totally fine and just keep going with it and for those people i mean do you you know i'm just encouraging people to to smoke safe and be safe because at the end of the day when it comes to concentrates people can put whatever they want in it man i'm not saying stay off it's just like you know stop popping off your plug when it comes to you know your meds or whatever do whatever you want um you know flour can be overpriced at the dispensary but when it comes to cartridges and concentrates guys please please try to make sure you know what's getting put in it and you know what where it's being sourced from all that stuff you know you want to know as much as possible about these concentrates because pesticides can slip in there pines i've heard people slipping pine sole into cartridges you know actual cleaner that's like pledges and stuff like that like that's that's crazy that's you know like i said it's poison so once again guys let's take a a final look here the one on the left has all those little weird black splotches and things like that the one on the right still looks totally fine um but again guys the way those bubbles move way too fast so we can do let's do a quick little comparison of the bubbles here um obviously the one on the left is uh traveling a little bit faster because i think the bubble is bigger you know there's less product in there and um another thing is i hit it a bit so maybe it's been heated up a bit and whatever was liquefying uh or you know was liquefied in there is a lot like more uh i don't know the word i'm forgetting it but a lot more movable but yeah i'm definitely not going to be trying any of these guys i'm really only holding onto these for reference so yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please leave a like comment subscribe and i'll be you know talking more about fake cartridges as time goes along answering questions uh dropping more knowledge that i know about them and things like that but uh yeah this was a good thing for i guess people who would want to know from an eye test how to tell if their cartridge is uh fake or at least how to know if i should be a little suspicious about it so yeah thanks everyone for watching if you enjoyed as always please leave a like comment and subscribe p2 out peace you", "n7cP6YWO_nc": "Hey guys, Nick with Precision here and\ntoday I'm gonna teach you a brief overview on how to make every extract\nunder the sun. So what I want to start off talking about is live resin and why\nlive resin is so relevant in the market and why you guys hear this this term\nbeing thrown around rather commonly. So live resin, the entire process really,\ntakes into account harvesting the plant while it's still technically \"alive\". So\nyou're harvesting the plant, you're not drying the plant, and what you're\nactually doing is taking those flowers and putting them into a vacuum type food\nsaver device and freezing them right away. So you can imagine like harvesting\nfresh blueberries or strawberries obviously you want to pick at the peak\nof ripeness, so that you have the maximum amount of terpenes, the maximum amount of smell, flavor and all the positive attributes of that plant. And you're\nactually freezing that in time by putting it into a freezer once you put\nit into the vacuum bag. Now it's very common for some people to deep freeze\nthat could be all the way down to -40C or -80C. I would say most commonly\nit's somewhere between -10C and -40C, so once we have this\nmaterial harvested and we have it frozen in vacuum bags - ultimately what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to extract it and we're going to extract it with\nhydrocarbons. The reason that we use hydrocarbons is because it's a very\ngentle process. The process of using hydrocarbons will actually take those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes out without disturbing a lot of the other\nplant-based matrices that are in there, and our result ultimately is a extract\nthat is very, very close to the native plant. So when you smell the extract of\nthe plant that we've extracted via a live resin process what will happen is\nyou'll actually smell the original orientation of that plant, it you'll have\nthose original flavors and they'll be extremely robust, extremely profound in\nthe way that you're actually smelling and almost tasting it when you consume\nthe product. Now the best analogy is if we keep that\nfreshness preserved we eliminate the oxidation, the degradation, and all the\nthings that can kind of take that \"fresh fruit\" so to speak or that \"fresh cannabis\"\nand turn it into rotten cannabis so to speak or rotten fruit. And that's\noxidation, that's degradation from the environment that could be disruption or\ndegradation from high temperature solvents. So with live resin were always\nfocused on preserving that natural state of the plant. We're focused on freezing\nthat biomass right away, and we're focused on ultimately extracting it at\nvery cold temperatures to retain our terpenes, to extract the cannabinoids in\na very gentle fashion, and ultimately to have a highly, highly desired end product\nthat's artisanal and a vast majority of consumers enjoy in terms of theirs their\nsatisfaction of consumption as well as their ability to just actually taste and\nsmell the product once it's been on the shelf for a while. So that's just an\noverview on live resin and the next thing I'd really like to talk about and\ngive you guys an overview on is shatter. So you may have seen shatter in the\nretail dispensaries and things like that and ultimately with shatter we're trying\nto get that end product from a sort of a plant-based entrapment of those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes to a glass-like finish. So it's very common at\nroom temperature for shatter you hit it and it'll shatter almost like a piece of\nglass. To get that consistency there's certain aspects of extraction, certain\nthings that you want to deal with. Shatter first and foremost is always\nmade with hydrocarbon, and the preparation of the biomass is almost\nalways under every circumstance dried very, very, very, very well almost to a\nfive percent or lower humidity. We want to avoid a lot of that water that would\nbe pulled out with the solvent, and we ultimately want to extract that product\nat a cold temperature in order to avoid a lot of the lipids and fat profiles\nthat you might create by extracting with a warmer temperature solvent. Hydrocarbon is obviously ideal for this because not only can we extract with hydrocarbon\ncold but it's hydrophobic so that the water is going to be separated very\neasily from the hydrocarbon, but in addition to that it's going to extract\nthat cannabinoid profile and it'll extract those terpenes with leaving\nbehind,  because of the cold temperature, a lot of those fats, waxes, and other\nadulterants that we don't want in our end product. So when making shatter are\nultimately extracting the dry biomass with the cold solvent we're going to\ntake that to a finishing process which is called vacuum oven purging. So once we\nhave our shatter and we want to vacuum oven purge it, what we do is we we spread\nthis out on vacuum oven trays and we go into a very low vacuum, very deep vacuum\nwith a mild temperature increase from atmospheric. So a temperature increase\ndepending on methodologies it ranges vary widely depending an operator but it\ncould be anywhere from 75 Fahrenheit to will say 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be\na common operational range, and we're always trying to get to a very deep\nvacuum we're talking about 28-29 inches of mercury - very, very deep in terms of\nbeing able to purge out those residual solvents. So not only do we have a\nsolvent free product but purging out the residual solvents and the terpenes is\nalso going to take away some of that some of that added viscosity and\nreally get that product to the point where it's like a glass-like consistency.\nAnd we commonly call those as they're coming out of the oven \"slabs\", sometimes\nthey look like Swiss cheese, sometimes they'll they'll be you know a perfect\nslab of glass, sometimes they'll flip over. And it can vary between a\ncomplete glass-like type consistency and it can also vary to you know sort of\nlike Jolly Rancher or warm Jolly Rancher type consistency - but the good part about\nthis process is to make shatter using hydrocarbon you can generally\nstill make a very good end product on biomass that's been properly dried\nproperly preserved even though it does have maybe a little bit of degradation\nit does have a little bit of oxidation of the cannabinoids and loss of the\nterpenes it's okay because you can still make a very very credible saleable\nproduct that's widely consumed in the form of shatter. And optimizing that\nprocess as a way that you can create a lot of revenue for your\nextraction company. So the next thing that I'd like to talk about is diamonds.\nTerp sauce. There's all sorts of crazy names, \"the sauce\" -  that they coined for\nthis type of extract and really what we're after on this type of extract is\nterpene preservation. So it starts off very much like a live resin\nprocess in the fact that we're harvesting these these buds or these\nflowers in a live state, we're freezing them, and we're ultimately preserving\nthose terpenes. Because terpenes are very volatile compounds in general. Too much\nheat they evaporate and they get degraded by heat, they get degraded by processes, they\nget degraded by solvent - so we want to use a very light solvent, like a light\nhydrocarbon, and in this case mostly moving towards a propane dominant blend. Propane has a much lower boiling point which means it's much more volatile in\nterms of removing it from the end product - easier to remove from the end\nproduct is another way to word that. So ultimately extracting this\nlive resin like prepared biomass with a propane dominant or a lighter\nhydrocarbon dominant blend at low temperatures and ultimately what we end\nup with is we end up with this extract that really becomes a sort of miscella of the cannabinoids but also a very amount high amount of terpene\ncontent. And as I stated before the terpenes are quite volatile and any sort\nof heat, any sort of degradation, even just being an atmosphere for too long\ncan degrade those terpenes. So imagine this kind of cannabinoid and terpenes\nsludge coming out of the machine because we've preserved them up to that point.\nImmediately usually what's done with sauce and live resin is you're taking\nthe terpenes and generally spinning them off in a classified centrifuge. The\nreason we use the classified centrifuge is because there's still a little bit of\nsolvent in there, so we just want to be cautious, but what that ultimately does\nis it spins off the terpenes and it separates a terpene layer from the\ncannabinoid layer. You separate those two now there's a variety of different\nproduction processes that go back into this. In some cases if you're if you're\ndoing crystallization you can leave a little bit of solvent in there and you\ncan ultimately recrystallize the THC-a through a supersaturation method.\nYou can ultimately take the cannabinoids off from that terpene fraction and\ndecarboxylate the cannabinoids and then add the terpenes back in - and that's how\nyou make live resin pens. So for example you know once that decarboxylated\ncannabinoid profile is there you take your original terpenes blend them back\nin and it's going to give you the viscosity in order for the pen or the\nvape cartridge to be able to uptake and atomized that extract. And make, again\nthis is an extract that is absolutely in line with the original orientation of\nthe plant, the original smells, flavors terpenes, and the uniqueness. It's very\ncool because you have such variety within these plants and to capture the\nnative essence of that plant and to reconstitute it and to several\nconsumable forms is a massive value add for an extraction business. And if you\nlook at some of the best extraction companies in the world that do this, this\nis exactly what they do and this is exactly how they do it. So on the flip\nside of what we've spoken about here which has mainly been artisanal\ntype extracts and hydrocarbon extracts. Let's talk about crude oil, let's talk\nabout distillate, let's talk about the high-value type extracts. So crude oil is\nexactly what it sounds if you think about crude oil coming out of the ground\nin like petrochemicals or something like that.\nIt's an oil that has a lot of adulterants in it. It needs a lot of\nrefinement. It needs to go through further processes in order to be\nconsumable or in a consumable form. So what we're looking for with crude oil\non an extraction is really any type of biomass but preferred dried biomass\nlow-grade biomass that can be purchased cheap and ultimately refined into\nsomething of high value. So if we've got for example you know a thousand pounds\nof biomass sitting it's been sitting for six months, we're not going to be able to\nmake really a credible shatter product out of that, we're not going to be able\nto make a credible live resin, definitely not going to be able to make any sort of\nhigh terpene extract or anything out of that. But what we can do is we can\nmaximize the extraction of the cannabinoids out of that biomass with a generally\nwarmer solvent - of course there's ways that you can do it with a cold solvent.\nAnd this can be done with hydrocarbon or ethanol. This is where ethanol becomes\nreally applicable it becomes really easy it becomes really user friendly and\ncost-conscious. And this is where you can still use hydrocarbon but not as\nefficient of a method as ethanol for bulk crude oil. So what we actually do is\nwe take our biomass we load it in and we'll saturate it with ethanol for\na given amount of time. Ultimately we take that miscella stream is what we\ncall it which is the cannabinoids and all the other stuff that comes out of\nthe plant along with the solvent and we evaporate that solvent off. Once that\nsolvents evaporated off ultimately we have our crude oil. Now this crude oil\nhas got all sorts of chlorophyll and whatever came along with the plant and\nany sort of adulterants in there. Generally it'll have a lot of fats, waxes,\nand lipids in there that generally come out of the plant in extraction. So\nthere's a variety of refinement processes. One of the most common\nprocesses to refine is to get to distillate and that's what I'd like to\nchat about next. So let's talk about guys how that distillate actually gets made.\nNow distillate is a process that's made through distillation so quite commonly\nor to break it down in really simple terms if you're putting a pot of water\non the stove and ultimately that water is boiling and turning into vapor - \nthat's a process of distillation. That water is being distilled into the\natmosphere in the form of vapors. So that's exactly what we're trying to do\nwith the cannabinoids in the crude oil. We're actually trying to take those\ncannabinoids, we're trying to vaporize them, and ultimately we're going to\nrecollect them in a more concentrated form. But before we can distill there's\nseveral other things we need to do. We need to make sure that there's no\nadulterants in that distillate or in that crude oil that are going to inhibit\nmaking the distillate. So those things can be waxes, they can be chlorophylls,\nthey can be fats, lipids, all sorts of weird stuff that can come over in a very\nrough crude extraction. The way that we refine that is we commonly\nuse winterization processes, we also commonly use fine filtration, there's\nguys that use what are called adsorbent - which could be diatomaceous earth or\nactivated carbons in order to clean up some of these undesirables from this\ncrude oil in order to make it into distillate. But ultimately once it's\npassed through a distillation process it's normally used a what's called a\nfractional distillation, or a wiped film distillation process when you're at\nscale. We're taking those cannabinoids and we're evaporating them and we're re-concentrating them. So what happens is we take this very, very poor quality\nbiomass, turn it into a really rough crude oil, but ultimately extract the\nwe'll call it \"the goodies\" - but the cannabinoids out of that crude oil and\nconcentrate them in a very refined format. That can be remixed in and\nreconstituted into several different products. This process is awesome because it can literally take any grade of biomass and turn it into a shelf-stable,\nreplicatable, scalable, repeatable product that has a consistency across the board\nfor end-users expectations. For example, you get Pepsi every time it tastes like\nPepsi every time you don't want it to taste like Coke one time or taste like\nyou know RC Cola the next time. You want consistency and a repeatable fashion for\nwhich to make your product. So last product that I want to talk about is\nisolates and isolates are made from actually in almost all cases distillate.\nSo we're taking this crude oil remember as we spoke about with distillate,\nrefining it into a distilled product. So we have this distilled product and the\npotency of that can be anywhere from say a little very low-end 75 percent on the very high-end 95 percent - but it's not 100% pure. And what\nwe're gonna do with that distillate is we're actually going to go through a\nsecondary refinement process called crystallization, isolation of\nthese individual cannabinoids. So each one of these cannabinoids has a\nmolecular structure and based upon what that molecular structure looks like we\ncan come up with ideal ways to actually crystallize and crash out of solution\nthese individual molecules. This is a very common process in chemistry. It's\nused very widely and it's ultimately how CBD isolate is made, it's ultimately how\nTHCA diamonds are made, it's a process of crystallization. So how we do that is\nwe use a selective solvent the selective solvent most often used is hydrocarbon.\nVery often it's either butane or pentane in order to make these isolates.\nAnd what happens is you actually take your distillate and you mix it into\neither the pentane or the butane if it's THCA depending on what you're trying to\ndo and you have your distillate or your fine cannabinoids back in matrices at\nthat point it's back in that now that miscella of hydrocarbon and\ncannabinoids. And what happens is over time and over a temperature ramp spike\ncurve and over a slow period of time these cannabinoids will start\nto actually crystallize. And they'll form one little crystal and it will grow upon\nitself. As we reduce the saturation of the solvent they actually fall out of\nsolution. So what will happen is you'll almost see like rock candy or crystal-like formation growing. Once those crystals are fully formed they can be\nharvested and once you optimize this process you actually have nearly 100%\npurity on any given compound. Now there can be adulterants you know that gets\nstuck on the crystals that need to be washed off but in ideal state this is\nsomething that you can refine up to say a good benchmark is 99 to 99.5 percent\nif you're a really good chemist you can get it up close to 99.7 to 99.9. This is where that last little bits very, very\nhard to get, but there is ways to do that. So if we look at you know the the world\nof cannabinoids in conclusion. There's several different ways to make extracts.\nThere's a lot of different ways to make very, very viable market products. There's\na lot of ways to drive revenue in your extraction business with these products.\nUnderstanding this knowledge base and understanding how you're going to occupy\neach one of these market niches, what access to biomass you have, what\ndiversity and methodology do you have in order to create these products and\nultimately drive diversity and revenue in your in your business. And then really\ntaking that to the next step and taking the next level of understanding of how\nto create these products. That's something that we do here all day long\nat Precision. We absolutely understand all these processes very intimately. We\nhave a very robust team of install / integrators that\noptimize these processes, so again not just selling you the pieces of equipment\nbut actually coming out training you on these processes, sitting there with the\npieces of equipment with you in order to get these processes integrated until\nyour business is up and running and on legs.\nSo in conclusion, a tremendous opportunity ,I hope you enjoyed the video, and thanks for joining us .We really look forward to seeing you again.", "r0an08pfcCY": "hey what's good everybody j ping here checking in respectmyregion.com here today to do a quick taste test review featuring the live resin cannabis oil from potter's cannabis here in california i'm excited to check this out because i actually haven't tried potter's cannabis in over a year it hasn't been since one of the first few hall of flowers events that i've tried their stuff this is labeled as a high potency live resin cannabis oil and then on the back it describes it as all natural whole plant extraction the way nature intended excuse me a tribe called potter's from the farm to your fingertips for the connoisseurs and the raccoon tours we wander the world on a soulful quest towards self exploration and elevation we connect material with spiritual and we believe in healthful healing we leave things better than we found them and we don't take shortcuts the journey is our destination join us and live higher all right so they definitely put some money into the branding that's for sure ingredients this is cool single source live resin extract terpenes derived 100 from cannabis high potency cannabis oil they are covering the bases y'all uh in terms of total cannabinoids 84.78 total cannabinoids we're looking at 80.25 percent chc 0.16 percent on the cbd 0.29 percent on the cbn 1.5 percent of the cbg a and then 1.08 on the cbg total terpenes also listed so the cvgs are listed and the total terpenes are listed four point five nine percent total terps terpenoline is at one point eight six mercene point five nine limonene point four nine so potter's is invested heavily into the terpene information the t the cbg information they've got this crazy poem basically on the back shout out to all those things now the one thing that does sketch me out a little bit is that the original sticker that's on this has different information listed on it there is a different sticker repackaged over it definitely leaves me a little to be conserved so other than that i am quite excited jungle spice is the strain you guys we've got a vessel vape battery over here big shout out to vessel uh how do we get this open ah all right here we go see if we can these these these labels sometimes man they kill me all right here we go so the packaging is tough it should be perforated edge it's not that kind of is troublesome to open for sure if a customer is gonna have difficulty getting into the item it just starts to decrease the chance that they're gonna buy it again and again this is difficult to get into and i don't like that why why is it so hard there we go all right you guys saw me trying to get into that having way too much trouble we finally got to the oil this is what we're looking at for the cart this is definitely looking like a disney car but we shall see it says high potency live resin we shall see i know a thing or two about live resin cards y'all all right here we go vessel one two three four five it's turned on one two three ah here we go we're on green this tastes like this tastes like distillate with fake terps i'm not even gonna lie jungle spice earthy and calming is what it's described and then the total terpenes on the back 1.86 on the trapinoline i don't know to me it's just not making sense the flavor profile with this trapinoline mercene and limonene and look at the color of that oil you do you see this gold this is insane is it live resin is it distillate i don't know do i need to do i need to pull out i guess you guys are gonna have to stay tuned in the description i'll let you guys know uh i'll i'll check out the coa that they have listed here with the qr code i'll see what happens when that comes up but i just want you guys to see this just so that way i can just 100 be transparent with you guys there are two different testing stickers on this one thing okay i just want you guys to see this i'm putting there are two different ones so the one that is on the outside layer okay the one that the one in this hand uh says 84.78 total cannabinoids um and 4.59 total terpenes the one on this which was the original sticker that's connected to the strain type says total cannabinoid 71.8 thc 66.45 but it says total terpenes 16 so it's just interesting to me what is it is it this one is it this one what's the issue um i don't know just a lot to really be desired uh in terms of that i am gonna hit it one more time and i'm gonna give my official score because if you took away this all that matters is the quality of the oil at the end of the day i don't know man this just tastes like dizzily with cannabis terps uh it does doesn't have that live resin uh type of vape hit i guess i've tried select i've tried prescott tried buddies i've tried stizzy i've tried alien labs this looks like dusty so potters let us know what's good comment below if you guys have tried the jungle spice cartridge let me know what your guys's thoughts please be sure to share your opinion if you want to go buy it yourself go visit mother nature's remedy in woodland hills show them some love make sure you follow them on instagram send them a dm and i will of course see you guys in the next taste test review but before we get out of here my taste test score for this is an 8.75 my official score on this is an 8 flat because i don't know what it is it looks like disney it tastes like disney it gets you high like cannabis terps but then you've got two different stickers over here on this packaging situation and so there's just a lot of questions going on i'll see you guys in the next review love you all peace", "BZDFXvM2MrM": "so after reading a few comments I decided that I wanted to make this video answering some of the questions you have on various things like is care T and muha med cards real and just a few various questions to help you understand vaping a little bit better and I thought why not make a part 2 of a video I did almost a year ago about how to get the most out of your oil cartridges this is gonna be a two part video so make sure you stay to the end so that you don't miss anything [Music] storage definitely plays a role into your oil cartridges we went over this in the last video but traveling at a higher altitude will affect your vape pen this is due to the change in air pressure the increased air pressure forces air into the device which can inhibit performance and cause leaking higher quality tanks are better equipped to withstand altitude changes if you plan to go to a higher altitude location purchase one that can handle these conditions or keep the rubber caps that come with the cartridges so I get asked a lot what is the best voltage for oil cartridges and I always say new vapors start low and experience vapors already no but if you are ready to move up to the next step three point two or three point five always works for me it gives me a big inhale but I can still taste the flavor of the terpenes but everyone has their own preferences but just remember that continuing to vape at max voltage for too long will burn out the card from sooner too much power could burn out the coil resulting in a burnt product with an unpleasant taste but what about the myth of leaving it standing upright leaving it standing upright is a good rule of thumb to have so that when you're ready to vape the oil is sitting down at the bottom by the airflow holes oil stick and can take some time to reach the bottom if you leave it lying on its side but it's not something crucial if stored in the right conditions you shouldn't get any leaks so what happens if you see your oil change color down by the airflow holes this is just your oil changing its structure due to the introduction of air and usually sunlight air and sunlight can change the color of your oil darker over time this is okay your oil is still safe to vape darker oil just means that the vapor was probably left exposed to sunlight and has darkened the oil through oxidization how do I make my oil last longer well that's up to the consumption of the user but getting the most out of each draw can help you from taking rip after rip absorption does not happen well if you let the vapors sit in your mouth inhale it down into your lungs inhale it deep and hold it there so that your lungs can fully absorb the vapor be aware of the voltage your vaping at also high as high and low as low as long as your vape isn't leaking or firing off in your pocket you should be able to recognize how long the point-five part will usually last you there's no blanket answer here everyone beeps differently do you leave the cartridge attached to the battery or remove it after every use I assume you're asking this because you don't want oil the link into your battery you shouldn't experience leaking if you keep your card can stored under 70 degrees Fahrenheit but after the seven days the structure of the oil will change and you might experience in very small amounts of leakage depending on where you store it so if you're still using the same car after a week then yes I would say cap it and store it in some place cool outside of the battery how long do you leave it in the fridge for oil cards don't really have an expiration date storing it in the fridge is just a way to keep your cards cool and away from sunlight you can keep it there for a while but you also don't want accumulation of moisture that's why I don't recommend the freezer either I've never kept mine in little fridge for more than about a week so but if anybody has kept it in there for longer please leave a comment down below and let me know what your experience is can you review hollow tip cards no because they're unregulated is KRT vapes a real brand umm they are real but there are also unwritten to my understanding I recently messaged them on IG and I'm waiting for a response I also heard that the blacklist hosted their testing results for clarity and past but you already know how I feel about our detest our glow carts real they are unregulated muh meds they also are unregulated so sorry about that guys I know you're hoping for the best there is a fake brands to avoid lists that I follow they try to update as much as possible but there's just a lot of brands and it's hard to keep up but this is the list that I use it really helps me out I'll put a link down below it has hundreds of brands on there so check it out share it get friends knowledge and finally is it possible to burn out or overcharge my battery yes absolutely when I work for a cellphone company we were trained in battery awareness so cell phones laptops camera batteries and bait batteries all need to expel energy it's a good idea to let your batteries die sometimes before charge me especially when it's the first time you get it not letting your battery die or using it before it's finished charging are ways for the battery to keep dead energy and the battery will expand and bubble up and never allow you to reach 100% again so that'll do it for this video guys we hope it was helpful let us know if you have any other questions down in the comments below like share subscribe this video and as always stay safe do your research and never vape underage peace", "4AvISpz3z_E": "hey welcome to cannabase IG's today we're taking a detailed look at how to use 510 oil cartridges with vape and batteries this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my

part two video on how to use the pure distillate in the syringe form so earlier I told you how to warm it up to loosen up the consistency so it was easier to use so when it's in that state the best thing to do is if you want to eat it on a cookie just put a little rice grain piece on there and directly eat it that way and if that's not enough you can always up the dose and make your little amount on there bigger another great way to use it when it's heated up in the syringe is you can directly put it into say like a cup of hot tea or warm coffee and that's a great way to use it as well so another way you can use it at is you can vaporize it so if you have a vaporizer that looks like this this is a barbed coil vaporizer you see right in there there's a coil in there and that's what you're going to want to put the actual you know little des of medicine right in there and that coil is going to burn it pretty hot and you're going to be able to be braise it in that way now the best way to use the distillate is a way called dabbing and that's something that they are not allowed to talk to you about at the dispensaries so that's why I'm gonna do this video and show you exactly how to dab it so there's different devices you can use to dab this right here is called a dab straw so what you need to do is use a little torch and heat up the end of it you're gonna want to get it nice and hot it's going to turn a little bit once it does and you can see mine is a little bit you're gonna want to bring that parchment paper out of the freezer put it right on there and go ahead and take an inhale now this is gonna go way down in so you can tell it is definitely a deep hit for sure but this is gonna affect you really really well so another way to dab excuse me is to use add a brick so this is gonna be probably the most beneficial way to use it so what the daybreak looks like is this right here you heat this piece up right here until that gets red you put this piece on and then what you're going to do is have your little piece of distill it on here put it down in hit it that way and then feel it go away down in and then the party begins I have a good one see y'all later",

pebbles what even is DMT oh that's the easiest way I can explain it to you man is what your brain produces to make you start having dreams and stuff like that so whenever you're dreaming you're pretty much in like a DM teacher it right there but I've seen Joe Rogan and a bunch of people talk about it and I said that whenever you're dreaming you're producing like but as a [ __ ] and my phone's producing an acid log DMT way more than you would can smoke or whatever I'm thinks what they were saying it's what you do with it is I've seen them smoke it too but I haven't smoked it before you put a bowl of somebody then you put a little DMT and then I think you put another little bit of butter over the top of it so you don't actually get the flame on it but you get the Ember from the bud to burn it or something like that and then you just [ __ ] blast off I never seen anybody [ __ ] up on and I think I watched uh I think they might have smoked it on that drugs Inc [ __ ] or something like that whatever [ __ ] I was watching but um I looked like the meat the [ __ ] just knocked out and just like pretty much went to sleep for like 10 to 15 minutes and then came back yeah where's my phone is on 12% right now the CBD actually gets you high [ __ ] man whenever I smoke CBD stuff then while the [ __ ] knock me into damn head but it's like different from like if you smoke the bowl of Bud and you smoked a like a dab card or some like CBD pen or something like that it's it's a different high but you still feel something you know I'm saying but it's I will say it's different but it's not like you're hitting it like you're hitting some [ __ ] fake [ __ ] it ain't gonna be like you're like man hey I'm just smoking [ __ ] nothing really you will actually feel get like a kind of a body little thing going I want to drive my hair shut up and it's hard to take care of it oh and is it hard nah man any really hard to take care of it the only thing that's a [ __ ] to do is to try it

Rafal studios and welcome to our review of the heavy hitters prefilled cannabis concentrate vaporizer pens [Music] we're going to be reviewing three different products from heavy hitters today we're gonna be reviewing the 2.2 gram cartridge the one gram cartridge and we're also going to be reviewing the actual vaporizer battery pen itself so let's go ahead and unbox these things and see what we have here first off is do we have the actual vaporizer pen and this is the pen that's actually provided by heavy hitters that you can purchase that's branded by heavy hitters it includes a little USB charger plug as well as the pen itself and that's a 5-10 thread pin okay and now we're gonna unbox the 1 gram cartridge this is an OG Kush cartridge which is a hybrid but it's in indica dominant and that's the one gram cartridge and now we're gonna unbox the 2.2 gram cartridge this is the ha static cartridge and this is a new flavor it's the blue dream ok so now let's take a closer look at these individual items first we're going to look at the battery itself now the heavy-hitters battery that is available through heavy hitters and which is recommended for the device is just the right wattage at 4 watts it also has no buttons or anything on it the only thing that you can see is the logo on the side for heavy hitters and then the 510 threaded end that actually plugs into the USB charger that's the simple kind of USB charger that plugs directly into USB and you could charge that with other kind of chargers as well ok now we're going to look at the 1 gram pen and this is the cartridge pin for the 1 gram that's the og cush I'm a big AG fan so I'm really looking forward to trying this out in a minute and it's really simple it's just a one piece I know there was a little rubber cap that goes over the 510 thread there on one end but you just could discard the little rubber cap and then you see it's just a simple cartridge that threads directly onto the pin and these are sort of low wattage it's a 3.7 watts recommend it there so you could try these on other pins but you wouldn't want to try these on a modern of high wattage device okay now we're going to take a closer look at the big 2.2 grand pen and these are monsters I really like this the concept here of just making a tank that's gonna last you for a couple of weeks and also a big fan of blue dreams so looking also for it to trying this out and you can see this pin is so big that it's actually the cartridge is a little bit longer than the pen itself but it's very similar to the other pen other than the length of it it has screws right on to the end of the battery and it's the same battery that you can use on both size cartridges look at that at this like a it's like a rifle or something they're just not rifle you can see the comparing the two you can also see that the two oils look different as these are strange specific and you can also see out of the quality of the oil is very good how thick it is that takes that bubbles so long to roll up but one thing to be cautioned with and this is a lot of vaporizer pens they will roll off the table and break so be careful you don't want to break your heavy head or you'll cry okay so it now comes the favorite part the part of that we've been waiting for here at Roth house studios and this is amazing a pen if you've tried any kind of these cartridges you just can't equal the taste I really like the little light-up end there when you you don't have to do anything when you draw through the pen it lights it up and also ignites the the vaporizer atomizers so you don't have to press any buttons or anything like that it's just air controlled and then I had a little fun here to try both flavors at once that OG Kush was delicious by the way very piney a little bit of lemon but very piney and delicious and the same goes for the Blue Dream it wasn't as pioneer but it was a much more lemony citrusy flavor and just awesome the flavor on these is incredible and heavy-hitters is the correct name you can get major puffs especially for the low wattage coils you can still get major big puffs and like I said we've tried these on multiple batteries and they work good with most of your low wattage batteries but you do need to be careful not to use too high of a wattage of a battery because you get burnt out the coil in the atomizer and it won't work another thing to be cautious with about using these heavy headers or any kind of the cartridges or a lot of these cartridges especially the high-end strong ones like this is that you can find yourself overmedicating very easily because it's such a pleasant experience it tastes so good and it doesn't make you cough and choke that after a few hits you may just find yourself staring out into the window aimlessly and forgetting what you're doing so be careful not to over Medicaid and don't drive or operate machinery obviously anytime but especially in the case with with these heavy headers because they are appropriately named-- you will definitely get very very high off of these all right very easily super high quality very premium premium oil right here [Music] so that comes to my review or my rating for the heavy hitters and I'm gonna give it five stars I really can't find any problems with it the only problem that I have is you're gonna be upset if you let it roll off the table and break it which is only a testament to the product itself just top-notch product so I would like to say thank you to heavy hitters who sent out these pens for us to review if you'd like to learn more about heavy hitters you can check them out online and you could also ask for them at your local dispensary I hope you enjoyed this review of the heavy hitters solvent free concentrated

how to scan here i don't know how to check it but i know it's real bro because the play checked them for me but yeah so yeah it comes in and this little type of thing this is um lush ice right it's called a fire bar and it's live rosin 100 bro i've never had rosin i don't know the difference between live rosin and live resin i've had light resin but i've never had a live browsing so yeah i'm gonna try to push a little bit of this review or if not i might be able to finish it right here for you but yeah it was already wrapped up it came in like this little type of [ __ ] i already ripped the top off but it's still like sealed right now so i gotta i gotta get in that yeah there you go oh bro and already what the [ __ ] bro this [ __ ] [ __ ] is on it bro and i [ __ ] this [ __ ] smells like have you ever had like kids shampoo bro like watermelon kid shampoo bro like the [ __ ] kids i swear i know y'all know what i'm talking about bro that kid shampoo bro i used to love that kid shampoo they should say smells exactly like i swear on everything bro like i'm not even playing but yeah look this is what it's looking right here right here oh here i got a i gotta i gotta pull i gotta peel this real quick it's telling me to peel here so i guess this is i don't know what this oh this opens up the air holes in the bottom so you can't hit it until you peel this whoa this has a lot of safety features on it it came with the thing on the top and this is what it's looking like boys fire bar and it's live rosin one gram this is a full gram right here it's smelling really strong and really good i'm getting a little turpiness too also with it but like barely any terpenes and it's late like it comes in late bro so i'm really excited we're about to see first time ever trying this first time ever trying light rosin and it's on a disposable voice oh that's cloudy boys i don't know i don't think you charge these hey i'm either by the look of the difference between light browsing live resin after this video or y'all could tell me in the comments y'all can also tell me in the comments i'm gonna look it up but y'all can tell me in the comments like y'all opinions or like what y'all think um live resonance and what y'all think like rosin is you know this fire bar is just smelling different bro like i don't know when it tasted really sweet bro like i don't know it's giving me different vibes like i don't know i've never had anything like this before like real [ __ ] like i've never had anything like this i don't know how to feel about it though i guess it's something bro i guess i hope this is certified bro i might have to go check this out i might have to go check this brand out but yeah it's they looking pretty legit bro the packaging is looking pretty legit and all of that bro so i hope there's not no fake ass [ __ ] i don't think it is bro y'all let me know if y'all know anything about this brand fire bar if y'all know anything about this y'all i know this is real if this is a real brand then this is real because my plug wouldn't sell me no fake [ __ ] if it's an actual brand you know if it's an actual brand he's actually going to sell you the authentic brand bro i don't know i'm feeling a little different i'm feeling a little lit but i feel like my tolerance is just so high that like oh no bruh okay this [ __ ] rips though it's moving pretty pretty whatever in here y'all can see the little bit of liquid here all right i'ma just say i guess this is fire bro i guess this is something i don't know how to feel about this bro i feel like this is either a really bomb or it's going to be like whatever but i'm already feeling a little late i think i'm going to take one more rip and then that's the end of this video y'all got to check these out if they're in your area i don't know if they're better than stizzy uh 45 or 4 gram you probably get them a lot cheaper at the shop bro but 45 a foreground bro in in the streets for some live browsing it ain't bad bro that's that's a deal right there boys and um i could have got a stizzy half gram bro 35 bro this is only 10 more books for a full gram so i thought it might not why not try it out for y'all actually you know plus yeah y'all probably getting tired of sticks i pretty much did every sizzy flavor bro but they're like throwback videos i have some old ass dizzy videos brother like i did damn near every flare that's why i'm trying to do some now and these are getting way more views and new ones that i'm dropping like i'm dropping the reviews that i did before but like it's just me doing the review again and i guess i guess i have a better personality now i speak more on camera and [ __ ] back then i was like different it was way different i was more shy but yeah boys i think i'm done this is pretty dank i guess and i'm out", "_vGVnBIqGV8": "[Music] hey guys Phil here from got vape when I first started vaping I would always leave my batteries and cartridges inside of my car because I couldn't take them to work and then when I came back from work I would always have leaky batteries leaky cartridges and that was really before I looked into proper maintenance of my oil cartridges so today I wanted to share a few tips I've learned along the way that I'll help you get the most out of your oil cartridge oil cartridges are great great for my producing they preserve your contents for a lot longer like most devices it's the small things that go a long way save you time save you money frustration but you don't want to take advantage of this by refilling new oils in the same oil cartridge do not fill your cartridge more than twice why is this bad to do well if you keep refilling the same cartridge over and over again it can cause leaking clogging lots of paper production thick oils will begin to harden on the wick and you won't be able to vape new oils properly stuck in an endless loop pulsing for good drawls and there's a special circular inhale for things like that especially you'll burn the cotton and the oils and once that happens even the best tasting oils they won't be able to mask it I like to think of it like oil in a car you wouldn't want to change your oil too often without changing your filter and the cotton inside of your atomizer is like the filter in your car you can go and get new oil but without changing the filter you never really have clean oil don't do what I did and leave your cartridges inside of your car or any hot place for that matter I know it might be convenient but for most you out there a good rule of thumb is heat bad cold good high temperatures can not only degrade the oil taste and potency but it can cause leaking the best places to store your oil vapes are cool dry dark places like a desk drawer or a refrigerator put the rubber plug back onto the bottom of the cartridge and start it ideally in a dark place around 70 degrees Fahrenheit or less but don't go too far to the extreme to the other side when stored in the freezer because that can create moisture inside of the cartridge so avoid heat and avoid freezers but now when you take your cartridge out of the fridge the oils gonna be thick and all thick oils need to be primed first priming your new oil cartridge is going to make the difference between the first hit being smooth and magical or dry and burn the nasty teetsi oil is thick so you need to give it some time to soak into the atomizer here's how to do it make sure your oils are at room temperature if they're fresh out of the fridge pull the cartridge in between your palms for about two to three minutes to warm it up if you're loading an empty cartridge only fill it with a small amount so if you run into problems you don't waste all your oil take about five polls on the cartridge without the battery being attached what you're doing is simulating vaping and pulling a little oil from the atomizer then attach the cartridge to the battery and give it a try I recommend pulsing the battery here it's the best way to ensure that you're not burning your oils if it's still too cold go back and warm it up and then try it again so there you have it guys those are the main ways to get the most out of your oil cartridge dont refill it more than twice always prime your new coils and always keep them in a cool dark place to prevent it from leaking on you keep in mind that not all cartridges have wigs some only come with ceramic or glass cores it's your responsibility to know what you're buying it's always smart to clean the bottom of the cartridge before storing it with cotton swabs or alcohol wipes that way when you take the rubber cap back off you can see if it's leaked hopefully these tips helped you guys where do you personally store your cartridges if you have any other questions leave them in the comments below let us know subscribe to god vape for more videos like this thanks for watching peace", "qsH3Z4Vh2Bs": "yo what is going on youtube welcome back to another video guys something a little bit different all right before we get started on to the actual video today man i just wanted to give you guys a little bit of an update i guess you can say so during quarantine man i've been building my dream setup and you know moved into my own new place all that good stuff and that means that now that i have my own like really really really good high quality really high-end pc setup that means i could finally stream for you guys every single day stream video games like i usually do so that means that i do have a second channel specifically that is going to be based on gaming slash tech so if you guys are into that you know weed and gaming i feel like those two are go hand in hand so go i'm gonna go ahead and put that in the description below go subscribe to that channel slash twitch and you know go support your boy i appreciate you guys and let's get started onto the video alright boys so now to get the video started man so as you guys know i have had been trying to try like new products ever since i found out raw garden was distillate and all that stuff and ever like honestly guys i've been feeling really really weird when it comes to smoking distillate in general so i've been kind of trying to lean towards like smoking rosin or just flour in general and it's really really staying away from things that are made out of bho and all that stuff so today guys i ended up going to the dyspo caught myself one of these because i literally a lot of people have been telling me to try these these apparently are really really good they're the new select elite live resins but as i'm reading it as i was reading it before the video you know when i purchased it it says enhanced live resin so i'm not sure if that means that it's distillate with like you know light resin terpenes in there i'm not too sure we're gonna go ahead and try it out i'm gonna try to distinguish if you know it it is some real live resin or if it's just distillate that has live resin terps in it because i feel like that's what every company's been doing nowadays right so this one is grapehead it is a sativa hybrid i don't know why in the menu all right because i did i did a pickup order in the menu i it was said it was an indica hybrid so now that i have the box it's a sativa hybrid but it doesn't really matter too much honestly it is sitting at a 89.7 percent potency man 82 thc and then so i don't really know i'm i'm assuming that the like you know the other seven percent is like terpene added so whatever the case is man we're just gonna go ahead and smoke it i hate when the packaging is just so like confusing right and so misleading so we're gonna go ahead and i'm not even too sure how to use this thing right boys brand new packaging brand new seal all that stuff so dude this thing is hard to open bro go ahead just tear the box apart boys don't even matter at this point so select welcome to better a whole bunch of carton boxing for what they're just for a little last cartridge go ahead and take this out actually i think they just took it out from here they have their normal i like the cartridges honestly i am a big fan of their cartridges the style of it has the clear tip and then the plastic tubing on the side with their s logo on there you got the little weed on the side make sure that you know caution california whatever you want to identify it as go ahead and take this off and for the battery we're going to be using the ooze variable wattage boys you already know ooze is my main driver all the time boys so well it's one of my main drivers right i am going to be using a variable wattage for this one just because i want to if it doesn't hit at a very very lower temperature i want to see if it hits at a higher temperature how the potency is how the terps come out at different variable wattages so with that being said guys and girls uh we're going to go ahead and chief on the grape head by select i don't know let me go ahead and taste this man see if it's real light resin all right i feel like you could always tell right off the bat whether it's a real light resin or not so cheers whoo okay so right off the bat i could tell you that it's not real live resin it's definitely some distillate filled with some live resin terps now i don't understand why all right when i was looking at the weed maps menu right let me just give you guys for an example let me give you guys a little breakdown okay i'm gonna give it another hit because it tasted really really good but i'm gonna give you guys where you know these these cartridge companies we companies start like pretty much manipulating the wording into you know making people really think it's real light resin so cheers oh and this battery is dead so we're gonna go ahead and have to switch it luckily i got like 10 different oozes so it's all good so i'm not really getting too much of the grapeiness but i'm starting to get the live resin terps in there so all right so i'm assuming with the plant what they did all right all right hold on hold on let me do a little back track all right so finish off where we left all right guys so on the packaging it says um live resin select they make it seem like it's a real live resin okay but when you go on the weed maps it says live resin and all that stuff and it doesn't it doesn't tell you anything that it's just distillate mixed in with live resin terps they just make it seem like it's a hundred percent live resin all right boys which is like when you're looking at that and you order it online and you don't have time to ask the butt tender whatever the case is you're thinking you're 100 going for some live resin okay and um that's definitely not the case man and i feel like that's why you know raw garden got a lawsuit but against them is because i mean it is some tricky wording obviously raw garden used the right term or refined live resident obviously select right here they they said enhanced light residents and 100 live resin but when i was looking at the weed mouse menu you know if they made it seem like it was 100 live resin because they just had light resin and they didn't specify that it was distillate with light resin terpenes so that that's kind of like really really really really bad communication between the the cartridge maker and you know the customer now we had to switch it up to the green one because the other one died all right so we're gonna turn it up to 3.5 and finish off where i left off like i was saying but let's take another hit damn dude i think all of these batteries are just dead i haven't used them in literally months so let me go ahead and see which one i have we're just gonna have to go with the raw garden one man just because of the fact that you know raw for raw garden is doing the same thing man they're making distillate with live resin terps that's all there is to say so cheers go in on the third hit of this grape head it tastes so good though honestly and it's really really potent but at the end of the day you know i just can't believe that they're doing this guys they're literally if you don't know what they what these companies are doing is they're making distillate and they're making distillate and they're stripping it they're getting live resin terpenes and then they're reintroducing it into the distillate and then just claiming that it's a live resin right they're not saying maybe a hundred percent light resin they're kind of like throwing some words in there that are kind of cross-canceling each other out so they'll put like this one for example enhanced live resin and that's that's like what is enhanced light resin you're you're technically altering the regular light resin into making it obviously in this case adding distillate to the live resin terps or the other way around adding the lyras and terpenes into the distillate and it's just not i don't know man i'm i just don't like what these cartridge companies are doing it's kind of getting annoying you know it's kind of getting annoying seeing these men either just say just say it's like a super distillate or something don't say that it's a better version of live resin or distilled live resin refined live resin all this you know bowl bs man bs that's all you can say but it does taste good i must say that i'm not going to hate on the taste but it definitely isn't a live resin um this grape head for example i'm getting like a very very like if the live resident terps in this cartridge specifically you know it's kind of like raw garden it's there it makes it seem like a sense like you're somewhat smoking live resin because you're getting a really really aromatic cushiness from the pan it makes you think oh wow this actually kind of tastes like weed instead of getting this other distillates that taste like you know fake fruitiness fake um fillers and alternate alternatives so this is basically it is basically like a mind trick for the people that are coming up in the industry like are barely jumping into smoking cartridges you could they're playing you they're playing people into making you think you're you know you're smoking 100 light resin guys so that being said i mean you guys need to be careful with what you which cop out there because like i said i did it myself i went out there went on weed maps i was like all right man i'm gonna get some light resin now that i'm smoking this definitely is not some light resin but like i said it does taste fire distillate is super super potent on the other hand and i could definitely taste the grape head strain it has like a fruitiness aroma to it and it is kind of getting me stoned i'm not gonna lie for a sativa hybrid i'm kind of feeling like like a kind of like kind of like a head high but that's like i don't know i wish i could get like the full entourage effect high where it's like all over the place it's very very mellow it kind of comes in slowly and this one it just instantly hits you which isn't bad you know some of you like this but this is just definitely was definitely not what i was expecting i was expecting a live resident man and i got played but it's all good select for what it is for what it is you know distill it with live resin terps it's good i mean if you could if they would just label it as that you know it would just be a fair game guys so let's go in on another hit we're not going to let this go to waste i'm a little bummed out but at the same time i can be too bummed out because it's actually pretty fire so cheers big old clouds too it definitely doesn't taste like distillate like i was saying the live resin terps that they put in here stand out a lot it gives it that really really fruity aroma to it like that super cushy earthiness also and it makes you really really kind of it gives that that fake live resin taste that's just been going all over the place alright guys so select grape head you know you're good for what you are but please don't put yourself under the category of live resin all right all right so with that being said guys i'm kind of stoned we talked a lot this video we discussed a lot of things man if you got this far into the video don't forget to go follow my gaming channel and my twitch it's very much appreciated man it helps you it helps your

into next time you make your oil cartridge purchase all Auto draw batteries need a cartridge with the airflow hole at the direct bottom of the tank if you're wondering why the new vaporizer you purchased won't vape your oil cartridge this is usually the reason cartridge tanks with solid connective bottoms will not work with buttons vapes this is the ex1 plastic wit cartridge with a flat head tip not really known for its big hits and good taste but it's a tried-and-true tank that's lightweight with the leak proof design and they easy to feel blue plug system be sure to preheat properly with this system as sticker oils can build up to a semi solid state on the wick so if you're looking for a cartridge that won't shadow around it though this is the cartridge for you the ex3 is a glass cartridge with a surco me of fiber heater similar to coils this cartridge gives a unique taste it feels heavy and very well made the big glass surrounding the heater allows for durability and will give you a truer quality of flavor this tank has been known not only to vape oils but ejuice to this tank features two dual Inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and because of the air hole at the bottom this can be baked with a south draw device the ex4 is a glass tank with ceramic heater it's great because of the rounded base the round base is great so that no oil or wastage get caught up there it has a wider mouthpiece than most cartridges so you'll be able to get more vapor production it features two inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and yes it's Auto draw friendly as well next is the only tank on the list we need a push to fire base and will not work on buttons as vaporizers or batteries the ex5 ii need each pilgrim or epub done for inlet holes for mediums against viscosity the egg v improves on the cartridge game by allowing you to control the amount of airflow you get great for heavy hits and with the mouthpiece being the largest of the bunch the vapor production is completely customizable to your liking but if you're not going to use the cartridge for a while it's best that you completely close the air vent even more amazing is the baseless center post assuring that you get the most out of your cartridge and that no oil is left behind and last but not least the e a fix-all cartridge this ESL style cartridge is the best fit for even the thickest of oils it features four large two millimeter inlet holes ceramic oven thick glass housing and ceramic mouthpiece and yes it is Auto drawl compatible this glass cartridge is a ceramic oven so you know what's going to give you a greater taste than any whipped cartridge out there all these cartridges are no wider than any CSL cartridge on the market and can fit into any vaporizer with the bore of ten point seven five millimeters or less please keep in mind that the thicker your oil the wider inlet hole that you'll need so that the right amount of oil can reach the heater to be vaporized without getting burned keep in mind that you shouldn't refill the cartridge is more than three times to assure you're getting the best vapor production consider subscribing for more videos like this drop us a

it's called uh this is like one of the most requested out of like all of them like i at least had like 10 people say part six part six part six part six so i decided you know uh for tuesday which this is actually monday night right now monday at 7 pm but i'm gonna upload it on tuesday i usually don't upload on tuesday i usually just go live but for this tuesday we're gonna have this video and then we're gonna go live on later uh usually around six or seven but usually with these videos i like to start like a little thing where we put comments from the previous video onto the screen so let's get that right now [Music] all right so back with that let's just take a hit i actually have some of this ember valley uh butter that uh obviously uh i i did a video on but with the reaction videos i kind of have to upload a little bit uh earlier than uh in the product videos that i already you know i'm saying so but very very good stuff if i had to say if i had to say let me know what you guys are smoking on and if you would like a part seven you know a shout out to the people that have actually been [ __ ] with these reaction videos uh like i said before you know they're very easy to make and you know if people keep requesting them they're easy to make you know i'll oblige you for me but in terms of like videos that i actually like to edit you know i like to edit the vlogs more and uh yeah so cheers boys get one more hit then we start this part six sure boys are you sure that's some good [ __ ] all right so let's get started so we have used to smoking some boof we got big chiefs and some sort of uh that is organic but a lot of you guys have been asking me to try big chiefs and i'm gonna let you guys right now right now um any product that you most likely get from the street i will not be trying on this channel you know most of the time i'm just gonna be talking about it if you do see it in the title i'll just be talking about it and uh i did have that fake raw garden cartridge in that video but only to show you in that video and i stepped on it right afterwards but i'm never gonna try any street brands and uh that's just me because when i have all these available to me like like dispensaries just near me like it's it's really hard for me to just go to a street the vendor and you know get off them but yes you know it's a shame that i don't have a cartridge for this video yeah it's only right fake cartridge you know and all that stuff but not posting to flex please read let's read it so they've been telling me to read some comments so let's just better move this right here let's read these comments so basically i purchased this dizzy from a local plug of course i'm not getting this from a dispensary so the origin of that note to me because someone please verify if this is real bro if you get it from the street you know it's already like iffy is this a fake friendly farms honestly i don't know if they have fake friendly forms please let me know if they do have that but i'm pretty sure i at least for me i haven't seen any fake friendly farms at all so cc car it's uh hard but wondering it fixes legit it's very bubbly for a cartridge you know what i'm saying look like you're sucking the [ __ ] out of that um but fake rope card i i'm not too familiar with ropes i do know that they are faked i did see a box of a fake one one time and it was just all [ __ ] up compared to the regular one so just be on the lookout for that you know the real thing obviously is going to have a higher quality box than the fake one that's all i remember then we got the down low real or fleet plug said it was from washington dyspo [ __ ] no it wasn't look at that [ __ ] you can't even see it what am i looking at this is like a bag fake rope carts yes or no see this box looks way better than the other box you know what i'm talking about i can't scan the qr code these are compliant you can't scan willy's reserve cannabis distillate hybrid i didn't know willie's reserved had cartridges to be honest i did try their pre-rolls before it was all right a bit pricey but it was also in the bay area but you know i mean that looks pretty legit i'm not gonna i was gonna say i'm not gonna lie someone mentioned that i do say that a lot a lot and i i do uh a lot of these things obviously i don't make these up like i'm not the first person to say it and uh but yeah a lot of people have been saying or not a lot of people but that comment was liked like 20 times and uh yeah it made me think yeah maybe i do say that a lot but yeah a lot of things that i say a lot kind of annoys me too so bear with me please i'm sorry but we got the big chief you know what i'm saying we got joji uploading big chief the box is really professional and the code said it was authentic so is this real the code said it was authentic just because you scan the code and it says it's authentic now you're gonna have to check the the paperwork you know what i'm saying like is it actual the strain from the string does it match the batch id on the box you know so get extra smacked up here fake that's a rope right there i think yeah real or fake ghost cars i've never i've never really heard of that ghost you know what i'm saying he posted twice he's like i want to get an opinion i have never heard of it and uh you know i say this in all these fake cartridge videos i am not an expert in cartridges i don't know all the fake cartridges in the world i don't know if you post a fake cartridge on here and it's real you know what i'm saying like this is just me reacting to it just like the title says and uh yeah we got cartonite oh my god some [ __ ] oh some plug some [ __ ] apologize some [ __ ] and or some plug in my state tried to sell these [ __ ] yeah i don't [ __ ] with that i don't [ __ ] with like seen some company actually utilize it pretty well i think it was called levels or something where they had it in these bags but these bags it's just so and plus it's like cartoony you know it's i couldn't screenshot and pick up the parts but the rod looks thick as [ __ ] and it's please tell me as a possibility these are legit from someone please let me know damn that's a lot of carvana that's so crazy it's so crazy the the legal in the legal market when it comes to cartridges you know it's so crazy when you break down the the weed into like an oil form and it's hard to discern from like i like how good it is obviously you know when you see weed and stuff you can see how good it is and all this stuff but oil you know if it's a certain color looks a certain way and it it's [ __ ] does it barely moves you know who could tell you know who could really tell you know like there's some bad oil that probably looks legit as [ __ ] is what i'm saying you know and that's dangerous last three let me know what 25 of a pop only doing pickups straight up this delay bro see i've never heard of that cartel new label booth label vicious viscous never know what you're smoking aqua wax cartridge what the [ __ ] thoughts smart cars oh my god wow i didn't even know they still had those be careful with that trying to copy the smart water and [ __ ] first time smoking clean oil what is that that looks crazy are these real so you know my opinion on canon clear i had my friend uh who said his was pink oil from a can of clear and then i've heard people say that thc uh delta thc8 or delta atx is pink so you know i like i really don't know but just be careful with canon clears you know because they are faked as well i mean look at the box scheme it's very similar to a dang vape you know just with their own little mechanical ear thing no one cartridge producers tutti frutti wow that's [ __ ] that's probably the best meme i've ever seen when it comes to cartridges what the [ __ ] are lion's breath fake so on the last one i believe lion's breath they tested a fake one um because there's hell of fakes you know who knows if there's real ones and you know i can't attest to that because i've never seen them in real life the homie shaka i did a video he ordered it off the website i believe just be careful with lion hearts or lion breasts or whatever uh burrito soda stick carts really let's see this i think i'll kill myself with this do what is you diamond [ __ ] has a girl scout picture on there [Music] all flavors in stock cove original it looks like the dink fake box but instead of the square uh cut out it's a like the shape of the whatever i don't trust that box type anything anything shaped like that anymore like i i really just think that it's fake you know because it's just so easy to make a box you know like that got the tilted are these rebranded push indica cookies that looks pretty good i'm not gonna lie i said but uh we got the halo is this real or fake the brand is called choices and it came to africa that choices thing you know my opinion on it i think it all obviously you should be careful with those but just the fact that they have in one pack and two half grams so you could try two for different strains is really innovative packwoods i've tried before you know the legit ones and you really can't go wrong with those that [ __ ] hit thoughts closely you can get them [ __ ] from cali timberlab never the heavy hitters cold filter i don't know i don't know about that like i've tried my homies you know daryn new year and i didn't really i wasn't really a fan of it are this cards legit didn't see them in the list of fakes not in the legal state uh i've had bloom and uh i haven't had the distillate ones the regular ones the blue brand though has anyone tried dark parts wow that looks pretty dope all right so that's going to be it for part six um that dark heart one someone mentioned that to me and said that they were legit uh but also i believe someone also said they were fake and off the streets so just be careful with those but let me know if you want a part seven you know these videos are very easy to make and you know like i said if i can do them and you guys want them i'm more than happy to you know also subscribe if you did like the video like it and i will see you guys in the next one peace out [Music] you", "f-DP35X6LaY": "so I'm curious how long does the oil within your cartridge actually last well for our 500 milligram cartridges we'd like to think of it as around 4 to 5 grams of cannabis okay for me it'll last a little less than a week but for my wife it can go a couple weeks okay and for some others it might last a month or two correct right right and - what's the shelf-life of an oil cartridge if I if I happen not to use it right away how long will it last work well with the oil there's not really a shelf-life but sometimes the cannabinoids will degrade over time whether it's with light or heat THC can turn to CBN a CBC can turn to CDL through too much light and that's not harmful but that's not exactly what people might want to have happen correct right so if you have a sativa oil that is high in CBN the CBN is going to make you sleepy which kind of goes against the sativa right and how long would that degradation take to occur it takes a good while at least a year okay so you've got you've got some time yeah it's gonna be gone before that happens and so tell me if I have a oil cartridge and/or it's on the pan or in the package how should I store it storage is probably best at room temperature and you don't want to leave it in your car you don't want to put it in the freezer or the refrigerator just a normal room temperature would be fine and if you live in a hot climate about that if you live in a hot climate it's good to be in air-conditioning if I wouldn't leave it in a car sometimes if if it's too hot in a car the oil will get so thin you're risking possibilities of it leaking got it okay well thank you so much for that answer", "Iv_gPNVA4Os": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is my top five cartridges but not of 2020 to start off 2021 because [ __ ] 2020 i don't even want to care about that [ __ ] anymore you know so i titled this the top five cartridges to start 2021 with before i start this video any further let's take a [ __ ] hit i got this bougie on a budget cart i i was just fresh off doing that video so i may look pretty [ __ ] high because i am but let's take a [ __ ] another hit here cheers and i might i say that this is a sleeper cartridge i just found out about this not too long ago i just bought it a few days ago and tried it today uh it's not going to be on the list but definitely an honorable mention like this is the only strain i've tried that's why i like i don't really want to like put it in the top five because i had my top five already set uh before making this video but this cartridge man this is this should definitely get some praise for what the price is and for what the quality is bougie on a budget um but i digress let's get started so uh let's just get done with the honorable mentions first uh we got raw garden i know a lot of people don't consider it live resin but i still do because it has the live resin terps which is what makes live resin live resin right the terps the initial terpenes from actually freezing the plants and all that stuff but they give the higher percentage of thc that comes with distillate as well so it's kind of like the best of both worlds but that is an honorable mention also i would say maybe select i've tried a few of them i've tried one personally myself that i bought and it was pretty good uh just it was all right uh you know nothing to really that blew my mind but i've tried another one from flynn it was pretty good you know um but let's get on to it we got number five we got buddies and i wouldn't be like mad if it was a little bit higher on the list because buddies has just been the brand of the year for me but in terms of cartridges i have to put it there because they do seem to like okay well first before i start getting into the list i should mention the things that i consider when it comes to cartridges is the hardware itself the oil the vapor production uh the price not so much because that's all based on location and you know buddies for me is cheap and sometimes it's cheap for other people too but it's more expensive for other people too so price even though i consider that one of the most important factors i won't consider it for the sake of this video um and also i'd like to mention that this is my [ __ ] list right so it's just me you know i'm not the cartridge god or some [ __ ] you know it's just some guy on the internet okay so like if i don't have a certain brand or whatever cartridge in your in the list like there's no reason to get upset put your opinions down below your top five and let's get started buddies brand of the year for me but uh unfortunately they just seem to really run out quick you know but they're priced so good but like i said price in this list doesn't really uh for the sake of this this video isn't really uh as important but yes buddies is there it has that cdt cartridges it has the live resin cartridges and they have a lot of strains to this day they have a lot of strains you know and to this day peach flambe upside down cake and orange eight are [ __ ] just phenomenal the green box ones just great uh and then we got coming in at four and uh three and four can be switched i mean actually no okay no it's a clear cut so four would be nug just enjoyable it's everything you would get from a green box buddies uh just last a lot longer than buddies buddy seems for me it just lasts like two or three days you know and uh i don't know it's just i don't know but nug just enjoyable i've tried a few of their stuff i think i've tried like three i don't have these cartridges on me but i will put videos on the screen as i'm talking about them because i've tried them and uh yeah nug was uh enjoyable cartridge lasted really really long compared to buddies and just the taste was phenomenal the live resin was true to the train uh but yes that will be number four number three uh like i said uh initially that i wouldn't be mad if you switched three and four is the jetties extracts their unrefined live resin just hit you can take a look at the classiest way to smoke a cartridge video or use a cartridge video money and me were just surprised at the wedding cake that i got from them it was just fat hits tasty phenomenal hits and this [ __ ] got me faded so uh yes coming in at three will be jenny's extracts and uh number two and number one can also be switched but based on just you know people being in the game longer than the other one you know i'll just i'll leave number one as it is and but for number two is alpine and uh i mean uh say what you want about it being a new live resident into the market they initially did you know this lit and other stuff it's fire like they have a ceramic car as well it's [ __ ] phenomenal the phenomenal taste it's true to the strain as well and it's just an all-around tasty experience the ceramic heart really makes it a difference when it comes to the taste and uh obviously you know the variety of whatever voltage used to uh changes the taste as well but they recommend it maybe 2 to 2.6 i would say but yes alpine live resin second in my book let's just take a hit before i reveal number one but i'm sure you guys still know what number one is i mean it's on my old list right so cheers good stuff number one is urza to this day urza has been established as the number one you know they're the first ones to really just come through with that ceramic i could be wrong but to my knowledge they had the ceramic cards uh i know walks has it now i haven't tried walks but i've heard walks and urza are like kind of the same company so um but yeah urzah to this day had just the most dab like experience from a cartridge the taste was there the smoothness of the hit was there you know a low temp dab obviously and it was just all around a great experience you know got me high um and yeah it was just it was just good they did have a few hiccups you know they had to switch back to the non-ceramic hearts but uh i think they're uh using dental grade ceramic now so all everything is good but yes there you have it for my list i know you guys have been waiting for this and it's been a long time overdue you know so i will take one lasting hit before i end this video let me know your opinions down below on my list and give me your list as well you know you know if you want to put mario karts in there and all that stuff for jokes as well because i know that's going to happen as well so cheers so oh okay all right there you go peace out guys [Music] you", "AZMrC0TjKdA": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive kind of think of it every day is a good [Music] alright guys back here for no [ __ ] video we out here got the bong ready to go your honor you know it is but today guys there's gonna be a short little vlog a little informative bug about fake [ __ ] carts guys because there's been a lot of fake ass carts going around and I don't want you guys to get cheated you feel me I want you guys to I want you guys to be able to smoke realize cars guys like I'm tired of people selling fake ass cars and it's just disrespectful guys so like today I found a guy who sells fake for all garden carts and I have a real raw garden this is a real rug or in the place that I got it from is verified I'll probably show you guys later that is verified just to prove you guys that it's [ __ ] verified and I don't know we don't get these fake cards off the street now we can't get the fake cars off the street but I can tell you guys how to tell the difference between a fake and a real [Music] as people have been selling fake cards for too long guys it started off with the brass knuckles and the dang cars and the mario cards like wind-up mario nigut if you smoke something called mario [ __ ] you stupid but um I hit him up this dumb just so dude that sells like treating cars on the street I hit him love and he's gonna come through real quick and when he gets here I'm going to show you guys what the [ __ ] the difference is but before that let me take a bong rip you guys already freaking know you know I'd be on my bong way of life all right I'm gonna get back to you guys in a few minutes I'm just waiting for him to pull up and we all will get these things all right before I um talk to him real quick he's about to come in in a few minutes I just want to show you that I got it from a place that's verified if it has the check mark and we maps that shit's verify so all these are verified and the one that I bought the other day I did a vlog on it you guys want to check it out with the link in the description it is a chocolate slurm alright guys I'm finally back and this is how you could tell the fake from the real pro so I got the dojo Kush I actually spend money on it and then I got the cherry slurm I couldn't find the chocolates learn that I had but I had cherries learn before and I know it's verified so I got that this is the rowan and this is the fake the first difference I'm gonna show you guys is you know the difference in the boxes the boxes are totally different I looked at that [ __ ] I knew was fake but I needed a box to get it so I said [ __ ] it take one for team but check yourself so this is Rowan and this is fake as you can see the font and the color are totally different see the fake one is more light green light green around while the real one is dark green start reading around and you can see the font is different too by the net weight and cartridge you can see that the font are way different see by the fonts on the date and of the other other information on here that's how you can see that's the first way you guys can tell a fake from a real so the other way is by actually looking at the cart actually I have to open it real quick give me a second guys so now the second difference is there's no see a caution on the card up see how the real one this is the real one you see how the real one has the CA on it that one didn't have it and then you can also tell by the color that's the third thing you could do is hell is by the color but honestly the color on these look super similar so I don't know but usually you can tell by the color guys and then you guys already know the last way is to like actually taste test the product but I already know it's fake but for you guys I'm gonna do it for the one time for you guys the wu-tang alright guys do not I'm just gonna tell you guys do not buy [ __ ] carts off the street like I already knew it was kind of bad when he told me that the cart was $45 that's a that's a signal that's a signal all in itself right there $45 boy that [ __ ] is 65 but I was just going with it I'm not I don't care I just needed a car either way you feel me but um it's 65 guys or more for these cars they're expensive and that's why they taste so good this [ __ ] tastes like a [ __ ] battery guys like it doesn't taste good at all it has no type of essence from the flower nothing like it might look similar this [ __ ] really gave me one with a fat bubble engine bro I just got screwed but um it's fake guys like I don't know let me taste this one [Music] see I wish you guys could taste this so you guys could tell this is that real raw garden [ __ ] like [ __ ] this fake [ __ ] but like those are the ways that you guys can tell guys I hope everyone's having a good day I just wanted to do a short little vlog for you guys because I just wanted to post more so I just decided to do something about karts because I don't know I feel like not too many people are doing the karts are they're not showing you the real fake ones like that are actually out there so I bought one I was like man let me show you guys like what the real fake ones look like let me just show you guys so I got one and I'm probably gonna throw it in the trash matter of fact just take this [ __ ] this is what you do with fake cards you take the fake cart and guys okay go to the trash can and you see the cigarette butts you throw it in with the cigarette butts so I hope everyone liked this vlog don't forget to Like comment subscribe and don't [ __ ] smoke fake cards make sure you go to a dispensary or get you got to get it from some reputable place make sure they're verified it's not worth your health you know what I mean so just get a verified one pretty much all you have to do is not buy off the street but [Music]", "oGIHH8e9XE4": "well now really when we go back then to falling in love and say it's crazy falling you see we don't say rising into love [Music] there is in it the idea of the fall and uh it is goes back as a matter of fact to extremely fundamental things so guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another reacting to fake cartridges on reddit part three but you know usually when i start these videos i like to do like a thing where i show the comments from the previous video to let you guys kind of get a better understanding of how you feel or how the community feels about fake cartridges so here it is that there is always a curious tie at some point between the fall and the creation [Music] now we are on here let's just review some stuff i do have my cartridge as well so this is kind of like awake and make it's only like 9am right now guys so please bear with me cheers boys that's how much i have left of it it's a buddy's car let me take another hit before we start this any further cheers boys all right so whoa i don't know about this this looks like [ __ ] in the cart like literally [ __ ] in the cart [ __ ] that delta 8 thc hemp extract bought this in the store when no car gives me high is this even legal triangle trading code came with qr lab results there's like a pinkish hue to that i don't know i don't know so with qr codes on being on things you know most of the time like when you get it from the street they're going to be replicated qr codes so they're going to take you to the same one whether you get a different product it's going to take you to the same one happened with raw garden i believe it was hb221 or some [ __ ] like that and i think it was i'm not sure what it was but that was the number and uh that's when you know it was fake they basically just copied that sticker and ran with it with their whole fakes um so just yeah even though they have qr codes and all that stuff if you're getting it from the streets most of the time it's going to be fake regardless and these qr codes can be printed on anything you know i could take this qr code off of well if this had one you know like i could take this barcode get on the computer and then put it on some sticker you know it's easy like that but i'm taking another hit because i don't know it's looking at that wax kind of made me want to like hit good wax you know saying so cheers boys all right just went to the dispensary and they gave me this menu i bought but all the cards look fake as hell and krt for 75 stizzy for 90. oh my god opinion on pesticides and cars okay obviously we know there has been cartridges to come out dirty from the black market for pesos but why do people that smoke regular weed from the platform i think their [ __ ] doesn't i mean they should probably think that too you know at the end of the day if you buy from the streets you are putting yourself at risk for whatever the hell reason you are like who knows what they're going with you know so just pee like just please be wary of what you buy on the streets you know there's a reason why people don't buy alcohol in the streets or regular canned goods on the street you know like no one you can buy that [ __ ] at the store you know just like how we in in california it's a legal state if you're buying from california off the street then it's because maybe it's a money issue you know i'm saying you don't want to pay that much on the street or in the club and also the most likely of all is that you're underage you know so at the end of the day if you're gonna smoke underage regardless of buying on the streets just tell someone older to get you something from the club legitly you know what i'm saying although both is illegal if you're going to be smoking fake carts underage you might as well be smoking real carts underage you know what i'm saying i'm not condoning underage smoking in any way but if you're putting yourself at risk with black market [ __ ] you might as well tell like an older brother older friend to buy you a real cartridge at the end of the day right all right real [ __ ] right here what is this kirby blue cheese huh real or fake wax looks nice i've looked on dhk a little bit haven't found anything please let me know choices okay you guys seen me react to a choice card before definitely fake but the idea is dope that they put two cards in one packaging that way you don't get stuck with one cart you know sometimes the legal market can learn from the black market because the black market they're willing to take these risks well obviously they're risking themselves already just being black market but like you know two carts in one you know that's pretty ingenious um the darker the oil the more terps i would maybe maybe think so you know an old lion's breath from a few months ago tastes like poor water now and it's brown and separated nasty and for those of you who swear by the gods that lion's breath is good you know what i'm saying like there are possibly some good ones you know what i'm saying that goes to say with all black market cards there's going to be some good ones there's going to be some bad ones now i'm saying so why would you risk it you know for a company to be i don't know like just looking at lion's breath you could tell it's fake you can tell that the box is mass produced and the people dealers will have a boxes of them with rubber bands tying them together you know what i'm saying homemade and illegals in the illegal state see they look pretty decent space vapes i think i've heard these before but they're very much using the old cartridge system which is bunk as [ __ ] look at you can see the wick on the bottom [ __ ] the [ __ ] out of you minus choice cards glow and vitamin and their vitamin e tests distill it syringe you can't go wrong with this list sometimes you know in the syringe you can just little dab yourself out real or fake i've never seen a select look like this and why is the box all scratched up what the [ __ ] did you receive it like that i received the box like that and then definitely something wrong you know she was boys good stuff so we're gonna probably do this for five more minutes just see what's going on you know i'm saying i know you guys really [ __ ] with these type of videos because uh you get a better understanding of how the community feels about these certain cartridges you know choices krt dank vapes you know just it's good to to make videos on this i've said this many times before to spread awareness because the more awareness you spread on these these products you know i'm saying like people are gonna start to to listen they're gonna start to be more self self aware you know i'm saying of of stupid [ __ ] in the streets so not sure what to make of this it's this high sky this sky high smacks but it tastes bad when i let it out the smoke in a bit runny bro real or fake like stizzy packaging pretty much looks legit to me you know even fake ones look pretty good so i don't know tko extracts for those of you who have been asking about tko extracts i know a few of you have i've never tried it but a lot of you have mentioned it told me just try and review it or something but i've never seen it i would probably consider this maybe a gray market but then again i don't know too much about it so you know just take that with a grain of salt let's see my plug says these selects these were celestial i took three phases and started to travel inside my brain and my pupils were super black they do look like good oil i'm not gonna i'm not gonna sit here and lie but you know unless you know the guy like really really really really well and there was like no bad bone in his body you know halo delta eight never even heard of these anyone else get this kind before i have never heard it looks like a pencil to be honest what's the deal with these characters and they're filled with cat 3 delta 9 and to be honest it's one of the best size i've had of course i usually smoke dabs so another thing i've seen recently uh this brand from cebu g was called lido lido or some [ __ ] it's basically like stizzy but they have their own little look it's like a white battery look and they mentioned that they had cat 3 distillate as well and knowing me it piqued my interest i wanted to know what cat 3 was apparently their scales or grading skills when it comes to distillate and cat 3's the best no impurities all that good stuff no contaminations and then there's like cat 1 and cat 2 i believe but cat 3 is what you want when it comes to distillate but then again i just looked it up briefly so i don't know too much about it so if you guys have any idea what cat 3 distillate is more of let me know you know what i'm saying but we got about two more minutes left in this so let's just get this on and just be more disappointed in what we see right am i getting sick am i getting sick from a fake car probably you know moxie member ignored the other [ __ ] in the background this whole got a buddy's cart that's promoting moxie you know i'm saying i know it's buddies because i mean look at this [ __ ] baby hey a few more we got the cart is leaf war x i got this card from a verified disc you can hear my brother complaining back and the oil is runny but the car gives me fate as [ __ ] for like a good hour and a half [ __ ] you on some other [ __ ] you know that all right so one more thing this moxie we can run through all right this is the last thing we're gonna end on currently stone reading the sub and seeing all the boot people post on here the one only downloads one of the first cards ever so they didn't face before they were even dank figures i'm not smoking anything with a dinosaur as promotion on it at the end of the day so we're going to end this off right now we're at 11 to 12 minutes i would say um hopefully you enjoyed this video i know you guys really [ __ ] with the reacting to fake cartridges reddit i'm gonna try and get this out today or tomorrow just because i know people probably check the subreddit after they watch the video and they're just like oh you're like old news you know what i'm saying i'll try to get it up by tomorrow or today um but yeah hopefully you enjoyed the video if you did like subscribe all that good stuff if you want though you know what i'm saying and i'll see you guys in the next one

zero to 100 like in terms of dollars that's the currency okay if i were to sell it i could sell it for 69. what do you think about the taste crisp clear crisp and clear it's piney you know what like yeah if you got a taste for it you know exactly what you want if you don't smoke tsc very much excuse me i mean taste and flavor-wise yeah that's worth the money that's why it's worth any dollar amount you assigned to right up to i'd say 60 70 bucks i could pick me worth it it would be low it would be well worth it batman flavor is high quality i like that i like that i do i like it what do

smell and taste okay i know that tastes really good okay tastes good smooth for sure smooth yeah so it hit smooth i mean i didn't didn't tickle my throat at all how much is it smacking you right right now i'd say at least 99 percent nine i feel like chill just very like relaxed okay ready to take on the day ready to take on the day well what would you say on a scale like of one to ten how what do you think about the cart taste nine smoothies that's pretty good nice i don't know pretty i mean they're up there if you were to buy that at let's say that dispensary right there how much you think they charge you for it they charge like 80 bucks for stuff like this yeah so if you go to the dispensary there for a point five card it's like a hundred dollars after tax yeah definitely so they're you're definitely getting taxed so with this stuff because it's hemp there's no like marijuana attacks on it so it's a lot cheaper definitely it's nice i would buy it cool right now i want to buy a

car I used to shoot every single video in here I mean sometimes I said it's just been a while since I've been in here man because you know we've been up in the game no need to do carb freakin videos anymore so as you guys can see by the title the video though getting right into the subject we got another cartridge EP for you guys so I've been hearing you guys out man I've been hearing you people like oh dude can you do different cartridges you know I'm tired of seeing you pick up raw garden three times a week and review it every single time I'm like no I'm just kidding um yeah but people are getting pretty tired of seeing the raw garden even even myself you know I'm getting pretty tired myself a freaking having to pick up the rug garden anyways so today we got something new though so I went up to my local dispo and then I was like alright man I'm trying to look for something new and you know there's a bunch of people passing by right now I'm project right in front of my house so yeah like I said I completely lost track for some reason so yeah I went in there I was like alright I'm looking for something new in there they told me about this company right here and it's called humble Farms they've been out I mean they said that they've been out for a little for a little bit of time now but they recently been coming up in the end you know in their own little chapters and so I was like alright let me try them they parently they make weed they make cartridges and then I think they make but I don't think they make edible just weeding cartridges I do know that she said that so right here we got like as you guys can see we got cannabis oil from Humble farms this flavor is grape soda lining in at 80 point 9 THC CBD 0.12 and this is a licensed verified product you guys can go ahead and follow them they are verified they are licensed manufacturers and then you know so it's not a boof cart from the streets man this is an actual brand license brand and I think it's time to give them to give new companies try as you know so opening it up right away alright so opening it up right away they you get a little sticker right here so cannabis oil indica growing in Humboldt County California so yeah and then ingredients cannabis oil cannabis derived in natural terpenes lab tested manufactured on 30th of May 2019 and packaged on June 2019 so that's fairly freaking you and it's actually say review from the company right here it says it's from loud pack I don't know if you guys already know um if you guys know who that is but a lot of Pat makes some amazing flower and light resins and stuff like that so I'm guessing this is one of their off branch ones so yeah right here we got the stick for that opening it up you got nice little packaging some stars right there you got the cartridge right there and the cartridge looks damn dude this thing looks empty bro way right off the bat like you guys literally saw me open this these cartridges literally it looks like they're selling me freaking no I'm not I'm not even joking look it up this is a half gram is this a half gram it says it's a half gram alright I mean then we're gonna go into it says choose kindly alright so I'm kind of like right now I'm kind of shocked I'm not gonna lie so taking off it's a wood tip take this off right here take this one off from the bottom and it doesn't look like there's anything leak that leaked but dude am i is this off one gram cartridge just filled half ways I mean I don't know I do this is kind of suspicious so let's go ahead and turn it around the oil is super super thick so yeah the oil super super thick it's not moving at all and I'm just kind of trying to figure out what is this dude like I've never seen a cart this empty alright so inhaling right off the bat there I do get a little taste of grape soda I'm gonna go ahead and take off his bowl draw a garden cartridge right here and then I'm gonna go ahead and smack this on this battery real quick so all right humble farm is a man grape soda half of a half of a cartridge I don't know what's the same man I don't know what to say like literally you guys saw me open it live on camera it was fully packaged I literally just walked out the dispo probably like 20 I mean I'm already on my house but it was like 20 minutes away so I don't know this is kind of this is kind of sketch just kind of sketch I mean we're gonna go ahead and try this though cheers for the people that are 21 and over make sure you're 21 and over though and yeah let's get into this guy's [Music] [Music] hmm so right off the bat hmm I get nothing at all like literally nothing [Music] it tastes like a day doesn't taste like anything artificial at all it's for sure a hundred percent natural you could taste like it tastes like weed but it does it it doesn't like I don't get anything I didn't I got a little cough right there but it was just I didn't get any sensation in my chest and my throw anything at all that years now when you guys get that fire stuff it's like it's just automatically boom like I could literally throw this raw garden on there right now and it's like literally empty and I'd probably get a bigger freaking hit than this this is this is disappointing man I mean I don't know if I should go back to the disbar what but this I feel like I literally got [ __ ] around I'm not having it I'm not even lying I paid $40 for this dude I'm disappointed this is the first time in my life where I go into licensed dispensary get at a product where they recommend it and it's garbage look at this I'm not even joking like alright I'm gonna go ahead and call out this company Humboldt Farms if you guys are over here freaking producing this stuff and giving it giving out to your clients like what is this do this is not a half gram cartridge I believe you this is this is not a half gram cartridge dude I don't care even if you say it's probably worked up in the coil man nah dude I don't care how much freaking is to wick the heck you know this is not a half gram purchase I don't even know what to say anymore about this man this is very very disappointing right now I'm just gonna sit here and just try to comprehend what I'm gonna do not expand we're gonna try to hit this one more time dude so uh you know we're gonna hit this one more time see if I could even get high off of it so no - yes [Music] I mean literally it tastes like a jetty extracts you guys know I've reviewed that one before jetty extracts is not good at all either this is like a beginner cartridge literally I'm disappointed I'm not even getting to try to continue this video man I'm gonna go ahead and take this off I'm gonna take this off right and then go ahead and put that away go ahead and slap this this little bit of raw garden that we got here we got literally right at the air holes we're about to rip this one time for the boys and we're just gonna go ahead and end the video here because I'm gonna try to figure out what I'm gonna do with this dude so put this back together I feel like taking it back I'm not even gonna lie I mean I'm not going to because it's a far Drive but it's just disappointing man like I don't know what to say I just don't know what to say so all right go ahead and seal this back up man I'm pissed I'm pissed all right so go back to the raw guard and like I said Humble farms right here is zero out of ten negative negative ten out of ten nude negative ten out of ten don't ever cut this ever in your life there's it's literally a freaking and [ __ ] dude it's a [ __ ] Lilly just trying to scam you so don't ever go out and buy this ever so you guys heard youhere first outside BG I don't know if anyone's ever reviewed any of these company any of these products from this company but if they did they probably lied about us saying it's good if they didn't so I'm gonna take one fat blinker for the boys to make up for this and I'm gonna just go back

enjoyed the video probably new people here too anyway if you guys did enjoy the video you know keep show the support show the support it's a much appreciated so yeah have a good day guys cheers man raw garden is the best this is why I review regarding so consistently because it's so good compared to all these other brands yeah so catch you guys later", "PxL8RgmvK3I": "hey what's up guys what did do is you boy mr. bling see I'm coming back at you with another video I think I just cringed after I said that but uh anyway today I wanted to just talk about some carts uh in specific fake carts because like I've been watching a lot of other people's videos on like your views of carts and [ __ ] and anytime they review something that's like a dank vape or a dab wood or like a cereal cart all I see in the comments are over you smoking home to fake cards oh you've got no food carts oh that car doesn't have the holo graphics on it so I think that fake um I would like to just say shut the [ __ ] up cuz like I'm pretty sure everyone who smokes carts knows that all of these aren't real carts because I mean it's pretty obvious if you smoke them yourself you can get different packaging which are like fake our carts from a fake cart in general but just starting off this video all of these carts are fake these two are real though I'm just gonna show you the packaging on these real quick so first off they have the California label and that's something only some of these fake car companies can write or copy onto their packaging but uh anyway you have a sticker that clearly labels your total THC and CBD content your strain how many milligrams you're getting and what type of weed it is you have this sticker label on the top that seals the box you have this sticker label on the back that lists your THC and CBD again and a government warning all of this information is on this legit kingpin packaging even the way the packaging it comes in obviously I mean like these are long since weak but uh you get a nice little kingpin cart it looks very nice it's all high quality you can open it in case you want to take the wax out it's a legit kingpin cart it even has the like the label a you can't scratch off I just hit my camera mess up my then I think it was a shame all right so you have all of these other companies that are making black-market cards all of these are black-market cards the thing is it's just some companies do it better than others and I don't know why some companies decide to lie about what they're putting in the curt's like trap house they put a rough percentage of your THC content they put all natural high percent organic no PG VG or PE d and they even copy the California sticker the thing is trap house is an alleged company and so these aren't real cards they're fake cards but they're high-quality fake cards if I would say so myself I just finished their Venice og one and like the waxen this was just as good if not better than the wax and these kingpin cards don't hate to kingpin though these were nice um but yeah so like just because it's a car is fake doesn't mean that it's not gonna work the thing is these are full of harmful chemicals not full of them but like Oh some more but these are pure wax they're not gonna harm you these though even though they say they don't have PG or VG they do they're mixed with that it's real wax but it's mixed to dilute it in therefore you get more use out of it the way you can tell if it's a higher quality fake wax is if it moves slowly and if it's like a deep golden color or like yeah a deep golden brown um I think out of all of these carts the worst one I've had was this chronomaly skittles cart obviously the packaging is fake I never seen Khurana play anywhere else it doesn't even have like the fake California label on it oh yeah it does but it's like an even weirder one they always say lab tested on percent organic but they're not like it's very obvious when you're hitting these cards that they are mixed with something some of them here really harsh dank babes as you can see his had to change sorry about that I had to fix my camera back because I'm sort of hit it while I was trying to talk about these dang babes packaging um what I was trying to say was dank babes has had to change their packaging three times since January because other people are now taking their packaging and putting fake tarts inside of already fake cart packages which is such an insane thought to me but it's kind of good that dank vapes likes to like at least change up the way that they're selling theirs think their stuff so that people are at least getting somewhat higher quality wax under thinning that I like another thing that I like about dang vapes is that you can't open these see cell atomizers that they use for their wax they're stuck closed and that's a good thing because the fact that all of these companies mix actual THC like weed wax with VG and PG it makes it harmful for you if you take it out of the cart when you're smoking it in the car it'll make you coffee cuz it's kind of harsh it might taste really good but it's still not that great for you imagine that but worse if you take and open these car packages and then you try to actually dab the wax from them Auto break some of these companies make it so that you can unscrew the top of their carts you can refill them obviously but then you can also take the wax out and that's where you can run into problems once you burn the wax that's mixed with VG and PG on a rig it can be super harmful for you because we're not supposed to be combusting those chemicals they're used in actual vape juice that you would mix with nicotine for people to stop smoking they're not meant to be used for THC cartridges obviously you can use them and people are but I feel like people should just put out the information that yes these are fake yes they do work but you have to at least also be careful with them and know what you're getting yourself into before you start trying to like just smoke cards out of the blue and thinking that all of these these are legit I'm pretty sure even exotic like their wax is around the same quality as dank vapes I'm not sure if they're super legit but I know that their wax is not like an amazing quality wax it's decent but it's not great these trap house cards they are pretty good I would suggest them just as highly as I would suggest at King pen but only with the information that these are mixed with VG and that they can harm you and I think like my basic opinion is that these cards while they are fake are just as good as legit carts as long as you know hey I'm sort of damaging my body by using these and you just continue with the information in mind if you can get legit carts I would highly suggest doing that because while they may not like get you as high as these like immediately you might take me need to take a few more hits but these also last longer they're more healthy for you and I mean the smoke is super smooth so it doesn't feel like I was harming myself at all when I was using these cards these carts are probably cheaper and more available to you so if that's your like only choice try some of them out but like try to figure out what brands you prefer over the ones that are like sort of harmful um I feel like this video ended up being a bit of a ramble I'm sorry about that but I also hope that if you did watch you enjoyed and um yeah I'll just catch you all next time see you", "2quA9B22k4M": "welcome to community cannabis review so originally my strategy with videos was to basically make one video per brand essentially didn't even really get into multiple videos per strains um mostly just to show you that so you got a brand you searched it up on youtube or you saw it at the dyspo before you bought it search it up on youtube and just verify that they don't make some crap or they're not basically gonna scam you for some booty that you don't want um but i've been having a lot a lot of people say that they want more videos more often and i kind of want to make some more honestly more frequently than i do so i'm going to start making a video basically every time i get a cart or a concentrate if i can or as frequently as i can to that anyways so um i'm not doing the editing on this one i'm gonna re-download my editing software and stuff but for this one i don't feel like it needs it too much because there's not very much packaging to even go over let's start with the hush brand cartridge because i was really surprised with the last one that i got so i picked up another one so um i got this one at beaver bulls where are we at let's see if i can get it to focus there we go phone's actually focusing uh purple cali cush cannabis extract cartridge try that again um this is one gram container uh contains rather 77 points 77 percent thc there we go 77 point actually the 770 milligrams dhc excuse me i can't talk today um then the cbd is 22 milligrams total i believe that puts it at 0.22 percent i don't remember how to work that i'm not thinking clearly um you got all your production info on there and then compliance labels and stuff but other than that it doesn't come with much it's very bare bones for a cart um you got the price there before tax which this dyspo does a lot do before attacks some do after etc anyways and here's the cartridge itself you can see that's some really nice looking distillate which this looks hard to screw up but at the lower um lower price points you will find just like i assume it's made from trim that's even worse off so it just requires more starting material allowing more contaminants in total like chlorophyll and just well everything that's not desirable and you know with distillation i don't know that it matters maybe it's just they got better with their process don't know what the situation is all i know is in my opinion they got better here's the you got um got two silicone caps and then you got the compliance label which i always tear off or peel off whatever and this little weed sticker got these like everywhere all right let's see if i can get some better pictures of this i got a sun lamp right now which is doing nothing but making my eyes look gorgeous nothing for the weed though um let's do some different colors put it in front of super clean um super clear what got me into this was i actually got a cart a couple days ago and it was even better than this one i don't remember the strain i think it was like um maui papaya or something like that um all right well i'm throwing everything i can't speak or grab anything right now apparently um that's the one that i was talking about same same deal basically but yeah i tried them out and they were readily better than i remember them so i wanted to make a video plus i just want to get into making some anyways so let's see if i can't taste some terpenes on this the other one was very interesting terpene wise that's also something i was grateful for they normally have some basic ass servings but this last one they had um i definitely tasted some one of the more exotic terpenes i'll say i don't remember what it was though the consistency is really nice on this dude's gotten a little better i'm using a mirror behind my phone so that i can point it straight at me so bear with me as i look that way and i hit super nice these are up there now with like what i call gold standard distillate cards because like i said distill it's hard to [ __ ] up so once you get to a certain point it doesn't really get any better it's just like as good as it gets and that's really not hard to achieve either but somehow people occasionally mess it up but you got like buddies and select those cards are just distill it how it's supposed to be done hush is getting up there they're pretty dang close now other than the fact that buddies and select have better hardware i want to say it's very close for this one sadly the terpenes i'm only really getting some pretty heavy mirror scene it tastes like a lot of purple strains for sure which that might be something different yeah these cards are solid um i just wanted to get another video out because i want to start putting out more so i hope you enjoyed this like and subscribe and stay tuned and i'll put out more and ideally better ones soon thanks for watching", "e3fvcHdwmnA": "hey what's up everybody I'm gonna be doing a product review for MPX melting point extracts mango haze live resin sauce one gram if you want to call them up ask him why it expires on Oh 212 2020 their phone numbers Theo one five nine one nine four five zero reason I got this one mainly is for the troponin lean level I was running low on my main squeeze for the tapana lean sauce with the pineapple Black Label sauce pineapple skunk Black Label sauce by G leaf I should have said that was the correct terminology for that product but I that had eight point six four percent to pine a lean but uh this is the next best thing I could find for Japan I mean today and it's got six point two nine four percent trip I know lean so that's good and yeah anyways mango haze live resin sauce one gram the live resin is from the turpenoid cannabis pistols that housed the molecular structure for the terpenes on the I'm running out of vocabulary for this I think I just said it and explained it if you understood that term and how I do correctly it's the Pistons pistols pistols pistols matte pastels or pistols or anything pistols on the end of the cannabis flower that house the terpenes which is the therapeutic and beneficial part and it's the stuff that gives you vacuum anyways live resin sauces derived specifically from that with a specific curative process and a dozen house any of the alive flower product which a cured resin sauce would be if it's a not a live resident it would be a cured resin which has flowery matter in but this is specifically terpenes and trichrome for your track roams so anyways here's my label I got this at remedy I'm not gonna show you the label because it's got my name and my providers name and information on there but just suffice it to say it's not there it's cost me $100 $100 and got a remedy in Colombia really good people over there I want to thank them for providing me with this great product still getting good chip on alien sauce levels in there so making it available to me and the public and anybody else that knows about it or wants to do research on it or whatever if they don't want to finally in one my Racine give him that - who cares anyway this comes with a great little sticker I might not put this on my motor scooter because I don't want to promote it that much but I'll keep it in the box it's even got a little label a sticker label MPX sticker label to keep it closed and I really love these casings I gotta say mbx has some of the best packaging in the world it's clear saran wrap you know in between some some harder plastic shells and it opens up like that and you just feel like a royal Majesty like I'm gonna have some like great tin of majestic royalty or something ring about to smoke this extract and the fact that it's a live resin sauce instead of a cured resin sauce is even better and you just feel like a chief so we're gonna do is you thumb it in and you press it open and then it opens like this and then you're like wow what great packaging and then you take this out and this is what it looks like it's all kind of bunched up right there on the side so when I open this oh I'm gonna snow it here's the labeling again for you melting point extracts Wow that smells delicious these crystals are very nice actually the sauce is excellent sauce is pure terpenes by the way crystals are where you get the track rims for the Delta T H Delta 9 THC tetra Delta tetrahydrocannabinol and CBD you know all that kind of stuff so that's where the crystals come out the crystals are the chunkier things and the sauce is the live resin which is all at the bottom Schmidt is Caribbean gooey so this is on the lid of it because some of the terpene sauce the live resin sauce is on the lid that makes me say that it's quite a good product wow this is this is almost soupy Wow that's like pure terpenes Wow I think I did that wrong I gotta put this back in here and scoop it up right when I'm like about to hit it cuz that's like soupy that's where the live resin is it's like soupy soupy Terps anyways um I'm hungry I'm gonna eat pizza and then it and I'm gonna drizzle down marinara sauce down like my palette and wipe it up with my big napkin huh but what I'm gonna use is this lighter that says hungry on it and it's dripping marinara pizza sauce down his face to heat up my quarts banger nail cord snail it's a 14 millimeter male quartz nail inside of that rhymes like a snail with a tail write a poem about male about it anyways I'm gonna smoke it out of this andg ball and what we're gonna do is just heat this up with this I've never used one of these small letters to do this before I gotta find my Clark cap holy oh right there anyways I didn't move that that far from that so I guess it's still getting up I guess this will work but it kind of hurts my thumb more than just holding a blowtorch by like the handle of exciting something down with this so I might not do this that frequently but I wanted to do this for just one video probably just to do it when expecting this mango live resin sauce to smell or taste as good as it smells that's probably hot enough cuz I don't want to hold it anymore not getting antsy I just you know let's get up a crystal of this I'm not gonna show you it for more than just a second and let's do it it tastes more like CBD distilleries CBD extracts than anything else oh wait now I'm getting a bit of haze mango flavor at the end yeah I smoked a CV distilleries tangi out of here or Jack Herer it's basically a hundred percent CBD but those are my friends that are watching me smoke cannabis and do that legally and lawfully and they're like wow I wish I could get some therapeutic benefits from some pot or whatever and you don't have license or don't want to get one or whatever you and but you want to get some therapeutic benefit out of some CBD you can buy this product from CB distillery it's called Terps elite it's actually got terpenes in there they don't have the percentages or milligram contents but it's therapeutic and beneficial so it's terpenes and you want to get the ones with Terp seen terpenes as Terps elate and soda just a regular CBD crystals it's not gonna get you high or [ __ ] up you can do it and go to work with the government and you can order it internationally if you want to that's an option yeah so that's what that quartz female 14 millimeter nail tasted like and I didn't light it long enough with the proper blowtorch so it wasn't the best did but um you know that's okay I'm gonna use an actual blowtorch this time and I think I might do it correctly [Applause] I'm gonna use my PID time tae Roma PID email to do this but still like burning stuff occasionally even though it's gonna just burn it - then vaporizes so nothing carcinogenic is really happening that's good I want to get a little bit hotter this is almost out of egg timer minutes and looking to look a little bit cherry red heating up like few seconds and that's probably fine all right so we're gonna do is take it rid of this weight there we go take a bit of this [Laughter] whoa all right sorry anyways um whoa whoo that's very good anyways I do that properly that time uh you're gonna want to call out some phlegm if you're a cannabis user and whatever that is you're gonna want to cough up some stuff if you're smoking cannabis legally I haven't tested it under a microscopic microscope yet but uh I'm not microscopic myself but if I were I'd do the tests as a microscopic man with a microscope to do my flem test to see if there's any bacteria or [ __ ] in there I'm assuming there probably is it's probably not a biohazard toxicity thing but uh you know just throw it out in the trash can or smoke on a toilet and spit in the toilet anyways um look um yeah this is good cannabis dude this is the first time I've ever had a live resin sauce I'm sorry for being like stoned for a minute but I'm actually just normal now and yeah so that's really good it's very potent extremely potent but not overwhelmingly so for a newbie this would get you rekt so don't do a live resin sauce by MPX if you're first starting out I'm not gonna lie to you uh I'm able to handle myself because I've been doing this for enough time and so anyways I'll explain this I could post what I'll probably end up doing is post another to finally mean at the end of this video if I actually want to do editing which I probably won't to be honest but I could trip on aliens I'll just tell you what's on it from the best of my memory alright to finally and I don't remember what the aroma smells like sorry about that the important things to me are what the properties and therapeutic benefits are appealing is for in its antifungal anti-cancer antibacterial and I don't think pain but it's good for those things bacteria of fungus and viruses and so for like I was talking to some gentleman earlier today about RSO and which is I forget the acronym what it stands for but it's like some kind of camp cannabis that helps some guy cure his cancer and now I lost my train of thoughts I started tangent Inc anyways um oh yes back to that let's see tur piling is good for antibacterial antifungal and antiviral properties and it's melting or vaporization point is probably below 380 degrees Fahrenheit or something maybe like 150 160 Celsius and that's not accurate exactly but you know it's approximate to the best of my knowledge right now without a meme and I've got the name so I could get approximate if I wanted to I just don't want to cuz I don't want to you know re-upload and edit the video and have too much space on my phone taken out but yeah those are the two things that are important to me about derp I know Lane so I just told you if you listen through all that and just didn't stop watching the video anyways this is good strain I think I just proved that by sort of making sense when I explained what your piling was intermittently explaining something else in between MPX melting point extracts it's very good super potent I'm gonna have to cherish this and savor it for a long time because wow it's very good anyways um I'm gonna put this back in the case and put it back in the box and then MPX make sure you got labels on your stuff people I work with are usually very good about that always keep it in the box or packaging after you're done with it please and thank you very much where to come from who's it by was it doing there what time did it happen that kind of stuff who wouldn't one where why it's important and it pretty much everybody supposedly so there you go that's what that one was and yeah there we go he's out", "EdoUnJuENuQ": "I'm gonna meet up with John Dawson from kung-fu dates to make some custom flavors of hash oil but the guests can consume music bait pens this is what we call soil tool rental product and what we're doing here is instead of taking oil and putting it on a hot nail and ad average or digitally dabbing write this is the wave of the future well let's make some vape pen cartridges dude let's do it awesome I can't wait to mix and terpenes so give you some blanks all right so this is my blank right here Glo empty cartridge right and this is called a removable center post and urine and screw the top you find your favorite oil people go with some raw okay great I just want to fill it up to this line right here right sure okay so looks like that's almost up to the line there don't want to add terpenes what flavor do you want to do so let's try Wi-Fi OG yeah sounds good to me so for that amount of wallet you need such a small money like a half of a micro drop okay gotcha I'll just put a timer all right okay so I've got that in there and yeah so I could feel from this arrange that that wall was pretty warm so that'll mix up quickly and sure I'm already getting a crazy amount of aroma Wow yeah that's incredible so now I stick my plunger stick your plunger in you kind of move it around you're gonna tear that shirt and just push it down it screws into the bottom there we go how many hits of cannabis are in one of these so you figure when we're at a half you're looking at 500 milligrams of THC now 500 milligrams in the cartridge for average everyday users that'll last a week let me say this real go sit with epic hits man I mean the flavor on this is uh it's pretty epic yeah but like I said we're travelling around the city where we're going to and from this is how everybody's going to be

couple where we explore and discuss our passion for cannabis today we are doing another delta 8 thc video quick recap that is a cannabinoid that is extracted from hemp cannabis plants it gives you a similar feeling to delta 9 thc that we all know and love but we sort of like to think of it as thc's little brother something that's not going to give you those same kind of paranoid effects from higher doses but i think the biggest surprise from this video is that i had no idea how many different ways you could apply delta eight for this video we've partnered with hometown heroes based in austin texas using hemp grown here in the united states they extensively work with veterans and a portion of all proceeds goes to help the vfw and the dav they sent us this big box so let's pop open this box and dive into it so let's start with the way that we've already at least featured on this channel before which is using a cart so we've got a 510 thread vaporizer cartridge here it's got 600 milligrams of delta eight and it is flavored after strawberry coffee and because it's a 510 thread cart you can pretty much put it into any battery is good for those carts and install it click a button and you're good to go oh cheers alice there we go i love it get this started oh nice big hit off of that yeah does kind of remind me of this kind of cotton candy flavor to it especially with the strawberry cough oh yeah really nice flavor it's not like overly sugary candy but this is this is good i would not mind smoking on this all day long so another way to consume delta eight is actually by smoking moon rocks kind of like a turducken of cannabis you take bud you take wax you take keef you push it all together into this crazy kind of hash sort of looking like thing and you can easily add it to a packed bowl or even sprinkle it into a little bit of a joint what this is is cbd bud with delta 8 distillate on top and then rolled again in cbd keith another very easy way to consume delta 8 is actually with delta 8 infused edibles edibles everybody loves edibles yeah we are looking at three different flavors gummies are kind of the go-to for edibles i love that i'm looking at pink lemonade fruit punch and blueberry and blueberry so these have 25 milligrams of delta eight per gummy and there are ten gummies in each container pretty good off of this vape i've taken a couple hits a bit yeah it's it's not that i'm high because i know what that feeling is this is different but i do feel pretty chill pretty uplifted that's what's so great about delta 8 is that i feel like we could dabble in every single way here and not get so floored that we couldn't get off the couch because that's not what the whole point of deltate it's to give you a kind of milder experience so cheers cheers everyone yeah that's good get a little gummy definitely don't taste the cannabis i don't taste any cannabis in this whatsoever if i just ate this out of a candy jar i would not know it's inedible what's great about these two is that it's kind of in the same genre as cbd which a lot of states have legalized and are allowed to ship and everything like that go ahead and check out the website for like exact details on bi-state specifications but pretty much all of this can get shipped nationwide which is really cool great way to experience cannabis a very popular cannabinoid without worrying that you're like breaking the law this is only one cannabinoid off of thc is delta nine that's delta eight exactly right another edible way of experiencing delta eight we have a couple of different tinctures usually one of the strongest ways to feel the effects of cannabis definitely the strongest in this box yeah yeah this is each bottle comes with 1200 milligrams that's insane 40 milligrams of delta eight per milliliter with tinctures usually it's good to just do them right under the tongue absorbed into your body really quickly tend to take effect really quickly great way to infuse food too if you're doing any kind of cooking add a couple of drops of this to it and like bam your whole meal is now infused this is the natural tincture this is mint tincture and this is berry i'm gonna try a little berry oh going for it you know i'll try a drop of the mint it's like a i was expecting it to be a little bit more syrupy but it's flavored water almost yes there's there's a lot of different almost like mouth sprays mouthwash that kind of reminds me of i mean this is also the mint so i'm definitely getting that's true that's true you should be feeling the effects of these very quickly i know i'm already just now starting to feel the first effects of the pen getting in front of the camera you're just like oh what's the next thing going but this i'm just like in the flow of it right now yeah there is just kind of an uplifting sort of happy mood and we haven't actually smoked any thc today so this is all just purely a delta eight high rolling on to the next product i see what you did there we're looking at this roll-on topical i know you can infuse delta nine you know thc with different topicals especially because it works really well for like veterans for anyone that has chronic muscle pain you can roll it on to very specific pain points on your body relaxation it has a kind of like i i rubbed a little bit on my arm earlier and it has a kind of like minty tingle feeling as well yeah i could actually see this working really well for any kind of a like post workout regiment um i did just roll a little bit on my arm and i do see what you mean there is kind of like a cooling like very light tingling effect feeling really good if you've got any kind of like neck or back or muscle cramps of just rolling that in and feeling the medicine get inside that's great nothing to do with like smoking or eating i this could not be easier for anyone that is totally adverse and afraid of cannabis in general the last way to use delta a that i was really surprised at hometown hero is introducing this to the market is dabbing it dabbing we've got delta 8 dabs here color on that is really nice and light let's try a delta 8 dab and see how we feel pull out the last things we've got some goodies here these are both dope rolling trays like cool and kind of trippy and sort of like future get kind of westworld vibes from these got kind of like alien sort of angel robot it looks very cool on camera too with the light hitting it damn yeah i'm trying out the sixth final way to do delta eight which is dabbing it cheers everyone as alice the first to try this this new delta eight experience infusing it into these dabs that was a big dab too it tastes a lot like cbd very cbd taste but i do enjoy the taste of cbd so there you go that just ripped me oh my god cheers everyone yeah i am feeling nice and groovy right now between the vape and the edibles and the tincture and my arm is feeling all tingly we've also still got the moon rocks there i i love it shout out to hometown hero i really am a fan that dab is kind of like next level and if you want to see more delta 8 adventures from us right now all you

garden so the other day in stream i was informed that raw garden was actually being sued and this isn't some sort of small lawsuit or anything this is a class action lawsuit for those of you who don't know what a class action lawsuit is it pretty much means that it's a bunch of people who are a part of the suing party you know a bunch of affected people are suing one group um for reparations that's that's pretty much a class action lawsuit does so a lot of other common um class action lawsuit things would be like medications you know side effects or medications you know all those um commercials that are like if you or a loved one has had mesothelioma etc etc those those are normally advertising for a class action lawsuit that's what a class action lawsuit is and um yeah so the the reason raw garden is being sued is over their packaging so for those of you who don't know raw garden puts refined live resin on the front of their packaging and that is not exactly the case it is not really live resin um now me personally i know that refined life resin it meant it didn't mean that it was actually a live resin cartridge it meant that it was a distillate cartridge with libras and turbines but i can see why so many people feel misled about it because this is refined live resin and it's even sold in the live resin sections of uh some dispensaries and and deliveries so um you know it it totally makes sense why this is happening uh there's been a lot of um you know markets and uh storefronts here that are affected by uh the false marketing which is why we we are seeing this uh class action lawsuit so let's let's go and read into a little bit of the article here from inkbrite.com i'll put put it up a little bit on screen right here but um yeah we'll start from the beginning here so packaging scrutiny class action complaint filed against live resin vape cartridge manufacturer as the cannabis market matures we see more lawsuits based on fraud including claims made on packaging and marketing materials a recent class action complaint filed in san francisco county superior court alleges that raw garden pro products packaged as refined live resin vape pens do not contain live resin instead they are allegedly made with distillate and reintroduced terpenes which is you know what i said earlier i i personally knew that but not a lot of people know that and some people take offense to the fact that um they think that raw garden is using the refined part of their live resin thing to get away with calling their stuff a live present so um yeah we'll go more it says here we'll have to wait and see what happens with this complaint it is important to watch as many industry terms have been loosely defined while others are well known and settled um you know that is just referring to the refined life resin term it is something one of those things that they're talking about that's loosely defined um you know and so here uh we're gonna go into the highlighted complaints here that are in the article so raw garden a dba for central coast agriculture llc has well-loved cannabis fib cannabis pens and a strong following the following included the plaintiff in the complaint the plaintiff claims that he purchased the raw garden vape cartridge and paid a premium price for the products because he believed them to contain live resin and that's very true we'd be paying about 60 to 75 dollars for per raw garden cartridge and um you know some people take offense to the fact that it is distillate and not real live resin i do like the live resin terps but i am a part of the small i am i am kind of in that little little bit that does think that uh they should be a little bit more honest in the packaging but yes the complaint states the complaint states that the plaintiff would not have purchased the product if he knew it was made with distillates and reintroduced terpenes the complaint alleges that raw iron creates the vape pen cartridges by making live resin distilling it and adding terpenes back into this distillate the company then packages and sells the resulting liquid as a refined live resin vape cartridge according to the complaint the complaint continues to allege that the liquid used in rawgun's live resin cartridge is not live resin because because it has been distilled and despite the re-addition of terpenes it does not contain all the organic compounds that are in other are in a true life resin so there we have it with the formal complaint about um you know you know what's going on here with raw garden um you know it all boils down to the fact that it is distillate with um you know reintroduced live resin terpenes now from what i read here they're actually making refined they're actually making live resin in the process and then distilling that same live resin while taking out the terps and then putting the same terps back in maybe it's the same terms maybe not but um you know the process is a little bit different i guess maybe from other ways people do this list but i personally don't have anything wrong against um reintroduced terpenes into any cartridges but again like i said before i do wish that i was do i did think that raw garden should be a little bit more honest in the the front of the packaging you know if they said if this is a refined live resin i feel like they should they should at least talk to people on the box about what that means because they could really they could have really still appealed to people um even if they said it was distillate i think the way that raw garden markets their stuff they would definitely have been able to pull that off so now we get into the next part of the article here destitutes versus live resin what's the difference so dabconnection.com explains this let's focus on retaining the strength and purity of cannabis concentrate taste and flavor are not a priority the distillation extraction process requires a solvent such as co2 butane or ethanol pressure steam and heat so that is discussing how distal it is done um you know you know taste and flavor are not a priority that's kind of why this looks not really one of my favorites i think i do like the more organic more full spectrum type things um but yeah for those who don't know how live resin is done it's pretty much just harvested freshly and then flash freezed immediately so that it can retain all its flavors and all that stuff and then it's extracted in a different way uh it's just keeping the cauli like it's like they keep the solvent really really cold and then you heat it up again to remove all this other stuff and it it's a process but just know that it starts very very with a very very cold run you know a little live resin focuses on retaining the flavors of the product and stuff and um yeah you know that's kind of why i like that so yeah what do you guys think about raw garden getting sued do you guys think that this is proper like do you guys think that raw garden had it coming you know that they've been lying to people for super long and this is just this is just what they get are you guys some raw garden fans and don't really see the point in the lawsuit me personally i get it i i totally get it um you know if if people are generally looking at live resin cartridges and seeing 70 75 or 60 to 65 dollars and then there's raw ground crushes up there that are actually distillate but you've got some distillate carts with cannabis and like you know kind of striped shrimp means that a little bit cheaper than of course i'm gonna raise a little eyebrow every now and then but you know like i said before i don't think there's any inherent problem with um having reintroduced terpenes into your distillates you know they they do that for buddies there's dizzy ones i i think it's just that you know the marketing just has to be honest yeah um thanks you guys for watching and um i'll be sure to keep my eye out on this situation and even read through some of the case files and um you know the formal documentation and if you guys are a little bit more interested in me breaking down those things i can definitely do that stuff but yeah thanks everyone for watching uh p2 out peace you", "HS1KtdWcwmI": "what is going on you [ __ ] bunch of stoners my name is yay 1 in today's video we're bringing out the old school y'all can you need a voice

Instagram you'll find the links of those down below thanks again everyone and hope to see you next time peace out", "F1Gj0gPR_Lk": "hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace", "MVT2XgW-iec": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive yo what's up ladies and gents and

we're not here about flour guys we're here about balloon [Music] so off jump guys man it says the monarch premium vape cartridge it's a hundred percent derived terpenes it's a distillate cart guys but it's cannabis derived terpenes and these terpenes also are sullivan less terpenes so they're not made with butane or whatnot and then also on the back it says on the ingredients it says triple refined cannabis oil i'm not sure what that means if anyone knows what that means please comment down below i would love to know what that means i'm wondering if it's like alcohol when you distill alcohol over and over so it gets less you know less strong and less like more burn on your throat and like it's more distilled kind of you know more premium so the strain that i got i got one grammar it's mendo breath and i'm gonna be real guys they are good with their packaging i like their packaging it's a nice package you just slide it up and then it also comes with this little card let me give you guys a close-up real quick here we go all right guys so it comes with this card and it says that they won the emerald cups first place in 2019 for their distillate cartridge and then in 2019 they also won third place award for their dislike cartridge so i guess they won two awards during the emerald cup one with the first place and one was a third place so their stuffs are pretty pretty good you should be able to scan them and look it up online maybe i'll do that later i'm not sure but yeah guys the oil looks freaking magnificent it looks closer to like a um to a raw garden the heck yeah guys bro i ain't gonna lie so far this legion of bloom it looks fire as hell i can't even front it looks like it's gonna be a good cartridge for me [Music] comes in a little too and also guys these cartridges are good because they have ceramic coils so it's you're getting less of that metal when you're smoking and you're getting that metal near your lungs from all those other coils that are made out of metal and whatnot these are actually made out of ceramic um made with ceramic coils and um a good brand for ceramic um coils i'm pretty sure is an avd cart but i looked on the bottom of this uh the bottom of this already and i didn't see any brand name but they do say that it's a ceramic coil inside so boom [ __ ] looking nice and gold so let's put it on a cart let's see what it tastes like man let's see what it tastes like but let me look at that see this is the raw garden it's a little bit darker than the raw garden but it's down there similar let me take a hit of the raw gardens real quick nothing beats a raw garden man that beats rawguard we're gonna take the rock garden off we're gonna put the bloom on and they actually have a logo on on the cartridge it's actually pretty nice they put a lot of thought and effort into their cartridge so we're gonna see if they put the same thought and effort into the actual oil to see if it's actually good guys all right all right so usually guys i don't like distillate i don't like distillate cards the only distillate cards that i really like are like sauce carts and stizzy carts those are the only distillate type of carts that i do like and sauce carts they're a little bit different because they add different type of terpenes to it and what not to make it a sauce cart but off a jump this actually reminds me of raw garden this i don't know man this and raw garden are pretty dang similar guys let me hit this one more [Music] time yeah i can definitely taste it tastes like a raw garden earth like you know you got that raw garden that's sweet you know the fruity fruity raw garden but this this one tastes like that earthy that earthy raw garden it's actually pretty damn good i can see why they won the emerald cup now this is actually pretty damn good it's surprising that not a lot of people actually i don't not a lot of people made videos about this i've been looking up seeing if people made videos about it not a lot of people made um videos about legion of bloom shout out to legion of [Music] bloomberg [Music] but yeah guys man i definitely recommend this it's actually a pretty damn good cart i'm actually gonna keep this one on the battery for a little bit you know what i'm saying yo i hope everyone enjoyed this freaking video don't forget to like comment subscribe man it was just a little car review i just had to throw you guys a little car review because your boy picked up and whenever i pick up guys i just want to give you guys a car review show you guys the new things that i that i purchased

secret nature and i want to talk to you really quick about our vapes [Music] our newest distillate formulation is averaging about 90 cbd and 95 total cannabinoids that's almost double from our previous batches hang on charlie i don't think they heard that right play it again for the people in the back averaging about 90 cbd and 95 total cannabinoids yeah you heard that right our team was able to create a high potency formulation that is a single source true full spectrum crystal resistant distillate with live cannabis terpenes this means that our oil is naturally distilled from the plant and not some concoction of isolated compounds thrown together in a lab like almost all cbd isolate-based vape pens we are also able to leave as much thc in there as we legally can around 0.25 since we are big believers in the benefits of full spectrum oils cbd distillate usually starts to crystallize when the oil reaches 60 potency and beyond because of its molecular structure however we figured out a way to naturally maintain the distillate in its oil form without adding any artificial ingredients or cutting agents like mct or vitamin e finally we introduce real cannabis derived terpenes extracted from freshly frozen cannabis plants in their live state pre-harvest and cure giving our vapes a true-to-plant taste and authentic farm-fresh cannabis experience i have with me here today two of our newest full-spectrum cbd vape pens white fire og and gelato 33. that rhymed lit let me unpack these and give them a try white fire og is an amazing indica that's perfect when you need a little r and r pining and mircine play a symphony in this strain and leave behind notes of lemon lime soda this bad boy has 436 milligrams to leave you feeling amazing matthew says this is the best tasting cbd cart he's ever ordered will says this pen tastes legit like real bud too legit will too legit to quit andrea says amazing takes the anxiety right away i'm feeling pretty chill myself andrea now let's try gelato 33 gelato 33 is an incredible hybrid with a sweet and fruity aroma is anybody else suddenly craving berries and cream if you're looking for something to take the edge off and offer a dose of happiness gelato 33 is the perfect way to go yvonne says this one is nice no substitute just what you're looking for the quality of this vape is top notch you'll definitely be impressed with the taste you're right yvonne there is no substitute for this quality chelsea says i bought this vape because most people say that when you start cbd you should vape it i loved the description of the flavor and it honestly tastes just like that this vape really helped me in the busy hours between work and feeling you get after smoking it is honestly uplifting and relaxing and i'm just now realizing that's the literal explanation they give you in the description of the vape i'm kind of mind blown that this has the effect that secret nature claims in those exact words chelsea we let the quality speak for itself that just about does it for today friends i'm dena mitchell and if you're thinking about purchasing a cbd cartridge look no further we here at secret nature got you covered with only the best visit secretnaturecbd.com for the highest quality cbd rich hemp products bye [Music] you", "jhJB497XdvE": "oh how is that one doing today dumb and died here back with another video in this video I'm gonna be doing a cartridge review more specifically another bear cartridge live resin I did one of these in the past and I think I did and on monster cookies I believe I'm not really too sure the exact string but yeah I've done this brand before and it was it was a good cartridge that's why I bought it again so yes and I'm gonna do a review on my past cartridge which was the Skywalker og from trap house carts I just finished that cartridge and uh it's a good cart man it was a it did the job at slump me out you know it got me tired out of a 10 I'm probably would I buy it again like what I get that same exact strain probably not I would probably get a different shape in strap out cards but there's a good strain overall out of 10 I'm gonna give it probably a 8.5 so yeah I'm gonna start doing that on the previous cars doing a little after review of that smoke the whole thing so 80 it says right here 80 plus t2 you guys can't see because of this stupid glass but and then it just says it has a wood tip is 510 thread and it's compatible this is citrus app it's a sativa I think it's actually a cross between like tangi and like a real igloo or something like that so yeah just keep outta reach all that good stuff it's taken out and let me know if you guys want to see more name branded cartridge reviews to like heavy hitters and that that kind of stuff so here's the cartridge there's the oil I think you said it has the wood tip which i think is pretty cool we're gonna put it we're gonna use the vape mAh battery button this battery and actually I just remembered something I just forgot the little screwy thing on the other cartridge so I will be right back alright guys my back I just forgot this little thing that goes on the bottom of your cartridge otherwise like the magnetic thing for the big law better yeah take this little silicon protection thing off see this screws on the bottom of your cartridge so he gives it that magnetic boom so Anne as she said he's pretty cool I see the big tip though not gonna lie like this is I [ __ ] like them so no homo [ __ ] this is the bear live rosin cartridge this car just hit me right away [Music] that tasty gave off once you exhaled the smoke was like a fruity citrusy type you know like how it is how it is citrusy SAP I mean I don't really taste like a SAP like maybe like a syrup no I taste like a citrusy strong citrusy flavor oh and maybe it's because this is a sativa but don't hit me right away yeah I think the Sun I'll show you guys a little boxing the boxing is really cool actually this is like enjoying the reviews leave a like oh my god do that taste now it's not even like I don't know it just tastes good it tastes really good just heads right away so this ateva effects are coming in on me I feel them a lot in my head in my eyes and I just feel like it's just coming on me you know this is crazy okay okay so it's a lot stronger than the other bear vape I did before because the other bear vape I did I thought it didn't hit as strong as I thought it should for a live resident cartridge and I don't know I saw good reviews on it on the weed map so I was like okay maybe I just didn't get a good strain you know it's it's your stop [ __ ] changes my mind I love these bear baits that tastes I have never got that taste from any cultured goodness so if you're from California and you want if you like if your shop your delivery services if they have a a bear of a partridge give it a try man this is 40 dollars a gram so yeah 40 bucks program you guys want to seem like more heavy hitters or brass knuckles or more maybe a sticky I might get a steezy battery I don't know yeah or maybe like wheat changes let me know what you guys want to see I'm trying to switch up the videos I don't want like to be the same thing as stuff you know let me know what you guys want to see if you really like in the cartridge with reviews because thank you guys

"Pm_MC3QLa10": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another reaction to fake cartridges video this is part 10 we finally got to the double digits not sure if i'm gonna make any more after this but i know you guys have really been [ __ ] with it and you know from the bottom of my heart i just really like like to thank you guys you know what i'm saying for just the constant support and this will be the second video i upload today the other video will be um three blinkers in one breath and mind you that these reaction videos they're most of the time their current day or at least a day behind but when my regular uploaded videos you know like that blinkers video that was filmed like two weeks ago so you know i'm saying people are gonna ask me if i still have that cartridge from that video i don't it's long gone it's out of here you know i'm saying so i figured you know i just get that out of the way when i do reaction videos i try i tend to at least uh upload the same day or the day before or a day after so when people watch these videos they can still kind of see the most recent posts you know i'm saying uh but yeah let's start this video off with a [ __ ] hit and i got the plug and play i do have videos that i already edited but they're scheduled on a certain day but this is what i'm on right now that mango mang that's just the preview but i do have a dedicated video that will be coming out in a week or so um but yeah let's just not take a regular hit though you know what i'm saying let's add this dab cap or dab cap i'm sorry [ __ ] up but uh video will be on this as well because you know you know i had to like just make a a video on this but look at it look at what i'm able to do now cheers boys i actually don't have any like wax to dab off of my b nails uh wax pen so i'm on this but you know what i'm saying we're making it work cheers don't have too much left of it but you know i'm saying it's all good i thoroughly enjoyed this but you'll see the video too and take another and let's start this reaction video right so cheers [Music] oh oh yeah so with these videos i like to post the best comments from the previous video so let's go with that right now [Music] now let's get started so we got tea savage salty's on ig shake my head let's pray for all the lungs about to get these are those robes those are okay i know these are fake as [ __ ] but my homie is saying they're good and from michigan dispensaries what you all think i've never seen that brand uh let me know if you guys any of my you know subscribers from michigan let us know are these on the street are they sold in dispensaries you know because i mentioned this many times many many times you know i don't know all the carts from each state you know some of you guys are from michigan and you guys can like shed light you know i'm saying in the comments below because you know a lot of these brands are coming out of the woodworks you know left and right it's it's really hard to keep up with them even if you're in just one state it's hard to keep up with all the [ __ ] fake cartridges or the legit cartridges in your state you know what i'm saying so just be safe at the end of the day and uh you know i never claimed to be like an expert on anything these videos it's just me reacting to it never have i said that i was a car expert you know i just smoke a lot of them you know i'm saying at the end of the day i would say that i have some knowledge in it and you know you don't have to take my my uh my words you know what i'm saying like it's far from that you know i'm saying i'm not your parent i'm just making these because some people you know i'm saying they're not as aware and they're very gullible especially with high school students you know they're getting this from their their homey you know i'm saying and they probably think it's legit so it's good to make videos like this to spread awareness and like i said i am no car expert people are always commenting another guy that thinks he's an expert i've never even said that you know what i'm saying so at the end of the day i do have a pretty big following on youtube and i feel like not a lot of people go on reddit frequently you know i'm saying and there's a lot of valuable information that could translate or transfer into a video therefore you know get more exposure and you know people know more about like these certain cartridges that they should steer away from or certain cartridges that they should buy you know i'm saying because this is some valuable information this could possibly save someone's health you know what i'm saying and i've had comments say you know you saved me from smoking fake cartridges and all that stuff it's very rewarding in itself but in the at the end of the day i can't even monetize these videos you know i'm saying like there's no gain in it for me other than to just you know get views and spread awareness you know what i'm saying so that was a little random sorry posted about found out it's fake now i'm sketching now that one i've been hitting for about a month had one just like it already finished it might be fake too don't have a box anymore in my experience most of the time when i see in rove they're very light and yellowish that's a very dark amberish color what do you all think about this hoe know what brand that is let's see what they think fake no leave it known as a cart it's definitely not a guardian what thoughts filthy laboratory [Music] it's a booth card a pretty decent boot looks like a normal display that [ __ ] looks like the craft ship but it's crave it's a distillate i don't know if you guys seen my cure company it was a premium distillate in a ceramic cartridge or some [ __ ] i think that's what i titled it looks the same like that the oil color and the cartridge so glad i moved to a legal state first part in the audience tastes like kool-aid rape dream great dream sounds pretty fire you know i'm not a fan of blue treating but grape dream sounds delectable can be very salty when you post up the real [ __ ] is that the canadian uh warning label damn stuck up on me those buttons like blinkers man even with that bubbler that [ __ ] top off my dick with a butter knife and set myself on fire than take a single hit from any of that garbage damn now tell me why you would want to cut your pp off rather than take one hand over yeah he's right you know i would i would probably not say that yeah that's funny raw garden cartridge cloud chaser review fan got one on a fake damn anything vape you know i i have bathing ape shoes i bought them like 10 years ago no like 15 years ago they're they're silver ones i'll show you right so these are mine these are so old i mean the [ __ ] shit's cut peeling off but these are real i'm saying i've only worn these like maybe 30 times in my lifetime i actually uh so me and flynn or calamity as you may know uh uh he had the spider-man ones and i had those grey ones and he spent like 300 bucks on his and i remember the uh the packaging it came in mine's different mine's the regular ones mine's not the superhero ones because the superhero ones come in those like you know when you get uh action figures they come in that cardboard box on the back and then there's like a like a plastic thing over it you know but bathing bait come on [ __ ] all that [ __ ] never become your own [ __ ] stop stop it cheap blackberry and the black hole scout cookies black is black market but it's rather because i saw evans farts smacking on them honestly not disappointing okay so a lot of you have been telling me to try big chief and you guys know my opinion on big chief but if you got it and if you stand by it by all means you know what i'm saying like i said i'm not anyone's parent in any way this is just information that i'm spreading you don't have to take it you know what i'm saying so just be careful with the big cheese because at the end of the day gambling with your health like that like that is not good and i've heard good things about big sheep don't get me wrong i've heard many good things about big chief but i've heard bad things about it and you know what i'm saying i'm really i wouldn't take that risk you know i'm saying but you know that's just me uh stay big chief stay big chief and then this fool bought nine of them he really loved that blue dream though yeah be safe man be safe horse head man toxic turtle so like like i said with the big chiefs i heard they're actually going into the legal market now so maybe things could be looking up for them i i don't know myself so like just be careful [Music] what the [ __ ] is crooked that [ __ ] ben [ __ ] that i think this plug i mean [Music] i'm still recovering from those hits anyone ever heard of gg organics i have not no no that's a big cartridge wow when the phones are obviously happy to see it ff is active on here so i hope you know comment to let me know crossing my fingers that is real since i live in south carolina and simply can't go to the store to buy one south carolina is that south carolina i don't know that's a my family don't look like that but they're also bought on the street most definitely fake like most wait so yours is fakes but you're still hitting it appears to be fake i can't bear 500 but it doesn't look like any friendly farms car ipad and the liquid is way too light for care resin plus 90 percent would be extremely high for pure aggressiveness face paint hopefully she's okay i live in south carolina and that part has a rod that's way too big to do this sorry we didn't lose yeah that [ __ ] damn man be careful [ __ ] you doing they doing family friendly farms like that now appears to be fake what do you think about buddha bear look at them i've seen a video about the boxes but these backfire will last me up to two weeks what the [ __ ] who the bear [ __ ] don't know i don't know this one took a picture of it on a door handle that's funny real or fake cookies watch full video dude like i said they sell fake cookies bags at smoke shops now like they encourage dealers street dealers now at stores storefronts that's just crazy be safe out there guys like you don't even have to order it from dhgate or whatever the [ __ ] anymore you can get it from your [ __ ] smoke shop [ __ ] bags i've seen alien alien labs or whatever i've seen all that [ __ ] i was like what the [ __ ] so are big chiefs really fake or are they real see that is that is the age-old question you know what i'm saying flat thoughts [Music] oh since you guys since it's the 10th um fake cartridge videos i'm going to show you something let me show you something [Music] all right put this over here we're going to end it right here but uh just hopefully you guys are subscribed because i will be unboxing these and doing videos for these but this is just a preview and obviously i don't need that much i will be taking some of them though but i might possibly be giving some away in the future uh but we got a pipe thing it's gonna be dope another battery oh wait this pipe is for uh cartridges and then this is another battery i think and i'm gonna see how that is you know what i'm saying make videos for all these so hopefully you're subscribed and i could possibly give one or two of these away because you know what i'm saying i can't but obviously i have to do a video on them first but possibly this one this two battery one just two cards your battery one this one seems like uh i don't have to clean much after using this end and then this one is an eight bowl pipe possibly gonna give this away to someone that i know personally because you know what i'm saying this is dope actually i might keep this because there's eight bowls in it just for the tenth video you know i decided to show you guys a little preview of what's to come these are you're not gonna see videos for on these probably in like a week or two plus because like i said i do have a lot of videos that are scheduled i do have plug and play videos that are coming out like i have a lot of videos coming out but it's a shame that i can only upload one per day to get the most reach out of possible but this one's a special day i'm gonna upload this uh on sunday but yeah hopefully you did enjoy this 10th one um possibly the last one of this series i do sorry i do have uh other videos to make of i mean other reaction videos to finish but uh you know i don't know if you guys really want it i might make one but uh you know 10 i feel like is enough hopefully you did enjoy it and i'll see you guys in the next one peace out [Music] you", "zXvIqpVzO7k": "[Music] thank you for watching ganja runner TV I'm Jake Gloria and today we have Lauren from heavy hitters here with us and she's gonna tell us all about their vapor cartridges yeah so heavy hitters is an awesome cartridge company it's all a distillate so these are distilled eight times total and on the 8th time they actually take the temperature almost to the point of freezing what that does is really just takes out all the plant fats and lipids that don't need to be in the product it just makes it a Lord clean and compact hit for you guys so would that be why is very clear yeah basically the clarity is a lot better it's also a little bit more fluid so you're gonna pull a larger hit a lot faster so how do I use this ah so we did just introduce the button battery just for a heavier hit we actually did invert the button so you're less likely to accidentally use it so how does one get a heavy hit what constitutes a heavy hit so to get the heaviest hit we actually do suggest holding down the button for five to eight seconds just to warm the cart just so when you pull it's immediately pulling the concentrate not warming up the cart the first one is Jack Herer this is our most uppity cart it's gonna keep you the most awake and kind of buzzing so it's actually five times to turn it on and then you would just hold down okay [Music] yeah so these don't automatically turn off say about that amount of time would be good the test actually you really taste like what yeah yeah so that's definitely a string specific one FARC we use all natural flavoring nothing artificial so the strain specific cards are going to be flavored with specific strains from the plant the plant champions and then our flavored ones will actually be using the fruit dripping Wow all right we can do a pineapple express this is on my favorites because it's fruity as well as string specific so I just feel like it's overall you have like it's a good hybrid good for any time of the day and it just strain I'll never get tired of [Music] and almost tastes like a like a little bit piney yeah so I just think it has a little bit of everything in there do you want to try it yeah okay this is one of my favorite self yeah it's kind of like excuse me oh man okay so we're back just a pineapple express and that was pretty heavy there's no 104 it's a button so just hold down in here [Music] Wow let me think very very sweet doesn't hurt my throat very smooth tastes great irritation this is Malibu og so it's super fruity fruit salad [Music] oh yeah let's taste like face like boysenberries it's all going to my head quite different I feel good Phil yeah definitely high but still like I can take on the day alright so now we're moving more towards the fruity into cos pink push I love this one just say like like pink lemonade or what is that fruit maybe game fish so diablo super strain-specific has a little kick to it like almost peppery yes button [Music] I think that would go great with like a burrito - no yeah really am diabla okay so meet at the end and I really enjoyed all of these vapes thank you for coming out and for telling us all about them I think it's I think that you guys are doing an amazing job of an amazing products tank it taste is amazing it's really potent so please come back in some other time let's try some more so yeah I'll be back with our new products okay guys thank you for watching we have heavy hitters available on at Cod return calm you can order that in California and have it shipped to your door so check us out [Music]", "rEwwGUg7IR0": "all right y'all i know this is a weird angle but i don't have my my gimbal is not working i mean it's working but i gotta charge it and i can't wait to make this video anymore because i'm about to finish this card so let's get straight to the video man today we're gonna be reviewing the live resin liquid diamond live resin buddies cartridge man so this cartridge was forty dollars out the door this is gonna be a full gram cartridge um the strain is gonna be sapphire og and triangle kush box first this is what the box is going to be looking like a nice mint colored box is going to be sapphire og and triangle kush it's going to be a low thc percentage at 69 cec but i will say that thc percentage has nothing to do with how hard it hits because it's one of the better cards that i've had um there's going to be indica dominant or straight indica i love my indicas um in the goods and higher bridges are my favorite sativas i like every now and then but indicators are going to be my favorite there's gonna be no cbd 72 percent total cannabinoids like i said liquid diamonds like resin um i was expecting the liquid to be darker but it's actually pretty clear and you could tell it's not distillate because of the leftover that's on the glass it looks like live resin you know like it looks like sauce or something and there's like little bits that are just hanging and stuff i don't know you could just tell this liquid looks different the consistency of this liquid is is not like a raw garden that has some clear ass supposedly light resin and it was just this the lip this is going to be the side right here you guys want to pause and read that this is the back gives you a lot of information in the back a lot of [ __ ] i don't even like i don't know what none of this stuff is here i just know what you know the tfc percentage is there's something cool about this i mean it's not like cool but something that i noticed most companies will put in hell for two to three seconds here it puts inhale until the desired effect is achieved that's pretty like you know that's something slick that you could add to your to your box these are all the terpene profiles uh what makes some like the natural terpene so what you guys don't know terpenes are just taste there's terpenes and everything i'm pretty sure there's you know terpenes in this gatorade disturbance in there so the way you open this just from the top there's gonna be a cart in there a clear box i mean and this is what the car is going to be looking like i've today's monday i've had this since friday i've been using it a good amount um i will say that it did go by a bit quicker than i wanted it to uh i don't know what i say is worth it though i got it for 40 bucks it's cool you know what i'm saying like for the price i just like if it was like 30 35 bucks it'll make more sense to me i'm pretty sure the distillate ones are like 30 35 bucks but i don't know i'm just like i expected it to be a lot more crazy you told me like this just kind of reminds me like a boy i don't know reminds me like almost i don't know man one thing i will say about this though the flavor is different i haven't tasted really any cartridges like this this is a unique taste i really like the sapphire og and triangle kush recommend this one if you guys haven't had buddies in general all right y'all so i'm gonna just put it in the battery for y'all take a hit and um so you guys can see what it's hitting like it should it hits cool you feel me um for flavor i'm gonna have to give it like an eight out of ten for the high like eight out of ten overcard is like a eight out of ten you feel me it's cool you feel me like it's not you know nothing crazy let me take a blinker for y'all [Music] it is a really [ __ ] smooth car though i will give it that um i'll say smoother than a hotter cartridge i said i'd say this is probably one of the smoothest cards i've had um like you guys saw it's like a blinker still able to talk after and all that so i don't know i don't know how i feel about this i'll give it like an eight out of ten filming i think that's like a solid score for this um nothing too crazy uh it's not the worst but if you haven't tried it i would for sure try them out just because the flavor is so unique on them haven't really had anything like them and uh yeah man so like i said i got this for forty dollars out the door um this is gonna be the liquid diamond one i believe buddies does also make a distillate one that one was probably like thirty dollars out the door i have to ask um i have to ask if they have the distilled ones maybe i'll get one and i know they have some cbd thc ones but i don't i don't like that [ __ ] show me i just like straight tvc cbd is cool should be cool for like uh syrup edibles and [ __ ] like that but straight up tastes like you're taking a dab i wouldn't say a weed i'll say more like taking this like it tastes like diamonds bro for real for real that's what it is bro it tastes like [ __ ] diamonds they're not capping about that liquid liquid diamond [ __ ] yeah it should taste like diamonds because i just had some diamonds you guys haven't seen in the video uploaded right before this one i believe it's the king's garden one tastes just like it bro what the [ __ ] yeah that's what it is man this should taste like straight diamonds you guys had diamonds before actual dish that's what this [ __ ] tastes like i don't know what number this is number one hopefully y'all enjoy the video hopefully i taught y'all some hopefully i learned something hopefully i inspired y'all to go get this hopefully i got lit with me man and i'll catch you in the next one peace", "IxckcK20ET8": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're gonna be doing some OpenCart surgery I'm just kidding we launched we've all been there a kit that is gonna take care of a problem that I know everybody who's in oil vaporizers has encountered which is your vaping your favorite cartridge and all of a sudden it stops working or you're vaping it down to where oil is no longer going into the orifice holes and you have a bunch of your valuable oil stuck at the bottom of the cartridge or your heater gives out or your disposable runs out of battery life but you have a cartridges no longer functioning which still has some of your precious oil CBD e-juice terpenes whatever and you want to try to excavate them so what honey stick did it was we made it really easy for you by launching our oil recovery kit which is everything that you need to help get a non-functioning cartridge that still has valuable oil in it out of the kit in today's episode we're gonna briefly run through the contents of this kit and how to use it to excavate oil out of your cartridge now just to backtrack a little bit the way that that we got this idea is actually one of our authorized distributors and my buddy Darrell over a rich mountain distribution he sent me a picture which I'm gonna make the video guy find and put up here on the YouTube screen as it said modern-day roaches and it showed a bunch of vape cartridges that are you know like quarter full or half full and not working laying around like you know people would have these Roach jars of these little collections of people have these little graveyards of non-working cartridges and vape accessories with oil left and so I was like man I showed that a couple of our employees just to get a laugh out of it and they were like oh I have one of those I have one of those I was like wow you know everybody must have one of those so let's make something to try to bring those non-working vape devices or the valuable contents in them back to life hence our oil recovery kit and let's make it affordable and easy to use so oil recovery kit available on WWE stay calm is gonna be selling for under ten bucks if you use the promo code that I'll give you guys at the end of the video you get an extra couple bucks off so let's jump right into what the kids contents are and how we generally use it so just to come this real simple plastic container which a lot of stores that because we whole sale and distribute a lot can have them just hanging in the stores so they have a little hanger here you're gonna get your kit you're gonna have your contents of the kit on the back let's get a little close-up so two filling syringes four blunt tips two syringe caps and some VG PG solution so let's go ahead and jump right in you just gonna open your kit and it's gonna slide right out you're gonna have a nice tray to keep all your stuff organized in and you're gonna have a really nice large instruction card here that basically explains very simply how to use this kit but we're gonna go through all this in the video so let's even though I briefly ran off the contents let's go through what we have here so you have two syringes these are two medical grade plastic syringes that you can use and this is used for excavating or rejecting your oils now these syringes they have a thread on them right in here which you will screw your your syringe blunt tip the into nice and firmly to pull pull the oil out or to re-inject the oil and when you're not using it if you have any oils in them you're gonna have these syringe caps right here which you're going to be able to use to seal up your syringe to make sure that you have no leaking all right so let's go through what type of blunt tips we have and what really they're used for on this side over here you have different you have different lengths of syringe needles because you're gonna have different cartridges and different devices where you might have to get down either deeper into the device or you might need a skinnier device to work with because certain cartridges for example they have a center post which doesn't give you that much space along the edges so you might need a skinnier needle to fit down in there or with certain cartridges you might have a thicker oil that you need a wider gauge needle just so that you can draw it out so here we have our thinnest gage oil and I'm going to use this just to kind of pry out here you have a very thin gauge needle let's get a close-up of that this is like a teal green color in our kit very thin it's about a about an inch in length the the shaft here is about an inch and a half and then no it's about an inch and it has a very thin opening you're not going to want to use this for any oils that are really thick you would mainly want to use this for thinner terpenes or for very thin oils or for CBDs or even for a liquid if you have it trapped in a cartridge don't use this for thicker oils and you might also be forced to use this if you have a very thin area between a cartridge and a center post to excavate your oils so this is a needle used for those devices now if we come down here to the gray needle blunt needle tip you'll notice it is slightly wider but the shaft here is only about half an inch now what you would use this for is you'd use this for slightly thicker oils or CBDs cartridges that aren't very deep because when you get down inside the cartridge the oil is more than likely to be trapped around the bottom so this would be more for larger tanks that have very open areas Torrey you can actually put the whole needle down in there to excavate your oil and this is also a good needle tip that is used for dispensing oil so once you've recovered your oil from being able to shoot it back into your cartridge because it's a very small it's a very agile you know you can you can point it down into places you don't have to worry about using something that is much longer that might be a little bit clumsy or when you're dispensing your oil so that's what you would use this needle for here it's a blunt needle tip so here we have four even thicker oils you have your kind of a kind of a Shrek green colored cartridge here or you know like a little Oscar the Grouch shade you have a thicker needle with a longer base this is gonna be for also for excavating out much thicker oils so the thickness and the needle you're gonna use for what type of thickness of material you're trying to draw out of your cartridge so make sure that you use the right and you know because if you have too thick of contents you use too thick of a needle it is just not going to draw out or it's gonna be very difficult so you have this needle is slightly thicker then if you come over here to the very far end you have a needle that's slightly thinner but longer so this is probably gonna be one your go-to stand that's why we showcase it because it's nice and long so you can get down inside cartridges it's not overly thick but the ring gauge of this needle is thick enough so it's gonna be all draw up a lot of the the thicker oils or sludgy oils now the other thing that we have that we explained here earlier is your needle covers they're gonna cover your syringes these don't cover the actual blunt needle tips but they will screw in once you've drawn oil out and you you're gonna store a syringe for later use you simply screw it in to the syringe and then it's sealed it makes a nice airtight you don't have to worry about leakage or anything like that you can put it up for storage now here we have some pg/vg solution now before my purists jumped into the comments section of this this video and start saying you don't want to mix out with your oils this is really only to be used in circumstances that you cannot draw the oil out that is too thick you cannot heat up the oils it's not it's not going to come out or there's just too little oil in there so what you would do is you would take some of this pg/vg which is available and you take it you put some into your cartridges close the cartridge up mix it around it'll give you something to draw out because if you're saving oil saving some oil and being able to vape it is better than being able to save no oil and vaping it so this is only really to be used in very difficult circumstances where you're not able to draw your oil or there's not as much oil in there to draw out it's really just you you add it in there you mix it around let it sit for a little bit and then you would go on with your excavation process so there's really for emergency situations where you would have something difficult to draw now let's go into what the procedure would be we're gonna do some much more specific videos of some of the customers if you guys can drop into the comments section below what cartridges you guys have had difficulty with so we can get the type of cartridge and make specific videos for how to excavate oil out of those cartridges that would be really helpful to us and we can make some really specific videos for other people who are having problems with and getting oil out of a specific cartridge how myself or James would go in there and go about maximizing the amount of oils you can salvage out of your cartridge that fail but I'm just gonna run through a real general kind of basic procedure of what you want to go through when you're looking at any cartridge to save some oil and as you guys comment we'll make some more specific videos and get them up here on the channel for you so first thing you want to do is you want to have your cartridge now I have these little styrofoam blocks in our shop because when we're buying a lot of cartridges that are made of glass it's really safe to ship them in these but what you want to do is you want to have a cartridge and you want to have it standing upright on a surface where you can get at it and perform a little bit of perform your excavation process without worrying about the cartridge falling over there falling out of your hand and breaking so these things are just really useful to have you can really easily just cut out a piece of foam or whatever use a small vise or something but you want to have your cartridge standing upright in on a stable area to where you can use both of your hands and not really worry about what you're gonna do this was actually a child lock cartridge so it's locked but you want to have it to where you can access it you can see it and you can use both hands to jump in and perform what you have to perform in there second of all most these oils especially colder temperatures a thicker before you start any excavation process you want to get your oil as viscous as possible you want you want that liquid to flow okay and be as thin as possible so you can pull it out easier so what I recommend is once you have it sitting there get a hairdryer and heat up the cartridge if you're in a warm climate state we're in Florida a lot of you guys are in sunny you know Southern California you can simply just walk outside and leave the cartridge outside for a few minutes and it'll it'll get really nice and thinned out take a hairdryer if you're gonna use a lighter make sure you don't put the lighter directly on the glass or plastic or whatever you're drawing it out of because you could compromise the cartridge you could you know burn it you can have it react with your oils you can melt a plastic one so if you're using a lighter or something be extremely cautious to hold it at a safe distance so you're only using the outside of the heat cone to get your cartridge warm you don't need to get hot you just need to get it warm and then once you're your contents in there they're about as thin as they can be then you're gonna go through and you're gonna select the appropriate tool that is gonna fit down in there but still be thick enough to draw out your liquids if I have a thicker oil that I'm using then I want to make sure that I'm using a nice as we mentioned before a nice wider gage syringe tip blunt needle tip which we're going with Shrek green and you want to make sure that it's gonna fit between the center post this one does fit however because this has an edge here I might want to use something a little bit thinner just so I can really get down into there this one is gonna work a little bit better now the thing is is because this come this specific cartridge comes in so close here I'm never gonna fully get everything that is around the orifice holes I'm if I kind of heat and then I tilt it and I come in at an angle so you're gonna have to play around with each specific cartridge certain other cartridges you're gonna be able to just jump right in there but it really depends on where the where where the base where how the base is how the center post is and how big of an opening you have to work with not each cartridge is gonna be the same you're gonna have to tinker and tamper around with them a little bit which is why I'm really encouraging you guys to drop into the video section brand names of cartridges you guys seem to be having problems with so we can do really cartridge specific videos but I've taken our performer tank for example which has a really open surface that you can get into so it's really not going to be picky as to which blunt needle tip you're gonna work down and get in there with okay and I've even had our sub-ohm which for example if you had a heat or go out and you're trying to pull your oils out I have it open here it's not gonna be picky you could basically fit the whole syringe in there so what you're gonna do is you're gonna select your proper cartridge make sure there's the needle plunger here that's what they call this a plunger it's completely pushed in okay then you could take this and you can make sure that's firmly screwed in there so it's locked in there then once you've made it down heat it up the cartridge you go down in there and you very slowly place the needle down to the bottom but you don't push it down to the bottom to where the needle cannot draw up the oils or get off air this works on air suction from you guys who aren't familiar with it and then you're gonna very slowly just draw up the oils don't reject them and draw them up so that when you're drawing it the oil doesn't get stuck here in the in the the syringe valve and the so as you draw it up the oil is gonna travel up here even if you see that you've pulled all the oils out give this an extra pull so you don't have any oils that are stuck inside the blunt needle tip because if you just take it out of the cartridge and you stop you stop withdrawing and you take this off you can have a significant amount of oil stuck in any portion of here so you want to make sure to keep drawing so the oil makes its way past the blunt needle tip as well as the base and makes its way into the syringe and once you've drawn it out take one of your syringe caps here with the kit take off your blunt needle tip you can drop this in the isopropyl alcohol right away to clean it if you do have some stuck in there then take whatever new cartridge you would be filling it in to use your other syringe [ __ ] it back a little bit screw it on and then push down and it will shoot the oil the air pressure will shoot the oil into whatever the little remaining oils into whatever cartridge you are placing it into so that's just a little tip there once you have this sealed you can store these syringes even though it says discard after use that is for safeties you don't want to be constantly you know mixing stuff but these are cleanable you do have to clean them after every use if you're gonna reuse them we will be selling extra bulk syringes on the website so you guys don't have to buy the whole kit at one shot we will be putting those up a little bit later but this should serve as a very useful kit for those of you who have experimented with cartridges or just any type of oils or CBD mixing or injecting you definitely want to have one of these definitely come in handy I mean we've already had half of our employees have already taken them to go work on

yeah I doubt you can see it but who knows so you just place it in this battery badass something you just hit it it vibrates when you eat it big clouds in that's on low temp I don't use high temp because I don't want to miss up my cartridge as in make it too hot because I'd like to get all my chirping so I keep it low you know you can use a high heat but you start getting not a burnt taste but heavier taste and sometimes it's not so pleasant and I recommend low while these on your libraries and cards if you're using like a dissonant or anything like that you can use high because it doesn't really affect it that much so that's that this batteries dope you should actually get one yourself the Blue River you can get it on their website blue river calm extracts and they also have a lot of that good [ __ ] just to let you guys know they actually have cartridge but that's my other review that I'm gonna do right after so yeah", "etoR5ts-y-Q": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video it is another reddit reaction on fake cartridges this one's number nine i actually thought this was 10 and i was going to say it was a milestone you know 10 of like this series but i'd like to thank you guys for making this series just well received and well well liked you know if you check my most recent videos like the most that the most views and most like likes and everything are the ones that are reddit reactions so you know i figured it when they're this easy to make i mention this all the time you know i'll do it for the people you know right after i did number eight some guy was like where's number nine uh well two weeks later here it is i'd like to mention that today is wednesday i'm going to be uploading it on thursday and also on friday i will be uploading a video and going live so you know there's a lot scheduled but i'm planning for this one to go on thursday and uh yeah let's get started with a hit so let me tell you five i like to mention that i did do this earlier in my car but then the footage got messed up and none of the audio saved so i'm stuck here like with the dilemma i was like about to edit that video and i already got all the like comments and stuff down that i usually do and uh turns out that the the second [ __ ] video file doesn't even have [ __ ] audio so but this is the pomelo clouds just going to take us some hits here hopefully you guys are smoking on that good stuff and uh like i said earlier i'd like to thank you guys for just making this series just i don't know it's just dope you know what i'm saying so you know the the stuff though just the love and support i've been i've been receiving over these the this series you know i'm saying this i'm truly grateful and uh yeah cheers let's take another hit just for safe measure you know what i'm saying but since this video is going out tomorrow let me know who you have for the fights you got the flyweight champions defending their titles i honestly think that they will defend their titles and there will not be no new champions but there will be good fights so cheers so there we go so usually with these videos i like to post like the previous comments or at least the best ones so here it is right now [Music] so [Music] all right we are now on the fake cartridges subreddit and let's just get started so we've got i just got this today and they're amazing has anyone ever tried hollow tubes haven't smoked in a weekend this hit me like two like a truck after two rips i still need to get this i know you guys have been requesting this i still need to try it uh i did i did notice something peculiar about this or very interesting is that this is cat 3 or c83 distillate which apparently is like one of the highest quality distillates you can get your hands on so be pretty interesting to like you know try that you know i'm very interested very interested the snap plugs back at it again okay so these we're still doing mario karts in 2020 i guess so [ __ ] it my cast on me for buying a black market and cat knows best you know what i'm saying choices booth cards is that a vessel so my last reaction video uh i think it was the wax pen subreddit i mistaken the puffco for the vessel they all look the same to me you know they look stick battery that you put your cartridge in you know oh wait the puffco is not actually that it's a wax pen but very similar and been looking i look for these for so long i know they're not a real brand but still better than a tank would so you guys know my opinion on choices i think they're very innovative in a way of them providing two strains in one product you know packaging uh but you know it's fake you know i'm saying like they're not a real brand but like i say i say this multiple times many many [ __ ] times on my videos that just because they're fake does not mean they're bad but that does not mean they could they're good you know what i'm saying so it's like it's like a 50 50 chance you know i'm saying and it's even i don't know it's just it's crazy it really is crazy and you're gambling with your health here and the chances and the probability is not good not in your not good in your turn in your terms you know what i'm saying so we got rip lungs see this is the dank vapes packaging right here look at this stuff what the [ __ ] oh tracks oh extracts glow extracts is it glow extracts another brand you guys have been asking me another brand is muhammed's all those brands are just questionable you know what i'm saying this brand i don't know 24k solutions and like to say like i don't know all brands okay even all legit brands i'm not gonna know of you know i'm not i don't study like legal brands from every [ __ ] legal state you know i'm not gonna know i'm not gonna be familiar with washington brands i'm not going to be familiar with oregon brands i'm not even familiar with all of california brands and i'm in california you know i'm saying so as far as fake cartridges go you know they're spawning like every [ __ ] two weeks so it's hard to like really keep count and uh i feel like these videos like someone asked me what's the use of these reaction videos this way i can kind of give you my opinion although you know sometimes like i said i don't know too much about the cartridge someone in the comments might know so this is just basically spreading information and it's just easier for me than just post processing putting all the stuff on the computer that way you know reacting is just so much easier you know it's like my dad says work smarter and harder you know what i'm saying so one of the better black market parts i've had what do you think what is this this is what they say trash there's no good street cars i like to mention that the people on reddit are hilarious i'll tell you that right now like they got they got a sense of humor i'll tell you that their sarcasm sense of humor is just you don't find that anywhere else well maybe in the youtube comment section but some most of that shit's toxic you know obviously uh you know what i'm talking about it's like the trolling and stuff but you know occasionally you do have some uh [ __ ] needle in the haystack comments you know what i'm saying so we got cbx cartridge highly recommended for anyone who gets their hand on this i don't know did they fake these because this is fake cartridges right i definitely gotta try this this guy's like lucky as [ __ ] this real so i don't know i'm not too familiar with stizzy i've only had them maybe like two or three years ago i would say they sent me a care package i did the the video at ben's house i remember and occasionally i'll try a friend's dizzy but yeah i'm not really familiar but everything looks right when it comes to you know the sticker with all the information is the sticker and not information that's printed on the box there's a scratch and sniff and it looks legit to me but at the end of the day i feel like stizzy is one of the most copyright like counterfeited products uh plug and play raw garden dizzy the big three you know what i'm saying so this spectrum this is friendly farms and their friendly farms is fake too so my club usually gets hurt from alcohol [Music] yeah i've never like i've been to a lot of dispensaries for a while now maybe like five six years no seven seven years of experience non uh when it's medical and recreational i've never received anything with a [ __ ] up box you know what i'm saying so fake right plug sent to me no batch number so i'm gonna say fake yeah you're probably right fake legit someone else posted this and my friend has helped as a couple and i'm trying to help i don't know about that one that looks cool though you know they have their own thing going a little stizzy battery i like to mention that uh some of you or someone mentioned that you know i've been receiving love on this subreddit in itself and uh for those of you who watch or are in that subreddit i'd like to thank you guys i didn't expect for you guys to talking about me on here you know honestly i just wanted to do a video it seemed like an interesting video idea and uh you know i'm saying i've been well received and i appreciate the [ __ ] out of it so if you guys are from there i truly appreciate it this is pretty much the best that you can get here on the streets here in new york city honeycomb clears do you guys think this is good quality oil or what and have you guys ever tried honeycomb i've been smoking these for about half or a year and a half never heard of honeycomb exactly but um i mean it looks fun looks decent looks like some stuff that the like with oils you really can't like tell you know based on the naked eye you know it was back then you know when we're getting flour and stuff in the street it's easier to tell you know you get like shitty looking like if if it looks like [ __ ] it probably is [ __ ] if it smells like [ __ ] or hay it's probably not good right but with oil there's just so many things you can mix with the oil to make it smell good and it's really hard to tell you know things to thicken it things to thin it things to just [ __ ] color it it's it's just it's really not worth the risk of your health you know what i'm saying meds are fake i bought one from a plug i had i never heard of the brand so i figured i might as well try it i knew it was fake after one year they don't even get you high if you ever see those or these don't bite so like i mentioned well i mentioned muhammad earlier i i really don't know too much about it but with all these black market or street brands you you just really can't take that [ __ ] risk you know it's i couldn't bring myself to it you know a lot of people are requesting me to try them or whatever but it's like i have only just i have all these dispensaries near me and the prices are are crazy crazy affordable and people are still like amazed that i'm able to get legit products for that cheap but i'm like there's no news for me to get any of these you know what i'm saying but we got my first real uh stizzy pot okay looks legit like i said i don't know too much about stizzy but i've tried some glow extracts as well um i don't know man just be careful we got krt this is this donald trump [ __ ] cart and [ __ ] man this might be the thumbnail that's some crazy [ __ ] so this is safe to smoke i don't know it's very clear you tell us it's like you've been smoking it oh my god like i said people on reddit they they have a sense of humor their sarcasm level is just top notch it's just yeah i just wanted to see what you all thought you can't tell based off just departures that could literally be anything in there like i said that's what i was saying there could literally literally be anything in there e-liquid [ __ ] paint thinner [ __ ] bleach [ __ ] nose you know what i'm saying when it's down to like a chemical or liquids and [ __ ] it's nearly impossible to tell you know what i'm saying we got himalayan eyes this looks like some liquor store [ __ ] oh yeah they're bad not even touch that and we got the alien slimes people are reaching nowadays alien slimes straight from cali hell no that [ __ ] was from baja california mexico i picked up this half gram for 40 dollars what do you all think is this it looks like a dope cartridge very disruptive if

this video and i'll see you guys in the next one peace out [Music] you", "MeVzVvDGnOI": "[Music] hey guys today we're going to take a look at the number one most common problem that you'll have with your vape pen and cartridge and how to quickly fix it so what you want to do to start is unscrew your cartridge from your pen and take a look at the two connectors there sometimes they can become too recessed of whether its packaging or being screwed down too tight and it's really easy to fix to bring it out so you'll want to grab a paper clip and just gently catch underneath the edge of the connector and tug on it very gently to make sure you don't pull it up too hard you can damage the cartridge that way so be careful and once you catch an edge you can work around the entire lip there so that it's in a nice proper position for it to emotion correctly with the battery next we're going to move on to the battery and repeat the same process we're gonna work underneath the connector here and ring it up nice and gently you don't need to apply much pressure again and once you catch that same edge just work around nice and slow so that you don't have an uneven space for the connectors that you're touching [Music] so it should be all ready to go here and we're gonna grab our cartridge and screw it back in the cartridges don't need to be screwed down too tightly for it to work once it's there you should have a green light ready to go all right guys thanks for watching [Music]", "SN7ADJelLeg": "all right how's everybody doing this John with C&C connoisseurs we've got a good one for today all right so we've got kind of a full dime for you here I'm gonna give you guys probably about half an hour 2025 minutes 30 minutes baby and then we'll see what's going down how's

be putting this in uh I've got a Jupiter liquid six glass disposable pin non refillable disposable pin this is one of the ones that they offer that events and things very neat I got a bit of I got a B D half BAM disposable but what I really want to do this with is these liquid six these Jupiter liquid cigs these RC cell cartridges alright these are liquid six these are what you get whenever you want to get some good quality cartridges these are where they give this a straight C sell quality cartridges best of the best in my opinion all right now we're gonna be doing a refill on that that's fast and easy not a problem I've got little applicator tip right here this is what you use on top of your syringe to fill the cartridge with if you look at this you're like man that oils moving look at that oh I'll move that [ __ ] is moving fast I have a heater right here then I'm actually setting this oil in front of so that it gets warm I know that good oils supposed to be thick I'm not a [ __ ] idiot okay so I got that warming up doing this little bit of a thing there I got my uh air is Janice right there this is one of them as a jewel pod refillable jewel pod with a ceramic cell cartridge coil in there for burning THC distillate we got a couple of those all right now to answer your question man this is what I'm running I'm running some secret recipe mango distillate this one is running on 73 percent THC total cannabinoids of 87.7 down there's at old cannabinoids 87.7 now this is not the best highest quality distillate you can buy I actually picked this one up for uh there you go we got some where's is that there we go double delicious critical cush strawberry lemon-aid distillate one gram $11.23 tax included $11.23 alright that's not for that mango that's for this right here I just picked out and you're looking at old cannabinoid air of uh sorry eighty-five percent at old THC of seventy-nine percent so you got your THC at the toddler seven I got your total cannabinoids over on the right right there it says 85% so that's what we're working with but you know that's what that's what the distillate looks like it's clear it looks good you know this does have added flavorings for artificial flavorings for strawberry lemonade I also picked up a bunch of grams of [ __ ] mountain high and we'll bust into some of that here pretty soon um a lot of that same for him fast giddy you guys gonna beat him fast [ __ ] hit me up but our log the damn baby you can do guaranteed guaranteed guaranteed I'll be there gonna be having a little bit of this right there some super turbid

is the cherry pie right here that's what it looks like cherry pie right there this one here 79% old cannabinoids we're looking at of THC am 75.8 4% it's up there on the top it's kinda hard to see but this is from at Mountain heiko very nice very nice very nice it is a very light flavor almost none at all I could mix it with some turkeys get a little bit of different flavors going on there first

all right folks there you go all right so I got seven people here I'm 7 minutes into it I'm gonna give a shout-out to my patreon patrons I'm a patron beast Rhiannon Foley thank you so much fun wonderful wonderful supporter they're got JK JK is out there Joe Kennedy's a man right there he might even be here Mel Ibaka we got screaming coils coming out of Washington State old screaming coils then last but turning at least we got JR Warner here my buddy John Warner he's the man right there he's one of my patreon supporters he gets his name up on the wall of fame right over here if you would like to know how to do that log on to my patreon page check out some of the tiers that are available you will get a shout out you can get your name on your board you can get one of the absolutely Milly many different mods that I'm giving out on my patreon supporters and if you are a top-grade $250 or more patreon supporter you will receive in the mail one time every single month on the 1st of the month I will mail to you a brand new unopened cartridge mod with a full one gram cartridge hell yeah try that out so that being said what we're gonna do is we're gonna fill up this this is a point three point three so this is only 0.3 of a gram less than half of a gram but it's great for hiking and things like that has a installed self-induced battery and everything in there I'm also gonna be filling up one of these half gram units there's one one gram and two half grams so those are C cell cartridges who you are as you can see on the bottom right there it says C cell ll9 2 L 1 9 9 0 jupiter-c cell all right now I will be taking this in song it onto a battery setting this up here on the heater next to the distillate so the cartridge itself warms up a little bit allowing the oil to soak into it promptly and efficiently I will also be doing that with this point 3 I don't know if you can read that but it's just right on there it's a Jupiter liquid X you see the big X right there that is the Jupiter glass liquid X this has a C cell authentic C cell inside of it comes with all your filling instructions on where to fill the fill line observed and all of the directions if you have any problems pretend Allah citizens please talk in contact info at Jupiter research comm these guys are one of only four distributors for distributors they're only for distributors of authentic C cell cartridges in the United States of America Jupiter research is one of them all right the screaming coils you are on here buddy shout out my brother thank you so much as one of my patreon supporters right there big shout out the screaming coils my brother brother alright so here we go um yeah that's a sale day the sale over at nature's gifts that was a 35% off sale day kind of a doorbuster deal normally I can get that for about $14 but down to 11 is really nice okay on a normal day no discounts at all it's about 1718 dollars for a gram of distillate so that's that's average price for a gram of disciplic no you have use concentrate in terms in the cartridge yes I have used concentrate in turrets in a cartridge as a matter of fact all my terpenes are inside right now but I do have a very large assortment of different terpenes and liquidizer that I use in cartridges if I want to try that the only liquidizer that I really recommend using at this point due to my caste is true terpenes actual Turkey and liquidizer and all that's used for is turning a very thick distillate oil into something a little more liquid so that it will run adequately through a lower quality cartridge it doesn't actually break down any waxes or anything like that like you would get in one of the wax liquidiser or something like that it just goes into a pre winterized distillate and thins it up a little bit so it runs adequately through a cartridge necessarily I recommend right now other than that you can add terpenes to your distillate to thin it out but as far as liquid izing wax and putting it into a cartridge I've heard good things from the company wax liquidiser I've never used it myself I used one product from Nexus a wax liquidiser product from Nexus which is a company that does products for liquid izing wax for a cartridge and I was very unhappy with the results I didn't like the the heaviness on the chest I didn't like the flavor I did I was unhappy with it so I did not recommend it in my video there is a video of me doing that online and I don't recommend doing that that that was just my experiences one I've heard that farm to vape is another quality company the company I use is kind of a no-name company so I'm not surprised that it was [ __ ] to be honest with you anyway let's read some more here here my upgrade trans bud 0.3 huh we'd finish that super quick yeah exactly but what this is is uh if you go to a dispensary and you're like I've got some really bitchin oil just handle this card and say here go man take this [ __ ] home it's a got point three in it they can get plenty of good pulls off of it plenty of effect they know what it's like they know the flavor the battery is disposable when it's dead it's gone you know it is what it is so I mean it has its place is meant for industrial events or industry events and things like that tasters samplers if you have if you're an extractor yourself and you want to try your product you do a DAB you taste it out you put it in a cartridge they've got these that are point one point one gram it's just you put in there in your sample you just sample it through a nice high-quality very small ceramic core cartridge and you just get a taste of the flavor and then the effect that you're getting point one is plenty and a cartridge to get a couple good rips off of it so you need to smoke it all day to know what the flavor is to know what the effect is anyway getting off on it but point three is plenty for what we're gonna be doing we're gonna be using it for different events walking very discreet that is about as discreet as you can get right there very nice unit we're gonna fill this up we're gonna show it to you I think you guys are gonna be pleasantly surprised this little unit is is quite cool alright and uh just just for comparison purposes just because you guys would probably appreciate it we're gonna hold up the point three the point five and the one gram cartridges so you've got your point three right here you had your point five right here and you got your one gram right here all right I I deal with cartridges sometimes pretty regularly I specifically want to know as much as possible about the cartridges that are coming out see the shop that I go to nature's gifts retailers of fine cannabis they have a vendor day every single Saturday and they guarantee that one product of every genre one edible one concentrate one of everything at least is on hella sale from every tier top shelf low top shelf middle shelf low middle shelf budget super budget they have everything on sale at least one product from every single tier guaranteed every Saturday like this this was your middle tier right here your middle tier got down to $13 for this super [ __ ] bad-ass this is cherry pie slightly we got some cherry pie oh gee right here 89.2% in cherry pie oh gee look at that crystalline [ __ ] right there 13 dollars a gram all right you got your distillate which is a low budget discipline this is a double delicious brand double delicious brand insolent and it was on sale for $11 a gram okay then they had a doorbuster deal which was $13 for low top shelf not quite full time but low top shelf turf crystals $13 or $14 for some turf crystals of a jungle cake which is something I didn't get any I don't like the farm I don't appreciate her work but it was quality it is quality so there you have it anyway Oh once again I want to give a shout out to all my patreon supporters thank you guys so much I really appreciate you guys pitch it in these are the direct result of my trip to the Indo Expo here's the press pass right there you guys paid the gas to get down there and I really appreciate it okay you guys paid some of the gas to get down there but you guys were a big part of it you're the only reason I was really able to do it and I appreciate that so this content is thanks to those four patreon supporters we got John Warner or JR Warner right here we got screaming coils you can say thanks to him right there we had Joel Kennedy say thanks to him right there and we got rien and Foley I don't know if she's here yet but if she's not you say things to hurt whenever you guys see her on the screen feed right on right on right on so now that I've been jacking my job I'm gonna do a dab I'm gonna grab this just let her fill up some cartridges you guys ready for that all right thank you so much for tuning in by the way let's get this done all right not too much on you're gonna have to open up another jar here pretty soon but not yet this still got a little bit of the terpenes in it yes sir yes sir yes sir I got me some OG he cush busted me a bottle of ji cush terpenes out did a drippity drop drop he drop onto my crystals here came up with some OG Kush crystal dubba dubba dabs very very delicious I used the last of my wedding cake here recently I cried a little bit in my goddamn Cheerios when I did it but I did it because it was so damn good all right folks let's get a dab on what's up Dave from Detroit man hope things are turning up turning up for you my friend if not it's Sunday it's Sunday Monday I'll probably worse so live it up live it up right cheers for years folks okey-dokey okay what the [ __ ] was I talking oh my damn great hey Loretta how's it going um did you catch that Cassie uh he wants you to do some goddamn he wants you to pay do some commentary on your mail videos well I see that anyway no I don't need terms lover things I'll have to check that stuff out for sure I literally don't have anything out here and I should have everything out here and I literally I don't have any other but [ __ ] it doesn't matter ah cells there all the time never ear said no dates price gave me down man I know sorry man I'm sorry I really apologize man I don't know what to tell you I would never ever ever condone traveling across state lines with concentrates or marital products of any form but hypothetically speaking if you live near a recreational state times like 7/10 for 20 different dates like that you can get concentrates I was able to get up a very nice quality concentrate one time for $7.00 a gram if you're used to paying 25 dollars a gram think if you were just to save up a little bit and you were just to do a road trip for personal use of course it would definitely hypothetically be extremely worth it you need to think how much do you pay for 10 grams normally $70 I've seen one gram go for $70 okay so mathematically speaking hypothetically of course if I lived in Idaho I would not be buying my cannabis in Idaho hypothetically okay but that's just me and I would have no way condone that don't do it drugs are my drugs man okay man now I have heard I have heard of people getting on an airplane right flying over to the the areas you know I'm saying if you're paying $80 a gram all right seriously you get a plane ticket for 160 bucks that's 2 grams right you get $300 saved up right what's that 4 grams so now you're out six grams of dope right you get on your plane ticket to fly over to a recreational area you get a wonderful experience a wonderful experience an absolutely wonderful experience what it should be all right and with that $300 you buy 30 [ __ ] grams 33 [ __ ] zero okay and then hypothetically don't do it hypothetically but don't do it you box all that [ __ ] up into a box and you mail that [ __ ] to home then you get on your airplane you fly home today why would a wonderful vacation I just had and you know a really a really bad person might get home and sell six grams of that distillate for 80 bucks and then they would have a free vacation in 24 grams of distillate don't do that it's not proper but if you do the math all that [ __ ] checks out every single piece but anyway um now that I've talked long enough I'm gonna blow my nose a little bit and then we're gonna do this damn distillate thingy that I've been talking about we really narrowed it down to six people huh there used to be a lot on there now it seems like that might be a bit of a stretch for a lot of people you know what I'm saying traveling all that distance for something now you need to think there are at least two people in this chat right now they use cannabis medicinally as [ __ ] all right couple people are dying right how you doing reasoning how are you I'm so Washington State for example does not have mandatory pesticide testing for their product a lot of people in an uproar about that I don't know exactly what parts per million my medicine has in it now you go to any one of these illegal states you're buying dope from some dude on the corner pesticides are in that maybe none make me they're not using a single bed sure why not now Oregon California Denver a lot of legal states they test for every [ __ ] thing all right just think about that if you think that clean medicine will make you live as much as one [ __ ] day longer is it not worth going there is it not worth going there just to do that just to have that peace of mind that that whatever the [ __ ] you know what I'm talking about but anyway we're off on tangents now like I said we're gonna bring you guys in we're gonna take you guys and bring you in to here here excited about that you guys seem excited I can tell the shade screams shaking and [ __ ] you guys are just twitching the mission I can see it I can see it I can feel it already how you do it didn't get right up close personal image engine it's weird got a big nose all right here we go I'll give you guys a reference point there's the desk you can't see me and the desk at the same time I'm sorry okay but it's also much darker here because the light glares much better cannabis marijuana THC okay we have here in the half gram cartridge this is the C cell cartridge by Jupiter research we have here a point three gram disposable pin this is also by C cell we want to take the mouthpiece and want to take the other mouthpiece we want to keep these handy we want to keep these handy for one [ __ ] reason and one reason filing as it states in the directions if you are reading the goddamn directions it says right here immediately after filling install the mouthpiece and twist clockwise to tighten all right bayar to install the mouthpieces and two minutes are filling their result in leakage you see that [ __ ] do you see that [ __ ] so if you're filling up like [ __ ] 50 of these cartridges you need to [ __ ] think about that they stay right [ __ ] there they are to install the mouthpiece within two minutes of filling may result in leakage okay maybe you should do 10 [ __ ] cart runs or some [ __ ] right depending on your system how many do you want to do in a row before you [ __ ] timeout you know what I'm saying I mean you want a failure rate as low as possibly production quality as high as possible [ __ ] do I know I'm just some dude [ __ ] smoking weed right okay here we go now what again what I am utilizing at this particular point is some mango secret recipe distillate that chance they send the cheapest [ __ ] blend of trash he swept up off the floor but it's pretty clean so I'm pretty happy with it other than that here you guys go I just lost another viewer you guys upset about that I'm doing exactly what I'm title said I'd be doing guys ready here we go okay this right here the oil is plenty malleable as you can see thank goodness it's sitting in front of that [ __ ] heater alright we're gonna go right over to the tip there oh there we go and here we go now here is the C cell let me introduce Ian go around a little bit a little bit okay all right I do have some god dang dang do air right there but I'm gonna set this back up a furnace heater you guys know I'm talking about right screw that mouthpiece on very nice okay there we have our nominal C cell cartridge so this is the 0.5 grandma grammar all right so there's back over in front of the heater here let that warm up and here down in there now this is the point 3 this should be nicer I've never done one of these before it's the same basic deal to spray the oil in all right they say point three but if you're a [ __ ] jackass slapped me you can point forward a [ __ ] you think I [ __ ] can I just [ __ ] did I [ __ ] did okay all right wow I sure put a lot in there you screw the mouthpiece on just like that and right there you've got a very very sexy little [ __ ] unit right there what the [ __ ] do you thing about that all right that is sexy as [ __ ] this was in much oil Jupiter where the [ __ ] reflection on there Jupiter liquid X Jupiter research calm there's a phone number call them tell them John [ __ ] sent you they don't but it does I talked to somebody at the place they like yeah oh not bad not bad not bad I'm gonna set that over there right next to the other one and I know when they were built let that [ __ ] cycle slow and warm and go for a minute or two well I do another one don't you know and then we'll get that blowing some smoke what do you I say what do you say what do you say what do you say what'd he say all right message retracted holy [ __ ] oh he took all of this messages

[Laughter] Wow that stuff is just so so very high-quality you know what I'm saying this goes back to what I was saying earlier about road trips this is just like I said this is $13 maybe $13 a gram for this the only real color in that is a little bit of almost no torches allowed no it's like laughs right that's why I'm gonna have an email I'm gonna have a silicone rig hopefully all right what music now well I just I gotta tell you I listen to horrible music my wife can inform you of my horrible music if she wants to Madonna she needs you Oh probably the reason our music some of the non carborundum another [ __ ] right yes at him fest but you can they have a bad check they have a bad check okay they have a bag check they checked your bag for torches they check your bag for rigs okay now what I normally take the Hempfest is to take bubbles my little bubbler my little bubbles I'll grab her for you hold on this is bubbles she's very very neat she's very cool she's a very awesome she's quite awesome and if you dump the water out of her and you invert her a hundred and eighty degrees upside down you can put right here the crotch of your pants right there this will add to your manliness by pushing your scrote all the way out and proud onto a platform like most will be able to see greatly this will shoot down one leg this will go down the other wait a little bit and it will be stable enough if your balls are holding it good did you sit there high and proud and nobody'll feel it unless they feel this far down from your crotch which they don't do that so all right I normally get this one in no problem I walk this one right through the old gates there and uh my torch I have a Newport blazer torch and I'm a bit of a mechanic a little bit so I adapted it a little bit to where it's about smaller than my fist and then I just take I take this okay then and I take my torch and away we go I'm very popular because very few other people have a torch and a rig in Hempfest so that's pretty neat but this right here this is my go case all right and all I need to do is replace this glass rig right here with a silicone rig and there's nothing in here that is not allowed in him fest by the way I'm press I've got a [ __ ] VIP press pass backstage everything pass so I'm not sure I even need to convert to silicone but just to abide by the rules I'm gonna make sure I get my goddamn rig in there one way or another you guarantee that [ __ ] um and now that's my go get I take that whenever I go anywhere hashtag mini nails the [ __ ] whatever and uh mini nail

friends this right here it's cannabis oil this right here is the tube cannabis oil came in this is the vapor cartridges right here you got one vapor cartridge that's permanently installed on a battery it's called a disposable go I just made that [ __ ] up this is a liquid ex by Jupiter research C cell to be exact the other one is a liquid sakes glass cartridge this is a C cell cartridge from smore the brand C cell they are the main distributor of C cells more devices so that being said we are going to give a bit of a pull on it it's pretty cool how that lights up I don't want to draw on this son-of-a-bitch too fast I think I filled the other one up first this one has a preheat this is that mango I was talking about so these cartridges I have found personally and all the devices that I put them in like this magic 7/10 right here from bat mod it's not too bad I think it runs about 3-4 this Drago right here from a mod it's pretty cool it's got one of them resin [ __ ] faces on it you said resin on Hertz light absorbing [ __ ] doesn't matter but uh this goes from like 2.4 up right this right here this has variable voltage this goes from 3.4 up right this one here and this is variable voltage from 2.6 and up yeah this one here and it doesn't say I'm pretty sure this one is like 3.2 and up and then this one here this says it has variable voltage but it doesn't say what it is this is the the air space so I have found while testing all these different batteries to this what's [ __ ] new these C cell liquid 6 510 thread glass cartridges right here they work best up to about 3 point 4 volts over that you start getting a burnt flavor that continues through the life of the cartridge if you hold the battery down for a long draw that's that's just what it is that's what it is that's not saying that the cartridge is no good that's saying that the cartridge is so efficient it vaporizes oil perfectly well at two point four to three point four degrees or volts it doesn't need four point five volts to activate this cartridge if it does then you will burn your cartridge that's just something to say and don't whenever you run this this cartridge through like I had one I ran through a uh I ran through a CB d5 battery it was a two battery kinda like this one right here alright and it wasn't clear on the voltages so I wasn't sure what the voltage was well I ran my cartridge to it it burned my cartridge like you could taste if it tasted bird to [ __ ] and it didn't taste like that just before so I took the mouthpiece off I drew the oil out I'll put the oil into another cartridge a brand new cartridge and the oil tasted good again it was definitely the burn cartridge and it was telling that battery we have not used that battery since because that didn't have clear clear instructions for the voltages I didn't even review that battery pissed me off so much I didn't want you guys to buy it and then not [ __ ] realize that but anyway that is what that is these these these are very high quality cartridges they can be bought at the link in the description Bay part smart comm if you click down there click that link go in there it'll take you to the home page looking cartridges look for parts alright this right here I don't know if it's drawn to very good I'm half we worried about it I don't want to burn up the cartridge because this is the first woman I've ever had but it shouldn't take any longer than the [ __ ] another one they're the same [ __ ] technology right not fully tasting the oil just yet tasting a little bit of something but it doesn't taste like it's possibly a good thing I don't know there are a couple bubbles but none of them are actually over the holes see that one is above the hole so I'll let it saturate for as long as it says they let it saturate so I'm pretty excited about it hopefully it works good we're trying more time then I'm going to kick the [ __ ] out of here and I'll let you know how this goes on Monday morning on the wake and bake have you seen any thank you so much me okay there was some there was some mango there you go alright I'm being a little bit of a [ __ ] with the goddamn thing because I don't want to burn it up this one here is completely contained I'm not even sure I think the only hair draw is that little tiny [ __ ] that little [ __ ] right there you can barely see that little rectangle right there there we go oh yeah see now she's born that's what I need to do it needed to get warm you get one view that well there we go all right well that's pretty good there that actually cloud it out really nice there at the end there's a big-ass [ __ ] bubble right there though someone let that summits rise up out of there so there you have it uh what am i goddamn glitter of all kinds of [ __ ] focus over there um got some videos coming up with some of this [ __ ] over here just let you guys know and as always say Kinkos I certainly will do that yes I did sir Locke I got this liquid x class cartridge had an event so I'm trying that out I think it's gonna be super cool all right that being said you guys have an absolutely wonderful day thank you so much for tuning in I really do appreciate it we will see you bright and early Monday morning on my sister channel wake and bake with C&C once again thank you so much y'all have an absolutely wonderful day peace", "9HLGL5fEt2k": "[Music] hi guys I'm van Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we are doing a helpful Pro tips video that I have been getting tons of email customer service requests for which is basically how to clean and maintain your tank or how do you get the most usable life out of your throwaway tank several people are refilling these and you want to get the most number of uses or you want to get them cleaned up so this video is basically gonna run through how to clean up your tank maintain it get it back to you level whether it's a complex tank like our sub old carbon fiber a Cannabis Cup winning tank or whether it's a simple 5-10 thread thing fact the matter is as you use on certain oils certain terpene profiles get in there certain areas get gummed up they don't get cleaned you want to get the taste out get your tank back to new level and this video is going to give you some really useful tips on how to do that so Before we jump into the video I don't know what type of level of Pro cleaning you guys are into but I'm gonna go to the extreme and basically supply all of the equipment that you will need in the worst possible case scenario so you are prepared for everything so let's go over what I have here I just have a couple tanks so I poured some dark eliquid into I don't believe in wasting CBD or medical oils I let them sit for a week so that so that they they get a little bit discolored and they go and get on to the gaskets and get all over the insides of tank I had my guys keep them upside down and whatnot so we can get the tank dirtied up a little bit just enough so we can show you guys how to clean it so we have our example tanks then over here let's get a nice little shot I've had this for a couple of years this is actually a little coiler kit that I bought off of Amazon anybody who's into vape mods vaporizers or small things for 10 bucks or 15 bucks whatever I paid for on Amazon it is super useful I use it in here in my office taking apart vaporizers - tampering with small things constantly I mean for 10 15 bucks you can't beat it it's called a mod coiler kit it comes with these really useful little ceramic tweezers so there don't conduct static electricity they come with these almost like like a little dental tool so you grab little small gaskets and little bitty things you can play some with small screwdrivers with all different types of sets scissors thanks for 10 bucks if you're tampering around these things definitely an awesome investment we have our tanks always good to have rubber gloves before you start cleaning your tank these things are gunky some of them are borderline gross you know the oil gets slippery the rubber does give you a good grip when you're taking the tanks apart much easier to throw away the gloves than to you know try to scrub off your skin afterwards the key component that you're gonna need whether you need any of the other things or not is isopropyl alcohol there's over 90 percent purity this stuff is not going to mess up your electronics do not use soap and water to clean your tanks or anything they'll come in contact with electricity only use isopropyl alcohol this stuff kills all the bacteria will definitely break down any type of oils that are stuck to the gaskets in your tank it's gonna give it a nice clean smell it's not gonna mess up your electronics this is your best bet to getting your tank close to you you can pick these up at any grocery store any type of you know CVS Walgreens little convenience shop usually will have this or you could order it online then I bring some styrofoam cups some thick styrofoam cups this is what I set out my bets are basically my little quarantine centers in two and then I have paper towels they do not particle eyes you don't want to use the types of the types of paper towels or napkins that once they get wet and you and you try to turn on them like almost like a toilet paper that they can particle eyes or fuzz up because you don't want that stuff in your tank coming in contact with your electronics it is just not going to be good so any type of paper towel that doesn't really particle eyes once it's gotten wet that just absorbs will be good for what we're doing so let's jump right into it let's get our gloves on and let's perform some open-heart surgery here all right first things first my first cup is gonna be like tobacco chewers not a big fan with polar spit cup where I'm going to dump my residue is it getting wasted or CBBC here we are simply using discolored thick and hardened to e-juice so I'm gonna get out whatever I can get out there upside down then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to start disassembling the tank into as many parts as I can while I wait I don't want to get my glass all dirty so put on paper towels so then I'm going to start a little isopropyl alcohol bath where I'm gonna take these cups and put some isopropyl alcohol in them for the various parts as you can see I fill them up about a quarter way just so the components can become submerged now make sure that when you disassembled your tank you remember kind of what you're doing so that you reassemble your thing properly so now that this has pretty much soaked away I'm going to remove the glass piece and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take off all gaskets and separate them put them into one of my little bath cuffs I'm gonna have one of my bath tubs b4 gaskets that gaskets off could need my tweezers to get this one out make sure that you remove all of your gaskets because a lot of times if you don't remove them and you get them lost when you're assembling or disassembling your tank and then you put your tank back together you're missing a gasket you cannot have a good connection or you can have leakage which you definitely do not want to do now when it comes to the sub ohm tank you don't want to remove these bottom gaskets here because they are your seal between your glass and your base and just removing them wears them out a little bit more so you want to keep those as good as possible so we're not going to remove these those are tight on the base we don't want those to become looser now you're gonna remove your heater you might have to put some muscle into it you might have to get some pliers because some of that residue might have been down there it might have hardened and this could be oily and slippery this ejuice propylene glycol I'm definitely feeling that slippery on my gloves so in the event that this is hard to unscrew a bigger set of pliers or you know or you gonna get a really put a little muscle into it yeah it was definitely on there pretty tight so I'm going to take this away now if you are cleaning your heater make sure that you get it into an isopropyl bath but most of the time when people are cleaning their subloan tanks they're just gonna want to switch it off once they clean it with a brand new heater to top it off so we're actually not going to put the heater into the best since we're gonna give it a brand new heater since we're essentially rebuilding the tank here with this so we're gonna give the bottom base a nice little bath and that is also going to bathe with the mouthpiece make sure it's fully submerged if it's not always just add a little bit of isopropyl we're gonna drop the glass in with the gaskets because it's not that dirty heater we're gonna throw away and the top piece which has the airflow control we're gonna put into a separate uh separate bath there now this guy is not fully submerged so I'm gonna add a little bit I'm gonna make sure that it is fully submerged there you can see and while I let those absorb generally what I like to do is depending on how dirty the tank is I'll leave it in there for probably four hours it's just to really let it soak up let is sterilized let the parts break down you'll come back and depending on what type of oil or CBD you have in there you'll come back and it will look like the eye so the clear isopropyl is now like Coke or coffee or something like that you know so depending on how dirty is what you had in there but I would say leave it in there for a few hours on the minimum and go from there sometimes people even say you know if they set this up at night they go to sleep and then they put it back together in the morning the longer you let it sit in there generally the deeper of a clean you're gonna get for cleaning purposes we're just gonna let it sit while I set up and show you guys how to clean a 510 threaded tank so we're gonna take our 510 thread tank that we have filled up with some yellowish ejuice here all you could do is you're going to unscrew the top piece there's any residues in there you're going to take the spit cup here and you're going to dump it out this is obviously thickened and hardened so there really is only a little bit of drops coming in and out now there we go it's kind of shaking out the is really much thicker you can remove the mouthpiece here because we will clean that - no you're gonna do is reassemble is appropriate we were just gonna let the tank submerge the tank body submerged in there and next to it we're gonna have a little mouthpiece submerged in there then we're just gonna let it sit and we're gonna let it bathe with these generally it helps because you can't take the tank apart in the cept several pieces like we can wear sub ohm tank it comes apart into about four pieces this is only one piece and because that center post that you have in the tank there's not a lot of area for that liquid to get into so when you're cleaning this it's not a bad idea to just kind of slosh it around for a little bit kind of wiggle it around to make sure the alcohol is working its way into the tank and into the heater is generally you gotta just I just spilled that isopropyl all over the place but you just kind of wiggle it around and then let it sit make sure that there's isopropyl getting into there now the next thing that we're gonna do off is before you would start any type of reassembly is you want to make sure that you clean off your tools because you just use these tools this is the one that I really used that was dirty I don't want to get the dirty residues back into a clean tank that is the last thing that I want to do so clean your tools you simply take a nice clean paper towel soaking a little bit of isopropyl you can clean off all the areas that you would have touched make sure it's nice and sterile now to be extra extra cautious while I'm cleaning my tank I'm actually for the final phase I'm going to remove my dirty gloves that have eliquid on them and all different types of tank residues and I'm going to give my tools here a little final final touch always get a little smell test that smells like clean isopropyl let that dry and we are gonna get some new gloves and we are gonna come back and now we're going to talk about reassembling the tank alright guys we've got some fresh clean gloves and we are back to start reassembling the tanks so as you can see here you can view the cups you can see that my isopropyl is definitely discolored and we didn't let it sit overnight I said we let it sit for like 10-15 minutes while we're showing you the other tank if that and this is just strictly an example but if you let it sit for a few hours you're definitely gonna get a lot more discoloration the liquid in the more discolor it is the better sometimes if you want to go the extreme once a liquid becomes discolored you take the components out and plort it into a clean isopropyl bath you know again that depends on the magnitude of cleanliness that you want to go and how you really want to let this stuff sit but now what I do is I set up what I call a little drying station well I take the paper towels that I had and I fold them up so I can basically take the components out of the isopropyl bath and allow them to dry Oh as much intro track as you can and for our little tank we are actually going to take that out and with 510 tanks what you want to do you want to try to let them sit upside down just let all the isopropyl to drip out now this this guy wants to tip over a little bit so we're gonna do these and this guy we want him to be upside down as well it's a little isopropyl drip down and that's going to take a little bit of a while if you want to spread out speed up the process of getting the isopropyl out of tank you can always use a hairdryer use either the hairdryer if you have it only take each setting from a distance or use it on the non heat setting on just a cool setting because if you hit it with a heat gun or something like that or hiking you do run the chance of compromising the integrity or warping the gaskets or the rubber pieces of tank so do not use any of those natural drying is usually the best or use a hairdryer but don't use it on a higher heat setting or each setting at all so now what I do with each one of these little components I haven't given it much much of a chance to dry put this guy off to the side I haven't given it much of a chance to dry so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a clean cloth clean rag and I'm actually gonna clean and dry the glass and all the components within the tank to make sure move any residue and all so that I get it as dry as possible in the short amount of time so we can do this video do it properly okay that's nice and clean the base it looks brand-new it's nice and dry I'll see any isopropyl so this one's ready to go now if my gaskets I'm also gonna dry them off whatever you do don't pull on your gaskets like the rubber bands that weakens them it shortens the life of them it does compromise the integrity of the gaskets so be gentle with them don't flex on them in other words that's nice try it's back to white it was pretty yellow before we clear it into the eye on the alcohol that there so that one's done clean up this long these aren't exactly the most form-fitting gloves but you get the picture never clean off the mouthpiece generally a lot of residue with these sub ohm tank builds up around the edges so if you want to you take a little bit of isopropyl you just dip the cloth in there to give her a real final scrub you can really get a nice clean on it there even kind of fold up the towel towel a little bit clean the inside yeah you get that as good as new see no it's much better there you go now let me get a dry paper towel I can even clean the internals here a little bit oh yeah that's nice that's basically bringing you there and again you can use a q-tip you can go much more extreme I'm just really trying to give you guys the basics now we go dry long dry this guy off here okay now let's get to the bottom base a lot of times oil will set up in there the isopropyl actually did a really good job of just getting that out as you can see I haven't touched it since we pulled it out of bath so for this one you can take some isopropyl a really scrub down but in this event I don't see that as being necessary I'm just gonna go ahead and just dry it out give it an extra little clean I mean this doesn't look bad at all I suppose I mean the e-liquid and the ISO the isopropyl got rid of a liquid stains rather well just by even dipping it into that sometimes with different oils or CBeebies you could have a little bit of a tougher time you might have to give it a couple baths and a couple cleans but like I said case-by-case basis you will know exactly how far to make it so that's done there now we're gonna get the top air flow piece for this you want to twist around the airflow piece sometimes you get residue caught in the middle there or on different ends always good to twist it around to get the inside this gasket also removes because we didn't actually use this tank much there was really nothing caught in there it looked pretty new but you can actually remove it also so you can see because we didn't use it there wasn't any residue trapped in there but you could have removed this gasket also and dropped it into the bath with the gasket so we're just not gonna best so we're just gonna clean off the outside of it it's sat in the bath this will be fine get this we're going to dry off the inside and again if you want let these sit out natural air dryer more it might be better or if you just blow dry them off we're really doing an express job just to not make this video seven hours and for us to get it done so that now the most important part is is not to forget your gaskets so you want to make sure that you drop in your gaskets now with the sub ohm tank what's very critical about it is that you have a gasket that goes into each side of where the glass interacts so one of your gaskets is gonna go right here into the very top of the mouthpiece let me get these form-fitting gloves a little bit better you want to go in there you can take your little tweezers I'm gonna push them down to make sure it's in the crevice nice and easy just kind of go around don't poke the gasket to compromise it that gaskets in there nice you want to take that put your glass in there you gotta feel it line up then your other gasket is going to go inside the crevice on your bottom base you're gonna want to make sure you drop it in there it drops them there good because otherwise that will give you bottom leaking because your tank most the time sits upright so if you had to pick one of the two to do perfectly this is definitely the one the top gasket really compromises only if you leave your tank upside down or on its side with the air vents over so you put this one is good to your bottom base now we could have cleaned up the heater but in this event I just grabbed a new one this is a sub ohm heater you can pick them up on the website they come in five packs I already took the liberty of removing it out of five pack that's brand new then you're gonna want to screw it on to the tank you want to get a nice tight screw you're gonna feel the two pieces of metal connect you don't need all the time if you when you're cleaning your tank the next time you're gonna fight with it that much more get a nice good hand tight where you feel the metal connect and it's making electrical connection you're not gonna get any bottom leakage and then you're going to connect the glass and you're gonna screw the actual body of the tank together with screws into here and you want to get it tight don't want to over tighten it don't want to put too much pressure on the gasket is completely unnecessary then you're gonna take it you're gonna fill it prime it that's the place you do it but before you do that you want to do a quick atomizer check to make sure you did everything right in your tank works screw the top piece on and then you can do an atomizer check this is a brand new tank out of the box that hasn't been used and I gotta say if we do a close up even though we rushed through the cleaning procedure I mean this is this is pretty closely it's not a bad job for doing it really quickly and we could have done a little bit better but basically looks brand new so now we're gonna do an atomizer check before we fill it up because the worst possible thing you can do that we've gotten a lot of angry phone calls and we don't want this to be an angry phone call if somebody just goes to the process of cleaning their tanks takes a gram of very expensive distillates or something puts it in there and they didn't do something right or the heaters not working and now they're in a big dilemma where they just dumped a whole syringe in there and we don't want to be the cause of your frustrations so do a quick atomizer check to make sure you put the tank together properly you're all cleaned up and dried out what you're good is you just screw it onto a battery of 510 battery you're going to turn it on in most of the time when you turn it on it'll already give you an atomizer resistance reading right here it says point 5 ohms if we get good close up of that right here in the lower corner you'll get a resistance reading you see that resistance reading generally that means that you have an electrical connection now what you're gonna do then is you're gonna turn your wattage all the way down all the way is down as far as it goes then you're gonna push the fire button and as long as the timer starts don't leave the timer on a long time because then you could get a burnt taste in there burn up the coil but as long as the timer starts you know that you did a good job and that tank is gonna work and you put everything back together properly the atomizer you put in there's legit everything is good on that end so now you can take this tank and you can go through the priming and filling procedures that you would as if you purchase the tank from us a brand new so now that showed you exactly how to maintain and clean the most complex tank that we offer and it's not is only going to be easier than that one I promise you so we're gonna jump right back to the tank that has been sitting upside down now what you're going to want to do with this is now it has an isopropyl in it so you can see there's still a little isopropyl in it so you have two real options you could do here is you can take a very nice thin piece of thin piece of napkin and you can use your tweezers and actually get inside there to get it out to kind of spin and twist it around that might take you a while or you can use a blow dryer trip on this one - is he use make sure that you get it nice and dry on the inside I actually take my glove off for this one because this is a little bit more delicate than these gloves weren't exactly sized for me the glove does not fit so what you do is you take your napkin sorry not a napkin your paper towel you can roll it up into a nice little fine braided string so it has a little bit of substance and it's ultra thin then you get this string in there you get it between the center post the inside of the tank and you can actually kind of move it around and get any remaining pieces of the isopropyl out it's working just fine here it's gonna take you a little bit of time because a very thin very small very delicate so I honestly suggest using the blow dryer method or letting it sit upside down for a few hours that will definitely work for you too once you've gotten basically all of the isopropyl particles little droplets out of there you know that you will be all set to check to see if the tank works and get another fill on it including these little 510 tanks if you're putting different strains in there or if it stops not performing but it still works that's because there's residue gummed up in there you want to get a better taste out of each one to make sure it's a taste neutral and you get Paul residues out definitely good idea to clean your tank before you fill it this one I can still feel my hands it has a little bit of isopropyl on so it's good dry it off get inside the mouthpiece get the air holes now when you screw it back together and we're gonna do the atomizer test we're just going to use this mod battery remember when using your honey stick carbon fiber that carbon fiber battery you're gonna use a five ton tank on it make sure you flip the ego adapter upside down otherwise it won't read and it won't work so you flip it upside down let's turn it off move this little silicon protector screw it on now we're going to turn our battery on as you can see now it's registered at one point three ohms which is actually the factory specs for the tank as you get residues and they're dirty the resistance will actually go up on the ohms so now we push it oh wow I even heard it hissing there actually burned off some of that a little isopropyl and I still be trapped in there but now we know we clean up the tank the resistance is back to the factory specs on the original heater and it is ready to vape so this is a good way to clean you little 510 tanks get a little bit more life out of them get a little bit more usage out of them and when you're going in between tanks to make sure you're clean and pure so for this and several other cool pro tips make sure you subscribe to our channel give this video a thumbs up if it was helpful if it wasn't then drop in the comments how we can

] snot just came on my nose no weird [ __ ] bro [ __ ] but yeah i'm gonna take one more hair for your [ __ ] man i think i'm done for the videos", "jZ6x8shCQqI": "- PO Boxes you're gonna be doing a video today for you guys I really hope you guys are doing good it is Wednesday afternoon today I'm just kicking back - I was just wondering you know what do you guys prefer you live residents really hot right now really popular now compared to distillate which distillate pretty good you know don't get me wrong it's still [ __ ] fire but a lot of people been saying you know distillate get you a little bit more higher than live resin or I don't know it just depends but they say live resins way WAY tastier than distillate but this really gets you higher than live resin so here we have a live resident Stiggy what a distillate is your regular stays you know that means hopefully you guys got a close-up on the tasty percentage so one has more CBD than the other one so that's pretty interesting as well so let me know what you guys prefer a live resin or a distillate you know pretty curious about that so we're gonna see you know to me I honestly I love both I [ __ ] with distillate a lot to me honestly I love distillate since dizzy came out it's one of my favorite distillate cartridges or applause whatever you want to call it plug and play and there's just other some other distillate cartridges are pretty fire out there but here we have a live residence tizzy this was a this was a living cookies you know I did a review on it but I haven't dropped it it's just I've been really really busy you know it means daughters coronavirus [ __ ] going on but if you guys haven't noticed live resin is way darker than actual distillate is as you guys can see this little a way lighter than what a live resin is so you know first when I seen a live resin cartridge or a pod I was like what the [ __ ] you know cuz it's way way darker so that it was like one of my first times I had try live resin so it was way darker so I was like kind of sketched about it but you know they taste really really good they taste fresh like most of life resin cartridges are really dark you know dark amber color compared to like a rocker which is really light but the but the taste on it is way way different but so today we're gonna do comparison table I'm gonna take a blink round of both of them and I'm gonna hold it in and see which one will choke me out a little better to see which one will get any high so first off we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna go ahead and hit this regular distillate sativa cartridge it's a Sour Diesel as you guys can see I've gotten out of my dispensary in the fake [ __ ] you know it's good to spend extra money on the legit cartridge guys you know to make sure you guys are smoking no [ __ ] so we're gonna go ahead and take a blink out of this distillate pot and I'm going to let you guys know if it's better than the library cheers guys if you guys are smoked a lot let me go ahead and do so [Music] those who know distillates dizzy pods are always [ __ ] fired the blinkers ain't as bad as a plug-and-play but the blinkers on the stasis are [ __ ] fire you know all you need is like maybe one blinker or two and you're good so the oil on the dizzies on the regular distillate they're really thick compared to a life resin after couple hits the live resin the library will run way way more than what a distillate when you know what I mean so if you were to flip it upside down after hit a night it will you know the oil will go upside down real quick so I'm feeling pretty high running off the distal ahead so we're gonna let him show you guys a close-up on the life resin one as you guys can see it's darker as I was saying so I suggest to see the California little sticker but they say you know don't be sketched about it you know if you guys get life rising cartridges and they're darker just because you got smoked rock garden and they're little lighter doesn't mean they're good you know but like rock garden is far but I'm just giving you guys an example you know just because it's darker doesn't mean it's bad but I take a hit of this life resident cartridge and we're gonna applaud whatever I just get mixed up by same pot and cartridge but we're not going to see what's the difference on it so I'm gonna take a blink row this life resin this is the lemon cookies I'm gonna see how it tastes [Music] Wow now the taste on it it's really fired to be honest the THC percentage it's a little lower than the distillate but the feeling you get on the throat is way different it's more like if you took a DAB like an actual diet and the taste on it it tastes so better it tastes it tastes so clean like it tastes like if you actually took like a DAB you know like the smell of it like you can literally taste like the actual terpene in it you know compared to the distillate you know the d\u00e9sol\u00e9e it does taste good but you do get like a little fakeness taste to it compared to life resin but it tastes pretty good you know I'm going to take another hit you know that's how good it is if you guys haven't had the lemon cookie you guys time how the lemon cookie won this one's pretty far ready going now to take another hit off to the [ __ ] taste so bitter [Music] but the light resident does run out a little faster than the distillate guys now now that we hear both of them honestly it's up to preference if you guys prefer life resin go ahead and drop a like or whatever let me know in the comments section of you guys prefer live resin or a distillate cartridge to me honestly I smoke any one it just depends you know I'm not really picky when it comes to smoking cartridges as long as they taste good and get any high as [ __ ] I'm good with that but that doesn't mean I'll get like the cheapest [ __ ] but you know I just like to try new [ __ ] not like I'll let you guys know if it's fire but to me honestly I'll [ __ ] with both but let me know what you guys preferred so now that we tried both of them it's time to abuse the share of these bad boys let's go ahead and hit both of them at the same time oh wow catcha is really good you know I see a lot of people that carry two batteries at the same time it's just one of them [ __ ] up so I had to get another one but ended up working all of a sudden so now I have to so that's pretty dope I really hope you guys stay safe out there while she got his hands coronavirus a [ __ ] so don't really want you guys to end up and catching it and nothing like that so you guys be safe out there take care of supra-conscious and you know and drop a like and comment what you guys would like to see next but peace guys", "XM5jqv1dHAM": "youtube what up your boy cushy

of this so probably not the rest but the majority of this uh through the dip and uh before i leave and that's exactly what we're gonna do [Music] there's fire here i like this one but it just i don't know it wasn't there like all the other cresco carts had done seemed [Music] [Music] it's good business i don't know it's not a smacker uh i've had better cresco carts like subscribe ring that bell

"emDXqTzS3-g": "well the Sun is going down and we are going to the Apothic let's go get some stuff this video is intended for a mature audience if you're not a mature audience this video is not for you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so we are just leaving the Apothic now I got a gram of Kraft concentrates and some harmony extracts and uh we got some good stuff and I can't wait to try these out these were really good prices today so I'm excited for these ok let's take a look at what I was able to pick up from the Apothic I got a couple of grams some live concentrates here I was able to get a rim of crafts lemon Jie I see live resin it's about 87% h-scenes and of course of the flower that looks really good that one's light in color it smells amazing I can't wait to try that one and then I also picked up a gram of harmony extracts and ghost OG live sugar and that one's about 75 just under 75 percent THC let's get a close look at the sugar there that one looks really good all right let's uh let's get a dab of both of these and see we like them okay let's try out these dams here the first one that we're gonna try is the craft lemon G hi-c lime present and that one was the high THC what was in the 87% let's check that one out [Music] oh that one's really good it's really smooth and it's really sweet tasting I'm gonna like a nice citrusy lemon flavor with that one oh it's good stuff okay the next one up is the harmony extracts the ghost OG live sugar and that one was just under 75 percent THC so let's give it a go here [Music] oh oh that one tastes really good [Music] okay the one with less THC tastes a bit better maybe we should mix them okay so I mixed both of them here we've got a nice fat scoop on the katana here and let's give it a try [Music] oh yeah still good when you mix them both together I just had to make sure [Music] great stuff do you like this video make sure to subscribe and if you want to see more content from me tune into twitch.tv /q

another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is the interesting video this is obviously a cartridge video but this is surprising I've never seen like a cartridge come in this measurement before and that measurement is 0.75 this was only like 25 or something like 25 to 28 dollars I'm not too sure I forgot but you can see right here it says 0.75 milliliters or grams or whatever we want to call it and it is white Walker ology by cruise I've never tried cruise cartridge but I've tried they're there but and it was good you know very very decent flour for decent prices but I believe this is also this is going to be distantly I believe so you know which is still pretty good you know I'm not I like distillate but as you like I really prefer like sauce cards or live raising card some more you know but this split is it bad it's just sometimes it's just like a artificial flavor so we're gonna see what this is and this is white Walker og you see all the specifications right there everything on the back you can pause if I'm going too fast hopefully it's focusing so just like in the other previous videos I like to mention that my merch is available right now I'll post the link in the bond description below this is just one of the sweaters and they have various colors I think I have like twelve twelve designs on there so like if you don't like one maybe you'll like on another one you know so there's one things to choose from and there's a lot of colors on all of them so I got you there and if you guys are interested I'll post a link people been telling me to make merch for a while and these are all designs I've made myself and I feel like it's more genuine that way because I wouldn't want to paste to design something for me I feel like it should come from the content creator you know and not to knock on any of like other content creators but some of their stuff is a little bit lacking I really wanted to like make it known that I made these and also you know I I understand that most people don't really want cannabis on their shirts so that's why I have some shirts that's just it's more about my life you know like how I was actually born in San Francisco I have a San Francisco shirt the bridge is a conic bridge I think we all know even people that don't live in California fall you know about the Bay Bridge and there's a story behind that because like I named that shirt the bridge to the Spencer eeeh and it's because back when Modesto didn't have too much we had to go to the bay and get all their [ __ ] you know and we had to cross that bridge and it's a play on to that one movie I didn't even see that movie Bridge to Terabithia there's some [ __ ] so I thought it was pretty cool but yes you were not inclined to buy any of these things if you want to support me and buy one of these you're more than welcome to but you're also more than welcome to just not buy it and just chilled me still so let's get on with this [ __ ] review what are you doing but link will be in the book down below so this is white Walker og syndicate as you can see right here really really good stuff it looks pretty nice no no way cartridge so far it's a [ __ ] plastic radiator Calvin your sticker our caution sticker whatever you want to call it I'm not gonna lie this looks pretty [ __ ] nice this thing the oil test or whatever this is dumb as hell I mean I've seen some that's very liquidy and you know what that's just it but very thick I mean this just proves how thick the oil is I mean other than it's [ __ ] legit cuz it's not moving no it could still be sure you know trash off the bed notice that there's some like weird like thing on here that I definitely gotta wash off be using it in my as a beauty which reminds me I still need to do that giveaway for this I'm waiting on light so I can do a live on YouTube in choose a winner but guys [Music] Cheers [Music] very small - not too tasty at all of you is that some sort of taste but I'm not really sure how to describe it I mean it's definitely alright I definitely wouldn't prefer other cartridges I mean what enticed me though was that it was 0.75 for twenty-something dollars which is pretty weird for a cartridge like they usually never come in 2075 so I had to get it never tried cruise cartridges soul paper production is there though it's a very like the sensation to cough afterwards is minimal the taste can't really describe the taste but it's minimal as well other than that pretty decent cartridge if you don't really care about taste you're trying to forget about value out of what you buy because it is 80 percent THC cartridge and I believe it as some sort of amount of CBD in it other than that very good cartridge for what it is not a very tasty one in my opinion but that's just me maybe it's just because I brush my teeth no but woman playing an end the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it [Music] [Music] [Music]", "HO7Mw1QhAOc": "yo what's going

level very very pleasant very nice very nice this double delicious which is what this is double delicious this was on sale recently this is about the bottom tier when it comes to distillate not in quality but definitely in price this is actually not too bad a quality some of their batches are not very good some of them are quite good I'm not sure about the strawberry lemonade but I did like the mango that's why I got another mango specifically for filling up those pods in that jewel type situation there all right now the most let me open up some of this uh black diamond extract crumble right

works oh man well I'm gonna be refilling a couple of these right here I'm refilling these cartridges right here these are brand new I'm not really refilling them I'm filling them with some double delicious we're just gonna do a DAB first so I get it rolling there yes there's a festival going on in the squib Washington area if you look up swim SE e qu I am Washington swim Washington right now there's a thing called of lavender Festival there is the perfect environment for growing lavender in this area and there are substantial my lavender farms and as there's a festival concerning lavender the little purple flower everybody likes the extract oil from it you don't talk about lavender anyway there's a large lavender festival here it comes through to get a little bit more business the local marijuana store here went on a very nice full weekend sale I'm having a lot of discounts for their cannabis and we were able to pick up we're hoping this stuff this for about nine dollars and ten cents three I'll pick up this one gram of distillate right here I knew we got this for twelve dollars and ninety cents possibly $12.40 I'm not really sure I didn't do the math all the way but it's about twelve and a half dollars twelve and a half dollars for a gram of mango distillate and like I said we're looking at a THC of seventy three point two so this is not bad this is not bad on any level um I know that wasn't supposed to have tea in it man I I feel you I figure I'm mom right there and this is an N one we're gonna do that on 4/20 one of these days man trust me trust me trust me we're gonna make it happen captain all right so these guys have the THC a the THC the th CV the CBD a the CBD the CB in the CB g the CBC and the CBL yeah there's a lot of information going on right there alright there's a lot of tea ages and see bees if you know what I'm saying a lot of but if you have that [ __ ] tested and those numbers come back why not throw them out there so people can see that [ __ ] right why not this is all pesticide free so there you go alright we're doing a DAB here and then we're gonna get on these cartridges once again I want to thank you guys so much for tuning

CVS is they should be right in there right right next to the NBC BG cheers folks Oh give me an order all right so they're real those are really nice little dab there now this was impromptu I know I set up a scheduling Ford but this truly was an impromptu and as such I am gonna have to get a couple things in line before I do this since this is a high-quality distillate granted it was cheap but that's just because it was inexpensive the quality on this is actually pretty on point and the distillate itself is actually pretty thick if you do not heat it up it will not flow well at all that being said I need to bring your heater over here and set up right here taking about one minute so if you guys got a minute there just grabbed a pipe grab a lighter pearl the [ __ ] you doing Phil common in the comment right there miss Foley I'm glad to have you here myself thank you so much and I will be right here [Music] like nothin ever happened right got here here turn a little bit so the noise is enough I'm super bad but it is what it is I hope you guys can still hear me I hope everything's hell yeah I do you want to see it you wanna see it you wanna see it this one right here do you want it do you really want it do you want it look it's awesome mmm these are almost real I bought off Amazon and for seaweedy to fill my part than the oils today I do as well I just got the whole system set up you just reminded me that my [ __ ] syringe tip I need to grab that son of a [ __ ] all right I know I'm bugging I'll come out and get it and do one okay the wines gonna come out do one real quick and she can sit down and enthused you just a second while I go take care of cleaning my [ __ ] tip because the oil is [ __ ] thick because I just did that video did everybody see that videos that I put out um I still hope that it helped some people out I thought it was really helpful if I'd have seen it whenever I was first refilling some cartridges whenever one went out and I just broke to some bits trying to get it apart instead of actually figuring out how the [ __ ] it works and come on push hard okay so Cassie's here everybody ready to say hi Cassie I'm from back here I just all you guys get to do is see the smoke nothing else I need abs and a tool and a lid I [ __ ] is hotter she just won one hot [ __ ] air like a [ __ ] right I know this is taking a long time to Marty fifteen minutes into it I'm sorry guys I know this is taking forever I apologize completely uh Emma you guys do over from the UK you guys tuned in at all I know this probably like tonight or some [ __ ] for you guys but that being said what we're going to do we are going to I'm cleaning out this goddamn thing I use it I use it to make that video and it got all gummed up if you guys don't clean your equipment in between uses it tends to gum up and it works like [ __ ] so please God don't do what I do and [ __ ] clean your goddamn equipment just clean your equipment not hard now I've lost a lot of people that's amazing I did that I did that live about three weeks ago yeah I do that I smoked the wedding cake I smoked the wedding cake cartridge in one sitting with my wife we sat down and we smoked it back and forth with a nitro collector using a dab cap it was uh it was brilliant it was absolutely brilliant okay now that this tip is clean I will be utilizing the built-in syringe that is used in these who filled these cartridges with it okay first things first I do have a custom cartridge stand um but I also have a couple different methods this is about the easiest one that I've come up with if you happen to find one of these laying around it's for 9-millimeter casings all right four nine millimeter but everybody nine millimeter this is what they come in these goddamn things they just they stand up and they're just [ __ ] so perfect they just fit right in there and they just stand up so [ __ ] good they don't [ __ ] fall out or nothing they don't [ __ ] fall out [ __ ] perfect [ __ ] yeah fell out thing cause I dropped with some of this but yeah you press them in there it's the [ __ ] works very very good very good okay now a tip like this and a syringe hover glass one can be found at Bay Park mark which is where I get all my bait supplies from and they are in the link in the description below bay parts marcom as well if you would like to improve the quality of the show or help contribute in any way check out the link down there for the patreon of double tears feel free to check them out no obligation but there are some wonderful prizes available as well that being said the first thing you do whenever you've got a cartridge you're trying to fill you unscrew the lid unscrew the lid a monster lid on each of these because I got 2 grams to fill so uh that's what I'm gonna be filling this is the distillate that we're gonna be using this one is the strawberry lemon-aid what I'm doing is I'm scoring up the top of this one because this one's the strawberry lemon-aid so when I open this one the mango and I mix them up because I'm [ __ ] stoned I'll know which one is which is there a better way of course there's a better way I just chewed on the [ __ ] thing yeah I could have got a marker and written on it if I wasn't a [ __ ] idiot but hashtag not a [ __ ] idiot you know what do you do this one as you can see this one is undamaged now I can mix them up readily and be like okay I know which is which always stinking always thinking now the mango flavored works out for total cannabinoids of 87 with a total THC of 73 the strawberry lemonade works off with the total cannabinoids of 87.9 a simple point to increase which is minimal and does not affect anything in my opinion with an actual THC total of seventy seven point three the seventy-three point two and the seventy seven point three that's about four percent that that can affect a little bit but when you're dealing with numbers this large if you're smoking hip and you're smoking weed that's got four percent THC there is a difference there but if you're smoking seventy three percent THC and seventy seven percent THC well you're smoking THC so they said as you can see these are come in and syringe with a threaded section there specifically to put a tip on it whenever it is nice and warm however if you can see there's a bubble in there and it's all graduated but I'm gonna do this is the chewed-up one this one has a bubble in there can you see that bubble in there it's on the bottom all right I'm gonna set this one up right here so you guys can watch and see if the bubble does rise up in that one which it won't it's it's pretty high-quality distally I rocket ition grot rocket ushion that's hard to say Joe are you doing my friend nice to see you how's it going thank you for joining my channel my friend what I do here is I spread a little bit of knowledge concerning the lovely world of cannabis and cannabis extracts right now what we're doing is I'm refilling I am filling two new cartridges these cartridges can be bought at bay parts marcom in the bottom with some distillate some THC distillate as you can see that bubble hasn't [ __ ] moved yet that I picked up for grand total I do is 12 and a half dollars give or take 10 or 15 cents twelve and a half dollars give or take ten or fifteen cents for the gram of distillate these are 77 percent THC and seventy-three percent THC we're really putting them into a cartridge we're gonna do the mango on the right and the strawberry are on the left I know this is cross corner of you guys but whatever like I said these are relatively thick and uh it needs to be heated up a little bit just to be able to flow you know not an overly a substantial amount but definitely a little bit definitely a little bit I have a heater over here that I'm using and one of the first things I do because I'm weird and I don't know if this really helps but this is the way I do it like my shirt oh gee cush Platinum boy I ran shadow what's up everybody boos Magoo man how you doing again again again all right so here it is I remove the little plastic cap that just screws on the screws off whoop take that off that is a plug that doesn't actually excrete anything you want to get rid of that [ __ ] this is completely useless much like tints on a rock you don't need any any tits on a rock and this isn't very good what you're gonna want to do is you're gonna want to utilize the tip that's using doing that why don't I do that just yet one of you first first and foremost I actually draw some air into the cartridge directly from in front of the heater this is some superficial [ __ ] at best but in my dumbass mind I think if I draw a warm air into it it will heat it up faster because you're a [ __ ] idiot we're total check out me I don't know so first thing I do is I draw some air into it and then I set it in front of that heater and just let it rotate I let it rotate right where my fingers are so that cylinder gets no harder than my fingertips now my fingertips can take a decent amount of heat but nowhere near what it would take to in any way compromise the plastic or the oil in that in that syringe so I'm not worried about burning it any more than I'm worried about actually burning my hands you know I'm saying my fingertips are pretty tough from smoking roaches and all that but when it comes down to it I'm not gonna let myself get burnt just holding this so that's how I basically keep it from getting overly warm possibly compromising there's the syringe in any way so this is actually pretty warm right here right now it's starting to flow I just see it's starting to flow down from the top just a little bit on the side there see you leveling out okay yeah now see you're starting to flow a little bit see that's that's how I do it as a heater some people will use a lighter or a torch or whatever the [ __ ] and that works out if your syringe is glass basically kind of use whatever the [ __ ] you want if your syringe is glass this this syringe is not glass for glass refilling syringes of high quality with the tip available a tip like this that will work in almost any cartridge they are available at the link in the description bate part smart comm that is vape part smart comm feel free to go check them out if you do use the link in the description I will get a little stipend of that and it is grateful for the channel to get that it's very grateful to you what the [ __ ] ever it's all he misses all words okay as you can see now this stuff is flowing a little bit kind of like like a little bit better you know what I'm saying oh yeah nice and warm that's what I do right before I do those refilling videos whenever you see me snap and come into picture I just brought it in from the heater so it's working it's working perfect so I I attached this tip to it just like this it goes in does a quarter turn boom it's on there it's on there I like to laid it down like this and then push some air out just so that it's in the top okay right there you've got your grab you've got your [ __ ] system right here you put your system into your system right like that and then you begin to dispense it and since it is warm it should have been so you come out pretty decent alright okay there we go that is topped off pull your cirrage out and you have a little area right there you see that where the oil needs to still get down in there but as you can see it is slowly moving in that area so it will flow right into there this cartridge itself is a little bit cool compared to the oil that I just pushed into it so as of right now that bubble isn't going to move I'm gonna have to heat it back up a little bit and all that good stuff but that's that's neither here nor there that's the way that one is so you can just touch this with a little bit of the tip there and you can see it's straight out like that the distillate is it's very thick [ __ ] it's like marshmallow [ __ ] fluff now simply take your lid place it right over that and screw it down once you've got it caught a little bit pull it out of your cartridge holder and there you have it there you see it has flowed a little bit down very little left as it goes into that area um this will be heated up and we'll give it about give it about a half an hour get it all nice and warm I'll use the heater again whenever I do it but this is just an example get it all nice and warm again and uh give it about a half an hour some people say five minutes some people say ten minutes some people are idiots so uh I'm gonna give it like I said thirty minutes before I even try to hit that day hit that bad thing so my wife came out and took the pin that I was choosing to smoke with um so what that comes down to is I'm gonna do another big dab here since I don't have my pin now those of you who've been watching from the beginning here's that bubble um if you're looking at the graduations you can see that bubble has moved approximately 2/10 of a mil in in the 20 minutes that we've been talking so we'll set that down right there and we'll keep that little experiment going okay now what I need to remember is that this cartridge right here is the mango first card I filled up is the mango will set it off to this side since it's on the right and this one's on the left we'll do that now I have this box sitting here viola I don't remember who I was speaking with on one of my lives but they said something about Humboldt County and I said uh Humboldt County hell yeah and I looked at this thinking that this possibly came from the Humboldt County area and for the life of me I think that it does but I'm not so sure now because the little exclamation point with the cannabis thing doesn't have a CA on it you know what I'm saying that doesn't have a CA on it now this says that this was done by rose any labs the testing lab is Rose City labs all testing data on those dates this was picked up when I went down to California and I think it was picked up in Northern California this stuff is absolutely amazing absolutely amazing one of the nicest concentrates I have ever smoked and I have smoked a fair amount of [ __ ] dope I'm just saying okay and this these guys right here I don't know if every single batch is as good as this but this [ __ ] live resin banana split this was on point like a point on the point you know what I'm saying like crazy crazy nice I'm gonna leave that right there just because they deserve a little bit of attention for what they're putting out that being said I'm gonna read a little bit I guess I don't know if that's what they call liquid marijuana or now but this is straight-up butane extracted hash oil that I'm smoking on right here and the liquid marijuana or the distillate that I've got right here is an oil and what that's done is they use a short path distillate by the way if you would like to expand your knowledge on the entire process about cannabis and the extraction process feel free to Google short path cannabis distillation it's very easy hit the Google microphone repeat the words short path cannabis distillation and they will show you a couple videos and a couple articles concerning the short path distillation process what it is is you take your extract which is generally any kind of cannabis extracted anything basically put it into a [ __ ] thing heat it up it eventually vaporizes it all be prized at different temperatures as it vaporizes it goes through a condensation tube and then it goes through some [ __ ] and then it just eventually um condenses into a bulb different temperatures you release different Turf and different molecules of the cannabis plant some people have five seven or three different chambers some go up one chamber and what you do is you just let it off gas until you hit your optimal temperature put the tube in collect it as it condenses in you will get your heavies which is the THC crystalline and depending on your process depending on how good you are at it depends on the purity of it it is it is what it is it's very intriguing it's very invigorating whenever you watch it and you think about it you're like holy [ __ ] really and that's basically how lots of things are condensed in a distillation process it's very very very very nice I'll do a video on it eventually when I have a little bit more hands-on knowledge I love the theory of it and I can explain the theory of it but when it all comes down to it without any actual hands-on knowledge like well what happens when you do this I [ __ ] really don't feel comfortable talking to you about a whole lot about it because I don't feel informed enough about it myself that makes sense fuckin'-a man all right here we go we're doing another dab on the damage right here this is some a in cream you know I don't even like saying that I don't like saying that at all [Music] so this is some crumble that we got from Black Diamond extracts they do decent job nine dollars and ten cents is what paid for this out the door nine dollars and ten cents out the door after taxes and discounts I'm pretty happy with it it's about a 70 percent THC wax they call it a crumple this one here is a wax cheers folks that's pretty good there is a little bit of harshness about it I mean you know it is a nine dollar crown you know not normally this is on sale but still need to understand that some companies do better work than others some companies have higher standards than others that's what it comes down to and some companies do a better job than others you're like hey man how can you get a decent concentrate for $9 a great deal how well there's a couple ways there's a couple ways sorry about that as you can see that bubble is almost 3/4 of the way up it has been about 35 minutes but that's the limits in there for 20 minutes I'm not gonna bow too much it but uh there you I'm pretty happy with the distillate though um yeah I actually don't like blunts at all let's have tobacco in them and I used to smoke cigarettes and now I can't I can't have any [ __ ] tobacco at all it's [ __ ] it's pretty lame it just it really it tastes bad to me and I'm not one of those guys that's like oh you smoke cigarettes well you should suck a dick no man you're a smoke cigarette smoke cigarettes I mean it's not like you don't know what's gonna kill you [ __ ] everybody's been telling [ __ ] everybody for [ __ ] decades and it's gonna [ __ ] kill you but everybody [ __ ] knows that's gonna kill you they did those commercials with the Marlboro Man and all that [ __ ] everybody knows I'm not [ __ ] I don't give a [ __ ] it's gonna kill you it's gonna key it's getting cait's gonna kill you my grandmother smoked for like 60 [ __ ] years she's lived to be 93 goddamn years old and she didn't die from cancer okay I'm just saying I'm not anti smoking I don't smoke I don't like I don't like how heavy it makes my chest I'm up I'm a pissy [ __ ] sorry coughing so art that's one of it that's a $9 gram okay see you got a little bit more [ __ ] on your chest you know you got a little bit more heavies in the in the hit it's not as pure it's not as it's not as nice that's why you pay three or four dollars more for your gram and then the upgrade just a little bit that's just that's that's what I'm saying folks just just that you know gingersnaps I'm having a decent day indeed indeed indeed I haven't had a good day in a long time I got four kids no I'm just kidding no never great day having a great day do a little bit of a live here I normally don't do anything on Sunday you know so I figured I'd pop on here got a friend of mine over and they wanted some distillate cartridges they're like man I really don't like paying the amount of money that they want for some distillate garbages I says you know what I got some cartridges here they're decent you know run over here we'll go down we'll go down by some really nice distillate at a decent price and uh I'll throw it into some cartridges for you I mean you're gonna have some decent babe cartridges at a decent price you know well it works out pretty good and it does you know even even if you were forced to buy these you know even if you were forced to buy these cars are just you know you go down you buy ten or something [ __ ] them you know you can generally get a decent cartridge a good I recommend going with good see sells you can use them two or three times and that cuts the price by a third but you get a good see sell cartridges if you only want one or two they can be about five bucks and that's that is what it is you know you get what you're paying for you can save money and buy cheaper cartridges if you want to save money by cheaper cartridges you could have a failure or they could not draw as well or I don't anything anyway you pick these up for about three or four bucks apiece right then you pick up this grandma distillate you know I got this gram discipline like I said I got it for $12 $12.50 you ever taste somewhere in there so you add that to the $3.00 you pay for this 15 bucks for a full one gram cartridge out the door you know whereas normally if I were to go down to buy a cartridge a decent cartridge even a cartridge from the guys that make this oil they still want eighteen to twenty dollars for a cartridge so you're paying six eight bucks just for that cartridge generally if you buy it in that manner then I just I don't need to do that I don't recommend doing that if you can get around doing that then do it as you can see now this is the same Boyle where that bubble didn't move at all I've been holding in front of the heater and as you didn't see that bubbles moving just fine now I'm gonna heat it up a little bit more and then I'll settle down and then I'll push all the air out then I'll load up this other cartridge and I'll let you guys get back to your day I do appreciate you guys joining in thank you so much it really means a lot to me and uh why I said if this helps you out or if you give a [ __ ] at all go ahead give a like on that thumbs up button down there and if you'd like to help contribute to the channel feel free to click the patreon link in the description and go check out some of my tears see if any of those rewards work for you I would appreciate it helps me out all right that being said we're drawing a little bit and then push out a little bit all right there we go once again we stick it all the way in to the bottom start to dispense the oil all right now do what there's a little bit all right so that being said and done so this is on the left this is the strawberry lemon-aid right here and this one on the right is the mango as you can see there's still a little bit of an air bubble right in there on that mango because I still haven't warmed up this cartridge it means II wind up let it sit in there whenever you've got some real good distillate you always want to do that whenever you see me doing my videos a lot of people like dude your videos three seconds long you take pure distillate you open it up you put in a cartridge then you start hitting it in [ __ ] thirty seconds dude there's a lot of cutting and pasting that happens there [ __ ] and my dumb ass standing in front of a heater for a minute while the [ __ ] cameras going going [ __ ] wildest goddamn [ __ ] feel better cuz I didn't heat it up enough that's why cuz I didn't heat it up okay um so yeah you don't see that all the time but all right at the base of each one of these mouthpieces there's a little silicone o-ring right there I'll make sure that squeezes out just enough to be completely flush with the outside so it's absolutely perfect um this right here with a little bit of an air bubble in it is the mangle and this one here is not as their differences but the mango is a little tiny bit lighter maybe a little bit tiny bit lighter maybe but that being said the mangos on the outside strawberry lemonade's one inch from the outside it's for my own benefit here you have it Oh Phillip a couple cartridges with a little bit discipline Oh hope you guys might be able to get a little bit of use out of that you know um I know it's not not everybody's gig but it's exactly what I do and uh it's how I make [ __ ] roll a lot easier and a lot smoother for me now I have got all of this done for approximately twenty-five dollars to one gram cartridges full of seventy seven percent THC distillate where the bubble don't [ __ ] move at all at all at all for a total of $25 $25 so you know for me this is the ideal way to do it okay you get a hundred bucks together you go down you buy [ __ ] what 9 grams of distillate you know if you've got a good C cell cartridge you pay five bucks down right now and you can use that three times you can fill that [ __ ] up three different times I can do it I try to do them never more than four but I never tell people more than three they've got a very good failure rating and that failure rating doubles or triples every time you reuse that but it's so low it doesn't even get to 1% by the time you're using it four times that's that's that's math anyway um maybe some reading real quick Daniels dude [ __ ] I'm a stretch to spit out some fold eyes I'm gonna [ __ ] just kidding I'm gonna do it dad's then we need the [ __ ] out of Dodge don't you worry about it we'll try to each phone in line what's the difference receiving Ewing oil and that stuff well here we go the difference between CBD oil and this stuff is to be exact this is oil if you look at these little numbers on the back the actual CBD that this has is 0.4% CBD all of these have a completely different THC v CBL CBC CBD CBN all these are different properties and molecules and components components of the cannabis plant each one of these components of the cannabis plant activates or utilize the different neuron or part of your brain to do [ __ ] you understand what I'm saying some of these are for nausea some of them are for making your [ __ ] pucker some more forget you [ __ ] high someone for me to get high longer okay that's just a scientific and I can get into that if you want to but that's a completely different video the main difference between lists in CBD oil I can buy this exact same package with a different flavor from a different plan that is 70% CBD in almost zero THD that's the difference they come from different plants therefore they extract a different material and that way this is a strike THC that they would attract CBD and that's the way that works very very baseline is that better you guys could have told me to [ __ ] turn that heater off and any [ __ ] kind and I don't listen to you fool it's just like right here anyway [ __ ] it's quiet now let's do a DAB somebody out there is running chainsaw leaves goddamn Christmas time one month while the [ __ ] eejits all right so here we go we're dabbing on some alien cream I still don't like the name of that right hey you should with some an alien cream in your [ __ ] rig right Wow really really that doesn't sound good at all I don't I don't know I don't like that but it doesn't sound enjoyable dude all are tasting an alien cream no no I have not I have not you can there's no videos or pictures I swear no alien cream for me all right so here we go we're into a bit of a Dingle donger dab here we're gonna say right well I appreciate that by the way come people ask why the [ __ ] should we give you anything on patreon mainly people that I know that don't watch my videos like [ __ ] enum to give you [ __ ] anything so I was like well you know what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to make my livestream you better I'm trying to get platform I'm trying to increase the microphone and increase the camera strength so that you can get a better start of what I'm doing here I would love to get a little bit higher quality video camera I'd love to get a desktop for the garage a desktop computer that I could run some the webcam and thing I could use an alternate alternate payment system other than YouTube super chat which they took for me because I'm so bad to in that situation and we can become more interactive we can interact more in an interactive way I think you go boo boo whenever I get a comment root loop and you know you could do that hey I'm gonna make my comment look like my wife's comment because uh I like her so thank you so much effort I appreciate it greatly man but uh go ahead and check it out this is really nice

marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my trusty pour one out 510 vape battery that is finely [ __ ] the bet on me after 15 cartridge reviews or something it finally [ __ ] the bed and my trusty 510 battery has died so I'm pulling out the backup the cheaper chintzy er one here that's okay we'll get a new one we'll get a better one but I'm gonna miss my old friend there has died but outside of the funeral for our trusty 510 vape pen we are here for a joyous celebration and we are here to review the product that I have had to me suggested the most of anything I have ever reviewed or intended to review and that is brass knuckles we are finally reviewing brass knuckles I have had you guys a lot of you recommending me check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles and I've used brass knuckles in the past and but we won't talk about that but today we are going to be reviewing brass knuckles finally found some here in Long Beach and I'm very very excited to give it a review so this is the one gram Gorilla Glue cartridge and it comes in some a primo packaging that I have no doubt I'm gonna have difficulty opening here really nice packaging as you can see plastic on the outside it's got all the information you want on the inside lab tested contaminant and pesticide free that brings me up to the controversy I I know that there was a big controversy with brass knuckles for a while about pesticide usage but apparently that is no longer the case I hope that is no longer the case I I would a vet suggest you do your due diligence and research if you're really worried about those kind of things what you might probably should be maybe so do your own due diligence make sure you know this is something for you but from what I've heard they have all of their problems in terms of having pesticides or whatever fungicides or whatever I was that was in there it's no longer the case so Gorilla Glue is my favorite strain as I have said many a times I have seen it listed as both hybrid and indica this is a hybrid gorilla glue I like it both as hybrid and indica this cost me as you can see $52 at my dispensary which is a bit of a miss which is a bit misleading because really with the 35% taxes it can cost considerably more than that but $52 is the base price so you know pretty expensive but not outrageously more expensive than other cartridges this one just has the reputation sort of throughout Southern California as being the best of the best and I think I actually got it open without too much trouble there maybe here we go here's our cartridge in its little packaging there for medicinal use only not for redistribution and we can see their weed maps all that logos blah blah blah blah blah they have a snapchat how fun alright we have got our standard 510 pen here not our former best friend bottoms cap just like all the others with these little rubber stoppers whoever makes these little rubber stoppers must be doing pretty bonk owes business right now I would imagine let's screw this in ooh I like the color of this oil nice dark golden oil beautiful looking oil there a nice brass tip I guess that's where the name brass knuckles come from and a nice wide intake hole there so very excited to give this a drop let's give it a go oh wow that is a premium experience that is a smooth with smooth draw Wow ignore the cough that's my fault not theirs I'm a coffer this does not burn hot at all you can barely feel it entering along it's wonderful the taste is exquisite and Wow I'm already feeling pretty nicely medicated actually oh wow they use a bad word on their packaging here I'm gonna have to read that for you guys I don't see what their THC potency is listed at on here but I do know that they are among the highest in the state I think I've seen before that it's over 90% it certainly feels that way I'm already feeling quite high after just 3 3 little puffs there one negative thing and it might actually be this pen is I'm not getting this huge a draw as I would want for pulling I like the bigger clouds but it's sort of ameliorated by the fact that even the small draws are getting me quite high and it might actually just be this pen doesn't have the voltage to get the huge clouds I'll double check I'm gonna be getting a new pen before I finish this so I'll I'll be sure to let you guys know in the follow up if that still the case Wow but up into this point brass knuckles definitely definitely earns their reputation tastes great hits like a dream oh man really really really enjoying the brass on my brass knuckles experience here guys if only it were a little easier to draw from it would be perfect but again that maybe the pen and I'll be sure to let you know guys because I'm gonna review this entire cartridge I'm not just gonna take a couple of puffs and say it's good I'm gonna come back to you guys after I finish this whole Graham here to let you know exactly my thoughts let you know if anything's changed if the starting to leak if the oil got tacky whatever the case may be I'll be sure to let you know in the follow up so I'll come back to you guys probably in four or five days after I finished this bad boy off and let you know exactly what I'm thinking thank you so much for watching weeks to this point guys and I will see you in just a bit it has been actually I believe eight days since I last checked in with you talking the one gram brass knuckles Gorilla Glue cartridge so right off the bat I wasn't doing this really any less than any other cartridge I don't feel like but it lasted a long long time I really got your values worth with this one certainly a gram in there the other thing is it is still very potent this is a potent a blend that they've got in here this is certainly as strong as its sort of reputation lends it to believe but all that being said my initial I'm not as emphatically as in love as I was with my initial impressions or as I was when I gave my initial impressions there have been a couple of things that have walnut spoiled me on the experience have certainly damper the experience one is it became significantly more difficult to draw as time went on I did get a new battery to test it with and even with a new battery it was still kind of tough to draw from and it got harder and harder as time went on and which is something I really have a problem with with the VBA I much prefer the ones that have nice easy drawers that you can make nice big you know take nice big inhalations with as the kids call them make nice big clouds this wasn't really that and I'm not sure if it was this cartridge in particular as you can see there's actually some oil left there at the bottom I just had such a tough time drawing from it that I think I'm just gonna have to leave it there the other thing is it did start to get a bit of a burnt taste as I got closer to the bottom the closer I got the more burnt the taste was it for the most part tasted great I really enjoyed the taste but as we started to get near the end or trim it's the end of its life that burnt taste started to amplify so tough to draw from and increasingly tough to draw from and an increasingly unpleasant taste those aren't good things for sure those those weren't those theirs don't keep it and there's hold it back and getting in my highest remarks for sure but I feel like I'm definitely gonna get brass knuckles the second chance I've heard enough about them that I'm wondering if maybe I just got a bad card what the case may be so I'm gonna give him a second chance we're gonna review something else from them in the future but for now between the two because they're so often compared and they're so look alike I actually think I might prefer the heavy hitters to brass knuckles maybe yeah I think in my initial impressions I would go with the heavy hitter of the brass knuckle but let's get let's go ahead and do another brass knuckle review before we give it any the definitive conclusion and overall my impressions are still pretty positive this is a potent a long lasting cartridge that you're gonna get your money's worth from so you know I it's still really positive review it's just not as good as I initially had hoped but we will be examining them and given the future so fingers crossed and that guys is gonna do it for this review but before I bounce I want to share with you a little cherry on top just something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related but could be enjoyed with weed or with or without weed and so on this cherry on top what I wanted to share with you guys was something nice and simple something nice and easy an 11 minute web clip from the fine folks at where I guess fine folks the mostly male folks over at Adult Swim make Krueger's of creators of chosen Rick and Morty or at least the hosts of such shows as Rick and Morty but that's not we're here to talk about is Rick and Morty we are here to talk about their 11 minutes short too many cooks too many cooks too many cooks it is an 11 minute video and if you haven't seen it a lot of you I'm sure have that sort of tries to replicate many 90s opening credit songs but things go awry and that's about all I want to say because you should know as little about it as possible before going in because it is who it's gonna be one of the most surreal 11 minutes of your life Definitely Maybe recommend if you do have some cannabis on hand doing some before hand if you're not prone to paranoia if you are definitely pass on it but it's gonna be enjoyable I think for you guys again that is called too many cooks on Adult Swim I'm sure you can find it on YouTube just search too many cooks so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat sand that's gonna do it for this cherry on top as well thank you so much for sticking around to the very end here guys I appreciate it as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "PvqNwla4YIc": "what is on canna fam and welcome back to another product review video so check it out guys for this video I have here a 1 gram cartridge here by Northwest kind and this is a 1 gram cartridge distillate I believe it's a distillate it actually I can't find anywhere on the package to confirm this but I'm almost like 99% sure this is a distillate ok so let's just go with that anyway so this is by Northwest kind this is gorilla snacks alright the gorillas hungry and this is his neck ok and this is coming in at a 88 percent THC so not [ __ ] bad that's almost in the 90s that's pretty damn good ok I had a little to know CBD ok doesn't say anything here about terpenes so I can't give you guys that information unfortunately but hey 88 percent THC not bad I'll take it alright so the gorilla snacks 100% cannabis extract and we're gonna go ahead and pull this out here does it say no it doesn't even say on there so I was just checking to see if it said distillate or co2 or something like that alright gonna set that in there so we don't lose it and this is our cartridge what do you guys think I pull that little rubber end off there let me see if I can get up a better view for you guys like this come on there we go look at that there we go nice shot there BAM very nice cartridge if I don't say so myself very nice color got their logo on it got the Cannabis thing on there I'm gonna say right off the bat before I try this and get into more of the review I kind of don't like that that kind of throws me off already the fact that this has got like that's not a sticker usually it's a sticker you can peel it off and whatnot but I mean I guess you could I guess you could sit here and kind of scrape it off see how I'm doing right there you can kind of if you really want to my only issue with that when they actually print it on the cartridge like that is one of the main reasons that we purchase these carts is for the discreteness okay this is because it's discrete people you know we can have these out kind of in public even though we're not supposed to and kind of just you know take our hits kind of get our medicine and stuff like that as we need throughout the day but when you have something like that that's like permanently printed on there it takes the discreet away you could be sitting here hitting this thing somebody looks over sees that logo and they're like oh oh oh you smell good way oh my god get him you know what I mean like I'm just saying like I just one of the big things about this for me at least I know for a lot of other people is the fact that you know they're discreet okay so and that kind of takes it away from me so I'm just gonna throw that out there that's just kind of my one negative so far with this but anyway this is a normal 510 thread okay so it's gonna fit most standard batteries okay which I have right here nice battery here this one screws in it's not a plug in at the bottom it's got the different two different temperature settings on it and we just screw this on ever so easy just like that we'll pay mo all right so here we go now off for me I usually do to hit hit too long hits off this okay so I'll hold the button down for 10 seconds until it flashes then I you know hold it again another 10 seconds so about 20 second draw okay that's what I like now for you I don't recommend that if you know you're somebody who can't handle a good amount of smoke then I would recommend maybe just doing the 10 seconds just the normal one time draw but for me I have to do it two times so here we go this is the gorilla snacks by Northwest kind much-loved guys thank you for watching my video [Music] well I say wow because I didn't have to actually hold the button down twice you see that cloud this this is good cart this is a good cart good cart a little bit of a cough to it but hey good cart tastes good I definitely get that gorilla glue that kind of like stinky gorilla glue you know what I mean like that it's really good I really like it it's not super pungent it's not like mouth watering turps okay it's not gonna mmm - so good you know it's not like that okay it's just mild it's a mild flavor on the terpenes you get it it's not all there like it could be but you still get something okay highs pretty good we're gonna go for round two on this now really quick I have my temperature setting because this has three different temperatures on it Green being the lowest blue being medium and red being the highest temp I have it set on blue so this is a medium temp it gives me a good enough hit without that you know if you put it on red and you kind of get like a nasty taste to it it kind of feels like a burnt taste you know what I mean and so I feel like blue is the safest bet because you still get a good big hit and yet you still taste the terpenes you still all that now if you want to get the full spectrum of those terpenes if you want to get the full flavor then I would recommend probably going to the green setting if you don't mind sacrificing a little bit of your smoke you know cuz it will be a smaller cloud of smoke that I highly recommend going to the green set okay but anyway I'm on the blue set we're in the middle all right here we go [Music] [Music] that's pretty good got a little kick to it I like it I'm a big fan of like guerrilla glue or guerilla snacks or Scooby Snacks or anything like that so this was right up my alley this was $36 recreationally here in the state of Oregon for this gram cartridge this is a full gram cartridge for only $36 here in the state of Oregon of course if your medical you're going to get it cheaper and I highly recommend it I really do I mean I really really do this gets two big thumbs up with me and let me tell you why even though even though it was lacking on the turkeys it was still there it's not like there was none you still got them they're just not like super pungent okay the fact that it's $36 for a full gram let me say that again $36 for a full gram okay that is amazing the fact that it's eighty-eight percent THC you can take a hit or two off this thing and actually feel it it actually feel it it's got a good high it's got a good nice relaxing high to it I could definitely see me like taking several hits of this before bed or something like that or before I need to like relax because it's definitely making me like just one eye just chill just just chill so I like it that's why all right the only thing the only thing that I really don't like about this is the fact that that's printed on right there I don't like that I really don't it takes away from it being discreet okay if I'm like somewhere you know outside of somewhere do you know a weight and smoking my [ __ ] bait pen and somebody looks over somebody who's not cool with cannabis or whatever you know some uptight [ __ ] sees this and then BOOM oh he's smoking in public you know what I mean and so I feel like - should be taken away okay part of the reason people buy these carts is because they're discreet you know they're easy to use they're discreet if you're somebody who travels a lot if you're somebody who's on the go if you're somebody who likes to go out and see nature while they get stoned stuff like that then these carts are gonna be perfect for you they're easy to handle they're very easy to maneuver they don't really have malfunctions most of the time okay if you get the good carts anything like in my opinion anything thirty-five dollars or so and up here in the state of Oregon not speaking for other states but here in Oregon and they say anything thirty-five dollars and up should be a good cart and I'm talking about the actual cart not the product inside should be a good cart okay anything lower than that you're gonna probably have malfunction problems okay I've had the $25.00 carts and I ended up sucking the whole gram through it got all over my teeth and mouth it sucked it sucked okay I tell you guys you don't want dabs in your mouth and on your teeth it sucks so just keep that in mind okay that's just a little bit of a advice when you go cart shopping and I would highly recommend picking this one okay that's what does the videos about so check out the gorilla smacks by Northwest kind let me know your thoughts and opinions in the comment section below

and Alaska here at Jupiter research and on this week's episode I'm going to teach you how to take apart to C cell cartridges the first type of cartridge I'm gonna demonstrate for you is our glass cartridge the glass cartridge has a twist off or a threaded mouthpiece which is really easy to take off all you do is unthread the mouthpiece from the cartridge and there you have it we do not recommend refilling our glass cartridges or our plastic cartridges due to the fact that the refilling may compromise the integrity of the ceramic and therefore compromise the experience the flavor and the taste the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate for you is our ATP or a plastic cartridge the plastic cartridge comes with a press bit mouthpiece which is camp very evident and extremely difficult to remove removing the mouthpiece could result in damaging the cartridge the mouthpiece or result in a loss of oil I'm going to try to demonstrate this by taking a pair of channellock pliers and twisting in a counterclockwise motion you will notice that it is a very difficult process and you can hear the cartridge actually being damaged and there we go it's broken the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate is actually a pod that fits into the uno and the dart device you will see that the pod is covered by the mouthpiece and in a way that the pod fits into the mouthpiece is flush and is press fit which basically gives you no way to remove it I know a lot of you had questions regarding the refilling of C cell cartridges and the removal of the mouthpieces in conclusion C cell cartridges are not designed to be refilled in the end acade compromise the flavor the taste the potency and overall paper ization experience if you have any further questions shoot us a DM or comment below thanks for watching", "UbM_3E7pQiM": "all right bruh you see me you can see me all right bro today we're back with another darkhawk review bro i'm not doing the whole series on the doghouse i just copped another one because i [ __ ] with darth hugs and i was like why not drop a video and then you for me so i was like yeah get a couple see what let me tell you how it should taste and everything i had two i had um chocolate choppy candy cookies and um straw guava those are the two i had but the straw guava broke on me like literally the day i bought it in the lemon mac i mean in the tropicana cookies i finished it but yeah this is 11 macro here 89 87 percent thc and then total is 89. so i think the rest is just cbd then but yeah i've been smacking on it a little bit and i'm not gonna lie to y'all this might be my favorite flavor so far bro like i [ __ ] with this heavy rare i'm not gonna lie to y'all like there's just the flavor on this is different like it's different bro like y'all don't understand and [ __ ] with this let me tell you what that tastes like all right let me point and by the way somebody asked me if i'm easy to use bro yeah i use it with battery she's been through a lot literally you can change the temp down here bro this is like one of the best batteries you could get out there bro drop this [ __ ] in water like a million times [ __ ] not three times and it still works still rips but yeah as i was saying i'm gonna tell y'all what it tastes like i'm gonna put my [ __ ] up so literally when you first inhale at first you taste nothing then you taste the lemon and then the [ __ ] bud hits you after the lemon like no caffeine it's just like it's just the way it goes the way it just hits you is it's cool bro because at first there's nothing in the limit and then the [ __ ] bud like it just the way it just comes at you bro and if it's your first time watching with the dark heart or if y'all got a dark [ __ ] bro this [ __ ] is cletus for like like in person it should just look so much better one of the best looking cartridges out there damn you see me i don't look faded but i just don't ever look faded because i smoke i think i smoke too much that's probably why but yeah just the like the way the cartridge even looks like the white tip like the design on it bro like it's hard to find another card like this for real this lemon max blowing i'm not gonna lie let me know like if y'all had lemon mac before because i [ __ ] with lemon mac way more than chocolate candy cookies the worst one was probably trouble candy cookies bro if y'all are getting dark [ __ ] i don't recommend i recommend you not to get tropicana cookies like it's smacks and [ __ ] yeah but it's just the flavor is not the best i think lemon mac's the best so far but i've only had lemon mac tropicana cookies and uh strogawatt but yeah look this is a strawberry [ __ ] that's how it broke but now um let me see let me see if i got another story time for you honestly in the last two videos i've been telling like a random story time in the middle of the video and i guess y'all [ __ ] with it but yeah i only think i got a story okay but yeah bro look at the bows on this hey one thing i do want to say though is that i don't know if it's just me but i feel like these go fast like the ways quick you feel me i don't know if i'm tripping on should i take a blinker for the boys or what a blinker for the boys [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] i'll [ __ ] sweetie if y'all didn't take a blinker with me you're sick as [ __ ] no cow bro i even forgot there's two hot bugs in here hold on bro look at that you see all the smooth bro and i've been trying to blow this [ __ ] away but my sister-in-law made me another one of these bro she makes shirts like this and stuff she makes um key chains i mean stuff for your keychains and [ __ ] she makes cuts like design cups and [ __ ] so if y'all want one of these or a shirt for yourself or anything um just comment and uh i'll send you her um insulin [ __ ] so you can hit her up but yeah i need to wear this no cap i'm gonna just throw it over the orange shirt this is my first video with this one on no cap we are sweating bro y'all see me y'all see that little [ __ ] it's too big hey look how big my forehead is yeah that's why i have this color here no cap so that's why yeah that's why that's why i'm attacking if y'all [ __ ] be hanging in the comments call me at taco that's why i broke this i wasn't blessed with the hairline if i was bro trust me i wouldn't be attack watching but yeah damn there you go this [ __ ] hard i'll [ __ ] with this but yeah oh i wear this with the boys yesterday bro hey so yesterday the boys hit me up on some [ __ ] late yesterday what's it called the homies hit me up and they're like they're like hey um somebody coming short upon me with him hit us up hit a gucci book and say hey i'm about to kind of shout her but i'm trying to link i was like bad on down but it might be i know my parents never let me go nowhere now because of corona and it was already like nine o'clock so i was just like [ __ ] boys come through me just jump on my window and just sneak out with y'all about my daughter and that's what i did i went out with the boys we got faded off the dark hogs off the stairs we finished my stage yesterday but yeah i just dipped on my window

eat bro like it just helps me much i'll be like not glizzy goblin no glitzy goblin [ __ ] bro but i be hella eating like i'll be hella eating after i chief it but yeah that's the end of this video", "Ehur9uFryow": "[Music] oh all right let's go to YouTube so back at it again with another video guys men now let me tell you guys something real quick all right let me tell you guys something so I recorded this video yesterday yesterday I'm gonna go ahead and throw up a clip here so another's video isn't like me best we're out well recorded video we might like but I'm gonna do it for you guys you know if you guys can see by that clip right there man now you guys see why I didn't upload that one instead of this one I I was rewatching it right and I was like oh my [ __ ] god dude like it started off cool the lighting was cool and then literally within five minutes the [ __ ] Sun sets so quick and then I was literally just dark you guys can barely see me and things like that so I was like you know what man I rewatched and I was like dude I'm not happy with this video I'm gonna go ahead and remake you for the boys so it's gonna it's not gonna be an unboxing cuz we can't do an unboxing because we already opened it so for today's video guys we're back on the rug Arden wave as usual man and we got the uke I'd punch number 72 right here sitting at 80 percent THC 2.0 milligrams of CBD you already know the deal man right here let's get it and this one was packaged on nine ten just a little over a month ago man and this wasn't sitting pretty clean like I said I already opened it man I got it sitting on the Pocket vapor battery right here boys look at that I've put a little dent in it yesterday we were taking some fat Ripper Reno's for you guys so that that's why there is an air bubble there so before we get into the review man let me tell you guys I still have an active affiliate link and a code with [ __ ] paper so if you guys are interested in copying this snazzy ass little battery man it's already like 40 to 50 bucks it's a hundred it's fifty dollars cheaper than the cheaper than the vessel battery and it does just the same [ __ ] man and it's a lot sleeker that's a lot nicer man it fits in your palm it's a little slowly the sleekest thing in the world man and you guys can get 15% out um 15% off if you guys use code sub eg man or use the code the link of the affiliate link you can get 10% off either way it benefits your boy so go ahead and cop one man like I said the ucae punch number 72 this is a straight any command so I think first before we put on the raw garden battery I mean before we put it on the pocket battery we might put it on the rug or an battery first so let me go and pop that sucker off for you guys as you guys can see here the proprietary battery for the raw garden cart if you guys everybody rock garden I do recommend tell you guys I do recommend going out and getting this one too if you guys aren't gonna buy the the pocket vapour battery to go ahead and get this one I know it I know it's just like you know no variable wattage and none of that stuff but you know it's a proprietary batter so if you're gonna be buying raw garden cartridges a lot you might as well buy prepared to everybody so go ahead and turn this air off real quick one time for the boys and hope you guys are having an amazing blessed day I know I am - man it's good it's it's been a good couple of good a couple of weeks or me tell you the truth I've been having some time off I've been having time to do things you know and I'm just I'm just happy I'm contented there's no reason to not be content and let's get to it man this thing looks so sleek it's so nice alright you kind of punched number 72 make sure you guys are smoking along with me if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over whatever it is in your legal state man only legal patients only so cheers guys let's see if we get the raw garden logo right there all right so just to touch base on the battery real quick this has literally no airflow whatsoever so when you're hitting it it feels like you're heating a clogged car as for with the pocky battery yes sir holy moly first hit of the day got me no jokes it's already noon and I still have any anything this is my first card of the day but that thing I already got me fade I'm telling you man yesterday was a good video it was a good video but it was just too dark to give it to you guys meant to wait too dark so yeah pocket vapor ultimate airflow dude ultimate [ __ ] airflow all right now now getting into the review boys so right off that initial Wow dude right off that initial hit it did the same thing to me yesterday it tastes a lot like Barry's super super super berry like it I'm for sure it has to have a cross train of purple punch in it because it's super berry super super berry like I'm talking about this the first hit the first initial hit man you're gonna get a pungent in his super mouth filling of berries bro and it's not like artificial berries to it's like you know aftertaste after you drink like after you eat a grape in shading you got the aftertaste of like a grape it's kind of similar man so the taste is [ __ ] phenomenal off this it doesn't really have too much of a cushy vibe to it or too much of like a you know a tree game going but we're gonna hit it maybe we could get something out of it but before we do let's go ahead and switch it onto the king itself the pocket labor battery mint you get the ultimate airflow a nice ass temperature you know get the most out of your cartridge man you guys should be getting up a battery like this how you guys shoot because it makes your experience so much more enjoyable man I know got dry lips excuse that guys all right pocket vapor in now so I think off of this one we're gonna be hitting it off the orange setting I think is or in your setting so I think this is like the middle the middle setting so let's see what let's see how it goes boys just listen I don't know if you guys can listen to this I'm gonna try to get as close as possible but try to listen to the airflow I try to listen to the airflow Oh holy [ __ ] no joke that clapped me that got me boys that got you bought whoa all right that's it that [ __ ] smacked me for sure not gonna be using that setting that's the setting that you put when you want to kill somebody dude seriously are you looking to just get super faded and that wasn't even the hottest setting dude the hottest setting is red I'm about to show you guys one time man I'm about to show you guys one time all right not just let me talk over it so that hey right there you guys heard the maximum airflow right maximum airflow is so [ __ ] nice on a cartridge man like when you're hitting something on a restricted cart like battery it's so horrible man because it's you're literally not getting enough airflow so you're burning up the coil at first of all slowly but surely you're burning up so that's why you get like a weird taste - you're not getting like a super you know fruity taste or whatever your cartridge is supposed to be tasting like it's probably the airflow man you're probably burning up the coil you know and it's just gunking up in there so I do recommend going out and buy this man you already know the deal and if you don't want to buy it man you could be one of the lucky one one person one person is going to be winning one of these right here this color right here right now so I'm gonna be doing a giveaway by the time you guys see this video go ahead and click on my Instagram and go follow my Instagram and pocky vapor and my gaming team prophecy gaming so I'll put all three of those accounts down below and we will be choosing one person win right and we will be giving them away a shirt also so make sure to do that man and tag your friends tag your friends and more people the better and you the more people you tag the better the higher your chances are of winning all right so let's go ahead and hit this on the red setting man cuz that hit was so good so freakin good it tasted so pungent you got me like smacked they literally smacked me right in my face I still know tree like you know no earthy earthy taste to it so this is more likely on the fruitier side of raw garden mmm cheers boys whoo oh my gosh that red setting is amazing oh yes sir oh that thing claps oh you guys need to go buy this right now you guys heard it here first if you're smoking cartridges and you guys don't have this battery you're [ __ ] up oh my gosh that was amazing I'm nyan cat that was amazing this cartridge is sitting literally all right remember to use this this thing is sitting at 80 percent THC right 80 percent total cannabinoids and and all right so let me just do a little let me show you yes and then that last raw garden cartridge that I got was at a 90 right dojo cush it was super amazing so super super smacked but I was getting most of the feeling because it was a cush strain right so that means that this this right here this has absolutely no cush at all in it it's just a bunch of fruity strains that they had that rubber and made up and it's smacking me just as hard if not harder as the dojo cush so it's sitting that at 80 percent THC so doo doo TC percentages really matter is what I'm trying to get at do they really matter or is it what strains they mix it with because tell you the truth I've had [ __ ] 93 percent cartridges and they don't they don't do [ __ ] like I'm dead serious they don't do anything for me so and I've noticed that a lot of lower end TC percentage cartridges smack me like a little like boom like I'm having a session I'm just like out after like 2 to 3 hits so raw garden you're doing phenomenal job with this frickin ucae punch like they're doing such great jobs I know this week they release a lot more flavor so by the time you guys see this I want you guys to hit that notification bill hit that subscribe button because we if you got especially if you smell Kroger mmm because we're gonna be keeping you updated with the weekly flavors and which one you should be getting so let's get it boys I'm gonna take another one on rent and go ahead and end the video out here actually I'll probably take it on the lowest setting that way you guys can see the clouds on that and end it out here and then give you guys the full review on this and get to the movement you know so cheers boys if you guys are 18 over 21 over you already know the deal like I said earlier alright that was a low setting but as you guys could see there and switch to the rainbow colors right it switched to the freakin rainbow colors and that I think from when I remember is like sesh mode and he keeps going after like more than ten seconds that one was super light super light in clouds but the taste oh we super tippy yo I'm telling you guys raw garden damn regarding and pocky vapor or literally the best combination ever so go ahead and use that affiliate code go use that code semi G get 15% off it'll support your boy and it'll chip some money off of your pockets too so let's get it boys I hope let's get into the final review of the raw garden cartridge tell us is true this thing smacks your auger and definitely knows what they're doing I feel like what they're trying to do in order it like yeah they always release new strains but I feel like what they're trying to do they're trying to create a vault of like super specific streams that they like that are super like you know fan favorites and they're gonna be keeping those in the history of lineage of like seeds and stuff like that but you've got punch number 72 is a banger dude it's super berry no it's very very like note honestly no tones of earthiness at all it's more on the berry sweeter side but if you guys have been using raw garden you guys know what kind of like sweetness it is it's not fake it's super super nice like something you would get off of a flower and the hymen the highest phenomenal I would give it an 8 out of 10 tell you the truth like the only reason I wouldn't give it a 10 out of 10 is because I since I have such a high tolerance I feel like it's not hitting me in a full effect but and then also an indica is usually super super cash luck but this one I'm like I'm relaxed I'm relaxed but I feel like I can still function which is good you know I'm not really hating on that so overall quality I'll probably give this a 10 out of 10 I'm 9 out of 10 Man 9 out of 10 it could use a little work like I said on the indica putting you a little bit more to sleep but overall man the quality raw garden never fails so if you guys are legal and illegal stay somewhere where you can get regardin years no you guys should hit them up see where you can find it legally so we're gonna end the video here if you guys enjoyed today's video man like I did go ahead and leave a sub it helps way more than you think and smash that [ __ ] like button and leave a comment I like to interact with everybody tell you guys the truth ie I interact with everybody so yeah let's keep it going boys and we'll catch you guys later",

you peace boys [Music] you", "3Y-JU0l7RiQ": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand video today yeah again we got actually a brand new brand that I've actually came across on ease before and I've actually you know I've wanted to review it for actually some time now again everybody this is an 18mm educational purpose podcast it's a review I don't condone the usage of these products nor I do not try to boost to sell these products and also we do not sell anything on this channel and again everything here is legal offer 18 and up at cannabis patients you guys are enormous good so today ladies and gentlemen we got a brand new brand to a review it's the old pal brand so I'm not promoting this product or anything like that this is just literally just a review I actually got this full gram $35 crazy huh we got some sativa check this out right here look there's actually some old pal this is actually from 510 which I believe is Oakland I think this is actually a local you know I think this company is actually in the bay keep that out and this is actually the cosmic sativa flavor it's a full sativa you know it has about eighty percent THC which is actually pretty [ __ ] good again everybody this is a $35 gram believe it or not I actually bought this and freaking off off ease and you guys already know man ease sometimes we kind of tax it check the [ __ ] out quick little test want to show you guys that this [ __ ] is look at that stuck for sure no hot water first hit now you lie you guys every time I take the first hit of this cartridge whoa I get laid man I feel this [ __ ] it's a sativa so usually before my morning my morning job you know I wake up take a couple puffs and I go go over to my morning driving [ __ ] you know and 9:00 I'll have one or two puffs literally just leaves me faint like I can already feel it right now I haven't even smoked today today I literally just skipped earlier today I don't really smoke just because I want to make sure I do these reviews with starting with sober but yeah look one thing I really do like about this product again I bought this off ease actually I got to 2 grams for the total price of $70 that includes taxes and delivery so I'm just like dude if this was a $35 full gram imagine if you actually go to like the legit old pal warehouse or whatever they're actually selling these and you buy you buy some stuff so I don't think I've ever seen these you know in the club but sometimes I'm like hmm that's very interesting it's a classic shareable cannabis oil cartridge this is shareable and it definitely is shareable because for the price and again a lot of people are gonna say oh it's fake it's just not no this is not fake this is I legit got this from the east service and they're for sure they're approved they're completely legal and it's not no neighborhood plug this ain't no neighborhood plug [ __ ] so it's crazy if a neighborhood plug [ __ ] is trying to sell you a [ __ ] for gram for like dirty dirty like $30 do that shit's fake as [ __ ] I smoked them before we actually reviewed up a car to do the super Lemon Haze one of my boys got with cool little fake cartridge or whatever and you got it for like pretty expensive but usually if you guys get this from like a a delivery service but it has to be legit though cuz I feel like some there are a couple like delivery services that are just not legit thought a homemade [ __ ] that could might not be healthy for you but please look I don't know if this is true or not I've heard this from a friend that's like a late punch tastes really good too um but I've heard that smoking like I guess fake cartridges or I don't even know if I even talked about but I'm pretty sure it's fake cartridges I guess there was like a youtuber like a weed youtuber some guy that made videos dude I'm pretty sure I don't know where the hell here is this drummer I don't know where it came from or I just don't I don't know but I believe in the obviously you know because it could have been fake cards but I guess like someone passed away from like smoking cartridges and I'm like dude I'm pretty sure it's not gonna be no [ __ ] cannabis you know like legal cartridges had to be some like fake [ __ ] you know I do know someone that bought like four cartridges for like the [ __ ] low and then with fake as [ __ ] dude like there was straight-up hot dog water personally me I know a lot of people that actually do like the old pal they like it because one so I don't think [ __ ] you know proof let's prove it right here look at that that should go it even has a little little sticker we are in California completely illegal dude and this [ __ ] gets you [ __ ] blasted i've only took like what like three four ribs and i'm ready list [ __ ] man but i really do i honestly everybody I appreciate everybody that our clinic everyone that's clicking on these videos man I appreciate you guys so much man because if you guys don't know I do have a main channel and I used to blog and like do pranks and all that [ __ ] back days ago days ago I used to do I gave me videos but that channel is just so mixed up with so much [ __ ] content random content that I got to the point where like I took a break and it just like dinah fell off I'm gonna try to revive it I've been trying for a while now you know but I was like you know what I'm gonna move on to something a little bit more different something a little bit you know like an educational type video if that makes sense so yeah but if you guys want to go check that [ __ ] out go down on my description it's my main channel 120 k subs you know and I actually reached 120 case subs like back like three oh [ __ ] it's gonna be almost four years ago back in like 2016 could've been I got a million right now [ __ ] up but hey [ __ ] have this for a reason right [Music] [Music] like I do appreciate everybody that's clicking on this cuz I know YouTube doesn't like cannabis videos and educational kind of this videos and [ __ ] but I do see that there's a [ __ ] large community there's a lot of people a lot of of age people that want to just watch you know like smoking videos educational cannabis videos type [ __ ] you know and I'm just like doing YouTube should just have its own little like section for that [ __ ] bro you know it's like I don't even wanna tie these videos if you guys see ads okay I'm telling guys this right now if you guys see ads on these videos it's literally [ __ ] YouTube putting videos and [ __ ] cuz first of all I'm not even [ __ ] partnered to me by the time you guys are watching this I don't think I'm ever gonna get this channel partnered honestly I'm definitely gonna be giving away a lot to like I can't really do like [ __ ] weed giveaway since I can't be like pack you know a shitty [ __ ] you know it's a places where like it might not even be like 100 it's legal but it's like you can't like [ __ ] receive it through the mail type [ __ ] you know like on some Canada [ __ ] it's like that legal [ __ ] hear in Caly it's not legal legal like it's get to the point where you just do it you could [ __ ] just smoke a blunt and a smoking area in some places you know people got bitched cuz let me smoke your cigarettes a bunch of tobacco products that [ __ ] [ __ ] kills you dude straight up it literally has a fat ID label that says this shit's gonna give you cancer and it [ __ ] stinks cuz you're [ __ ] smoking like cardboard a [ __ ] you know no offense to everybody that smokes cigarettes if you guys do your thing do what you got to do but I'm telling you right now that is a bad hat bad [ __ ] habit you know and if you guys switch over to vaping and all that vaping [ __ ] quit that [ __ ] brush it's also bad for you too bro and this cartridge probably bad for this too so I do not recommend any type of smoking but again this is for an educational purpose you know my personal review on this [ __ ] but a real [ __ ] though everybody that's watching this man you guys are first James 2nd Janet no matter man everybody like check this out we all got to go to a [ __ ] struggle like it doesn't matter if it's like the struggle is red if the struggle is blue of distress I don't even know I'm saying if the struggle is a triangle a square [ __ ] lid that made no sense that's the path you know that's for your life and [ __ ] but see if you're trying to grind you guys trying to come up be successful in all that [ __ ] I was gonna be a shitload of obstacles so when something's happening in your life that's part of it you know that's an obstacle you gotta face this [ __ ] to get to where you want to be in [ __ ] but damn it have like these crazy eyes like [ __ ] ideas and everything that I want to say on camera every time I say it I'm just look by the way follow me on Instagram I'm crunchy or go down in my description and go I don't check out all my social media I got Twitter snapchat all that stuff I'm gonna try to convince you guys to just chase your [ __ ] dreams take a jade tastes like it takes your passions like it chase your passion you know because in reality if you guys have a talent either if it's [ __ ] drawing you know [ __ ] writing us you're good at writing stories you're gonna like painting you could you're good at something Here I am not knowing how to [ __ ] explain myself but it's like if you guys have a passion or a talent or a hobby you guys are really [ __ ] good I meant pursue that [ __ ] right because I'm telling you guys right now bro you nowadays bro it's the new this is wearing mm about it be 2020 anything is [ __ ] possible that you could monetize absolutely everything bro [ __ ] what's that kid's name [ __ ] Ryan something to bear such the little kid that reviews [ __ ] toys for YouTube dude if he could do that and earn like [ __ ] close to 100 mice where he got like over 50 million dollars a year bro and income or more maybe like 40 to 50 million after taxes because if you got close to a hundred thousand then probably take like half that [ __ ] or even more um holy [ __ ] dude just from revealing choices so if this kid could review toys and become makers it's [ __ ] more more time like millions of dollars then you guys could [ __ ] monetize everything bro it's like you too bro YouTube is like the perfect way to just show off your personality show off you know your talents and [ __ ] there's a lot of people that could take pictures of cars they go they like you know fix cars or all that shade there's car channels shoes - actually I know David got kicks on in person and he has like he's like a sneaker head you know he [ __ ] he reviews sneakers he paints sneakers he customizes sneakers and [ __ ] like that and he's pretty funny he's a funny guy this dude [ __ ] made YouTube videos and then he [ __ ] all of a sudden from just showing off shoes at him making shoes and all this [ __ ] like customizing shoes and [ __ ] painting them all that [ __ ] he got into an eBay commercial true started by the way and I mean that [ __ ] just sounds like what the [ __ ] oven broke YouTube is like a [ __ ] stepping-stone to like this [ __ ] bro crazy like I'm trying to do that bro cuz I know everybody does not want to live that nine-to-five like [ __ ] that [ __ ] you know but if you guys do I'd beid obviously if you guys make like a couple you know small like six figures and [ __ ] and you guys have like a good job with like the benefits and all of the [ __ ] then I understand you know 9 to 5 is for you but exist you know you worked hard you got to where you wanted to be and [ __ ] and that's what's up you know respect honestly but then there's other people like me bro just [ __ ] hate I just don't like that nine-to-five [ __ ] and it's not that I'm lazy you know it's just that I really don't like I just find it so trying to upgrade myself trying to upgrade this this this brand you feel me so [ __ ] y'all shut the crazy-ass video don't even know how blood coughing oh [ __ ] we're reviewing this [ __ ] [ __ ] takes you great to give you guys a good taste it's kind of like piney honestly little piney walk yeah this should taste good taste like like the weed cosmic sativa it was everybody if you guys didn't know make sure you guys drop a like a comment subscribe I'm about to drop more videos and [

time we upload I'm [ __ ] lit yeah I'm [ __ ] blasting Oh", "v7eQ8UTo-Ug": "howdy y'all Dan Scott lean here joining you from legal grass that she sits the heartland of America so for today's episode I'm going to be reviewing this Delta 8 cartridge yes Delta 8 not not the Delta 9 that you commonly associate with THC but there's another form of THC there's Delta 8 that comes before 9 and there's also Delta 10 but I haven't heard of any vendors creating Delta 10 carts at this moment in time right now so I'm just gonna be reviewing what I do have in my hands which is a Delta 9 THC cartridge from 3qi and I've plugged them before on this podcast but I've actually given this actual vape cart the the light of day I've given it a chance and Delta 8 I got it quacks very much like the same duck of cannabis they did it's it feels if you told me that this was a different form of THC I wouldn't I would have I would I would would think it's the same wing of the of the same bird and but yeah so I bought their purple punch Delta Delta eight cartridge that the particular cartridge has about 900 milligrams of Delta 850 milligrams of CBN and CBC and 50 milligrams of terpenes alright so I got this purple punch vape cart from from the folks of 3qi and so do this all right this is what this looks like 3qi this is the cart so you're gonna vape it right now in front of you guys if you look in the video version of this excuse me all right so I vaped it it's like any other vape card if you vape a little too much and you put a little too much we're taking a little too much vapor we are gonna get the coughs and that's what happened I mess with the rooster and got and got the beak but but now with that hefty sort of vape poll that I got you could you could taste the purple purple grape II sort of sweetness to it and it's very apparent in that and in this cart so does it does for taste and flavor it tastes like purple punch concentrates I've had in the past so it does hold up I feel high I don't feel the same debilitating high that a good edible would make me feel or even just like a job two bowls of a 2 2 full cannabis bowls smoking before bed that kid it packs a punch and does the the what I find with Delta Aid is that it feels I still feel the same body it effects of a that I would feel from a good indica I sort of I still feel the same sort of Medicaid medicated that I would with with regular teeth see um what I do notice is that the Delta eight by itself I just vape it by itself like it tends to fade very quickly or in my experience it like you feel the high but then it just it fades and I feel like it fades quicker than if you had had a regular THC count cart so I I do feel that the sticking power with the high in the duration of the highs is shorter with this Delta aid cart and with this Delta eight that I'm trying but I'm what I do notice when I combine it with my THC and CBD I do notice that my sleep is a lot better because I'm getting the anuradha fact and I do feel that Delta eight with Delta nine by itself I feel like it's a lethal combo for for my sleep like it's you take it and it's like oh man it's like I'm hitting the snooze alarm again like I feel that my suppli supplementation of Delta aid with that my Delta nine in my CBD I feel like that's done a world of good and for for treating my illnesses that works actually better than just typical Delta nine I've a fried CBN concentrated like I've like I've mentioned again didn't see the big ruckus in it but I put a gram on my flour I put no I put a little bit on my own flour I put a little bit when I would vape and I again I didn't really feel that much kick from cbn I didn't really feel that oh I'm so gosh darn tired I feel like I get more of a kick from a delta eight and then Delta nine and having that together I feel like I get way more doing that than just getting cbn pills or cbn concentrate which I've gone before and didn't really didn't really live up to the hype but this Delta 8 stuff like if you want a good sort of if you want to replicate that body high and you know you move to a new city or state and don't really have your connects like this is as close as you'll get to the actual THC without having it without having to take spice or anything like that you still all the hallmarks of a traditional high are still there it's just just a bit less intense and it just fades quicker like that's what I've noticed from taking this powerful punch and what I've evaluated over the course of a few days but what I do feel that we're gonna learn and what what people a lot smarter than me are gonna find out is that Delta eight and nine and when you combine it can work very very well when when when taken without Delta eight so Delta eight and nine complement each other very well I definitely feel the hallmarks of a traditional high without you know the without the sort of oh my god this is out of control Ness about it like you you feel high but it's a very sort of controlled high you know it's not it's not like a sound like a sativa edible or whatever that oh my god I'm high I'm high and I don't want to be high anymore pleases no I don't I don't know I don't feel that with Delta eight it's a very it's a very controlled sort of high doesn't feel too much different than a one I would say a one to one sort of strain might offer you a comparable experience my opinion where you feel both he feels M you feel sort you feel impaired but you still you still don't feel like it's out of control boy so I feel like that's what I feel like these are going to be like the new one to ones or maybe you'll have one part Delta a one part Delta nine I feel like that's gonna be the way of the future I do feel that you know for sleep having supplementing with Delta Aid and my THC I feel that the sleep I get is deeper when I sleep when I wake up I'm hidden snooze a little bit more often because the claudius lead that I'm used to getting under Delta aid definitely improves when I paired with Delta nine flower but yeah we've gone into what Delta eight is in previous episodes I would I would recommend you check out these cards they're the one milliliter card was honest aid after shipping was $65 or something like that so if you live in a state where the met both medical or adult use are still very new and still very expensive you may be able to come out ahead buying Delta eight cards as they continue as more continue to go in the market there's another vendor I just ordered four cards from that that's selling their cards for ten bucks apiece which is a lot cheaper than than what I got with three tree but um but again that's it's it's that's still in the mail now so when we get those cards were gonna review we're gonna review that vendor there are new vendor to so we're gonna be what among the first people reviewing it hopefully but yeah I'm if you want something that's gonna complement the medical reasons why you use canvas I guess let's say you use it for anxiety use it for whatever I mean we're all different you know CBD affects me different than it affects UTC affects me differently Delta eight will affect me differently or affect you differently but I do notice that it amplifies the qualities that I find so medicinal about about indicas and it complements that body hi that I need and I need to treat my illnesses and my symptoms in compliments that perfectly it doesn't make the hi out of control it's it's a good enhancer you know and and I find that I don't get like I mean I don't get as paranoid anymore with with with cannabis but I do find that with this Delta eight like it's it's it's kind of like CBD but not you know you know in a sense that it it's able to neutralize it but you are still gonna feel impaired compared to not taking Delta eight or Delta nine you like you're still gonna feel something it is it is gonna so pack a punch and you should understand how your body can handle it before handling heavy machinery but yeah I would highly recommend checking out Delta eight cards if you have the ability to do so again the entourage effect you know all these cannabinoids work better in concert as opposed to just in isolation so again if you have the cash you have the funds and have the ability to get Delta eight cards and you're looking for something that might enhance or amplify your body high from cannabis that you use to treat various different illnesses like if you're sewing in which the body high is needed or the effects that are granted from a body highs needed then Delta eight is gonna be your friend in my opinion I I will say that before letting you all go but yeah I would highly recommend you check out three tree & shaki to live in a state check to see if you live in a state where Delta eight can be shipped to you first make sure you do that before anything else and yeah um if you have the funds and you have the ability to do it and I would check it out so as always everyone I'm their humble and gracious hosts dance Scotland I can be found anywhere you find podcasts tune in google play store I heard radio radio public spotify stitcher tune in and the Google and an iHeartRadio and I can be found at I am cannabis sativa on Instagram and I see sativa pod on the Twitter's peace out Chow and see medicated my friends", "MAS526f5doo": "YouTube would up under there's a crazy epidemic type deal going on all these cartridges and this and that madness but I don't sound on these cartridges these are all mine for me to smoke only so I know what's in them and I'm not worried about these carts but some cartridges out there that look a lot like these you have to be careful with you have to these are on me with distillate and Shore natural Terps or put in but everyone's like an ease off whites about a bunch of hits on this so we're gonna do another off-white one this is a sativa melon aid so off-white is fake they do not make cartridges at the clothing brand so this is not and 2013 is not the date it is the date that the company was made someone said that all the must be old those are from 2013 no it's the date the company was made but this one here this one here one's the real one fake you can see this one here's a thousand milligrams on the air it's 500 this one the air comes in a nice plastic jar this was the snowman strain the strain of it but that's how real cookies car comes it comes in a plastic jar cookie on their cookies on the black in black library but we're not going cookies these coming the plastic thing that they're good but they come in like a Styrofoam one open insert t care of and then these Dangs people were screwing the game up with that stupid thickener now it's like you only wanted your bangs to be too thick because it's insane anymore insane these really medicate you might go well let's get into this dizzy I got that too you can look at the cart it's clear clear oil I don't have that fuzz to it like it's a dirty oil how clicks the bubble move it moves please don't comment that it's water and it's moving super fast cuz it's definitely not but like I said again these are not real they do not make cartridges off way brand what's the bottom looking like the bottom is an icy so the rubber in it to cut the cage just like the dank quartz pretty much these are what I smell great your Moxie I like the Moxie carts but I don't like this porcelain tip I dropped this thing a couple times today a lot of times that I hit the Steeler game and it didn't break and I'm very happy nice looking stuff let me twist this camera around take a lot of likes on these cartridges figured I'd do another one for y'all this is just an empty pack probably buy on Amazon for probably get a hundred of them for $25 off white one cram 2018 zip tie it even says off-white on the ceramic tip it's pretty cool they put a lot of work in the days they put a lot of time and that Easy's ain't no bull crap too much working that he's to throw junk

so I always use this during the day so let's go and check this out the packaging gives us a lot of good info it's hybrid meaning it's a strange combination of sativa and indica Jack Herer is more sativa dominant which is one of the reasons why I love it turn to the side you'll see it's 60% THC and now to the back they'll let us know there are no additives and they use a clean co2 extraction process which is proprietary to ABX okay let's attach the cartridge to our ABX battery you can buy this too at hello MD comm or use any 510 thread battery you already have it tastes great it's an earthy flavor with a hint of dried berries I'd recommend that you take one puff and then wait about 15 minutes before you take another you could get this now at hello MD calm until next time guys have a good one [Music]", "JHuSstnceBE": "do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail one mil or one gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges let's take this to the deck okay well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sell brand we're going to take a pair of vice grips common rice clips and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this caller right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged all right I will show you again on this one here you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it", "vfbEQNSMFXo": "[Music] so these forms of extraction kind of started like beautiful accidents like a lot of things in this industry being the first processors in the state of organ we dealt with a lot of new products and consistencies that have come about along the way liquid live resin is essentially our iteration of oil that can go into a cartridge we just take fresh frozen cannabis flower extract that here it get it clean and then fill cartridges with it so people are learning about distillate and about fake terpenes are liquid live resin is literally just libraries and it append there's no cutting agents there's it's not like a formulation it's not like I'm a chef and they're adding a bunch of stuff to a pot mixing it together and then putting it in a pen it's literally just live resin in a liquid form so that it can run through a cartridge from there we have innovated ways to then include liquid cured resin and those two products have a serious stronghold now with the demand for quality on the organ market so the difference between liquid cured and liquid live resin is the beginning product that we put inside so liquid cured resin is a cured either trim or node that would normally be made into a shatter and then the liquid live resin is fresh frozen that the cannabis companies will cut down fresh freeze it as quick as possible which gives you the highest terpene rich cannabis that you can have so that's just a differences the starting material as far as effects they aren't drastically different unless you're really looking for that 5% 10% more terpene variation which is liquid live rest when you pull this vape in out of your pocket and you have a drill on it you're gonna have that fresh plant experience just like you're at a farm walking the rows

appreciate you guys watching my videos if you got someone watch the video I posted before this one go ahead and check it out we'd really appreciate that but other than that it's Sunday more Sunday morning actually you know I'm just chillin kicking back bout it hit my dispensary maybe a cup and eight this something you know it's it's about that time you know I really want to smoke it it's kind of different when you have a when you smoke out of a cartridge and you smoke a bloody nut I mean it's way different so but before I go ahead head out you know I want to get this out of the way so here we have this lemon haze from bloom farms you know I've never had a blue farm before actually I have but it was more uh it was one of these darts I'm know if you guys had seen these before these are pretty good so I don't know if they taste exactly like the card just because at the time I didn't see no cartridges I just seen these so I don't know whether they just like I said they just came out with cartridges or whatnot but you guys let me know on that this was like it was like 38 bucks you know I couldn't pass these up they had a lot they had all kinds of flavors you know what I mean so there's those people say there's a lot of fakes and there's real [ __ ] but you know this one's definitely real I got it from the dispensary but I don't know what would be the difference between a fake or real so I cannot tell you like you know on the packaging is [ __ ] so let me know in a comment section what are you guys smoking on I'm about to pop this [ __ ] open you know I have a smoked all day so it's about that time we get the wake-and-bake going so let's go ahead and pop this [ __ ] open so the THC on this is 83 no 88 actually total cannabinoids I got to see on the back and it's pretty cool pretty cool simple packaging so we're just gonna go and take this little alright guys so we finally got the sticker open and I kind of [ __ ] it up you know kind of [ __ ] the box up a little tab ripped out so here it goes hey they got the here you got the the packaging and it looks pretty dope you not never had a bloom cartridge before and here it says today was a good day it's pretty dope packaging I'm starting to really like this we're gonna get that and all you get is like this little I'm hotter burnin like what what not to do you know what your cartridge which I'm pretty sure are you cartridge smokers know what and what not to do what your cartridge is right keep it out of the keep out of the Sun you know what that should amount and [ __ ] so here you have it cool little cab a little oh [ __ ] alright guys so we finally you have to push this and you turn it at the same time so it's kind of where you know you you gotta know what the [ __ ] you're doing with these things because it's not gonna have a hard time trying to open this [ __ ] so BAM guys this looks pretty nice you know the oil looks really really clear nice yellow gold and first of all we're just gonna go ahead and do the bubble test on it this one's a super Lemon Haze I were really big the team fan and the super Lemon Haze is like a really old school strain so I really caught my attention so that's why I kind of wanted to get it the oil is really really thick guys she does not move at all so it's it's not life resin it says triple distillate so it must be some pretty you know clean clean distillate some people say dis list not to move now you know a lot of resins a new wave well it kind of is you know there's a lot of companies coming out with live resin so I don't know I mean this still is still good you know don't get me wrong it's still good just depends what kind of distillate you guys get from so we're gonna try hit this and we're gonna see what it tastes like all right off the bat you can taste those lemons man it is really good wow that's just fire I didn't just let me give you guys a little close-up again before I smoked a [ __ ] out of this cartridge it says bloom on there and this is the SL H for super Lemon Haze on the side and you got your California sticker there which is pretty dub so we headed up connected the little magnet right here for the yoke and battery you guys need to get one of these joke cows and other monsters had it for like almost two years already you know it's still hits like if I just pull it out the Box you know so we're just gonna throw it in there and cheers guys if you got smoke along with me go ahead and do so man we're about a good fake right now Wow I'm gonna be honest with you guys this cartridge does not taste like distillate it tastes more like a it tastes like really cleaned lemons no fresh like it's just fire its [ __ ] guys I didn't really expect it to be that good you know for some distillate bloom bloom Farms are pretty far man I'm going to hit her again I'm see if I can get a bigger bigger cloud oh yeah definitely you get lemons you know Wow so if you guys you guys let me know like what's the price on these bloom cartridges some people told me to have fakes you know so I don't know whether what to tell the difference like I said but you guys have these around where you guys from what's the price on these I got him prepared for like $38 with tax so it's not as bad so you guys don't pass this up man I'm at the [ __ ] again she's pretty good you know it tastes like actual lemons like it'll taste fake or nothing like that tastes like some actual terpene and definitely one of my favorite cartridges so far from bloom farm I haven't tried I haven't tried any other ones besides this one and the GDP one the GDP one was really good as well you know it tastes like actual granddaddy but but this was pretty far guys and if you guys ever see this super Lemon Haze you guys gotta try them out you know for the price $38 well it depends on where you guys from but here where I'm from it's pretty cheating but this is California but yeah guys I'm uh gonna head out good like I said I'm go to my dispensary and picked up some weed and tied to a hot box video or something let me know in the comment section what kind of cartridges and what kind of videos you guys like to see that I mean cuz I do

we're gonna be going over three ways to salvage your oil cartridges from empty or broken cartridges so whether you drop your bait pin break the cartridge glass in the process or your oil cartridges almost empty you just want to get those small remnants just below the airflow hole or maybe a cartridge is faulty and it just hasn't worked from the start here's a few quick reasons why you shouldn't throw away your cartridges just yet so the easiest way to get the most oil out of your cartridge is with a syringe but let's say we don't have one so we're gonna resort to some more primitive methods but first you're gonna need a few things plastic bowl ziplock bag a microwave and a sheet of foil you can also use a zig zag paper rolls if you don't have any foil if you want to transfer oils from one cartridge to another then you're gonna need a new empty cartridge too if your cartridge glass is shattered into pieces you run the risk of transferring oils with small shards in them and I don't recommend that but if it's just cracked and it's leaky then it shouldn't work all the same just be gentle with it but first put the oil cartridge that you want to transfer oil from into a ziploc bag and zip it up and set it aside for right now second is to get your plastic bowl and fill it with water then take it and put into the microwave for about two to three minutes or until you see it's steamy third step is to take the bowl out for the microwave and place the bag with the cartridge inside of it again make sure that's airtight so no water gets in and just pop it in there for about 2 minutes place the sheet of foil down on a flat clean surface this will act as your work station to catch any oils and then take the mouthpiece off of the cartridge and make sure that the heating post is exposed after about two minutes of the cartridge being inside the water bowl take it out remove the mouthpiece usually use a napkin or towel because it's gonna be hot and once the mouthpiece is off flip it upside down directly mirroring of the cartridge below and just set it right on top and I promise you that the balancing act is a lot more easier than it looks make sure not to get any oils down the heating post because that's where the airflow comes from heat makes oil less viscous and allows it to run so the oil should just slide right into the cartridge if you don't want to transfer your oils to another cartridge you can just put them directly on a cake batter or cookie dough you can also place the cartridge upside down on the foil to let it catch the oils and use it for later sort of the refrigerator use it for dabbing or use a dab tool to peel it off and put on your dry herbs once your oils are transferred to the new cartridge place the mouthpiece back on and you're ready to date so we hope this video was helpful to you guys if you have any other questions please leave them down in the comments below and subscribe to god me for more videos like this teeth", "3UWOCjjlWYk": "[Music] what's up y'all p2 peeps and today we're going to be looking at another delta 8 thc cartridge today it's going to be from rogue river labs instead though this is the super sour diesel delta 8 thc car this is just the packaging just to show you guys and here is the cart itself um just you know you guys get that color on there so yeah um real quick before i take it uh this is of course a different brand and um from this brand you can give two options of cartridges cards with bdt and cards with cdt so that being said let's go ahead and take our first ear here and then let's talk about what's going on here with uh you know taste flavor and effects things like that so cheers everybody i hope you guys are all having a great wonderful day week whatever it is when you're watching this and uh yeah thank you for joining me [Music] so right off the bat very very flowery taste and that is mostly because of the bdds in there so here bdt stands for botanical derived terpenes meaning the terpenes are coming from flowers so of course it's going to have a little bit more of a flowery taste there um comparatively to a cdt you know cannabis derived terpenes but it still has good flavor um and well good effect you know like i said before and so my other delta hc videos i feel like this kind of hits me a little bit faster excuse me than regular thc it's a very kind of heavy like back in the head type type of feel at first it kind of just like it just kind of feels like it's pulling you back a little bit um and yeah i mean very relaxing effects not only for a lot of delta thc products and uh you know all that stuff so real quick question guys have you tried any delta 8 thc and if you have please let me know down below in the comments and while you're at it don't forget to like comment and leave another comment and subscribe if you're enjoying the video so far so yeah those are the notes we're getting with flavors here it's just kind of flowery you know i'm not getting um too many differences there you know there's a slight tang and souriness there um but not too much as we're getting a lot of that the flowery tones so let me go ahead and take another hit here and then talk a little bit more about how i'm feeling about this one cheers everybody [Music] okay before i talk about this a little bit more i do want to take the time to correct myself in my last video i said that this was legal in all 50 states it is not i will be putting a list of all the states that delta a thc is legal in uh down below in the description so you know you guys don't get it twisted i mean i have it in the other uh video as well but you know i just felt like i should at least address my mistakes i mean i always do anyway whenever someone corrects me but um you know i just feel like it's a little bit better to address that as well in the video so very sorry to those who might have been slightly misinformed i mean probably not a big number of you guys no one really watches these videos but but you know yeah so after that last hit i'm feeling pretty [ __ ] lit i know guys i feel like the more i hit delta hthc the more obviously you know you get tolerance you get a little used to it but the more i i just kind of learned to enjoy it more um i mean that's not to say i never enjoyed my first hit or nothing like that but yeah you know every delta a thc product i give you don't try out i'm more excited to get another one and give it a go give it a try all that stuff so for rogue or river labs i'm looking to try a cannabis derived terpene cart very soon so um for me this is the super sour diesel pretty good stuff i don't know personally whether uh i can discern between a sativa delta eight thc high and uh an indica one so hopefully you know i go grab an indica one as you know the cannabis derived terpene cart so that should be it for this video i do want to thank you guys for watching and tuning in and here's a little sneak peek at our next delta 8 thc video i did get a package in the mail so give me one second let me grab that thing here we are so might as well have a quick little unboxing we're unboxing this opening of a package here we got a bunch of goodies i mean you know i already know what's in this package but you know i might as well show you guys oh come on [Applause] all right well that's it's just ripping right off come on there we go oh we got a whole bunch of cartridges guys so let's see here which is the one that is oh yep here we go so we'll be giving this black lime cartridge a go one of these times you know you guys will definitely see reviews for all of these pretty much white widow koji kush wedding cake and sour banana sherbet so this is gonna be the one that is coming right after this delta a t oh i wouldn't say right after but in terms of you know delta eight thc products the sour banana server is gonna be the next one coming up so thank you guys for joining me on this video once again and please don't forget to like comment subscribe if you have enjoyed it and let's take one more hit for the road guys cheers thanks for watching everybody and i'll see you on the next one man peace you out [Music] peace", "on1oTL9jsH0": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title this is another raw garden video but it's not like a product review this is more of like a wake and bake hitting two cartridges at the same time trying to blink it and I know I what I've said about excessive smoking this is actually the first time I'm blazing today and we're probably just gonna do two hits off of each pin and try to blink both of them and we're pretty much done from there you know I'm not gonna drain the cartridges in any way I just want to see if I complained to maybe just twice you know saying so we're gonna start the video right in the [ __ ] [ __ ] so if you couldn't tell from my video the other day I got to half cap cartridges of raw card in as you can see right here good stuff we got both of them are indica hybrids and uh I just noticed the font is different on the top but oh well you know I'm saying I've got it from fie nose you see right here QR code and everything berry punch number two and Golden Eagle I'm saying I will post the crosses on the screen right here just on each side and I'm saying so you guys couldn't get a better understanding of what strains are actually crossed in here but very very good stuff these were $24 for a half grams so about 48 dollars total a full gram is 45 at my shop so I did so about buying a full gram cartridge would save you about 3 bucks but you only get one strain I get two and yeah we're just gonna get started from here just see the percentages so for the berry punch it's gonna be 82 percent or 83 let's just say 83 and then this one's going to be 80 point 74 percent okay let's just open it I'm kind of scared I've never blinked two pens at once so we're gonna be trying this so this one golden here here very very similar I did smoke some already as you can tell so try this friendly funds will go in the golden one I'm in the chill battery this one see if we can bring both of these at once do not try this at home voice no I'm saying my tolerance is a lot different than every tall everyone's person's tolerance is different so please keep that in mind my tolerance is a bit high so I do have to smoke a little bit more than a average person so I'm saying cheers boys [Music] that's Syrian think so a lot of you have probably been wondering about raw garden for a while and I've been wondering too you know their life resin is a lot lighter than other life resin cartridges and it's not like raw garden has hid anything from their extraction process maybe just a few secrets but I've read articles on Leafly where they're basically saying that it's this list so it's like raw garden has never hid the fact and then the fact that there were fine live resin is not really that much of a difference you know I'm saying it actually it's like kind of like the best of both worlds how distillate usually has higher THC percentages than let's say library but then if you reintroduce the strain-specific turts like it's it's all the same it's just a little bit lighter and it's not it's distillate mix with real turf so you know I'm saying usually distillate you're gonna mix it with like strawberry terms or grave herbs or watermelon herbs but what raw garden is doing and I'm not saying like I'm like a raw garden expert because I am far from that you know this is just what I've been reading online and please just take it with a grain of salt people are messaging me saying that they're a bad company but it's like you know they're not they're not a bad company they're certified they never like failed a test for pesticides and they never honestly never like they said refine life resins if you look up refine it means remove from all impurities in the [ __ ] and that's basically what they say on their Instagram you know I'm saying so no hate on raw garden is still my second favorite my first favorite is obviously Ursa but raw garden they're doing something right you know they really are and it kind of is like the best of both worlds if it is this late which I'm not sure it is they have the Hyatt they have the high percentages you know thing and what live resin is is it basically the flash freeze the plants and then they just extract it with BHO or closed a closed loop system and then you get the final product you know I'm saying and some some companies you know they and just put that whole product into a cartridge what raw garden does is that they distill it with some sort of method that they use which is only unique to them and then they reintroduce the Terps back into it like it's not really it's just like it's like doing math but differently you know I'm saying like two plus two equals four but then you put two plus one plus one you know I'm saying there's just a different way it just ends up kind of similar you know I'm saying I'm not saying it's the same we obviously know that live resident cartridges is usually a bit darker but like like I said raw garden has never been lying about anything you know and the cartridges are getting I'm saying so while garden fan till the end and respect to the people who has been telling me about you know whatever they think they're concerned with these thing they're telling me that there's like the housing 10,000 chemicals like come on really let's be honest you just ready you're spreading some weird rumors now so cheers boys I'm gonna do another blink you're probably gonna end the video here it's just like the video says I was just going to do a blinker with both pens at once and hopefully you guys enjoyed the video you know there will be another video of some King's garden so be on the lookout for that I didn't even open it here so yeah just I don't understand the heat for raw garden it's like raw garden never hid that fact you know they're gonna hide some facts of like their methods of extraction you know you can't really tell people what you do too much you know you gotta keep it a secret but like they never like hidden the fact that you know the alley flea article says that their distillate you know alley flea article shares boys [Music] no more we gotta put it down it's all like I said it was a wake and bake today so I'm definitely gonna feel this but yes both really really phenomenal flavors I'm not gonna lie and honestly that was all I need for this wake and bake um holy [ __ ] well yeah much love to a rock garden much love to ursa and all the other companies you know saying do your own thing you know I'm saying and uh I don't know it's kind of like the best of both worlds to me let me know in the comments what you think you know obviously we're going to have different opinions just let me know let me know your opinion on rawr and let me know what you actually think of raw garden and uh yeah we'll just get this discussion going you know but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video [Music]", "w043BMerbyM": "all right without boys just got back from the dispensary picked up a few things a couple cartridges and a half cream of some live L out batter I'll get into that stuff in another time but right now what I'm going to do is show you guys just strawberry Lane spread liquid live resin cartridge okay I I do know that Lance Brett is a Jamaican lineages to making something and sire child or some [ __ ] like that but uh I don't lambsbread before so if you actually want to know lineage to go back to that that review and yeah so anybody read these numbers off real quick THC is seventy four point eight th CAS at 0.35 I think they had that backwards I think the thta's that are you take C's at 0.35 M th CAS at seventy four point eight but anyway a c BG 2.25 c bt a 0.55 CB z 0.99 in total seventy eight point nine for the terpenes a C alpha pining 0.59 I'm reading big ones here beta mercy three point seven [Music] Deveney 1.02 and see turpentine years ago on 5.21 had to go in there anyway the total terpenes on this is fourteen point seven okay here's a quick look at that stuff there guys it's kind of hard I'm in the car the way if he's driving on the way at Walmart real quick I just want to get a couple puffs in before uh I go in this craziness yes I know you guys can't see [ __ ] bumping and driving I'm just gonna crack this baby open and get to it alright see they put they put a new new little sticker on it's not those little white things anymore some plastic brown johns now right I couldn't very good turned on I got the [Music] yeah it's not not as hard I actually broke a lot easier than the other little stickers on let's see nice nice color nice golden color the the cards are just always the same I have no complaints about these cartridges I like them only only thing is I wish that it would come with like some kind of plug for the top that way uh you know you don't get [ __ ] [ __ ] in it whenever you put it in your pocket so with that said take this one off here of course got the crest good battery yes dude I teach real quick I know it's a hybrid I believe it was in the cat dominant I believe I know you for it helps a pain stress depression all that good stuff like like it always does you know I mean so without further ado be safe guys State Police say troopers here at Walmart I don't know why but yeah Cheers right

interstate 710 and keep your eye out for the giveaway", "HwKWVcTne9M": "what's up youtube i'm coming at you today with the product review and today i have the lax extracts live resin sauce carts um i've had the lax flower before they make real good uh real good weed flower strings and i've actually had this animal mints and flower form from them and uh really amazing really amazing stuff and uh i can't lie to you guys i've already taken a few hits out of this cartridge and um it's amazing it tastes just like the flour the effects feel the same real similar and um you know it's real good this is a clean product um this is my first time trying their extracts but uh you know this is amazing absolutely no distillate 100 live resin additive free no heavy metals and natural terpenes only and that's what i like because uh you know i was a desolate guy for a long time and don't get me wrong i still might get this lit every once in a while plugging plays or you know something of that caliber but uh this lit just it doesn't smoke the same as live resin i'm not gonna lie to you guys uh it's just not quite the same and for one being distillate is mainly just thc and sometimes cbd nothing else whereas when you smoke flour there's so many different components and compounds in it that contribute to the high the feeling that you get after smoking that uh you know there's so many more and i'm not a scientist i can't really go into it but uh it's a lot more than just thc and cbd like those those might be the psychoactive and physical components but there's much more that goes into it that gives you the full complete high that you feel when you smoke a joint and uh that's what why they call it the entourage effect so for live resin they take the complete plant matter they don't take anything out they're not taking out just thc they're not extracting uh cbd they're extract they're taking everything from the plant and putting it into a cartridge like this and uh it's just so much nicer it tastes like weed it smells like weed so that's that's the only downside if you're trying to be discreet you're not really going to be discreet with live resin cartridges for the most part especially this uh it smells like weed and it tastes like weed so uh if you're smoking in your car or in an enclosed space yeah other people around you will know what you're doing they will know what you're doing but uh it's great man like the overall feeling of this is just amazing and uh i'm gonna go ahead and take a couple hits i'm not gonna show myself doing that on camera because youtube doesn't [ __ ] with that type of stuff so i'm gonna take a few hits off camera and just give you guys a quick rundown on this um wow so oh my god so off that one hit i could say that uh whoo there it is you get that flavor we're flowery punch it flavor is smell marijuana flour smell it taste so right off the bat for flavor guys i'm gonna have to give this a five out of five and why i'm gonna say that is because i'm a flower guy i love the taste of weed the smell of it and this gives me that the aftertaste you know it's not a disgusting this lit cartridge typical aftertaste no i'm just left with the taste of weed flour and and i like that so this is great for that so five out of five on flavor potency i just took one hit so far and as you can see as you can hear i'm still recovering from that coughing but um what i can say is i'm high as [ __ ] that one hit it really did it to me i'm going on another hit right now guys but uh what i can tell you is you definitely feel this off one hit take one nice hit and you'll feel it you know i know some people don't like to go too deep and get too fried but you take one nice hit off of this you'll be high it'll get you where you need to be um i know this is labeled as a hybrid and um yeah i kind of get that because i'm getting some mind mind racing effects you know like my my i'm really high i can feel it in my head my eyes all that and uh but i'm also feeling it in my body like i can't feel my feet right now i'm real relaxed just laying low you know i don't want to get out the car i got to go in the store i don't even want to do that but um hey let me go on one more hit for you guys um damn i just can't really get over the flavor this i love live rising guys oh man i'mma confident guys my bad but um whoo i'm high as [ __ ] yeah man [ __ ] i'm stuck like chuck right i'll be reviewing different products a different life different different live resin cartridges flowers i'll be reviewing all that stuff edibles all that you know but um potency of this i rate it five out of five flavor five out of five this is an amazing product i'm high as hell [Music] god goddamn trying to get it together today yeah but um guys check these guys out lax extracts on instagram at lax extracts and then they got another page at lax packs i'll leave links to both of those pages in the description below um overall great product i'd highly recommend it try them out if you can if you ever see them in your local shops dispensaries whatever try to definitely try them out see you guys next time", "NN5GlVnEE-s": "[Music] love you too thank you for tapping in whether you subscribe or you searched for this product either way I'm glad I came across this today I picked me up some alien cash buy buddies indica there's one other well it's one of their strongest ones they usually range from 7 D THC to like 85 80 89 this is 87 total THC super indica alien Kush with 1.20 of limonene it gives you their little terpene profile in the back ingredient cannabis concentrate only nothing knows no fillers I see a lot of people are speaking highly of buddies I have to agree I've been on them for quite some time now I believe where he went for like more grams yeah yeah yeah I've been going through his stuff like crazy and it actually sugars up like on the flag inside the cart at the very end it gets all Dimond up so you up liquid live diamonds live resin up liquid diamonds it is my buddies alien fish and we're gonna go ahead and open this up at the end I'm gonna post a picture of one of the cards that I had prior to this which was the Durbin poison I've been going through it probably for like a week and a half you go straight see the diamonds like and the sugar inside it looks crazy so that's how you know these besides ain't playing pretty reputable brand and they range from like 40 45 to 55 a gram which is not bad for sauce in a cart I've been stopped [ __ ] with the distillates but hey I got nothing against this tool it's just personal preference now look at that look at that amber color that's our live resin that goes the buddy's logo then we got their their own parts check this out they got the little Callie and cram it in the back no sticker straight up there look at that color pretty good stuff like I said I went through like four of their grams already and I haven't been disappointed now this one yep 87 87 THC so it's pretty up there 49% and 0.49 be mercy 0.24 Lionel ooh I mean I know what these terms are all about so uh packaging is pretty dope always on point mission statement on the side full grand shout out to friendly farms for the free battery low voltage I believe it's at 2.2 right now and my present should be intended to vape I hope you guys are taking the music in the background that's all me every time you see a video of mine it won't be my own beat in the back so uh yeah nice color there [Music] I've never gotten a running cart from them it always just sticks right there just stays didn't move like molasses I gotta add the lowest setting there it is buddy's alien fish indica zero point zero zero CBD oh here we go by the way check that out that's the Durban poison after a week and a half you see the Barney's so yeah I've been recommending the brand for sure it's freaking on point with the price and whatnot so buddy's much respect to you guys for bringing some of the clean meds that are affordable and super delicious I can't wait to you guys get in other states some on the top for other people you know so enough talk let me go ahead and take some rips of this [Music] [Music] marry tasty super turkeys super turkey why pay $80 for a gram when you can pay 40 to 50 for some super [ __ ] fire wow I've never tried their alien fish this is it straight tastes just like the plant straight like it almost reminds me of like rosin you know how it leaves that plant flavor in your mouth that's this very similar friendly farms if anything I'm gonna say many people are gonna hate me for it but I personally will choose buddies over friendly farms this shit's been [ __ ] tasty don't get me wrong I'm just giving you guys my quick opinion that's just what it's been lately with the price break and all that praise when mattering a lot so [Music] [Music] super cushy straight-up you can taste the [ __ ] plant very very very earthy very good flavor smooth doesn't make you in a cough I recommend you to take small drags you know three to five second pools at the most you know get the flavor out of it you want to get the terpenes and before the fact I feel it straight up going to my brain right now into my body making my eyes feel a little lower so it's been a couple of hits that inhales so mom Wow kind of like if I'm hitting a rig like on low tent paper vapor production is pretty freakin strong as you can see I'm barely even taking drags and straight bringing clouds very light drags just look at her head and they seem to last I had this other one for a week and a half and I just been dragging it oh I work at night this is a team of Durbin poison so it definitely helped me out this is the indica I'm feeling [ __ ] high that was like what four hits leaves a good aftertaste I feel like each hit I'm getting a different note on herbs which is a good thing like it's freaking good because I like the taste of herb you know you don't want to taste some [ __ ] that's like fruity or like you taste artificial things you know this is straight herbal stuff and it smells I smell it in the car right now smell saucy yeah that's what it is liquid diamonds y'all buddies go do some research on them the prices they carry sugars they carry live diamonds very very euphoric high absolutely [ __ ] high FL lift it take another hit [Music] those Terps are on point yeah as you guys see I haven't caught once it's been very very subtle on my lungs very smooth I highly recommend it I approve of it just trying to show you guys their sativas are little lighter like a little yellow er I notice that but they're all still live resin you know just like this [ __ ] like that's that different poison you can see the diamonds in there we got this alien fish is very very euphoric if you want to feel really really relaxed and that euphoria through the roof this is it I'm like ready to go into work and face my supervisors but it's nothing they're super chill I'm

up in today's video i got a review on a push disposable so let's just get right into this let's check out the packaging this is a live resin uh this is premium live resin this is the alien og it's an indica uh it says organic it's got a picture of the actual live resin bar it's one gram it's rechargeable you got the california medical stamp on it uh the side says push and then push stands for puff until something happens that's the branding like i said i i've not seen any of these i've not seen any video reviews on these i've seen reddit posts on them but i've not actually seen any actual videos on these i've seen the push carts i haven't seen the i haven't looked up the pods so i don't know if there may be some pod videos of the push pods but um yeah i haven't seen any videos so i figured i'd put out a video let you guys know so if you see these you know what to expect uh here's the back it's got the lab test and stuff like pretty much every other cart that's on the black market you got all those this qr takes you to their instagram which i'll give you their instagram in a second don't worry about that and this is to authenticate if it's an actual push um product so disclaimer before anybody comments something bro you're you're smoking dog water bro it's hot dog water broom save yourself time don't come in it you don't know you're talking about okay no disrespect you're not smoking what i am so you don't know what i'm smoking you don't know my plug you don't know my source so i'm gonna leave it at that i'm a little high i already tried to record this uh like twice and every time i just i don't like the way i do it so here we are i'm gonna do it real good this time hopefully but without further ado let's open this alien og it is gonna have uh a sill that goes over this i obviously already opened it so when i slid it in i accidentally slid it in so mine's not going to be sold but here open it up you have your um disposable then it says made in the usa los angeles california um yeah there's the box um their instagram is right there official push product is their instagram go ahead and check them out if you want and yeah they say you can recharge these which i've tried it just takes a micro usb but yeah on the bottom you'll see that it says usb all you do is take your finger and it's got like a little place so you can pull out and there's the charge port which for a disposable that's pretty nice actually i i think that's a game chart changer because you know you're for sure gonna get all your oil so don't be afraid to pick one of these up and be afraid that like yo i'm gonna take a few tokes then that battery is gonna die and i'm not going to be able to smoke point well no as long as you have a micro usb it does not come with a micro usb you have to add one which usually i don't know who wouldn't have a micro usb now that is but yeah so you can charge this which is dope um let me see if i'm missing anything i don't think i'm missing anything i think i hit everything about it this is the alien og again this is what the box of it looks like and yeah here's the the actual disposable i like that it's got the window over here where you can see your oil level then on this side it's actually pretty cool too it has the push the push uh logo and you can see your oil through that window as well and then it says live resin bar then push got your uh light to let you know that it is activating when you draw on it uh on the back it's got your california stamp again and then on the side just your window and that's it and yeah all right let's get right into this boys i'm gonna take uh i am pretty high off this but we're just gonna take like medium hit there is no dry hitting this for flavor as soon as you draw it does you know hit so cheers dudes hope you guys are smoking along dab it along smoking a joint roll your joint pause the smoke with me but cheers dudes pretty decent little hit for not a blinker really smooth uh the draw is not bad on this pretty easy draw uh this doesn't hit you in the back of the throat and burn your throat when you when you're hitting it or at least me it does not uh yeah the flavor on this i'm not really good at explaining flavors so i'm not gonna i'm not gonna leave a flavor description because i'm not good at it tastes just like um pretty much just like weed in a cart you know i mean that's you know with some flavor that there's not much to it uh it is good though effects i would say pretty high give this a this is an indica i prefer indicas because i like that just calm me down kind of like let me chill so yeah i would say i'm getting that i am being able to kick back i'm feeling myself just kind of my body like my muscles are loosening up and i'm just kind of chilling you know um what else trying to think anything you guys would want to know about uh how long these last i like i said this is my first one so i'm not the best person to ask how long this will last black and sap took some pretty big draws off this i mean it's got some bubble action in there going on at the top that you can kind of see so um yeah i'll just have to update in the comments and let you know about how long this lasts i'm assuming it'll last a week maybe maybe two i'm not really sure just really depends on how much it took i do like like i said i like to roll a couple joints every now and then so uh just kind of just on my go you know take a few tokes while i'm out about but yeah i want to do a review for you guys like i said i keep seeing these pop up my plugs had them for a while and i just they keep selling down i i never get any but uh i like the whole concept that you don't need to buy battery you don't need anything you grab it you're ready to go you there's no extras you know you ain't got to worry about if your battery's charged you ain't got to worry about none of that with this because i mean pretty much you know right out the box you're ready to go i mean i don't know how good the battery life is but i'm assuming it's pretty good considering like i mean look at how big this thing is i don't know this does produce some vape so there is that i hope you guys did enjoy this let me know if uh you have tried these and if you have seen them let me know what you think and uh yeah without further ado spin your boy exotica i'll see you guys in the next one bye", "lu9nS1v3E3s": "Never burn another vape cartridge. Hey guys welcome to the vape review how-to series. we're gonna take this olive oil we're gonna put it in the pan we're gonna turn it on and we're gonna let it smoke until vaporizes okay so after the oils been heated this is what it looks like the color is gonna change to brown when it's overheated the same thing is happening in your vape cartridge when you heat it up for too long so the question is how do we stop this from happening? here's a few tips tip 1 batteries matter all batteries do the same thing but they each do it a little differently so whether you have an Autopen a mini mod Conceal or a Manual battery there's a couple of different things that you can do auto pens heat while you're inhaling so tip number two limit your inhale to 5 seconds Tip 3 I also feel the pen for heat at the top right there in the connection\npoint just stop inhaling for about one to three seconds alright tip number four\nfor variable voltage batteries you want to always use the lowest temperature\nclick three times to change the voltage For manual push-button pens tip five\npulse the button this will lower the overall temperature\nacross the oil and the coils as you inhale The optimal battery temperature\nis 2.2 volts This ensures that you don't overheat your oil It's enough to vaporize the oil but cool enough not to burn it all right if you\ndon't want to do all of that stuff... Tip number six get a cold fusion vape pen it's the best of both worlds variable voltage down to two point two volts pulse chip technologies is integrated into the vape pen never to make sure that you \nburn another vape cartridge You can hold the button down on the green setting which is the lowest setting With two point two volts and you can hold it as long as you want If our logo isn't on it.  It isn't Cold Fusion! The cold fusion challenge If your cartridge doesn't taste better with our battery we will not only buy it back but we will also pay for the return shipping Cartridges taste the way they're supposed to

at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is pissing me off much love y'all seven likes do it do it all right go to twitch.tv link will be in the description uh go to my twitter man i'm trying to get my twitter up as well like i want y'all to be able to follow me and know what i'm doing you know know when i'm going to make a video knowing i'm going live you know i always want feedback as well you know i want to talk to you guys too that's

it I don't know why the [ __ ] it's 20 but Browns greens on boom I have this battery but I don't I forgot what it's called it's moving but very slowly I [ __ ] what they go oh it's pretty like yellow it looks like a like the KRT oil I don't know how I feel about that I didn't really like the Quixote's we're trying something new so let's go this battery I'm gonna show you guys how it works here's to like turn up the heat look at this 3.8 here's the power button / the hit button to like press it to take a you know whatever I'm over this review let's go see how it tastes it smells like sugar smoke like honey I'm scared what I'm smoking honey breath okay I'm just hitting it tastes like [ __ ] sugar that's what I'm saying like what the fight this should taste like sugar like I don't know something sweet sweet sweet sweet oh it's cool I've heard of these before though the Bloom cards this kid in my class he would always talk about it he got so high that off like one blinker he was like darling he could feel it as soon as he was hitting it and [ __ ] this one I don't know like I feel like you overhyped it I don't know if you were just excited or maybe I just got a fake one I don't know like I don't know what the situation is right now but because it doesn't taste like wax you know it tastes like sugar do you like I don't know how to explain it let me take another hey you know I'm tripping make sure you guys are smoking with me not this for you yeah that should taste sweet as food people like overall I don't really know how to feel about this I don't know if I got a rule one ever I would have got it from a dispensary I would have loved it pretty good card for like cheap you know but I got it from a plug so that makes it halis good just like so scared to sleep I just got it because it was 20 bucks and I was like dude like that kid was always talking about is a lip mac and B get it I'm asked for their opinions yeah they like yeah they like oh froley like keep smoking they don't like it I'll throw it away book that I'm trying to get what you could get from like smoking pesticides and [ __ ] probably [ __ ] bad you know probably overall just sketch about it because I got a funny play basically because you know what I mean I've never picked up from that play I don't know if it rings fake shit's not gonna wanted to get my reaction to be oh you guys all that Tennessee doesn't really see how much place we're presenting it whatever I'm over this review I don't like it was a waste 20 bucks and I saw it at the dispensary and probably get it though cuz you know I know that it's legit this though trash trash absolute trash anyways hope you guys enjoyed this little review in the next video peace", "0dGf5pK_PAA": "you know guys what is up we are back but we are in my car because I have to go to [ __ ] school on a Friday which is my second day which makes no sense because I started yesterday on a Thursday I don't know it's my 2nd year my final year of my trade school [ __ ] I don't know I'm excited to be done but the reason I'm doing this review right that voice crack I'm 12 uh the reason I'm doing this review is because this morning I broke my toe in the shower like a dumbass so that hurts like a [ __ ] and like I said I don't want to go to school cuz it's my second day on a Friday so [ __ ] that you know so today we're reviewing z skittles um I was gonna do like the whole gram challenge but I don't know I feel like that'll be a lot and I should wait till like 100 subs or something like that if that happens I'm whenever but maybe we'll do like a half gram challenge or something like that but this right here is a full spectrum distill it it's a full gram it's the same distributor the so like the dispensary doctor Rosa dispensary way out shits build Deer Valley and then it's not that far so the last one definitely [ __ ] my ass cheeks up so I think this one will to that select cart by the ways I have it in my pocket actually I really hope nobody drives by cuz this will be weird I'm just kind of out in the parking lot little Chipotle because I wanted to get Chipotle but I don't think I'll have time after this video unfortunately you guys always come first up the nice elect cart that shits got a little bit of wax but you know that that stuff does not ever get hit ever I don't know why but it says nom we were hitting battery juice before we didn't that stuff so this card is completely dead I threw it on the anodized battery because this one died and I had to charge it and I didn't want to wait so good as Carter went really fast I did feel like but you know it's a half gram and I'm a little [ __ ] so I probably complain a lot it so we're gonna just jump right into the review yuuji strobe I kind of looked at me a little bit anyway like I said for probably the 15 millionth time z skittles blah blah batch you don't need the badge number y'all don't want that crap let's go ahead and rip this bad boy open boom there she is mmm not even open yet there's still Ziploc thinking I was just smelling bag hold on mmm I don't know what that that smells like a very like fruity maybe of fruity cushion kind of taste yeah not bad I'm a I'm a fruity kind of guy you know what I mean let's do this anyway I can't twist off the battery today we're rockin lean doctor zodiacs razzle dazzle moon rock Barry battery to take this bag don't get people don't live they can't seat you if you don't move go ahead and pop off this sexy ass rubber cap shit's girthy rubber cap on this one oh no they parked over there oh no they're gonna come join my review surprise review guests the Civic driver we're gonna pop that cap back on this old cart here just because I like to have all my cards but the cash back on kind of works out that way here you guys go here's the oil I don't really have a white background per se I mean I kinda have to book this thing but it's the wax it moves it does move but not tremendously fast so that's good as it gets hotter obviously don't move quicker and quicker but you know no dang fades no PG no VG none that [ __ ] so we are chillin hard with this stuff and well without further ado wait it's important important hydration time boys go ahead and move up the throat here hydration drink of hydration drink of choice yeah hydration drink of choice is some Aquafina it's what they had at the circle-k it's on the way here [ __ ] I don't know okay anyway boys oh let me just say real quick this is for 18 to 21 years old depending on your state and adult smoking cannabis shits I can't make the rules I just got to tell you them you already know how it is if you're if you're still here let me know what you're smoking on in the chat the chat the comments the comments let me know in the comments huh otherwise I have nothing more to say except for that's a big-ass list a truck cheers guys oh [ __ ] that brings me that taste brings me back to like when I first started smoking didn't like carts like when I first started getting some real gas not from the dispensary but some real gas from a whole meet up that's ooh hell yeah that tastes real good guys I'm not gonna lie that gives me some good good good good flashbacks hydration break you know honestly out of all the carts I've had oh no we have another car dude I spilled water on my old bro this car out of all the other ones I think so far this is honestly like the smoothest hitting I mean it don't get me wrong this [ __ ] like hurts you know it hurts inside right but it feels good I don't know what else hurts inside usually there's so many people around here it's like everybody's just staring at me like I don't really mind I don't really care I just think it's weird then again there's only two people and they're like 100 feet away that way and then there's like one more person wait that way and they're like 300 feet away I know cheers let's do another one I hope you guys haven't been able to hear my a/c going probably coulda heard it more so in the Jesus Christ you probably conquered it more so in the beginning of the video I turned it down like a couple minutes ago you might have noticed a difference in white noise I hope not but maybe me bring it up you probably do notice it now a [ __ ] terrible person I'm sorry what kind of cars you guys in doing I'm just looking at like these cars around here so many kids at my school like have these lifted trucks bro I don't know I don't know where their parents get this money like I had to buy my own car I have to pay my own rent you know like these kids are showing up in like $35,000 lifted trucks and there's 17 I'm like what the [ __ ] you know I'm 18 driving a Mazda 3 hatchback shoutout to you if you like the hatchbacks you know I like to call her the panty-dropper the panties drop because they're so wet you know why they're so wet cuz me just kidding cuz my car just kidding it's not has this has not got me one car anyway I like this card a lot so far guys um I tried telling you to taste it's kind of like a fruity plunging almost taste it and you definitely taste a lot of cushion there as well it is honestly I don't know if I'd call it fruity actually it's it's got some taste in there of fruit but it's not like super strong it's more of like a pungent cush kind of taste over anything and I'm usually like a fan of fruity flavors I guess when it comes to courts but but this one is definitely a great contender for what I'm gonna top tasting karts I've ever had if you like that the less of the terpenes but more of like the cush the pungent like wax taste I guess if that's what you're looking for then what strain was this jungle last one was jungle juice this is the skittles I guess this is the one to go for it I don't know how closest this will be to like other ones you know obviously but if you're going to dr. roses and you want one that tastes just like I described go for Zee skittles for sure and like I said you do get that you get a free half gram select cart which was my last video if you haven't checked that one out go back and look at that for being a first move a first time patient there and then I think if you refer somebody you also get another half gram cart as well for free and then they get that first time one and then if they refer blah blah blah keeps going which is actually stupid cool I don't really know a lot of homies I have their medical cards but you know if I did I'd be getting a lot of select cards you know I'm saying say I say we take one more one more good one right and we call it there right is that three I think that'll be three I'm feeling pretty good I got still got school guys I can't be going like the last video all like inbred looking [ __ ] you know I was that should have me [ __ ] up you know like [ __ ] up but I kind of want to go to school like that cuz that'd be fun ah I don't know let's do one more for sure one more and we'll see how we're feeling we'll see cheers guys mmm yup there it is there she blows hydration break you know that one video I think it was the kind sweet cart speech one I had that really good um piece T the peach one I think it was peach or was mango one of those too but I'm pretty sure it was piece the piece team Pete that [ __ ] was so good bro I've never seen it at another establishment since then I saw a quick trip that one time they saw all the other three flavors of peace tea but not peach am I the only one in the world that likes peach or what I don't know what I got to do but I'll do it I don't know if I gotta slide him a 20 under the table and put that [ __ ] back on the shelves or if I got a light not gonna dance for somebody maybe you know it's not not up to my morals but that tea have teas worth a dancer till you know I'm saying but pretty I hear guys I'm I'm pretty hungry too Oh guys bro I just parked outside Chipotle when I say something that was why I party bro bro that's some great news since I just got some great news I'm gonna give you awesome green news we're gonna do number four might as well write Cheers oh no Jason brake [ __ ] send help I'm dying all right guys my conclusion with this cart for this quick little sesh this for hit sesh right before school right it's a [ __ ] Cenac or there's no other way to put it I'm on four hits and I'm I'm pretty high I'm I'm not like slow like to level right but [ __ ] I'm in like I don't even know what kind of hide this is well guys I'm gonna end the video there this will probably be up on Saturday so you know maybe maybe Friday maybe Friday depending what time or how school goes and [ __ ] hey there's a person a problem would be Saturday it'll probably set solo [ __ ] I just want to say thank you guys very much for watching let me put down this water I don't know why I'm in the water thank you guys so much for watching the supports been awesome let me know what other kind of reviews you guys want to see or if there's a certain length like strain of carts you want to see a certain brand just let me know uh if you guys do want to see like a whole gram or like a half gram cart challenge or me smoking with a home year whatever it is I got some homies at school I can smoke with two uh just let me know it would be super dope yeah that's all I got to say so make sure if you can you don't have to be super dope though like subscribe you know don't share that's weird you'll lose friends that way it just goes to like and subscribe you don't got to ring that Bell because nobody likes [ __ ] notifications anyway especially for YouTube anyway later guys I'll see you all in the next one deuces", "oC1aQnM1UIA": "a min of vaping health scare the new hope police chief announced a record seizure of illegal vaping cartridges that contained the active ingredient in marijuana the bust happened in [ __ ] Rapids but was announced in New Hope because the lead investigator on the case is a new hope officer that officer was part of the Northwest Metro drug task force which sees 75 thousand vaping cartridges that contain potent levels of THC many of the cartridges were marketed toward younger users with names on packages like fruity pebbles and strawberry shortcake authorities say using illegal THC cartridges can be very dangerous because the ingredients aren't always clear I want to urge all parents have conversations with your kids your loved ones anybody that you know that are using these cartridges stop using them get help go to treatment have conversations about the dangers these types of products are available for purchase in supplier states that have already passed law as legalizing recreational marijuana if you think this is a problem now wait until cannabis products become commercially available in Minnesota this is yet another example of why we should pause take our time before passing similar laws in the state currently there are more than 500 people in the US with serious lung injuries because of vaping and that number is expected to grow", "2fZK7ykAPBI": "yo yo sup guys back here for another video man it's a sort of rainy day today it's kind of cloudy hasn't rained yet but um I'm about to go to a dispensary called purple Lotus and I'm gonna buy a bara garden because my raw garden is pretty much empty if it even shows you it's pretty much empty so I'm gonna pick up a raw garden so then we can do a review of these new cars that I got up in Finn and I've been waiting to even try these I haven't even tried it yet it's called Ursa extracts Ursa extracts this is live resin I don't think it has any additives or anything so we're gonna test these out I'm gonna put the link to their Instagram and stuff down below check those guys out there kind of a new wax I've never even heard of them so we're gonna try them out and we're gonna compare them to the raw garden we're gonna see which one's better but we got to pick up some more raw garden because this shit's done sup so about to knock on my friends door and he's gonna pretty much take me so I'm waiting for him he doesn't want to be on camera so using probably not gonna be on camera this whole time sorry guys but how you doing bro all my friends dog dogs except for me as you can see we're gonna get out of here soon guys oh I'm still mad I'm mad about these versa extract the only thing I'm mad about versa extract and I want them to explain to me is how how is this a gram when it's 659 milligrams of THC and 2.3 milligrams of CBD that makes no sense it should be a thousand milligrams all together for 1 grand if I'm trippin tell me I'm trippin in the comments but I'm pretty sure it's a thousand [ __ ] milligrams this is almost like I have [ __ ] gram it's like a big-ass bubble it in [ __ ] but it's probably hella good we don't even know if it's good so I don't even know but no cars guys new cards so we're gonna see what it is I'll get back to you guys when I faith back in you guys already know [Music] [Music] we just pulled up about to walk in here probably won't bring the camera in because I don't think they'll let me record even though cookies let me record inside there I'm still not gonna bring it in just in case you know I don't want to be awkward as [ __ ] but we're gonna go in here bro didn't get as much as I thought I was gonna get but here's Nicki from me this looks like he got the Mendel punch golden gold sauce cartridge strawberry banana cartridge and then yogi berry let's check this [ __ ] out [ __ ] was how much was that [ __ ] BAM 177 53 after taxes for three carts oh four carts I mean sorry four cards one two three four and I only got two cars because I'm broke and because I already bought two other carts to raw garden mendel punch dough see about 120 125 up the tag [ __ ] taxes guys um it's gonna be like an hour and my card 17 minutes just to get back so that these were all garden carts then Nick he got some unique [ __ ] never tried these the Cresco tell me if you guys ever tried them if they're good in the comments you know if you try the cress goes and and you know if you tried the rolls I've never tried to roll I don't even know how to open this box man it looks confusing us [ __ ] probably not even confusing but probably get the taste those later maybe finish lets me get some eventually and then he got the raw garden half gram comes in a smaller box probably wait a little bit before we try this you know so happy to finally find a better spot to do it nothing out here because we're still at the dispensary but I'm popular with these girls we don't see what's poppin I figured out that all the men dough like all the ones that have punches you told me to they taste better I feel like so if you're looking for a good rock garden flavor to get it has punch in it or some kind of berry in it usually those ones are pretty good honestly compared to banana bread definitely good banana bread was cool though I ain't gonna diss banana so we out and we're gonna get it we don't get it Ian soon we just gotta find a good place to smoke man all right guys it took [ __ ] forever to get back here but we're back and it's kind of dark so I'm not even gonna go outside and smoke or are we gonna go so I don't know what do you want to do we gotta go outside can be smoking it so we're gonna try this real quick behold alright so we're gonna try out the banana OG first I don't know if I'm gonna try the next one yet but well I mean we're gonna try it another video so that's what it looks like it's focused [ __ ] persona raw garden pin now we got to get the Earth's opinion when is the Ursa pin coming first I tell me in the comments come on [Music] alright guys here goes I'm not gonna lie this [ __ ] is [ __ ] shits ding this shit's powerful it tastes like legit just straight wax was put in there you're taking a straight dab so I guess the live res like it has no distillate no nothing nothing at it cut it to it so it just tastes like straight dab it actually tastes pretty good it looks pretty good I don't know I like it but I could see if people don't like it because they don't like the taste and they're used to smoking like this Jewett's and all types of [ __ ] but if you're a person that's into [ __ ] taking straight dabs this will be the pin for you I feel like hold on I gotta get the raw garden stuff we got to try that we got it compared to the raw garden no one's better so far though I like the Ursa this shit's pretty dim did you like it what would you take [Music] you heard it you heard them that shit's [ __ ] powerful here you go bro oh yeah we got the Cresco [ __ ] we're gonna pair it to the crest go right now Cresco with a moon robbed that this [ __ ] just tastes like tea to me I swear to god this [ __ ] tastes like tea to me tastes good though it takes hella good yeah yeah but what would you saw here chillin just got done eating or eating and I'm just waiting for some people to hit me up chillin with my boy Nicky no it's just another day in the life of Shaka Zulu wait let me get y'all what y'all really want y'all want to look at the raw garden that's what y'all really here for I mean yeah Rob Carss I don't know I always just loved regarding that's the main when I go for it I know it's always been smacking like moon rocks failed me brass knuckle failed me a lot of cars fell me stiffy was good but I just didn't like I don't know yeah I don't know some rules every time I smokes dizzy my chest started hurting so yeah but they're consistent but um we're gonna try this one the mindo punch I don't know if you guys can see miss mindo punch [Music] press this two sides in and push up and looks like they did it right ether Springs on my [ __ ] [ __ ] oh I see yes the springs all right let me just take one more hit of this that Ursa Oh shit's good fighting online that's just good I like how the oh it tastes just cuz it tastes like straight wax I don't have my tripod that's why I'm doing this right now sorry see what he done bro neither did oh that [ __ ] is nice to be smoking in there sorry about the background noise dude I'm have to go with the car to be honest look beyond that why just cuz I like how it tastes like it's how the punishing I mean but I'm not gonna [ __ ] throw her and you know stood that the robber so I love mm I was like oh I gotta go because someone else hit me up and made me go to a movie or something baby I love you I don't know maybe this won't even make the video but [Music]", "bhdFatjgvhM": "[Music] good what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is a special type of video it is a delta 8 video and a plug and play video i figured i'd do some blinkers off of some delta 8 thc and also some delta 9 thc what we all know and love but in the in terms of delta 9 we're going to be talking about plug and play good old plug and play with that syndicate og shout out to plug and play once again and we are going to be hitting my delta 8 cartridge from delta 8 hemp you know i saved a good amount of this you know i made that video two weeks ago but i've been meaning to save this just because if that tolerance cross tolerance thing or whatever if tolerance from delta 9 doesn't carry over to delta 8 i definitely will be keeping this cartridge just to be hidden on some days you know what i'm saying but uh it is right here let's get a thumbnail um i don't know of the stuff and i'm not sure if i'm gonna be able to hit both at the same time but we are gonna make it work if not i'll just take the blinker out of both you know not at the same time but off both but yes we will be taking his of these this isn't the first time i'm smoking today but this is going to be the first time i'm smoking fat today so [ __ ] cheers all right we're gonna see if this light oh so honestly that kind of blended well together because this is piney this is lemony well this is lemony so honestly it just kind of mixed together to make like a very lemony piney hit but all all the pretty much enjoyable i'm not coughing that much the sensation of cough isn't as as prominent as it usually is which is crazy maybe the delta eight [ __ ] uh helps soothe it i don't know i've been told not to take blinkers off the delta eight but i've been told not to take blinkers off of any cartridge or pods so like what who knows you know the end of the day we're getting high off some good old delta nine and some good old delta eight and uh shout out to both companies for just being dope as you can see from that first blinker of both i'll probably be not doing that again maybe towards the end of this session video but uh yeah i just wanted to do like a lightweight sesh with both because delta eight's been i would say one of the more popular cannabinoids lately you know as of right now like people are talking about this i've seen it everywhere this is like when cbd came out you know you just cbd this cbd that i'm glad that i finally was able to try my own and uh before you just get into delta a do your research you know find if it's for you and if you're in illegal states where they don't have you know delta nine cannabis products uh yeah consider delta eight because it's really just a really good alternative for the people that are less fortunate to not have you know real or not real i wouldn't say real because this is real too but like you know legit cannabis uh legit delta nine cannabis products yeah let's take a blinker of this syndicate og cheers guys gotta settle down i know that there are some products that some delta eat products that are cannabis derived terpenes i definitely want to try one of those myself one day but the one i have is not i believe they're botanical terpenes pizza peach made a video just talking about some of that stuff but basically this is what it comes from like lemons and you know other fruits and stuff instead of just the cannabis strain but there are delta eight products that are cannabis derived terpenes and they probably taste like raw garden and this i'm saying this probably because i haven't tried one uh but in the future i definitely will try one gotta relax give me like two minutes i'll take a flickr off this and then uh we're probably gonna chill for the rest of the video and then towards the end take a break off both of them at the same time once again just to get send me off throughout the day you know so uh right now it's about 12 53 i still haven't eaten yet so i'm planning on getting super faded off this video you know kill two birds with one stone and uh then eat afterwards and then uh probably get some editing done with probably this video and uh yeah that's it hopefully you've been enjoying the content lately guys uh i've been working my butt off to provide you content at least five times a week and uh i hope you guys appreciate that and you know i do love this you know this passion here is not gonna end soon like not until i'm dead so uh i hope you do enjoy what i put out for you guys and you know subscribe to my homies as well uh mainly rj eats because you know he's the only one that's uploading i wouldn't say consistently but more frequently than stevie so but yes so support mommy you know i'm saying it it's dope seeing his numbers go up as well you know i want to get him to a thousand so you can get that monetization like that thing that you can enable and i this is just my like assumption i don't know if it's true or not but it's happened on my previous channels and uh like once i hit a thousand it like just consistently like exponentially went up uh on my second channel uh specifically and uh i think it's because youtube is just like oh this channel is monetized now so let's push it out more i don't know that's that's just me some weird [ __ ] but you know youtube is a business and a business needs to make money and if you ain't making them money you know saying why would they [ __ ] push your [ __ ] out right that makes sense from a business standpoint but i don't know if it's true or not but cheers oh yeah that's smooth [Music] i believe someone said that this was like harsh or whatever but it's actually not you know it just depends on how big of a hit you take i mean i took a blinker and it wasn't even harsh in any way you know um so i don't know i guess it's just different for everyone honestly it's been pretty smooth the experience when it comes to these uh delta eight products the disposable one and the cartridge but yeah man just a quick session with you guys i wanted to do more videos with the delta eight because i know a lot of people have been asking a lot of questions about it it's actually a hot topic on youtube right now so i figured you know let's make some more of these videos and sesh while we're at it but yeah just do your research with delta 8 i know there's a lot of good brands out there this one delta eight hemp and then we got uh three chai and then i believe rogue river from p2 peeps just do your research and find the one that's best for you and they're all pretty uh pretty well priced i would say you know so let me know if you've tried the new syndicate og i've been really really [ __ ] with it this is actually my second one right now i went through the other one pretty quick but uh yeah man syndicate og uh i do have a bubbler i can't handle the bubble but no you can't just do it she's gonna process it it's enough for this video like i'm already feeling it like i don't know what you do what happens when you mix delta eight and delta nine um i'm definitely feeling super faded right now this one's gonna be the end of all ends right here and uh yeah i just appreciate the [ __ ] out of you guys oh yeah [ __ ] play gaming [ __ ] soccer [ __ ] i'll be wearing it i'm not used to long socks so it's something i have to get used to but they're dope but yeah cheers guys see if i can do this again [Music] i'll do it oh oh i don't think i can do it [Music] but i will finish it off with the bubbler here i guess put the damn cap on all right this is gonna be the last hit of this session guys hopefully you enjoyed the video i'm [ __ ] dying from that i couldn't even finish that [ __ ] i'm sad cheers [Music] i just a clue", "vbaXWabINVE": "you too what is

subscribe", "CcqVbopKY2c": "you know I do ladies and gents we are back with another review you already know it's been a couple days since my last review I just wanted to say real quick that that's because I've had a lot of stuff going on at school some really important tests and stuff I usually have really important tests all throughout the year but this this specific course in my school kicking my ass it's really difficult but we're good through it we just finished today so I'm treating myself I'm treating you guys we got a new video it's about to be smack right before we jump into this video let's go ahead and throw it out there this channel is a adult smoking cannabis channel only it's for 18 to 21 and up depending on your state and how legal medical or recreational marijuana is I'm here in Arizona I have my own medical card everything I do on this channel is legal yeah so now that that's out of the way I guess we can get right into this so I'm completely sober right now I smoked a little bit this morning awesome an old cart that I had actually was a venom acts I was supposed to do a video for that but I just like I said school was just training me I was stressed I just couldn't do it but I the two cars that I showed in the last the strange Saturday which we're still debating if we want to do Sunday or not but the let's train Saturday I said I had two carts those were venom X's I think they were tangi I don't remember pineapple tangi or something like that I got i don't remember the strain but i threw out the boxes but they were supposed to be two different ones now it's going to review them and have two two videos two completely separate videos but since they were the same it would have been useless and only one video and like I said I just was stressed as [ __ ] so I just skipped out of it and didn't do a video but we are we're here with another video and I got to cut two videos coming up here so this one and then another one the cards were reviewing on these two videos are gonna be pure earth no I don't remember exactly I could be wrong but the first pure earth cart I did actually was one of them I beated viewed videos I think in their first or second which is actually insane so if this video can be even like 1/4 or 1/2 of that that would be dopes mad appreciation so the cart we're gonna review today though is the pure earth DJ short right there I don't know if you can see that there you go um uncut VAP cartridge is a half gram I won't lie to you guys these are probably my favorite boxes I've seen out of any descent cart they're just so [ __ ] elegant I don't know it's just it's super dope um I don't know if y'all are into video games or anything like that but there's this game called destiny - there's this raid at the boss by Calvin our model remember that narrates called but this [ __ ] color scheme anyway flashbacks if you play that game but yeah this box is clean and and just like the other one they're the same box got a little pull tab there I'm pure earth it you know somehow some rep saying this or whatever [ __ ] yeah you guys killed this box gorgeous box so on the back here says in infused with authentic cannabis terpenes no PG propylene glycol propylene glycol PG I don't know what that is or MCT I don't know what that is a proprietary pure atropine and cannabinoid profiles so that's what that says right there on the back right there then there's their website and then all their other information blah blah says requires pure earth battery for use this product has been tested for potency wow that's cool so that says that on the back right there and then read above that it says right here this little like black dark black line so the extremely potent cartridge use small draws until comfortable with the effects so that's super dope I'm excited this isn't my first pure earth like I said I do not remember at all what that one was what the strain was how it hit anything like that so if you guys want to know before you see this video go ahead and check it out you know check out my channel you know life subscribe do all that [ __ ] if you haven't of course but well let's go ahead and open this [ __ ] up I think you just pull okay there's a sticker right here the best thing to use lightning cables for if you have an iPhone is for cutting a little like [ __ ] piece of corners like that [ __ ] yeah cool boom and then not a tape no that's done boom she just slides on out there and it oh no I thought it locked um so it didn't fall out but it doesn't uh box [ __ ] hollow box it's a very sturdy box so that she you know you could take this [ __ ] and eat it and not really have to worry too much about breaking the cart which is which is really nice that's uh that's a good feature to have on carts let's do a little hydration break here guys drinking another pees tea Georgia Peach you already know yall already know so here's the Box simple box right there on the front it even says it says the this is an indica dominant so I didn't even say that this isn't in a kendama net strain it's like 8020 ad indica xx sativa but you know basically indica just oh that's nice so this is a little really soft foam packaging so it's gonna be even harder to break your carts in here if you drop or throw them in your backpack or whatever you got to do that was loud I apologize for that um yeah so here's the cart so this is pure earth there on the front super dope and then here on the back yeah well cuz I'm a terrible youtuber and everything like that it says the strain which is oh I drew that [ __ ] it says the strain which is DG a short and then it says that it is an eighty indica 20 sativa so it shows you like the breakdown which is super cool it's going to pop this cap off alright there we go there's the bottom authentic see so [ __ ] you know you already know here we got the dr. zodiacs Moonrock battery here I really want to get another one of those cards just to have the battery to be honest but those cards did smack as well we just charged this one up you already know how I am when it comes to hits on the cards I think a fully charged battery is always gonna hit hella harder that just makes a [ __ ] ton of sense to if you'll think about it I mean you know but if you guys like to you know use your batteries all day that's fine I do - I did - I burned through them then I charged them for the [ __ ] video so cuz I want to show you guys the potency I had its finest so let's do one more quick hydration break here without out of what what did I just say and with that out of the way let's go ahead and take our first draw up this DJ short nice it was cheesy shortcake doesn't say it's on the bus it says DJ short but anyway guys Cheers hopefully you guys are smokin medicating along with me let me know if you are now in the comments I'm always interested to see what you guys are smoking on guys well tooth Wow Wow that tastes man i that tastes exactly like like a strawberry shortcake that's that's part guys that is that is delicious man awesome let me show you the wax here kind of got a little piece of paper here so you can kind of see a contrast there super dope so that was I just realized like that was me probably shelling off the goddamn lakhs for like 30 seconds and I'm gonna tell you why because I'm already feeling this [ __ ] hard I was facing now I just face that [ __ ] showing you guys what I actually hydrate afraid but oh I hope you guys can't hear that noise I was watching Bohemian Rhapsody outside a little bit of a Bond movie if you guys haven't seen that Mia shut the door boo boo that door shut look at that Pro youtubers - the yellow shouldn't have heard that but you got it anyway nice um back to the part I'm a big fan of this part already I'm a big fan of all my cars to be honest but this one's flavor wise right on there probably not eight out of ten nine out of ten easily potency just not one hit man that's a it's like a four I'm already gonna for pretty good so [ __ ] let me just kind of regain my breath here like nothing like hitting anything all day so I'm a little Oh what are you doing eating yeah but just gotta get a couple hydration breaks video and you'll be chillin just fine so god I feel like I have to Kaufman try get it out there we go ladies and gentlemen we are gonna do number two guys truth yeah if you guys if you guys are a big fan of like strawberries or like short like case like Strawberry Shortcake's anything relative to strawberry this is your cart um I don't think I've ever really had any any cart or anything like that hmm that was like cherry pie or no like cherry cream or whatever they short um but for the first one that I've ever had like that pardon me it's hurting me deep but for the first one I've ever had nobilis I should like a shortcake or strawberry anything definitely definitely solid it's highly recommend to start just off the taste potency I'm feeling it for sure I'm feeling like really loose just chill just you know a good vibe just feeling myself I send it real weird I don't know I just feel like some popping out some good music after this hydration break just chillin y'all having a real x19 place me game that I do not know but let's do one more and then we'll call it there and I'll let you guys do something else with your life and not waste it you know I'm saying I feel like I'm gonna take a this is exactly how I felt the last day if I was gonna take a hit I'm gonna get some mad coughs man alright whatever whatever do one more quick hydration right like that's what's making me cough actually cuz it's just making it feel like weird but you know that's on me oh well choose god damn I told you guys told you guys I don't think I'm good oh I don't think that tastes he's gonna get old any time soon man that is a there's a solid night at least change the eight take the eight back [ __ ] that a it's a nine on your purse at least a nine on a good day maybe a nine point six you know you don't know we don't know but that is if for the review I hope you guys enjoyed if you guys are still here and still get stuck it through to the end I appreciate you guys very much like subscribe do whatever you got to do me a lot if not know I understand you habits yeah it's not for everybody but with that all said like I said I appreciate you guys all the support and love I'll see you guys in the next one deuces", "FBru-i5Xf5g": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel as well hello everybody welcome to a brand new podcast today again we got another cartridge of you but today we're gonna be doing something a little bit more different I've only tried this brand at least like once and it is the king pan brand honestly the reason why I really I wanted to make this I had to make this video like I have to make this video I have to show you guys exactly what I really think about these and the only issue that I have with these but other than that I think King pen is hella fire it's I guess it's one of the world's most awarded cannabis fate I mean I guess I could believe that because this [ __ ] is it's pretty far is it better than raw garden heavy hitters you know what it's on its own it's on its own level so today I got some Cali oh it's eighty-three percent THC checked it out and I got a Minuteman I mean the design of this is pretty sick you know I think it's pretty dope it's powered by loud pack if you got you guys to see that right there and it says right here a 1 3 second draw as I see while serving so like always everybody you know a 3 second drag that's gonna be equivalent to one hit and let's seize cartridges king pan cartridges are available in indica sativa and hybrid proud to be the most avoided cannabis bait in the world okay in the world but hey man you guys better be cool watch out cuz you know seven 10 laughs who knows how their cartridges are gonna be raw garden to a man everybody's trying to come on big fan of raw garden because everybody that I know that smokes cartridges and I'm talking about like you've wired from like different cities and stuff they're all going for those rock garden songs oh man you better watch out cuz you might not be the most awarded soon so bono so I've actually tried a couple of these before I do have another flavor King Louie Oh got some King Louie og but I wanted to save that for another video but shout out the packaging but let me just show you guys one thing because these are just again everybody I do not condone the usage of these products I do not promote the sales of these products and I don't sell anything on this channel or I don't push anything it's just an educational review it's for cannabis patients 18 and up you know people that are just wanting to look for a review so let's go right here oh so got myself a little half not too bad not too bad I do want to take this sticker off Rennie let me say [ __ ] it maybe take it off there's a little sticker right here sometimes the sticker kind of kills the color it doesn't get you like that full color if that makes sense you know kick off that sticker there you go slowly nice and slowly BAM oh okay look at this this looks kind of fired I do like the logo right there you guys see right there okay you guys see the logo and it's just some clear wax - and this is clear - like the liquid inside is so clear look at that look at that let's do a little test there you go it's not moving at all we got some sativa on our end so you know I'm trying to wake up but like just one thing I can't everybody I've talked about this in different videos don't get me wrong man these King pens are fired I like them to me they're kind of like equivalent to like a heavy hitter so cheers everybody let's try it out whoo that flare mmm that [ __ ] is so fiery literally just tastes like gum kind of like an orange that's like an orange e flavor and you can just tell us a tivo right off the bat honestly sometimes a lot of people could smoke a sativa and they feel like they took like a shot of coffee you're like a little cup of coffee which is kind of crazy to me it's the other way around I feel like sometimes I could be slumped but smoking sativa it kind of does kind of wake me up like mentally it's like a it's like a mental wake-up type thing you know the physical wake up I feel like I'm a little [ __ ] little tired just cuz I smoked it you know but here like hey I'm show you guys king pan BAM eighty three point zero three percent THC so oh well like how these hey the design is pretty cool you know it's kind of heavy notes made I'd like a little likes a little type of metal but one thing I really do like about the kingpin is that some other flavors are just like lose it they got they got a good taste you guys like I I completely like I approve of the taste the taste is pretty nice hmm oh yeah let me tell you guys one thing though and I know I feel like a lot of people are gonna be able to relate to this but let me know in the comments down below but check this out so if you guys see the very end of this so yeah I see the bottom of it right there like this bottom right here I feel like some some of the liquid stays right here you know it's it gets stuck right here and I feel like you don't 100% complete like you don't want a hundred percent like all over the juice doesn't go inside the you know like the little coils inside if that makes sense you know there's always like a little bit left over that's just stuck in there and that happened to me like two times already I bought two cuz back then I used to like the king I used I select heavy hitters brass knuckles and King pens those were like my two daughters before I even knew about like raw garden and all these other cartridges it was always it was mainly brass knuckles I don't really like the brass knuckles and the heavy hitters see here and there I came across a king pin but actually I think yeah cuz my first cartridge ever was a a brass knuckle it was some sv og I remember that I was the SF vog and it was the full gram and I remember when I first bought it I first bought my first pan I was so excited I was like bruh I'm gonna get so late sigh my room while watch a movie watch a show I'm like ooh it's gonna be sick and that's exactly what I did you know I freaking got my home chart I mean I spent without any somewhat charge but I thought it was in charge so I kind of charged it up you know put it in and I was just like oh dude I'll if I can get it can I can remember to lose and it was in the next room it was the next the next door room I switched rooms in my apartment but back there I was inside yeah this is a tea but I feel like I'm kind of like can look creative you know get a little bit like let's [ __ ] get this bag baby let's look in yes but I remember that's - I freaked I think I watched the epic movie you guys remember that movie those like dumb parody movies the epic loot it was like scary movie epic movie disaster movie [ __ ] love these those lows those stupid parody movies I think they're so funny they're so interesting cuz I'm late half the time but in reality they're they're [ __ ] shitty movies but I always thought they're hella interesting the one that I really like oh my god you guys should go check that one it's called Stan Helsing it's a parody of Van Helsing but that [ __ ] is just ash it's just so funny honestly damn I feel like one thing about the King pens is I feel like the airflow is really nice like there's a way too much now way too much air flow but the air flow is just like on [ __ ] point what's my name before I do remember it was like I forgot what 2014 what was one out like I was first introduced to a couple pens no yet no 2013 Oh 13 or 14 yeah I think it was 13 or 14 one of those years but it wasn't like a it wasn't like a cartridge like a wax cartridge you know like like like distally you know it wasn't stuff like that it wasn't like live resin - it was more like a little globe it was like these little globes and inside was like a little like a tab it was pretty much like you're taking a DAB and there was like a little piece like a little coil in the middle there's like a globe and inside it was like a little coil and it was like heat up so you don't have to put your dab on that stuff you'd have to put your down on that and then you would hold it and I should the coil would heat up and then that's when you take it out that's what I remember the first pens that's that's that's what I'm I'm you know like what the hell is okay to smoke out of a pin likewise and after that that happened and I made like a year or two after that that's when all these like distillate that's when all you got all these like wax cartridges all these like random cartridges coming out and they were fired you know I I came across like for sure a lot of real ones but I'm not gonna lie I didn't come across maybe here and there - three of them that were for sure fake and that's cuz again I've talked about this I say this in every single cartridge video if you guys if you guys are buying those fake-ass $20 cards to stop buying that [ __ ] man don't just just cuz you're you okay right now you're in your head you're part like all 20 bucks bro [ __ ] that I'm not gonna go buy a $35 half gram or a 55 or $60 a full gram at the club and I could be buying a full almost a full gram on 20 bucks just like you guys man you guys are smoking those deadly pesticides you guys are smoking that fake [ __ ] I don't care if you're like local drug dealer or whatever selling guys now man this is some fire that's just the real [ __ ] nah man [ __ ] that if he's selling that [ __ ] I got 20 bucks unless you personally know the person and you know that he's making it and you know exactly what's going on that [ __ ] don't trust that [ __ ] bro cuz if you're paying 20 bucks even 20 bucks for a half gram bro I don't think so no but hey sometimes you guys could get I mean I mean I'm not gonna lie something you guys could probably get like a nice little there's probably people out there that get some nice little plugs or you guys you get some real [ __ ] for really low shout-out to you but majority of the people out there hell nah man you guys copy nothing [ __ ] just save your money and just go buy yourself a [ __ ] full gram of like a heavy hitter you know raw garden you know like cuz I know a lot of people that just mind some fake [ __ ] say it and say this real [ __ ] but I don't [ __ ] I don't think so I don't know I would I wouldn't risk it because at the end of the day she guys's body you're not gonna feel the damages that don't see your body right now but you're gonna feel it like maybe 20 30 years down the road when you're like and then you're 50 60 s you're gonna be like tan mask [ __ ] I smoked all that fake [ __ ] this [ __ ] sprocket effect is 2-1 like 50 60 who knows hopefully now but [ __ ] that's what we're doing that that's why I'm doing this review you guys so [ __ ] makes you guys drop alike man drop a comment what you guys have favorite flavor if you guys have tried kingpin and if you guys are new hit that subscribe button click that bell so you guys can notified every time we upload but sure y'all want to take a hit like what's up I bought a when I first found out that there was fake cartridges out on the street that's why I kind of like completely I'm like [ __ ] that dude I'm not I'm stopping I'm not gonna buy off the street I did a couple times here in they're not gonna lie but this was like maybe like three years ago yeah this happened like maybe three almost four years ago I bought a [ __ ] cartridge it was a brass knuckles cartridge and I bought it for 30 bucks at 30 for a $30 full gram and I'm like okay this guy that I knew at the time on this guy probably bottom and bulk got him super [ __ ] cheap he's just adding another extra five you know another 5 10 bucks to the price to each cartridge so that's that's cool you know he's making a profit I smoked like maybe like one third of it in like the bottom of this she started getting black I'm like what the [ __ ] was it getting black I started getting black I'm like what the [ __ ] dude this [ __ ] is not normal she's starting it I like what the hell's inside this cartridge so I showed one of my other friends but if you like it's obvious I doing this is fake bro you're smoking like fake wax fake this to it you know you're smoking fake distill fake to steal like he's like nah bro just don't [ __ ] away so what I did I was like [ __ ] the [ __ ] grabbed it screwed it off I just did that [ __ ] away and from there I was like dude I can be something you can't be something that fakes you do I did know some [ __ ] one girl though I'm not gonna lie like she [ __ ] oh my god I'm just disgusting but I mean she wasn't disgusting what I'm saying like just she just had no idea one time like [ __ ] I met some girl that had a cartridge that was so [ __ ] dark so cheap you can tell the plastic was so cheap like I asked her I was like what you are this [ __ ] I bought it for my friend house like let the [ __ ] how much like it's like 20 bucks and I was like bro what though it was so dark she was smoking like black tar [ __ ] wax or some [ __ ] ha and I was like dude throw this [ __ ] away and she's like nah and I was like okay cool you know I wanna I want to like taste I'm not gonna inhale this [ __ ] so I took it here oh hell no my mouth too blew it out as [ __ ] tastes like plastic oh she pointed and she part finished it knowing her knowing that chicks you pod killed that [ __ ] she got laid off her ass how [ __ ] all these deadly pesticides all these like chemicals and [ __ ] I have no idea but I don't know I just don't think it's worth it honestly I think it's just it's best just to go to the your local club you know like just go to the local dispensary these brands I know it might not be like 100 percent safe but they're free share you're way better than the [ __ ] that people caught cop off the streets and I talked about this in almost every single cartridge video because it's just so important to not be smoking these book these nasty like chemicals because it's not it might not affect you right now but it's gonna affect you down the road so [ __ ] a lot of people say they leave comments down below saying that I need to take I need to hold in my heads for holidays but your lungs instantly absorb all the THC one day when the smoke goes in your lungs it like instantly [ __ ] absorbs all the THC you know so it's not like you have to keep it in there for it till I grab the most tasty you know but oh that's why usually I hit it I hate it make sure it goes all in the lungs and I just blow it out right away so I'm like yeah I got all the teasing I needed I don't need to keep that smoking my lungs I'm already I should that's about to be wow I'm lit can't even talk anyways everybody at your price cut it off right now makes you guys drop a like a comment subscribe if you guys are brand new and click that bell it's really important guys click that bell so you guys you know five every time we upload let me know in a comment down below if you guys did that give you guys a shout out cause everybody this is the kingpin uh-huh the Kelly oh and Kelly OH skitty I get everybody I do not condone the usage of these products I do not promote the cells of any brand anything like that and I do not sell anything of this channel this is literally just an educational review for Canada's patients 18 innit you already know", "LG2RiG88uGY": "yo what's up gfm guys today i got some of the this is by far the like one of my most favourite brands now this is definitely gonna hit probably I'm probably gonna have to give it the number one spot as of now until I find some better ship but here we go West Coast cure grape gas made with sauce says right there on the bottom below the grape gas but you guys can't really see it because the iPhone camera sucks dick so yeah it comes in this pretty neat packaging kinda reminds me of the plug-and-play packaging 35 bucks for a half gram and man I've been hearing this since yesterday and [ __ ] guys you guys are gonna be like damn I'm persuade you guys to want to go get this [ __ ] right now so that's the [ __ ] inside boom comes a little button a little button to [ __ ] a little button so you know kids can't get hold that [ __ ] kids get [ __ ] smoked nowadays I have my little [ __ ] cousin dude he grabs the he grabs vapes like and he's like he said I want to be a dragon so you're gonna get it it's gonna come in this little short round tip roundish tip it's out it's what's flat slash around in between both of them and it's all gold cure pin on the bottom west coast cure logo on top and then look at the oil man the oil is so beautiful so naturally golden honey like literally the most beautiful I've seen independent in a while so we're gonna hit this [ __ ] and imma let you guys know what I feel what I like about it what I don't like about it and all that all that good [ __ ] so cheers boys if you guys are 18 over 21 over let me know what the [ __ ] you guys are smoking whether it's [ __ ] bud wax cartridges boo fats [ __ ] hash or whatever it is let me know coming down below and cheers boys see how long you hold a shame for so alright so right off the bat let me tell you guys this this taste that I get from the sauce it's not your average like flavored filled plug-and-play but it's not your usual plug-and-play flavor you know heavy hitters brass knuckles et Cie all that [ __ ] that has a little bit a little bit of artificial flavoring none of that it's straight-up hardcore sauce dude you taste it it's just like taking a dab of sauce and that's a [ __ ] amazing ass taste if you guys are into the concentrate game and you guys you guys know what I'm talking about when I say that like it's literally the one of the best tasting flavors ever it's hard to describe you just have to taste it but yeah it's straight-up a DAB it's a straight-up dab in a pen the high it's really high like I [ __ ] you not if I take a blinker hit off of this and I'll hold an for maybe like I want to say five ten seconds if I could ten seconds is too much I can't hold that [ __ ] in for that long it's oh my chest starts [ __ ] hurting but if I one little one blinker five to ten seconds and then boom I'm [ __ ] Colin off my ass and that's why I like this product I mean yeah it is a little bit more on the expense expensive side sorry guys but it's worth it cuz if you think about it all right you drop you drop 25 to 30 on this cheap ass I'm the cartridge and then it takes you four or five hits to get faded and might as well just buy some [ __ ] like this you know I always told you guys be smart don't [ __ ] be a [ __ ] fiend and be like ah shine you get hot let me get whatever the [ __ ] could get my hands on you know try to be smart you guys like cuz there's a lotta there's no movement right now like shitty cartridge movement like I don't know if you guys if you guys go on instagram search that [ __ ] up you'll see people are throwing away exotic cards dank vape carts all that [ __ ] like let's get rid of all that [ __ ] man cuz I'm so sick of can seeing all that [ __ ] on the internet man it's horrible what you guys are smoking so if you guys can get your hands on this this is definitely worth it the high that I'm getting right now this is an indica by the way and the high that I'm getting right now I'm getting a really mellow high I'm relaxing my eyes are low I feel like I can still function you know like project because I just took one hit but I feel like I can still function if I take another hit and the high I've had it lasted me up to an hour hour and a half I have a really high tolerance guys so just keep that and keep that in mind and then all right so probably let's go into the pros and cons so pro is real quick the pros would be nice cartridge nice packaging the oil the [ __ ] quality of this [ __ ] is amazing the tip I don't actually don't mind it it's pretty clean it's probably one of the most convenient ones so those are the pros this the taste is amazing it's there you could taste the grape of like the natural grape of the flower that they used and it's all it's all there you know it's all there so let's go into the pecans real quick I've noticed this this [ __ ] sauce burns it does actually burn a little bit quicker than any other like what regular cartridge would like I got a girl the glue number four from these guys and then I smoked down this [ __ ] and then she lost it forever - I could take fat ass rips and it would go down slowly but this one like I've taken I'm like alive taking about between me and the people that I've shared it with maybe it's 20 hits so it's 20 hits and then boom that's not bad so I'd be my only con maybe a little bit more thicker oil super thick though it's actually super thick but you guys know that [ __ ] regular wax it's super thick to the point where you can leave it on the side for like thirty minutes and it'll barely move so well that would be my only content I was honestly I would write I would have to say my last con would be I want them self fulla grams cuz one thing I don't know if it's just in my [ __ ] head or what but half times I just feel like they go go faster you know like that you literally just go through them within two to three days and all half gram you have a full grant a full gram and then it lasts you well at least my cartridges lasted me a week I try to make a must a week at least and then yeah that's it on the pros and cons guys I'm pretty [ __ ] faded right now but I hit the gym you guys know the deal man I've been I've been like working my mind has been on so much [ __ ] man like I just want to talk to you guys for a second we're done with the review it's great go buy it if you can West Coast cures sauting you saw spins just came out this month so I'm one of the first people to review I know that for a fact so let just hit this [ __ ] one more time and get to the chat boys yeah so I just feel like man my mind my mind I'm I feel like I'm a workhorse in a way but sometimes I feel like I don't do enough like we sit like I don't know about you guys but I sit here and just think about like what could I be doing to better myself better better better the things around me you know [ __ ] so and then right now I just feel like I'm working hard but you guys you guys know that feeling where you're just like not in the place where you want to be and then to me right now I always end up in that situation but it's normal it's normal I want to tell you guys it's normal if you guys are working on something and if you guys are going for something that you guys want to do whether it's [ __ ] learning something new whether it's getting a job whether it's learning something in school you know just keep working at it at the end of the day you don't gain anything from stopping you don't gain anything from stopping so if you keep working eventually you're gonna get something if you really believe in yourself and you really work hard towards it it's it's unimaginable what we can do like there's some everyone in this world is the same yet do you see all these famous sports sports athletes and then all these [ __ ] actors [ __ ] singers and [ __ ] like that and obviously singers it's a little bit different I feel like with that you do have to be a little bit more like blast like talented like naturally talented all that [ __ ] but like when it comes to sports and [ __ ] like that this YouTube [ __ ] you know getting big like in anything I feel like as long as you work hard towards it like it's unimaginable man so that's kind of my mentality right now I'm working hard and then I feel like you know there's bumps in the road there's bumps in the road but I feel like there's bumps in the road no matter what road you take so he's got to get through it work hard and get over it whatever it is what it is guys so yeah just a little peace of mind for you guys if you guys enjoyed today's video I'm a [ __ ] nd right here make sure to go leave a like make sure to leave a comment subscribe we're about 500 subs remember guys if we [ __ ] hit 500 subs by the end of this month I mean either way when we hit 500 subs bomb hoping by the end of this month

taken care yourselves and each other out there Sheeran and chemo back on the channel here got another product to review for you today we've got a 510 threaded vape cartridge from sundial cannabis called lemon riot we got 0.5 grams sativa hybrid coming in at 791 milligrams THC one point five milligrams CBDs are gonna be hitting about 79 80 percent THC on this less than a percent CBD it's a heavy hitting THC vape cartridge from sundial tried this strain before in flower sundial product the lemon riot really enjoyed it purchased it a few times it's got a great taste a nice citrusy lemon taste flavor in the bud really looking forward to see how that translates to the cartridge here for some beeping you know what without further ado let's get this package open it's a little bit of a unique package I haven't seen one like this before um yeah it's okay I will let you know it was packaged in November 16th 2019 and like I said it's a 0.5 grams let's without further ado let's get it okay I'm really excited to try this guy I just want to rip it open so um we're gonna go to a so on the top here it says twist in a line and push up so we twist what are we twisting here yeah sometimes these things are not too clear okay there you go so we want to looks like we're aligning here Oh push the top oh look at that it's kind of crazy little pop so push the top off you got your cartridge in there just like that kind of neat let's take it out of here if we can yeah it's a little foam thing in there it's kind of neat like a little push pop so still some wasteful packaging right you know Canadian legal cannabis wasteful packaging but go to I mean it's kind of a neat package and I do like that you kind of have somewhere that you can put this afterwards if you in between cartridges so that's kind of cool so let's put that cool package over here and let's see what we got all right so here's your standard 510 threaded VAP cartridge oil looks you know not bad pretty clear not too bad looking for oil I've seen worse doesn't look too murky kind of moving a little bit in there when I move it that's good it's kind of what you want to see in your oil I think so for my experience this is a nice color you got the sundial branding on the one side and the other side you got your THC warning sticker along the bottom here says lemon riot and yellow let's take the little mouthpiece condom off and yeah we've got our most about the charger on our battery let's take it off standard battery here for a 510 threaded cartridge let's screw it on and there you go so looks like ready to rock so without any further ado and let's jump right in I'm really excited to try this out oh yeah you got that citrusy lemon flavor kind of a earthy kind of taste to it as well I was expecting to be hit over the head with just lemon citrusy flavor there's a bit there but it's got a little bit more of a an earthy flavor to it you know kind of hummus almost like kind of piney in a way yeah you definitely definitely kind of get those hints those notes of lemon citrus on the inhale and on the exhale you get sort of a earthy piney taste now this is a really nice balanced flavor to this I really like it but it's surprising I thought it was gonna be a little bit more like BAM you know hit me with that citrus lemony flavor but it is there a little subtle but it is a good taste I like the exhale flavor is a little bit earthy kind of piney good sort of a class of cannabis flavor going on with this um it's been about what 40 seconds since I took a drag I almost feel like again a little bit of effects going on here this is my first hit of the day haven't had anything before this I like to come into these reviews kind of fresh so uh first impressions packaging is pretty nice design I don't know no I'm not gonna give it any awards on design there's kind of a lot going on here you got the white top the yellow bottom you got the branding there it's not going on it's alright but for taste so far really enjoying it lemon citrusy piney earthy on you so it's really nice great flavor so we're gonna get this marinating here we're gonna check it out gonna hate this up throughout the day put it through its paces okay so for the last couple days just exclusively they've been using the Sunday lemon riot vape here I've got to say I like this thing hits you hard it lasts for a while and it comes on pretty quick it's it's good B it's about eighty percent THC so you know it's gonna hit hard but it lasts for a while it's gonna last you about one or two hours on set right away what you're gonna get is a nice daytime sativa high you know cerebral head kind of focused energetic happy overall gets through your day really good babe I like it recommended value wise you know these things run about fifty bucks seems to be about standard for a 5-10 credit card trade you get about they say 0.5 grams in there which is standard for these unfortunately we'd like to see something your tanks come out and some cheaper prices but what can we do right we're gonna get there for what it is though you get a good value like I said I've been reefing on this thing for two days oh three to five five second drags every time and you know we still got quite a bit of oil in the tank as you can see it's gonna last you for a while we're gonna get you through value eyes give it a thumbs up effects wise two thumbs up you know even the packaging I know I like to rip on the Canadian legal weed packaging I like this packaging you know it's got that pop top push pop you got a little container that you can put it back in here you want to switch cartridges back and forth is it a little wasteful a little much yes but I do like it what can I say I like their packaging this one so value effect is good values good effect is good taste flavor yeah this where you might be a little disappointed you're expecting a real citrusy lemon hit you over the head with flavor you're not going to get it that's what I was expecting as well - what you get is you know a little bit of lemon citrusy on the inhale on the exhale more of an earthy piney kind of flavor and that's definitely the more dominant flavor that's a tasty hit in the mouth afterwards I don't not like it it's not bad it's just not what I was expecting at all when I got when I went and got something named lemon right because I have had the flower before does have a really strong citrusy lemony taste to it didn't really fully come through on here but I gotta say I'm not disappointed with the taste that's there so overall everybody I'm gonna say definitely recommend a limit right sundial 510 0.5 sativa cannabis faith cartridge here for you that's the end of my review thumbs up recommended let me know what you think as always leave me a comment read them all reply to them all like to hear what you say have you got any questions comments concerns I like to hear what you think about it did you like it you don't like

not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel as well got milk rod art and vs. bar garden video once again you guys really enjoyed the first one and you guys know me man I'm [ __ ] I love raw garden man rock garden is like my top right now this brand rock garden is amazing but today I feel like we already reviewed this one the key lime honestly I to be honest with you guys to be honest with you guys I don't remember but this one thing oh [ __ ] gasps berries and cream and I'm kind of just sick try this one Oakland but you guys know man got the v-model got this the Ease battery out it's been a minute was good with the blinker you never had a blinker and this part has to be like my favorite shirt honestly but we got the key lime pie ladies and gentleman was good you know let's check it out ooh okay okay this one's looking nice and clear I want to compare some of the flavors because a lot of people say that this [ __ ] all just has the same taste and I'm like you know that I don't disagree with you but at the same time like there has to be like a little hint of flavor the gasps berries and cream I think this one's gonna be gasps so everybody always asked me how come I never hit blinkers and well you know what I got iron baby lungs and the reason why I keep myself the reason why I take such little hits and I don't hit blinkers and uh that's just because once I start hitting blinkers I've said it before my tolerance is gonna go up and then I'm out to start taking blinkers like all the time just to get kind of let you know and then just it's just not and that way you know every time I take little hits I'm always lit and I don't have to take off I hate to get lit you know I think this one is the guy's very soul oh [ __ ] okay I gotta restart that actually I'm ready to go oh this one oh this is a podcast I do not condone the usage of these products this is literally just an educational review you know just kick them back but all right I got you guys for shading this time shout out to the whole world shout out to everybody watching this video that what you guys wanted whoa I was only off by like two three seconds but I felt like that shows gonna blink and oh that one hurt gasps berries and cream at 81 percent THC the key line the key line is at a key lime is that 89 percent THC damn this was pretty much 90% maybe this is the one that I hit right now sheesh god damn yo I swear it let me know the comments down below if you guys are able to hit a legit raw garden blinker bro [ __ ] bro that [ __ ] is tough let's try the beam on Wow I can only imagine if I hit it on the B want dude I even hit that [ __ ] out of loli sensitivity - I got so Pete decide everybody the reason why alright so I don't really be smoking out crazy like how people think you know people think like I'm probably I'm probably stoned all day but now I'll probably only get lit you know when I'm recording a video or maybe like a nighttime you know when I'm doing my [ __ ] but I always had this like theory in my head where if I don't hit anything too hard or if I try not to get my turn it's like super super high up I'm gonna remain a lightweight when it comes to smoking but at the same time it's just like how do I see it like the amount of either like wax or like trees that I have to smoke to get lit is so little compared to like all my friends like I thought all my friends these guys are like everyone has like a really high tolerance and I feel like my tolerance is low just because you know I kind of take like controlled hits if that makes sense you know I'll tell I'll take enough for me to feel late if that makes sense I mean I'm still getting late I'm still taking [ __ ] hits you know but I don't be taking like big ass hits because that way you know my thoughts is just low and I'm getting late cuz I'll stop [ __ ] it bro oh my god I'm [ __ ] zooted right now whoo yeah yeah and I got you guys a in the next video get into the cartridge I'm gonna try another blinker you know until we finally got it for the video but hey you know I'm just trying to keep it real with you guys you know like [ __ ] that regarding who you know it's pretty little - I just recently just saw the 710 pods like I think that's literally gonna be like the next video I make right there just the 7/10 pause Allen ooh I didn't see it like til I was walking out the door like you know I was just walking I was just looking at the club I was just looking at the selection I was like on my way out what the [ __ ] I saw like you know the 7 10 11 spot it was like 75 bucks and I was like you know what this [ __ ] must be so far you know you know so especially with cartridges there anything else like I just be taking like the littlest baby hits I get it lit but it's just like my tolerance is just stays low you know so that's I wanted sometimes like like right now [ __ ] died right now holy [ __ ] let's shot both [ __ ] oh [ __ ] late I know you get that thumbnail going you know me yeah so stay tuned everybody for a seven-ten labs review cuz I'm for sure gonna cop to of those I don't first you're gonna do to 710 labs and one sitting [ __ ] am definitely gonna review those I'm gonna review a couple more studies to that keyline is just fired I think this is the key line hmm just like [ __ ] which is which vitas Aquila is the gas right here the gas berries and cream oh [ __ ] I heard both these flavors were like really popular but I can see why like gas berries and cream sad catchy name but the key line is just pretty much 90% THC almost all of them have like the same flavor would like a little extra policy look this one does look a little bit more yellowish than this one but they're both cleared I think I'm just tripping I'm [ __ ] tripping they're both the same color so this company and viral cleanse um hit me up right so they have like little like like mini AC filter machines where you can just put like you know connect it like for example you can put it in your living room you know your bathroom or like your bedroom for example for me I'm gonna put in my bedroom and you just connect it and you just like powered it up you power it up and it kind of just filters like everything you know it's either smaller if it's like an at your room just kind of smells like a nasty room that doesn't get opened you know like the what you guys don't open the windows I'm not saying you guys though but I'm saying you know there's people out there that don't open windows keep the doors closed and you know eventually the smell I starts to get kind of nasty so this machine right here right it's like a foot it's an air it's an air filter so once you turn it on it's like it starts it's suck it starts to suck I like especially if you're burning too if you're smoking you could literally like [ __ ] have them like you could have like a smoke get sucked in and just everything like you know your entire room is just [ __ ] filtered so I was just thinking I was like BAM and I've seen this [ __ ] on YouTube I've seen other youtubers have this um this air filter right there just smoking a joint whatever you know they have that [ __ ] on and I'm like bro once I get that [ __ ] I might have the role of enjoy I might have to test it out oh damn because if I dab it in my room just a little bit of it like the smell leaks a little bit just a little bit but I'm just like doing if I have this little [ __ ] this AC air filter machine chilling you know in my room and I'm smoking a joint I'm like Bravo see you know I'm just going back and forth with the company right and pretty much [Music] anyways I just like also what would you think about um doing with what the product right and I'm like you know what I'm just gonna do that I'm gonna smoke one of my products inside my house inside my room and I'm gonna just turn on the AC and I'm gonna make a video like a little vlog and we just smoke in the joint and seeing how good you know it sucks the air in and like the smoke and then you know my just wait then I'm gonna go out I'm a glob Tom my fam like a like does it stink or anything like that you know but it's not gonna stink because I know that [ __ ] I seen that machine it's really [ __ ] high quality it's like oh it's like almost like eight hundred dollars and I'm like damn they're hooking it up with one so well could stay tuned you guys cuz [ __ ] that be sick I'll be able to just smoke a little joint in here dad that's like that's okay and then I'll probably have like other like more people come through you know we could review the tree inside my house switch up the scenery you know cuz I got I got my green screen on all the time well you're not gonna I could do I could do other [

Moxie I think yeah Moxie and then I think there's like another one other than that I don't see the ones that you guys like be asking for them something like you know what I think once I start

smooth taste yeah this one's good the [ __ ] the gas berries and cream and then the key line was just [ __ ] just strong it sounds like a low-lying taste and it just packs a punch because it's pretty much 90% THC so that's my final verdict but hey everybody gasp a reason for you damn that's [ __ ] delicious", "tn6ZpYK-L8M": "guys what's going on it's your boy cam and we are back with another

contempo specialty packaging episode 4 of the 12 episode saga talking about bakes and carts today Dan in particular wants to be on this show we're about to bring Nick on the show dan was like I got a lot to say here so we got a bunch of options we want to show you some creative options Dan anything before we kick this off let's jump right into it I love it alright and good so take it away okay original a sliding box kit you've seen that at the trade shows some people go up to make the traitors like I would never use that that is so different from my branding yes we customized things it's not for you it's all about what you're about this is another one that is very popular it's our that was one of our first products that people really fell in love with they're like wow I see how this is different I see how this is better that's out there it's a nice texture paper on the bottom and a soft touch paper with a black hot stamp on the top all right they're board insert in this one let's keep it let's keep it rolling rapid fire because we get a lot to go through this is a less expensive option it's our blister fold or I don't have one that's open but this is one long piece and the blister pops in and you fold it tapes together and you can customize it any way you want we can use all of our foils spot UV any kind of coloration you want or a nice textured paper if you want to go that route less expensive way that you could still make very customizable and look great so it's going to say is you have adhesive on that so you don't need any heat sealing equipment and that's something that a lot of people have liked about that concept all right customizable blisters is another two piece box it just has a nice angle to it so it has the colorful feel there and inside we have an Eevee a foam insert which is a dense foam it's a soft touch of varnish on it as well that's just a wood pattern that we printed it still has that you know luxe natural look folding box but it's on a foil printed on foil board so it has a nice shimmer to it a little more bling a lot of people they're looking at the cosmetic market as what their cannabis brands are about and I think it's good but I want to make a point that I think people should still because a lot of people are thinking that way make sure you still maintain your unique angle so don't go cookie cutter try to think of how you're going to be separate from other people who are thinking in this cosmetic mindset a lot of people are using the vault box for their cartridges this one doesn't have an insert the vault box exclusive to contempo specialty packaging yes patent pending patent pending child resistant certified trademark trademark the two began which we shown in our pre-roll show pr\u00e9val show but also another option so the dates this is a non contempo product but we want to show it because it looks great we have a pattern on the outside which matches the products on the inside I think that would be awesome with the disposable pen where you match the pattern on the pen custom pen match the pattern to the box like the Kate Spade pen so sometimes you can get inspired from other industries and do the same thing and get the same advantages that those people did but this is another paper product through peaceful signing box the feedback has been and I quote outstanding on that box and the texture in the field this is not a contempo product but we think it looks really nice it's a textured paper on the bottom on the top and it's a very simple on folding box good job it's not super sturdy but it still looks really nice and they have a folding board insert inside really cool of that contrasting look so you can have you know one look where everything's really uniform everything's really clean or you can have really nice contrasting you can see the color contrast the craft versus the board and then you can see the embossing contrast that they've done here really really cool look and again they've done it well so you can go with either of those and I think they've done a nice job on that and the reveal of this icon as you open it is also a really nice touch yeah so bloom farms has outstanding branding outstanding packaging this is a good example of how you can make something as simple as a folding box and still be able to charge a premium price for it and compete in that premium market so this is a $70 product here so this is a reusable vape pen along with the charger so again really good job here and using some nice craft board materials dressing it up a bit with your branding the branding does in fact match the pen that was included in the Box done a good job I think of also matching this story that they're telling like we talked about the Instagram feeds the social media campaign that the provide they live and really having that match up with the packaging of the story they're telling in the stores good company good things and just a couple of different options that you can use to put the actual product in this is a vac form in here which is molded plastic that we would mold specifically around your product for a perfect fit and this is a board insert much like that Bloomfield box the board just folds in to create the cavity and then of course we have the EBA foam these are not see our boxes nor was the bloom farmer one so it states that demand CR on the primary packaging that's not going to work in many states the exit bag is still sufficient until a certain point in time that's been marked so just keep that in mind that we're well aware of all the CR laws and we're showing you options because it's currently available and once the primary packaging is required to be CR probably won't be seeing these things from us but the wallbox is still a perfect option solves all the problems all the world's problems are next looking sharp in that suit you're coming on the next episode of hope you know that oh yeah of course all right good all right anything else you guys want to add live studio audience Manny you gotta need to say guys thanks for watching see on the next episode", "-n9Dq0Fggbs": "all right good evening everybody Saturday night I just got back from the dispensary in the grocery store and I got this evolved tea for trainwreck with a total cannabinoid content of 97.5% which is a new high and this says it's got ninety three point seven nine and get out of the video here ninety three point seven nine percent THC one point three six percent CVG and one point two two percent CBC I have no idea what CVG or CBC is I've heard that there's hundreds of different types of cannabinoids out there and yeah each strain does something different to your brain so you know experiment talk to the folks at your dispensary if you live in a state that is legalized but yeah I'm going to try this tea for trainwreck here for the first time and as a bonus while I'm at it I am in the process of doing a little cooking here waiting for this water boil just said wash boils I got my ganja butter over here see Annie wants to be in the video say hi to everybody on YouTube and what do you have on your face you've been getting in the chocolate or something you got something on your face go clean up your face okay it's pretty pretty dark pretty dark extract in there it's usually with the more pure the more translucent it is but if it says 97% like I live in Oregon they test this [ __ ] like very carefully and from what I've experienced here in my state I can't speaker and others where testing may be different but the numbers are usually pretty reliable so take a quick hit here and it's pretty darn good I like the I like the taste of it here it's giving you a shot of this t4 train wreck and all right let's do our cooking segment here we have some king crab legs these monsters they're spiny actually you got to be careful picking these things up yeah so we're gonna take them over here and the water is pretty much boiling good enough these are already cooked and frozen anyway so really you just want to want to warm them up we throw them in gonna fit in the pot Wow this vicious bastards getting his revenge around there you just stabbed me one all right well I'll just let make sure that when we dump it back out we hit it with some hot water maybe dump some hot water real quick [Music] get some steam meanwhile we're gonna take ganja butter here this is about like like two tablespoons of ganja butter put that on the stove you don't want to put too much heat on your ganja butter you know those guys are looking like they're trying to kill me take a look at our spice assortment here throw just a little splash of cream sherry on there it's some extra virgin olive oil garlic powder a little bit of pink Himalayan sea salt a little bit black pepper and we're gonna finish off with some dill just like our butter is sufficiently melted so we're gonna throw and just move it olive oil here cooking sherry garlic powder little sprinkling you know what I'm seasoning I really play it you know a little bit of this a little bit of that and it's 40 [ __ ] years old you know all that you know I have sea salt grind or going here too quick little grinds of the sea salt you know that's getting a little too hot we're gonna take it off you don't want to burn it and we're gonna finish it off just a little bit of dill weed yes a little yeah swish that around although at all and that is exactly what you want Sherri's to cook off just a little bit it's really savory you know I don't mess around I get to I get to organic there we go just just a splash that's the thing you know when you're working with seafood and ganja butter you definitely don't want to overcook and you know it's better to under cook and send it back again this is this is precooked anyway they cook it before they freeze it on the boat or whatever so yeah now we're gonna get that out of there sometimes you gotta improvise in the field you know again we just want to steam in for a few minutes we don't want to hurt him we just want want to get it nice and warm speaking of nice and warm we got over our ganja butter dipping sauce over here we're gonna we're gonna pour it in this bowl you got ready here after dinner tonight right I just finished myself off and knock myself out it'll probably take me a piece of bread and dab out all the all the goodies in the bottom of this pan here sliced lemons we got our dip king crab legs up here just once again let's let's get a shot of this and then I can nificent the Beast [Music] that's what it's all about folks that's some cute crab legs thanks for watching everybody and have a good weekend and Happy Thanksgiving", "WGYLG9X81pY": "this channel is strictly for viewers ages 18 and over I do not user promote the sale of illegal drugs or harmful substances this video was recorded in California a legal recreational state under the laws of Prop 64 now sit back and enjoy the video what's good YouTube it's your boy savvy ji back at it with another fire video for you so first of all I'd like to thank all this recent supporters I've been getting lately man if you're new here man go ahead and smash that subscribe button right now man what are you doing that we produce some of the most fired content out right now and nothing less man nothing less so getting straight into it man getting straight into you know we don't like wasting no time out here man so for today's video man I got some of the craziest cartridges I've ever seen bro some of the craziest cartridge like the most eye appealing cartridges that you guys have ever seen I have ever seen anybody has ever seen man these cartridges are honestly like just by the eye appeal like I hope I hope I hope they're freaking good man I hope they're freaking good so for today's video guys we are going to be reviewing the hollow tips cartridges man this company is based out of California you guys can see right there man look look at this what did I tell you guys man this cartridge is crazy just look at the I appeal to it man like you doesn't don't tell me that doesn't make you want to smoke it right away man it looks like a bullet the distillate is super super clear and man look at it alright so right here we got the point 38 special which is a hybrid of full gram and right here we got the ak-47 hybrid all right so aside from the cartridges though I also have the matching batteries if you guys don't remember I did do I do do a review on one of these countries a long time ago so I have this old battery that they used to they used to sell but this is their new and improved battery I'm not sure if it's any different from this but it looks kind of the same but different packaging so let's go ahead and test these two out for you guys and I kind of want to show you guys the batteries just in case you guys do want to go in and cop one of these cartridges and you end up getting the battery so once you open it up you're gonna see open here right here I believe this is going to be the charger and the little magnetic pin connector and then nothing nothing too much in there and then right here itself is the nice-ass battery itself man it's all gold got the holotapes logo right there in the back and it got the hollow tips name right there engraved in the front man I'm telling you bro like if people see you oh and they got their their logo right there on top I don't even see them and I don't think this one has this one yeah you see this one does not have the logo right there on the top so that's that's something new that they added so and but yeah for the most part they do look like they're similar so like I said man these cartridges if someone sees you out in public your men are here with your homie smoking about yo what is that man like this thing is so I appealing man it catches your attention right away man so I'm gonna go ahead and smack both of these cartridges on there and I'll cut you guys in a little second but right here we got the point 38 special men and this right here you guys can see this little cap right here this is a collectible magnet that yes kink like you know I know there's a lot of people out there that buy cartridges of the same company and they're you know it's always cool collecting something it's always cool connecting something so like I said man the little metal connector you are gonna connect it right here at the bottom and show you guys just that twist on and I'll tell you do this thing but I just want to hit it bro I just want to hit it I just want to hit it because this thing is just like catching my eye man I can't stop looking at it so full gram politest point 38 special we're gonna do both of them in one video and then we're probably not to take some [ __ ] double hits for you guys man so Cheers if you guys are over the age of 18 and 21 you are any other deal holy [ __ ] whoa dude yo that was [ __ ] tasty holy dude like you're literally as soon as the first hit man that first hit that first initial hit you get all of the terpenes event all of the terms and then you know that super super leichter penis that you get from plants that are super [ __ ] fire hey guys so after that first hit man this thing had me coughing and honestly like all right initial thoughts initial thoughts I haven't had I didn't really remember what the taste was like but this thing is so flavorful man I'm talking about as soon as you take the first hit that exhale you taste all the Terps all the freakin cannabis like literally everything there's no fruity flavors no artificial [ __ ] this tastes honestly like some pretty freakin clean distally like I'm not even gonna lie that first hit got me already to like you could feel it instantly the head change happen instantly man it might be just cuz I haven't smoked today but honestly you guys know me I'm a heavy hitter so for it to be hitting that hard it has to say something so this is the point 38 special let me go ahead and take another hit of this and tell you guys what the flavor notes are of it on the inhale you get like the really really it's not fruity but it's kind of like on the sweeter side of the terpenes it's not like very very OD ish but on the exhale on this thing has me coughing guys on the exhale it tastes a very very smooth like if you're kind of like if you're hitting um a joint and you guys know when you hit a joint but you can at the at the exhale at the end you can kind of taste like your little small notes of the weed that's kind of what this is providing with you guys so when you and the inhale you get the terpenes and on the exhale you get those those notes of the freaking strain man I've never I'm never myself had the point 38 special and I kind of want to try that in but form because if it tastes it as good as this man we're in for a treat goes so moving on to number two right here we got the ak-47 this one right here is the one that I kind of wanted to try man because like ak-47 like that doesn't that kind of scare you a little bit man like what kind of they they have some pretty unique names man shoutout to hollow tips so like I said man right here we got another magnetic tip just throw that to the side if you want to collect it and then right here same thing you're gonna have to add the adapter luckily for you guys you know hollow tips to make sure it's a pride you guys with too because I know there's a lot of battery companies out there that only ever provide you with one ring so if you ever lose like oh I see you guys these things right here I cannot tell you how many I freaking lost already I've lost literally almost every single one that I've ever had to battery so for them to be able to provide to with you is kind of that a little come up man a little come up so like I said go ahead and screw this sucker on and as you guys know you guys a little design on this man because this is honestly one of the sickest cartridges I've ever seen so as you guys can see right there I this kinda reminds me of like a little Fendi logo I don't know if you guys can see that but inside of the cartridge next to the distillate it looks kind of like a Fanny logo by notes they're hollow tips logo and as you can see right here on the bottom they have hollow tips engrave they got the California weed sticker make sure they're compliant with everything y'all ready though lab clean tested all that good stuff man so let's go ahead and some this on the battery and take some rips man cheers guys oh I didn't even think I was getting ahead I didn't see the light or not fool my gosh one second oh my gosh that was gonna make me cough horrendously if I didn't catch myself well quick written because like literally oh my gosh about oh my gosh that hit that three second hit literally was so much freaking vapor and I it would it just filled up my lie my lungs right away man you felt the lung expansion you felt the turps you felt every single aspect of this penny just filled your freaking lungs up or at least my lungs up you know I'm over here talking for both of us but yeah man I think if I'm not mistaken their cartridges have like a special special element right here in the tip that's supposed to create a larger air flow and create milkier hits pretty much so that could be why we got some pretty good hits me where we've been getting some pretty good hits office all right like I said this is the ak-47 let me see if I can get some more hint to that because our see for me it was just more like kind of like a just straight up OG if Ike if I can tell you guys the truth yes sir damn like literally every single hit that I've taken meant is straight lung expansion guys and I'm not even joking like dramatically like after those four hits that I just took I am blown right now I am pretty freakin faded i feel the major head change already and i'm just chillin at this point i'm just chillin at this point right because these are the craziest card shoes I've ever tried man hold on I'm a hit on both that you guys see if we get some point 3d and ak-47 special man so I don't know what kind of bullets does an ak-47 take just a point thirty there is pazatto point 38 special like a like a bullet or is it a gun I don't know but let's go ahead and hit both of you guys some of the craziest cartridges that I have ever smoked in a while now I can't remember the last time that I've been so attracted to a cartridge like this so right here guys I'm gonna take two different hits man choose guys I apologize for that son and stop I know I'm probably gonna have to cut that out here's me brother what the heck it was so what happened after he caught me cuz I coughed I died literally I it took me literally two or three minutes right now to recuperate myself and get get back into the video I'm not gonna lie I am baked as balls right now these pens those two hits I just took right now to where the icing on top of the cake works this thing tastes so phenomenal like I'm talking about so phenomenal I have not had some cartridges this good in a minute man and it's good to see you know a fellow California company just coming up like this and man like I said man I'm gonna be putting all their information down in the description below if you guys want to check them out man if you're over the age of 18 and 21 you guys have to be legal you already know we don't promote that stuff out here so overall thoughts on me on these pens man I love them I love I'm like I say I love them sorry sorry strong choice of words guys I like them I like them honestly I have no complaint about it I have as of now I have no complaint like the initial thoughts I have no complaints about it I appreciate the aesthetic look that they give you I appreciate like the full grams the really the taste man that taste the taste is phenomenal the taste is phenomenal I'm not even a cat like I haven't tasted something like this I think the last time I tasted something like this was like me the first time I ever tried raw garden maybe the first time I ever tried our garden this [ __ ] blew me away in our sea for someone to be doing this with dissolute it's kind of mind-boggling man it's crazy how good distal is getting I know a lot of people aren't fans of distillate now that's 2020 you know there's so many other sauce and diamonds and blah blah blah but remember distillate it's it has its own purpose it has its own category for a reason man and they lived like hollow tips you guys are dominating the [ __ ] man I appreciate you guys um producing this very very well high quality product man so we're gonna take another hit though want to take another hit for that one time for the one time for you guys I am baked as heck though and I'm gonna end it out here man like I said the flavor for this it's not to overpower with like fake terpenes or it doesn't even taste fake at all it tastes very very artificial very real very tasty man like oh jeez like at least the at least the point 38 special was a very very og and then that a k47 also was a little bit more like it's a weird combination between like an OG like a I don't know what I want to say like an OG and kind of like a just some more earthy flavor you feel me so man I'm big like I said guys overall high quality product 10 out of 10 man let's go ahead and take this rip for you guys the crazies cartridges that I've ever tried Cheers aren't you just get me every single time oh those double hits are finito you take a double hit you're out man so just like I'm gonna be out right now so I'm adding out the video here if you guys enjoyed the damn video go ahead and leave a like comment and subscribe it I won't

California so what are you most excited about well today well actually if you guys watch any of our past videos you guys know I'm all about the canvas terms so today I'm really excited to try something new something I never tried guys and that is this guy right here this is some friendly farms guys I have never tried actual live resin full-spectrum live rather than in a pen this is no discipline this is just 100% live residents tucked in this pen that you don't add any extra turkeys with nothing guys nothing so this is going to be I think 68 percent THC yes it does you know it is somewhat low but you guys remember it's not his lip this has a full spectrum high so you know this high is gonna feel and be a lot different than any high you're gonna get a pen so waiting but I'm really excited just the first time I've heard of a pen this way I've always heard where you get your distillate you add your terpenes and then maybe once in a while other companies toss them the other things might be talking about that later but I'm just excited to be honest I'm a little curious about how it's gonna taste since they didn't have the trick things back in there but nevertheless let's get to it yeah that's good to it alright get over it I'm gonna try so as you know all these to be pens are supposed to be childproof tamper proof people true that sticker on it with a sticker Sarah oh yeah guys so we're trying this trade but its flavor I guess you could say it's called Chewbacca Chewbacca sure I don't know you guys can you guys can you put up that heavy suit you guys think it is but it's a hybrid and it's looking pretty good honestly oh also what is special about this mean this is a collab right with easioyya these farm stuff I think it's gonna be cool out stuff I do have stuff that the feds just took the straight line that's just from other farms and stuff like that so yeah we'll take a look at this one right now you know and I will plug you know close to three guys as always suggest and see how dark this stuff is and when I say dark I don't mean like bad door can I just mean it's big it's not it's not desolate rise it in take all you know the camp going turkey new tripping out of there and take all the bats what is and you know this is it guys this is your lever isn't just straight stuff doing then I am so excited right now of course we got our battery from the court officials perfect for this a 5-10 thread leaves ok so just making sure okay so we're at three point four guys and I think I'm gonna keep it back to repent for usually I'll go to point eight but since this is not dis lit and this does have like you know more of that's enough plant matter in it I I do want to burn out a higher temperature so if it doesn't taste like you know all that goes up into a point in yeah [Music] I've also heard before people say that they always wanted on a lower battery setting or so you can might taste the turkeys better and so this doesn't have champions that definitely makes sense yes yeah yeah yeah I like that it is so totally different at the lane that like that taste is like so natural wax doesn't say it smells kind of like the smell of like a for your job or like a bird but yeah that's awesome awesome awesome I could smoke on that all day long that's like up there with raw cardoons flavor honestly even though Gardens like almost taste like something that's not quite hitting that that's you know 100% locked and add flavor but it's the closest thing in the market right now and tell me right now until right now alright I don't think this you know actually does take precedence in flavors over anything I've ever tasted I mean it makes sense it's not you're not tampering yeah yeah it does remind me a little bit broader is I will say that I like the Terps yeah the terms relate to motors in this rail there no no no Rihanna trips because there's Turks nothing oh okay I'm sorry that's my bad it's just it that's crazy that's that's nuts so I'm going away so I don't know if you were to write this you know oh yeah one to tattoo the same all right guys so late personally I'm a bit I need to see you know raiding stuff like that just like total enjoyability and smoke and like just the way it made me feel the way that hey like actually went in like when I held it I guess it's like maybe it's just the distillate you know that like makes my nose like I like her a little bit like you feel it is - no not at all not one bit so I said that I'd be like perfect Penn High like I just feel like you should he give something in 10 just because looks like a hundred percent the best of the best but like I'll give it a nine point seven I mean like the flavor is ridiculous hi I will take that anger or anything else stick back flavor is just not late and then also you know feel like you know years old again you know or closest to a nice know or something you know I don't like that straight in your face I you think when you think of full spectrum highlight what do you think of like that body high like where it's like you for it and it washes over you or like I feel yeah it's more relaxing it's more calming it's more like a wave you know what I'm saying it's more of like it's you and then like a colic you ride it out you know what I'm saying whereas those wax and I feel like can you smoke it you know what I'm saying and then you get high for about 30 45 minutes and it really okay and then like you just boom I don't know yes there I just feel like you just you know you'll have a lot more enjoyable time with that miswak and I'm excited to take a date and literally just smoke this and just see how I feel like we actually got this from place box and then you were nice enough to include a DAB cap so make sure you guys check them out this dab cap will literally turn like almost any one of your vape pens like into a hittable like okay well actually we have figured that some bakers are more are better than others of lechery actually look at the tip of this this is let's hit similar to the tip that rock artists on it these tips will go really well fit the nasty sound so why not getting show [Music] [Music] so I just need to have my wits about me or I'm not gonna do this video so all right so no I think it's your turn to pick I know you're coughing dying right now just point and we got it for you I'm really excited to try this one I definitely can't wait to hear her opinions but yeah I think sighs this to me is just like you know on time coming I just I've heard a lot about them but I've never actually sat down and over the package of platinum bait and I just looking so you know it's a great price point fifty dollars for one gram that's [Music] that's pretty good a and honestly is right now I got from the farm sixty two dollars at for a half is a half way like I just said this my number one pen right now it's just beats it I'll be hard-pressed okay let me see if I can always struggle with the fast ones I do like the design those boxes no chopper just tells me I just taped over the chocolate you know and then [Applause] yeah they still put the they said with a little less of things on the I like that I especially like the talk please like if I put my all right I want to see you take the fattest rib out of that piece all right now see what flavor do we got white buffalo interesting have you ever heard it's gonna say I really like this packaging because there's the state of California in it I think that's pretty California and all right what do you think flavor-wise white buffalo I don't know what it tastes like but like like like a peach orange a little harsh which is crazy because you would think that yellow slime present would be streaming I get news okay you got this all right real quick rating Platinum v what do you think all right well as you guys can see it's it was a little harsh definitely $50 you know it's still it's great you know already but I don't know the flavor was definitely like reminiscing yeah of orange and if you had a baby I don't know if a white buffalo taste like that I wouldn't imagine but you know so I can't really speak on like what the flavor like you resembles but like did taste it yet he's good but it didn't taste like so so so yeah so yeah so these guys I'm actually kind of excited to try these guys kids these trying to think that via song they have you know cannabis terpenes cannabis oil you know Italy Italy also had some secret ball taxes yeah with like like a turkey I think yeah this is definitely a weird design guys and just like look at this right now there's like a little like swirl in the center of it which is kind of weird I beautiful is that and then there's also you know I mean this thing it's just one of the ones like right like the other side look at the comparison I'm already like really big so yeah okay sorry just be like all right all right enough talk about it this is Bubba a ping guys she's a bad beginning but I know sorry I'm okay go for it I'll tell you what everyone what I think it's definitely interesting when they see like floor equipment and cool I do get that little like maybe perfumey taste just a little bit and remind me a little bit of cheesy just a little bit like the taste so it's just I don't know go back and is business sweet if this is the kind of speech it's like really light though like it makes a good vapor it seems like you know you're like you're like there's like oh my god there's like an insane amount of like space like in this closed like it's closing [Music] it's not like I can't is maybe I'm just like I don't know I know it's just it's just not my favorite like this one TC if I don't be it and video tasted a little bit better later not like a little bit better definitely a lot bit better I think than that one but I'm still loving the friendly friends right now okay so well I I don't like everything I don't like a sugary taste too much so like that was like a light that's almost like a lemon is just a tight yeah really right so I was gonna do one but personally I wanted to be that wasn't taste in the campus but you have this week I believe this I can think [Music] like I love candy and so I think that's why I like containing our yeah that's that's why okay what we stopped to mourn we still got some competitors here you guys alright what's up next I don't I think I'm excited I kind of let me say about this one absolute extracts it's called dawn water oh gee so definitely wanted to try that when we saw it early yes like this is interesting okay and also if it's you art so I'm pretty excited about that yeah let's do it this is very interesting very cool that Conner Lake looks like like the top that you put on the pill bottle yeah I like it it's like yeah alright let's get into this push [Music] and so this is kind of cool right that we have Moxie tart and this is like straight-up kbx but it's for the dart system so it can just go into the dark absolutely we're told so since they even if you're taking an open eye they probably can't get there they do okay evaluate what they were doing eat you've had this very well here baby I don't even know why I'm Cheers [Music] oh yeah guys um but yeah I know that definitely tasted pretty good I kind of like want to just like puff on that a few times to like see how high that gets me exactly like it would get me like really live yeah it was interesting like you said though like definitely like painters thing it was like to me it tasted more of like - it's like that or - or something like it was good I liked it no like teeny like I feel like they didn't like a look at much of chirps in there anything like yeah yeah I think I'm probably had an eight with that one okay yeah I'm nerdy Nate - it's like eight like seven point five eight like yeah Joey it's just like the way the battery hit so like to meet I like fat hits I guess by the way is some healing effects like like doing if I could hit this three times I do it and just wing it didn't spark up that much and so I don't know me hey yeah okay yeah I think I'm at like seven point five I think like it's definitely like up there

an alarming breaking news report about vaping it's a new piece of the puzzle that may explain the mysterious vaping injuries we've been covering here on the show from double lung transplants to even death I mean big complications is the culprit black-market THC the chemical in marijuana that gets you high and listen products are being sold to unsuspecting customers that have no idea what they're buying may be lethal senior legal and investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden brings us this as an NBC News exclusive our investigation took us to downtown Los Angeles where in a 12 block radius we saw dozens and dozens of storefronts advertising vaping products we're in pursuit of what black market operators come here for the empty packaging and cartridges that they fill with cheap and often tainted substances sold as legitimate THC products within minutes we score we were able to go in one shop one-stop shopping by these dank VAP containers the packaging and a hundred of the cartridges into which you can put whatever you want there's no ID no tax no nothing and it's counterfeit marijuana babes like these that may be making people sick I do believe that I was given black market stuff and I do believe that had a had an effect on me Fabian says his lungs were slowly beginning to shut down he ended up in the emergency room I couldn't breathe I couldn't talk I really couldn't even move my hands so what is lurking in these black market vapes and are the legal ones even safe no one not even the FDA or the CDC had tested the actual vapor people are sucking into their lungs until now we revealed those results Cynthia joins us what exactly is marijuana vape and how do you compare it to the typical East cigarettes or tobacco baby ok so a step backwards vaping is just taking a liquid of the compound heat it up and then that vapor is what you suck into your lung so if it's nicotine like a Joule which has 80% of the market that's tobacco THC the active ingredient in marijuana it's made into a liquid form and then it's heated up and then you suck that into your so again the cartridge looks like this that's what we were buying that's what we were buying on these are the ones we bought on the street so we bought for a hundred bucks we bought a hundred containers and a hundred of these so if I'm a black-market manufacturer of THC oil I'm in business when you walked into that store yeah what actually transpired what was the conversation like you said I got a hundred bucks when you got for me did you have to sort of lead him along how'd you hook that the fish well the first thing I would say is that we had our choice of dozens and dozens and dozens of stores in downtown Los Angeles all of them selling these kinds of illicit products and so we said hey we want to buy some containers we rolled off a few of the illicit names that are popular dank vapes is one you've got it right here dank vapes it is associated with many of the people who got sick it is not a legitimate brand there is no company called dank vapes so the black market on this which is what's concerning to me seems to be dominant there doesn't seem to be any way of digging taking them out less consumers are unsuspecting well even more insidious there are legitimate brands that aren't contaminated of THC oil that you can buy in states where it's legal and these counterfeiters make boxes and carts that look exactly like those legitimate brands so the consumer has essentially no idea what he or she is going to get so the Mac market operators fill empty cartridges with their own substances and then they're selling them as legitimate tested products but what exactly are they putting in there and is it dangerous Cynthia brought the stuff to a lab to find out if the chemist a flabs in Los Angeles considered one of the top marijuana testing facilities in the world can a safe executives Aaron Riley and Antonio Frazier explain they've come up with a brand new test we wanted to design a system that would be able to provide reproducible results to do something they wish the government would do analyze the vapor produced by illicit THC oil Canas they've tested seven THC cartridges from licensed dispensaries and six from the black-market we come back the shocking results from the lab [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I'm back with NBC News investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden and for the very first time a new lab test is able to tell us exactly what is in the vapor produced by THC oil when you vape what's actually going into your lungs to remind everybody what you tested okay we tested seven legitimate products these are licensed brands from licensed dispensaries and then on the black market we tested six black market these are listen what did the kind of safe lab testing show was in the vapor coming out of it okay there were no contaminants in either the oil we also tested the oil previously either the oil or the vapor here if that was used at the temperature that's recommended we can talk about that let's say that the lowest temperature or lower temperature lower temperature because guess what when you crank the thing up which is what kids do because it makes more vapor Oh carcinogens yeah so not safe anymore not safe anybody know what happened to black market cartridges even when it was turned at the right power setting on the low side okay under the best set of circumstances this stuff is dangerous it's contaminated this is just you're asking for it you vape this stuff you're asking for it well they're stealing your money it's not surprising they would steal your health well what percentage of America is given products that are counterfeit yeah you're asking questions really hard to answer because this is the illicit market the black market it's underground law enforcement is having a really hard time getting a Tanz around this think about it I mean the FDA isn't testing this stuff why it's not legal across the country so the FDA doesn't have the authority to test these brands but you know states are doing the best they can but the best they can it's not good enough in my opinion because we've got a population doesn't appreciate I just the things I've read maybe it's a quarter maybe it's half of all the stuff is counterfeit it's being brought basically from a drug dealer all right the THC oil let's go through exactly what kinds of things were found in your testing by the way it's state of the art and I would applaud you for doing this because our own government is in doing this we've finally got the answers from you well some of the things none of them good carbon monoxide formaldehyde pesticides well we're in the counterfeit stuff the ELISA stuff for rat you find a couple things that surprised you yeah it'll surprise you to cyanide yeah you don't want your kids breathing that stuff you just don't or yourself and vitamin E oil which is a little bit confusing it really sounds healthy but what they want though is the consumer to think it's real THC oil so they mix it with vitamin E oil why they pick that one because the viscosity the thickness is the same as vitamin E oil so these are really crafty dastardly criminals so let's talk a little about vitamin E because I think it's exam it's emblematic of the problem here we all know substances like pesticides and sine are dangerous let me talk about it but vitamin E sounds healthy right but when you inhaled the vapor with vitamin E in it it goes into your lungs right at the high temperature it's converted into an oil to a grease in your body once in a long some say that it coats the Airways and when it does that then coats the Airways it starts an inflammatory reaction making it really hard to breathe the information in the oil get into the tiny little sacs these little sacs alright of your lung they're not hard to treat now the CDC thinks vitamin E is that big culprit behind these marijuana vaping deaths and injuries but we're no unsure and if these black markets your products are being sold like this the question I'm having everybody is what can people do to make sure that they're getting something that's safe well don't buy illicit products buy from a licensed dispensary is one thing I just want to add a little bit to your vitamin E oil here's so the Mayo Clinic as you know did a of testing on 17 patients who had that vaping illness and they discovered that the lungs of those patients looked like someone who'd been exposed to mustard gas so it's why it's important they're only state regulated marijuana dispensaries in states were its legal right to your point the government won't regulate it because it's only in these states so when you look at the country if you're in a red state maybe you're buying marijuana from a legitimate place right if you're in a great state guarantee or not then if it in the red states from Cynthia Stella me is there more of the illegal places illicit places than illegal ones which means you're buying the stuff from drug dealers they're not legitimate sellers I don't see a difference between two groups so you've got another big warning which I wanted to point out which is the temperature warning just make that really clear to folks so when we tested the legal product that didn't have the contaminants that are horrifying the cyanide and other things cranked up higher they produce what the lab told us were carcinogens but you know if your kids are doing it tell them making those big vapor puffs is just not worth it it could be killing them so if you're not buying THC cartridges for a licensed dispensary in states where they're illegal here's the picture again right you're buying them from the drug dealer don't do it and if your vape pen is an adjustable temperature setting don't crank it all the way up because it's dangerous lots of data support in this now use the low power setting Cinthia wonderful reporting thank you very much you can catch Cynthia's reporting on today and NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt and be sure to check out Cynthia's latest report the results of a year-long NBC exclusive investigation where she uncovers an underground army of child laborers in Africa they are digging up a mineral being used in everyday cars planes and cell phones that's where I'll use them we'll put a link to the special report on dr. oz comm I'll be right back [Applause] [Music] be sure to subscribe to my channel so you don't miss anything and remember to check back often to see what's new", "Z3QMe5rXwUU": "[Music] what's up club lives are here and today we're talking about fake cartridges there are so many cartridge friends out now carvanha flavor brands jetty extracts heavy hitters king penn exotic cards so many brands and manufacturers now it's very difficult to figure out whether or not the product that you got is a clean genuine cannabis cartridge so we have 5 ways for you to determine whether or not what you're puffin on is the real deal if you feel in this content and you want to see more videos like this hit that subscribe button down below the like button shoot me a little feedback in the comment section we're trying to build community here so let me know packaging on legitimate genuine cannabis cartridges are very distinct and there are a couple things that you should look for a genuine cartridge we're gonna use this carvanha here for example a genuine cartridge always has the potency information listed on a sticker as opposed to printed on the box so if you see here the carvanha the carvanha potency is on that little white label I could peel it off with my finger if I wanted to that's not necessarily true for this flavors brands which claims that it's 91% on the box I can't take this off the reason why this is an issue is because each batch of oil needs to be tested individually depending on what state you're from every state regulates the cannabis oils differently and a third party has to test these not and ready oh gee so there is no way that they can know that this is 91% if your package comes with the potency pre-printed on it it's probably fake [Music] next is the bubble test if you don't know the bubble test is check out my video on streets disease versus legit disease will be bubble test of streets is e and aced is e that I pick up from the clinic and the bubbles move at different rates high quality cannabis oil or distillate moves a little slower than whatever junk they're putting in these cartridges so I'll pull the bubble test for you guys for my example cartridges for you to see but this is a great way for you to tell if what you're getting is booth and homemade or the real deal if your bubble races to the top is probably fake so we're doing a classic bubble test to compare our raw garden cartridge to this flavors brand and andragogy cartridge compare how fast these bubbles are moving you can see for yourself which one has the thicker oil [Music] the next way to tell if your cartridge is fake is brand recognition packaged counterfeiters have gotten very good and there are certain brands that they are known to counterfeit repeatedly brands like kingpin Stiggy plug and play oh man I've seen stuff called pissing excellence there are certain brands that don't have the cachet as a lot of their legal counterparts if you live in a if you live in a illegal State this may be harder for you to ascertain but for the most part if you here in California or in Nevada most brands have a well distinguished brand identity you should be able to Google their name find their website find out information about them if your cartridge is lacking in any of those areas it's probably fake the next way to tell if your cartridge is boof is through the cartridge design itself most manufacturers who exist in the legal market try very hard to distinguish themselves from the pack there are so many cartridge brands out here but this is the hervana C cell you see the custom bottom here a unique great tip here is the raw garden C cell note the plastic on the tip and the bottom and then at the bottom there's also an embossing like a chrome embossment saying raw garden extra touches extra touches now if we're gonna if we're gonna compare that to our suspected Street cart this andretti OG it didn't come with a tip on the top not nearly the level of customization here not nearly the level of customization and personal touch that you would find on other brands so if your brand is lacking in some of these little accouterments might be booth last way you know whether or not your cartridge is legitimate genuine or fake is through the taste test sometimes you just know if you get an uncharacteristic burning in your new clean your mucous membranes like your nose or your mouth or the back of your throat it might be a boof cart get brands are known to add things like MCT or botanical terpenes that may add a certain harshness to your hit however trust your instinct on this one if it's burning too much if it feels really uncomfortable if you're finding a little bit of irritation in your throat or your nose after vaping one of these it's probably fate well that's it you guys thank you for watching be sure to LIKE and subscribe hit those lows uh that's it you guys thank you for watching be sure to LIKE subscribe hit me up in

tallying up these numbers right here because I get an experiment on how many full hits it takes to or how many full hits there are and a half gram cartridge you know cuz I was curious so I went ahead and did that if you ever wondered well now I have a almost exact precise number so if you stay tuned and watch this video then that by the end then you'll know the number and you know a little bit more information as well shout out to shout our house you know these are some good good cartridges if you find them out there and dispensaries there anywhere you might want to check them out on that note stay tuned and watch the whole video and I appreciate you guys into the next one everybody has the question so I'm gonna go ahead and give you guys the answer to the best of my ability that is the question is how many true hits can you get out of a half gram cartridge so I'm gonna go ahead no not this one as you can see this one's kind of empty but I'm going to be using this one and this is a timeless sfv og right here but this so you see because most of the time I tap it and I hit them you know a few times at once but for the sake of this test I'm gonna be hitting them one time for through each pool just like this so that's one hit most of the time I like to tap them and try to give it a maximum hit for the back some effect but for the sake of this experiment we're gonna see how many of this take so stay tuned [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now people see that it might be one more Inlet someone mark 20 34 34 you know results from a berry these were fooled some of those Mayberry if you're not taking it might get up with this but I got 34 silent ones hope this information was valuable", "1fGvtdnW8oQ": "what is that YouTube family boy fastest here gonna be doing another cartridge movie to do today guys I really hope you guys are really doing good you know staying positive I know the world's kind of [ __ ] up right now so I really hope you guys have what you guys need and I'll be over soon guys but stay positive you know but today we have this wind Berry Farms I've been having this [ __ ] cartridge for like two weeks literally it's just sometimes I stash them away and I really forgot about this one but this was a blue dream I had I'd had this one before just a different string you know I had the strawberry lemonade I think these are distillate cartridges I think these people are from like Oregon this [ __ ] you can just talk about like your packaging you know and like I literally went on their Instagram page and they are from Morgan so that was the good guys but these were like two cartridges for 30 bucks so that especially going on these are like 80 percent THC they're not bad you know I had some of these before and they do get you high they distillate cartridges this still it's still fire don't get me wrong and I still [ __ ] with distillate even though like resin is a little better but it don't get me wrong I still love distillate but I still have this Moxie I've been smoking on there for like past week it's almost done I'm going to take a hit before I get in the cartridge smoke along with me guys Wow you guys ever see these batteries are there like four pots to that little thing they're pretty good batteries I had barely bought it I got tired of the [ __ ] battery I used sometimes so I just like getting me buddy but we have this wind Berry Farms this one's a sativa hybrid so like I said I had bought one for 30 bucks I have Graham and the guy was like you don't wanna get another one for a penny so I was like might as well you know it's like pretty much getting the cartridge for free and [ __ ] so I definitely had a cop you know but I literally had this like two weeks and though it comes in this little tube it's a blue dream I really really loves the TVs you know they get you going on to the day so we're not gonna screw this [ __ ] let me know what you guys up to it's it's Tuesday afternoons around three o'clock she got off work you know you got smoking up if you guys are smoke along with me go ahead and do so I literally forgot to dry hit this [ __ ] but let me show you guys up close hopefully you guys get a good view on there literally it's like has a nice little dent in it so half gram so we're gonna flip it over for you guys you guys like my new angle where I'm have the camera let me know if not I mean like I said because I have the a/c pumpin so I I thought I was gonna have like a was gonna have the camera shaking but I guess it doesn't so I'm going to try hit this time see if I get some flavors to be honest it tastes kind of fruity you don't really get like a actual taste to it so we're just gonna go in our screw this [ __ ] in BAM so it's just ready guys if you guys are smoking let me go ahead and do so cheers guys Wow she tastes really good guys um tastes piney I don't really taste like a Blue Dream it smells like a little piney tation know them don't get me wrong she's fired alright so we're going to hit it again my bad got a little distracted so well tastes really good you know it does have a little hint of some blue dream in it it tastes really good you know but I [ __ ] hate buying half game cartridges they honestly they don't last for [ __ ] I think they waste a little bit more faster I don't know but half grams will last me like two days max you know depending on what the [ __ ] I'm doing but the high on these are really good you know for some distillate the THC percent is like 80% so it's pretty high I'm glad to take another hit and I'm cut the Vita short got some [ __ ] to do got got a lot of store get some stubs and cheers guys try and get a little bigger here for you guys no I have feeling a little good buzz you know it's not a strong buzz because it's not like an indica or like a hybrid it's just a tema but it's a really really good buzz you know really left the TVs that get you going on through the day and [ __ ] but you guys don't forget to subscribe and let me know what kind of videos you guys would be interested in but she already has a [ __ ] date and it only took like maybe four big ribs but she's gonna be gone maybe by tonight or

ethan here today we are going to be reviewing the half baked extracts live resin batter so here is a better picture hopefully it is focused on the camera but instead of using my other glass for the video instead of using like the actual rig i'm just going to be using the puffco peek pro just because these different videos even though the rig is fun to use it just takes a lot of time for videos and this is just more convenient for videos if you're just going to be tasting the flavor anyways because it keeps the same temperature so i'm going to be hitting this um off the peak pro at 490 for i believe it is a minute and 10 seconds so i'm gonna go ahead load this up and we're gonna go ahead and take a nice dab so let's go so here's what i'm going to be loading up if i didn't say before i don't think i did this is the recon flavor or strain if you want to call it but let's go ahead load it up and take a hit so it's all loaded up now and we're just going to wait for it to reach temp and once it vibrates we're going to be ready to go i have a turbo in here so hopefully you know i do get a better taste so all of the chirps will be splashing around so just vibrated and here we go uh do so i'm getting a lot of freaking smoke out of this at this low temp it should be over any second now so the batter tastes really good on this low temp and the reason i have it for a minute a minute and 20 seconds and so all of the batter um is used and i don't have any left so i don't need to keep reheating it so that's a good temperature to put it at so i'm only going to hit that one time because i really don't think i really need to go over it that much so it does taste really good i'm gonna have their instagram down below so here's like the little logo that they have and then here's what i just hit so really good flavor puffco peak probably can't go wrong with it really good device just expensive but if you do have the money to spend on it i wouldn't pass out on it's better than some of the other devices that are cheaper but if you want the best device this is it it's just kind of expensive but that's gonna be it for the video thank you guys so much for watching and this

the videos but yeah i'm already feeling a little sweat so i'm going to take one more hit and we're going to go ahead and off the video so here's a cartridge in case you guys haven't seen it whichever

great welcome back to another stoney review today i got a real special review for you guys the homies over at math labs hit me up they're like yo stoney you can't be smoking those fake carts anymore man we got you so they went and sent me a stoney care package a couple different strains let me get a pound of your swedish chibok damn something told me to bring a lot of weed man today we got this one it's nice knowing that there's people and companies out there that actually care about other people and don't want to see them smoking on no hot dog water so without further ado let's get this going and get this package open for the package feels nice and sturdy it's got a cool logo right here that's where i want to be to the moon hopefully i'm hanging out with this guy by the end of this review got the math labs up top a little design there on the bottom you got the strain name skittles indica got the sticker right there sealing it shut on the side you got a qr code so we'll scan that in a minute and then on this side we got the thc and the cbd so for the thc we got 89 for the cbd we got two percent and then the back it's pretty cool got the window right there so you can see the car so far the oil looks pretty good blasting off to the moon so this is where you start that's where you end up let's uh scan this qr code see what comes up so after you scan it it gives you the lab results and i mean the full lab result four pages now it tells you everything that it passed tells you the percentages and it tells you all the canopy nodes that are inside of it on the next page and um it also tests for pesticides as well as heavy metals wow that's awesome so that's good news the qr code works let's get this opened up just take that sticker off wow this box is really nice whoever uh created these boxes and made this design did a really good job want to smoke so the part looks nice too it looks nice and sturdy let's take it out and see what it's about i really like how there's a qr code on the inside too it's legit as you can see the cart is completely full not even a bubble inside of it so we'll do the bubble test once we put a dent in it it's looking good it's got this nice cap at the bottom in case you want to store it so for the package i really like this parts nice and sturdy package is sturdy got the window unless you got the rocket to blast off i'm gonna have to give this one a 420 out of 420 even though there's no stickers on the inside not a mercy they still got the qr code and it gives you a lot of information in there so that's dope right there definitely a 420 out of 420 for the package now let's see what this uh flavor is all about the battery i'm using today is the th 710 box mod and it's a really good battery if you're looking for a new one i'd suggest getting this it lasts for days anyways let's get right into this flavor test [Music] [Music] these taste really really good definitely you could taste skittles definitely could taste weak like this tastes like some straight cali oil that's where this company is from mad labs i just took a couple blinkers and a couple of small hits on the lowest temp and i'm already feeling them so i can tell you right now this is some legit oil this is good stuff right here let's do one more blinker and then we're going to rate the flavor and we'll increase the temperature and rate the high here we go cheers [Music] so for the flavor i'm gonna have to give this one a 400 out of 420 because it tastes bomb definitely tastes like skittles and it definitely has a good wheat taste to it like some cali oil for sure let's take a couple hits and rate the high so now we're gonna turn the temperature up there we go off the blue [Music] definitely uh taste the weed a lot more with that it's temperature nice smooth bit [Music] it's good in the chest i would definitely say i'm pretty stoned i felt a nice head change off [Music] that last hit was so good i started to cry thank you matlab [Music] for the high i'm gonna have to give this one a 420 out of 420 damn just killing it all across the board today because i am faded right now i don't know if i'm to be doing any more blinkers maybe let's increase the temperature so we can give this a total score here we go so before we get into the last test see how much of a dent we've put in it now let's see if do this for about 30 seconds that oil looks really good though whoa okay people are watching oil looks nice and thick i don't really see it moving that's good so it's a little bit over 30 seconds still exactly where it was at so that's a good sign hell yeah [Music] you guys probably thought i was using the wires [Music] i had to plug it in because it drained all the batteries smoking it so imagine where it's full potential on this battery i said it would have smacked even harder so for the overall score ladies and gentlemen i think we have our first ever 420 out of 420 here on this channel matt labs congratulations fire oil i would definitely suggest getting it this is bomb i stick by my story i'm from jamaica and i'm not just saying that because they sent me these for free i mean it and that just goes to show you right there they believe in their product they're gonna send it to somebody for free so known youtube i can't tell you guys how to get these yourself but you can add me on snapchat and uh yeah but you know the deal mad labs thank you so much for watching i appreciate you guys make sure you hit the thumbs up if you enjoyed the video subscribe if you knew because i do reviews all the time and uh for everybody that stuck around here's a little preview for next week's review math labs pink champagne so stay tuned stay up and stay stoney until next time peace i can't end the video without doing a blinker on the highest temperature so here we go one more temperature up white let's go to the moon still checking this no", "EMmYy7VGXZs": "hey guys his dab connection and we're going over transferring oil between cartridges and this is the easiest way I figured out how to do it based on a combination of other things I've read and someone on reddit had the idea of actually putting it into the syringe and then putting it through here so kind of modified that by taping it up so I tape it up and here's a upside down cartridge that I've taken the thing off and I'm transferring it into a real C cell and some people do this when the cartridge breaks I also do it if I find the cartridge that has particularly great oil but the hardware is not so good so this hardware is not so hot on this remedy cartridge but the oil is awesome and it's still a pretty good card but I'd rather hit in the C cell so it drains through here then once it gets in there I'm gonna put back in the little tip and I'm gonna push it push it down in there and then I'll end up there you want to let that seesaw soak for about 20 minutes and then it goes and then it should be fine to work a couple things on the note so I did take this piece off and before I took this piece off I had this right side up and I used a hairdryer to get the oil off the top of the mouthpiece didn't want to waste anything and then it's actually so you can actually have to sit for a while but sometimes always just a little too sticky Oh see that's nothing it cannot fall over something to speed it up a little bit by blowing on it but I'm going to hold that while I blow it and then you'll see the oil going down into there and then I'll do the final part well pump it into that final cartridge oil down I taped up this top one to make it easier you have to tape that you can also hold it on the end of the battery but he just blow on it make a little they also get my pillows too much them a little bit laughs in there and you know it's inevitable you might lose a little bit of oil doing this process and this Karcher is not a program anyway mid full half gram anyway partially used now get the rest of that in there today I got most of it as now that in there now when I take this apart and be careful to just just get those little last drops dripping down into there a sort kind of on the tail end here and you'll see that a lot of Italy just naturally went through the syringe already and that's why I have it already ready to go like that and I'll do a final pump to pump it all through but you see it's already kind of about halfway there also be careful not to melt your tape and into the thing either so what did I do when I when I finally I'm going to take this on the little head around my little top right there I'm gonna then do the push down to the center and then put it in there but you guys get the concept cartridge to serve and to cartridge that is what I have found the easiest way to transfer all between cartridges whether it's broken or whether you get some really fire oil and the cartridge just kind of sucks I personally would rather take a little bit of loss in the oil and not use this crappier cartridge and use the better cartridge because overall I'm gonna have overall better efficiency so if I lost 10% but it's 20% more efficient its overall it's a winner so after that I'm just gonna seal it up you guys really don't need to see that part but I'm just ribbing that apart pumping the back in and then capping it off there's dab connection thanks for watching guys have a great week", "LUDYeJtJidU": "what's up everybody welcome back or welcome today we are going to see how to take apart a sealed cartridge now normally as countries they're either sealed or the screwed on and the round ones like these are usually sealed supposed to be sealed compressed into there and the they have other ones that have the fluted or the flat tip that are also compressed in there but this cart is still reusable so if you can get it open you can fill it back up we use it quite a few times before you have to get rid of it so you can't untwist it this is that doesn't have a school screw on her screw thread on there when you take it apart I'm gonna show you right now you don't want to try to turn it what you want to do is try and twist it and pull it twist it and pull it but you want to be careful you don't damage it because you don't want to grab it with the pliers and mess up the anything around it to make it sharp or this form so you've got to grab a towel then with pliers you grab this end make sure you got enough of a towel there okay okay and then you're gonna wiggle slowly wiggle slowly wiggle take your time just keep wiggling and bam you got yourself a open card now you can refill it reuse it you wanna be take your time be gentle cuz you can break this whole part often it's no good okay but if you keep wiggling you will get it out I've tried twisting it before and I've never had success that way but if you wiggle wiggle wiggle it'll come out mmm it smells like piney but oh you're on the mouthpiece there and they're still all your in there so this is still reusable there's no reason to toss it out if you can still fill it back up point I just refill it when you want to and to put it back together you're just gonna have to obviously put it back where it was in the slot there and push it down hard and you will be able to seal it back up there once it's filled up you fill it up like a normal cartridge screw on cartridge and then you can go ahead and compress it and it will go back into place okay it's a little bit far out there very little so once it's in place and you're not gonna spill your oil you can flip it probably down push it okay so I've had this problem before too so it's not sealing right now so what we're gonna have to do it's clean around the edges because it has oil so the oil is not letting it sit back down it's acting as like a grease so you want to clean around here okay and clean around here and then press it back together so that's what I'm gonna do right now I'll come back and you'll see it'll go back together okay so I've cleaned up both sides around here and around the inside of here okay you want to be careful when you're filling it up you don't want to get nothing in this area here because it won't let it sit back down so when you fill it up you want to use a syringe or clean it up after you fill it up - down here now that we got both parts cleaned you can go ahead and push it down you can leave it like that since you don't want anything to spill and push it down hard okay you see it even grab the towel there and then when uh you got it sealed a bit you can turn it back around see the back tight and there you go back to normal sealed and will not come out you don't want to do like I did don't even fix a towel there you see that so I'll take that off later but this is just to show you you can pull it out if that happens to you pull it out a little bit and pull it push it back in you can see it's right back in its place and it's not coming out okay usually when you twist these do not come out when they twist you can twist all day long and you're not gonna get them out okay you can only do it the way I explained there and that's how to use your shield cart a lot of dispensaries have this style as well as the threaded style so if you get this style running you use it there you go", "ZjBQDphg7UA": "hello everybody and welcome to my honeycomb 1/2 gram cart review before I start I want to say thank you so much for the support on my last video I reviewed a full gram honeycomb cart and as this recording has over 300 views it might not seem like a lot for you all but for me it does because it's my first video and I just want to say thank you so much for the support so without further ado let's get started so right here I have the kosher sativa and gelato hybrid and let's check the packaging see right here see if the camera can focus there we go so I has 83 percent THC and 32 CBD and I would definitely recommend you all to check out their Instagram because they update their news and although all about their cartridges and this is the same to teach you the same and yeah so let's open this up as you can see right here this looks like very nice and clean I show you the other one looks the same too there's never really focus a good you get the idea and actually let's do a comparison on a full gram let me get my full gram out here we go so this is just what a full Graham looks like and a half gram you can tell it's kind of hard for them to stand out but you can tell they're definitely different definitely tell the during sighs so yeah why don't we need your some I just start smoking it got my pen right here I'm a G let's do let's do the sativa first actually the gushers there we go Andres turn on Cheers that's pretty good um definitely um totally has that fruity flavor like the candy smooth hit and yeah it's great for the morning um definitely makes me really in a happy mood I usually smoke this in the morning so let me take it out and let's move the gelato ah here we go see it's on now alright Cheers whoo that's pretty good um it definitely has a fruity favorite too but not as much as the gushers it's really great for people who have high tolerance make myself at one point cuz it has some pretty strong THC though so I need a drink there um it definitely has physical really exact relaxation because um for example let's say um I'm not really good at shooter games and when I'm high I tend to have a slow reaction because I'm relaxed and with shooter games every second counts cuz you know I don't want to miss that sniper shot okay but um yeah this is pretty good it's definitely fun to play with yeah and I'm already getting high right now as we [ __ ] speak I couldn't even a [ __ ] made this standstill here we go and I still I don't know one look I know going for another hit cuz I want to do it uh-huh but yeah um in conclusion you know these are really great I recommend this for anyone who is beginning to smoke arches or it's a fan of cartridges and yeah that's it for my review and stay safe you all and sooner we sooner we get out of this damn Koba 19 pandemic we all can smoke together thank you all for watching", "GDgj4zVNub0": "so we are going to be doing a uh cbd versus thc delta 9 versus thc delta 8 blind test we're gonna have my friends try out these drugs and see if they can tell the difference between them uh this is purely for entertainment uh so let's get right into it by the way if you don't know who i am i'm chris with cbd extract and if you haven't tried our hemp flour before do me a favor and hit the link down below and you can grab an eighth of our hemp flour completely for free it doesn't cost you anything all you got to do is click the link down below to claim the offer let's get right into it we're not going to tell you what's what okay oh we're going to we're going to tell you at the end but for now let me ask a couple questions okay uh how long have you been smoking like a year and a half year and a half okay about six years six years quite a while yeah that's quite a while how experienced would you say you are with weed but i am not good at knowing types quite a lot of experience so i'm a big dabber so like um i get a lot of different profiles like i tried to switch up my strains and stuff and switch up like in because of a hybrid so okay i like to get a lot of different like experiences so i'm pretty well versed and he's from the uk by the way wheat is not legal there at all so he has [ __ ] weed [ __ ] weed in [ __ ] england they don't even have cbd weed there if they do they have to label it as tea because they they don't even allow cbd weed there so this is the first cartridge uh you're going to have to guess if it's delta 8 delta 9 or cbd and also you know just feel what you think about it tastes like ginger um it's interesting like it tastes like a flounder tastes like actual planters i could do your own i feel nothing it just tastes very like not strong but you can tell the flavor no but that just tastes like the ground it tastes like the ground yeah what cannabinoid would you say this is um it tastes a little bit different from like most cards i almost want to guess that's delta nine i really don't know i don't know cbd i'll i'll say this is cbd for now but i might change my mind so okay i don't know i get like a certain like throw hit off of the actual thc and i felt like slightly different but i almost can kind of notice some effects i could just be liking a placebo so this is the next card [ __ ] tastes a lot more like what i would expect a cart to taste like oh there we go right off the bat i noticed it's super clear i'm just looking at it it looks pretty concentrated and i can i feel like i can almost kind of feel it off of that suit and by the way on these parts we're doing a curveball because not only are some some of them delta 8 or delta 9 or cbd we're also some of them are botanical terpenes and some are going to be cannabis derived terpenes so we're going to talk not super vibrant flavor like if there's any terps in this i would guess it's you know minimal what do you think about the taste this is um this is delta eight would you say it's an indica or sativa i'm never gonna tell you that all right yeah whatever i get in the currency but it's just for like the flavor differential not really the effects i never noticed anything different [ __ ] does it hit strong though like i smoked delta 8 before but this is kind of different this is like that tastes very strong in the back of my throat i can feel that [ __ ] just yeah it's definitely there um this is delta a that's delta a i think the last one might have been delta nine because starting to fill that a little bit i'm gonna guess delta h [ __ ] i don't like that one like nothing like i can't taste anything really just tastes like is there a throat hit to it nope no throwhead okay it's fruity yeah i don't know and it hits good like very smooth it just tastes like him like i'm chewing grass taste reminds me a lot of like actual distillate like um delta nine still i like this one it seems to look a little bit like it unless it's just like terps although it does look really thick i don't know it's good though i like that one so would you say cbd delta 8 or delta 9 on this one um i'm pretty stuck in between delta no no no this is delta a not cbd i don't know that was delta nine which one the one that i just did was delta nine the first one cbd because this is way weaker than the last one right i'm not tripping like this has to be delta a i don't know you tell me man i think there might be like some cd in there too you think there might be cbd yeah yeah i think like the last one is more like pure delta eight if i had to guess and then like this one there's like some other additives i don't know it could be completely wrong but i don't know how you know the difference between [Music] [Music] okay hmm is that one clogged too they're all i feel like all cars wow that one hits more it's in the bathroom oh that one is like peaceful this is like taking him right before getting to bed i don't know whether it's thc cbd abc this is like not the strongest thing it's not the strongest like the second weakest in terms of like first impressions right but this is like i could smoke this like a lot you know like i could wake up a lot of bed and take a hit you know i have to prepare myself for this i don't need a big breakfast [Music] this is very casual this is delta r that's delta all right uh yeah or delta yeah delta nine here okay i always get it mixed up then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah interesting i don't know i don't know what this is but it's not dealt to mine not about the man no okay so final verdict finally uh which one would you say was the strongest out of all strong ones one two three or four probably two two three two two no i lied three was this one yeah three okay interesting and so and out of the one two three four which one is cbd which one is delta eight which one's delta nine [Music] cbd was the one with the little white cartridge uh delta nine was the second one and the first one was whatever okay cool am i right nope you're completely wrong so out of the four which one do you think had like the best flavor to the worst flavor um i would say the first one had like the most diverse flavor like i could just like pick up like those things going on in it and i think that one would be the seemingly one the very first one i had um and then the second one there wasn't a whole lot of flavor but uh it seemed like there was a high concentration of thc in it whether it's delta eight or delta card and then uh the third one you gave me it was a lot like the first one but it just had like a little bit more flavor okay cool and then what about the and then the fourth one we just talked about that yeah yeah yeah that obviously tastes like almost any card up there interesting all right well hey that's you were actually spot on that everything was right oh okay then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah and then this the third the middle one was dr eight and then the last one was the first one yeah okay we got that right i did she got everything right yeah oh my god yes so there you have it hope you enjoyed the video if you

THC man I'm back at it with the banger now look you guys this is gonna be part of my cheapest versus most expensive series where I go to different dispensaries and I try out different products right so last time I tried out flower I got the cheapest eighth and the most expensive eight in Washington State today I'm in Las Vegas so I visited planet 13 which by the way if you're in Vegas and you have to choose between reef and planet 13 I highly recommend you go to Planet 13 I felt like it was a way better dispensary they had a lot more options it was a lot more open and you were able to really move around and look at everything they had I went down there and this time I decided that we're gonna be reviewing their cheapest versus the most expensive cartridge now before I show you the product I just want to give him an understanding of how much everything came up to okay so for the half gram the most expensive half gram it was priced at $100 before tax right now I bought let me see how many items you got we got one two three four or five how about five items here that I bought and it was $55 in taxes so let's just give it you know let's just say that every item had $10 tax to it right just the same so that means that that $100 half gram is now 110 dollars because of the tax not to mention that this half gram didn't come with the battery so I had to buy a 15 dollar battery now the fifteen dollar battery doesn't really have a ten dollar tax to it but just because I'm dividing up the total tax that I was charged for everything that I purchased I just thought that I would throw it in there and had another $10 to the battery to substitute for the tax so now we're at a twenty five dollar battery and that a hundred and ten dollar and a half gram so that puts us at a hundred and thirty five dollars in total tax included battery included cartridge included with a half gram which is really pricey if you ask me and for the cheapest cartridge it was fifty five dollars which was a disposable cart which means that he already came with the ability for you to use it you didn't have to buy the battery on this I was fifty five dollars but now adding the $10.00 tax that I might need to all the items it was about it $65 cartridge right there now this is pretty expensive this is a Las Vegas prices I know Cali would have been wait jeepers like never in my life have I paid over $100 or even a $100 bro for a half gram of distillate like what the hell because I'm pretty sure this is just a little right I don't think it doesn't say anything about like live resin oh it is live resin my bad so not for distillate its life resin but still man this is an expensive cartridge right here you guys so this is what the expensive one looks like right here it comes in this fancy box which I'll give it to them I mean at least they you know they message some of that money that they're charging for this product into the way that the box looks now I'm gonna break down for you guys the whole entire like THC percentage etc etc you know what I'm saying so so the THC percentage test at eighty two point 61% CBD is zero there's no that there's no CBD and there there's cbn 11.1 total terpene so the terpenes is actually like the flavor profile to your product right it's gonna determine how the product tastes and all these flavors and aromas also play a role into how the high hits you so the terpenes are actually really really important this has an eight point zero five percent terpene base which is really hot especially for a live resin so this is supposed to be really gas that's actually what you're paying for when you're buying this product you're paying to get more trips to get more flavor and more quality out of your high and since it's life present it's gonna give you a way better higher than the distillate I personally hate hitting distillate man like when I first started I just I didn't know any better so that's just what I would do but after trying like the life resident I was just like all bro you can't go back to just regular distillate now look I'm gonna open it up and show you guys what it looks like when you open it a little box in here you see that boom Wow what look at that you guys it's like sick now they have their logo right in the front it's crazy because the guy at the shop was like just smell it smell it oh my god it smells so good it just smells like strong strong concentrate now if we look at the back of the box once it opens up that's how it opens this is what the inside of the package looks like so they're talking about the philosophy provide only world-class cannabis products for customers our state-of-the-art production process utilizes THC distillate and cannabis derived terpenes coupled with premium hardware is simply unmatched this technology consistently delivers an unparalleled vaping experience where elegance meets perfection hmm okay so again 110 dollars right here after tax 15 dollars but since we divided the text evenly do all the five items that I purchased we're gonna add another ten dollars to it and just say that it was a 25 dollar battery after tax 135 dollars right here now I was told that this battery was already gonna be charged and ready to go I believe this is Planet Thirteen's like the branded batteries that they have there we're just gonna go ahead put this on here and take off this top rubber piece now before I go ahead and try this project I'm actually gonna open up the other product that we got and talk about the cheapest wax battery that we got so this is roots I got the cush mango and this one I have a believe all the testing for it I got all the testing right here so mango Kush oh you know what I'm so sorry on the last one oh I did tell you guys the TC percentage tripping I'm high you guys I'm already late alright so for the mango push this one tested really high in THC percentage so THC tested at ninety one point ninety seven percent again this is the cheap one this is the $55 sixty five dollar after tax cartridge right here okay um let me see CBG which I really don't know exactly what that cannabinoid is and test that twenty four point forty nine milligrams look at the terpene percentage though the terpene percentage is at one point zero three so basically this one has eight times the terpene profile than this one so this should make for a way more better quality experience and high but this was more convenient you know this one is just you open up the package right pure and simple you got everything right here in the back okay now when you open up the package this side right here is empty I don't know why but everything is on this side so you can just like use your finger to you know slide bad boy out there oh now it comes like this right you just pop this open and you're ready to go wow that feels good at the finger okay is this what is this what is this okay so roots this is I know these are disposable but why is this like this I don't think that you guys is logo this is basically their local you guys look look at this I don't think you guys just logo should be able to come off that easy I mean I'm pretty sure it wasn't meant to happen like that I'm gonna just put it back for sure it's meant to look like this but first impression mm-hmm you know but yeah guys here you have it to my left side we have planet 13s cheapest babe cartridge that's disposable so you'd have to worry about buying a battery and to my right side their most expensive premium $100 bro 110 after-tax 135 after we add everything up with the battery 65 over here on the Left what do you guys think would you spend over $100 on a oh you guys say [ __ ] that I'm spending $65 after tax out the door and now I don't got to worry about the battery I'm just don't listing away what I'm doing I don't know hey guys we're gonna have to taste them and really see how we feel about them we're gonna go ahead and start off with the roots all right let's go ahead and give this thing a shot now we're gonna try to complain I really want a good to flower look we're gonna do a blinker out of them and if we're gonna do like you know shorter pause and we'll do longer pulls we're kind of play with it a little bit to try to actually get the flavor flavor you know put it down for a second I was like what does it think don't blink Wow dude the room just got foggy my eyes bro my soul left my body okay that was strong that 91 percent THC dude it's different however though it reminded me of like when you hit a dirty Punk no offense I'm not trying to talk [ __ ] you know what I'm saying because wasn't that bad okay hitting a dirty bomb it's a lot worse but I still reminded me of just like when you take one of those rips that just leaves your throat oh you know tasting all nasty and [ __ ] I think that I got really hot too like the disposable battery it took a really long pull so I kept I was feeling like the mouthpiece getting hotter and hotter so maybe it was a little too hot for the product so now we're gonna try small pools medium pools and longer pools to get the flavor out of those but I need to get some water bro god damn alright so there's been a solid ten minutes right off the bad guys the flavors wasn't there dude like I'm sorry you guys can improve on the flavor you know what I didn't write this thing just to lit oh this is hash oil posh this side of that let me see and this is the mango cush I believe is what this train is called the other strain cold it's called medicine Chloe I believe is with this one here is called a hundred percent pure cannabis oil no additives no fillers no synthetic terpenes okay so maybe that's why it has that flavor because it doesn't have faked our booth actually it's obviously pretty good cuz fake Terps or [ __ ] you know you don't want a bunch of fake Terps like dis lis it's just a bunch of fake chirps but it says it's hash oil I don't know is that like I really don't know all right but this is its hat it's premium hash oil so the other one is like resin let's take a short poll and see I'm saying a couple straw polls and just see how like it tastes and stuff yeah I mean now that I hit it more the flavor isn't really what's off-putting I think it's more like it's just a very dry throat it tries to throw up quick we take like a medium part of it man but you know what gets you so bad bro I started to explain something to my go downstairs and now saying all kinds of things well always like do so look the highest am i high is no joke this is not this isn't for rookies right here bro still knock that ass out you know you guys $65 brothers a good bang for your buck for real now I want to take like a longer pool just to see at what point I feel like it's you know it's too much or it just makes your throat too dry or whatever yes definitely with like the bigger pools that it leaves like that burn and your throw afterwards you know maybe it's just like the temperature because I'm just something that longer you're hitting it the harder it's getting because it's just on and more consistent you know but median to small hits on this thing is to go to to enjoy and if you're just trying to get like super medicated I guess like you know a long a long rip will do it for you oh I am eight to 10 out of 10 I'm out of 10 for real and I was the cheapest one now we got you guys the medicine Chloe and the medicine is spelled like M EDI Zi it's full of fun easy all right I guess we gotta turn it off with the blinker just like we do the other one so cheers you guys Wow there's some of the cleanest I've ever tried I'm hurt I'm hurt I swear by the end of this video I'm being so sleepy hi guys so the flavor was phenomenal it's like when I coughed it didn't burn my throat so I kind of like thought it was like what what my throat didn't burn it tastes crazy I don't even know how to explain the taste it tastes like when you hit a really really clean joint with some good flour you know and you just hit it and you just tasting the flour me like damn this flowers clean and the flavors on point that was crazy yo what the hell damn I'm up to highs on for myself don't be like here babe you have this one it's kidding all right let's take a small rip a medium rip and then a long rip I'm really excited for the small ring because it tastes so good Wow you know it's crazy and I don't know why this is what it tastes like to me but it tastes like a lemon raspado which is like just Google that little hemming dress bad I'll put a picture you you know what I mean that's what it tastes like it is delicious who this TT is crazy I don't know I mean this is more for like the premium smokers you know I guess this is more for like the people that are like I need quality every single Hey which I understand yo cuz even though the THC percentage is lower you're still gonna get just as bait you just gotta hit it maybe a little bit more but every hit can it be more enjoyable so it comes out to like some people might rather be like buggy I don't really care if the taste isn't as a1 as long as it gets me more late which I'm not saying this one won't get you more loot to this because you just got a pie smoked out of this a little longer but the quality of it I mean you're ingesting into your body so I guess at the end of the day you gotta make decisions sometimes young but I think it would be worth paying a little extra to go for like quality but that's just my preference medium pool do like the flavors still consistent and it's crazy how these trips like play a role with your mouth huh pause right they like they don't dry your mouth up you know I feel like this is over the battery it would get hot really quick and dry my mouth up now I'm not sure if it's also because it's a disposable that the quality might be a little different on the battery I'm not sure you know but dowsers my experience I'm gonna take a long pull out of this I'm so baked I feel like all right it's gonna pull down this fire this fire so I would definitely say they're both really good products because at the end of the day even though this one doesn't have like the best flavor in the world it gets you so big I was like baked out of my mind earlier what this was like uncomfortably be do you know what I'm saying this one however gives you a better experience like it's more premium it's probably way better for your lungs and it just tastes better all around I feel like the high is really good and the more you hit it too higher you're gonna get so it's really up to you what you want but yeah your boy mr. THC if you guys enjoyed this video because you got smash that like button let me know what you guys want me to do next on this series cheapest vs. most expensive out", "zCefsDMbWUo": "[Music] hey everybody so check it out for this review video I figured it would be awesome to do it outside alright man it's a beautiful day out today it's nice I mean I figured nature would be the best place to do this review video so for this video I have here this is a gram cartridge by buddies this is one gram distillate with no added flavor alright this has got no added flavor so this is the buddies and again no added flavor alright I got to make sure that I make that very clear for everybody so this is coming in at 87 percent THC this is royal dog-walker alright it is the Royal dog walker it's not just regular dog Walker its royal [ __ ] okay you better bow down and recognize alright anyway it is a beautiful product first off let's see if we get a good view on that look at that that is a beautiful beautiful nice product right there that's a nice distillate so this this cartridge cost me twenty nine dollars for medical here in Oregon and for recreational that means anybody over the age of 21 with valid ID you could pick this cartridge up this buddy's cartridge with no added flavor for about thirty nine dollars recreational so that's not bad either anyway I got my om extracts battery here that I'm using really cool battery just because it's got the the charger right there at the bottom you can just charge it use a regular phone charger whatever kind of you know LG charger and we're going through this nice little I want you guys to see this really quick for my stuff there's a nice little area it's nice little walk path this looks like where somebody would get murdered in a scary movie like hey let's go through the forest yeah oh man but it's nice it's nice out today and so like I said before I figure we do this review video outside so um right here's a good area there ain't nobody around so let's uh go ahead and try this bad boy [Music] [Music] not bad man that is really smooth and that tastes really good it doesn't taste too much like dog walker though if you've ever actually had dog walker it's got that diesel that really gassy diesel taste it mainly because of the chem dog in it but man not bad it's got like a fruity sweet taste to it with a little tinge of that gas eNOS at the end that's how I describe it not super fruity more sweet but like that you know sweet fruity ish with a little gassy Diesel at the end that's how I'd describe the terpenes on this and I don't know does it say make cannabis deprived terpenes you see that peep it because it's very important when you get these cartridges all right very [ __ ] important I can't tell you enough please guys please please please please please try to stay away from the flavored stuff now I know that I've done a few review videos on some of the flavored stuff but that doesn't mean that that's what I personally smoke okay this is the kind of stuff that I personally smoke those review videos are just for reviews okay they're nothing more than that anyway so this buddies I don't know if it says it doesn't say the terpenes on it but it's pretty tasty alright this is a hybrid distillate 1 gram vape cartridge distillate alright I'll make sure I say that again because I want people think and it's BHO or anything else but this is a distillate I love it this is a perfect item for somebody on the go this perfect item very discreet easy to use if you're out somewhere like this you know you know what I mean you're just out enjoying nature maybe you're taking a trip somewhere it doesn't matter these are very easy to use and again they're very very discreet alright a lot of people that don't smoke mistake these for actual vape you know mods and stuff like that they think it's a juice I don't know we come to a fork of the road here I don't know which way to go it's either that way we're that way but hold on let me let me show you guys this this is the other side of the entrance this isn't a nice little walk I don't know if you guys caught any of that walk through there but does a nice little walk so anyway let's go this way all right check it out it's really hot out here it's like 93 degrees or some [ __ ] and it's only getting hotter summer has just begun out here at Eastern Oregon a lot of people think that I'm in the Portland area or Salem OR Eugene or something like that now I live out here in Eastern Oregon Hermiston Oregon good old harvestin out here in the damn desert as you can see mostly everything out here is dead just burning up out here in the desert man it's kind of shitty to grow out here because if you don't do your if you don't amend your soil right if you don't make sure that you know everything's on you know the up and up and legit you'll end up with that like desert hay tasting weed man and that sucks Oh God does it taste like [ __ ] alright so if you're growing out here in the desert man remember to amend your soils correctly man because you don't want that nasty hay taste [Music] so my thoughts on this one gram cart bye buddies I have to say I highly recommend it it's something that's still somewhat affordable it's not going to break the bank but it's exactly what you want when you're looking for carts okay the cart gives you a big massive hit which is always you know what I'm looking for because I want to feel like I'm taking a DAB you know what I mean I don't want to feel like Joe I'm just taking like these little nothing cloud hits I want to feel it I don't know there's a lot of you guys out there that are the same way but I would say this is it like I said exactly what you're looking for when you're going shopping for a cart you're looking for a cart that functions well it's not you know a cheap cart these carts are actually really nice carts you're looking for the product itself to be really good okay you're looking for those higher numbers especially for distillate you want those high eighty 90s and I mean that's just beautiful distillate look at that that's just beautiful distillate you know what I mean there's nothing I could say about that you could see yourself just some really nice you know very see-through golden distillate which is very beautiful all right no arguing that and again eighty eighty seven eighty seven percent THC almost ninety that is some good numbers those are some good test results right this doesn't have any CBD in it or at least it doesn't tell me but oh wait it does it does have a house three point five fifty three percent of CBD in it so that is a little bit of a bonus in there so nice I didn't read the side I'm a dumbass but anyway seriously no I like that though so the breakdown tea 85% is a total cannabinoid okay so that's the overall total the actual breakdown of it is 75 percent while 75 point 69 percent THC if we want to get technical about it then again three point 53 percent CBD so that's the breakdown of it nice nice nice nice not bad it's hoping that the THC would be a little bit higher than 75 to be honest especially when you're dealing with distillate a lot of distillates are in those higher numbers you know what I mean but hey as long as it tastes great as long as I'm getting a good hit as long as you know my cart is functioning because there's a lot of carts that [ __ ] up there's a lot of carts that you'll end up sucking the oil through or they'll just burn out and quit to stop working and you're [ __ ] with half of your grammar if not more in there yeah so you go you you got to add that in when you're shopping for these babies so big shout out to buddies again the Royal dog walker which if you ever get a chance to try dog walker itself it's one of my favorite strains a highly recommended man that that Terr pee gas diesel skunky oh.just musters the nostrils and I love it I love it I love it I love it look at these boulders they're very big boulders so I don't drive my car into that Lake I guess if I'm like crazy on crack or some [ __ ] oh there's deer over here I think I scared the deer by yelling too loud I just saw him take a you know beeline it straight for the woods over here that's some crazy [ __ ] he's like oh no not these [ __ ] again look at this white boy out here talking and getting high I can't take this [ __ ] anyway I want to go down here that's nice if there wasn't like fish hooks and all kinds of poke and [ __ ] from people fishing in here I'd probably be like let's go swimming in here in fact then again I don't know they they these are the pawns that they stock every so often so nothing but just small trout oh nothing big for all you stoner fishermen out there if you are a stoner fisherman let me know in the comment section below there's a lot of them out there you know getting stoned and going fishing is a really relaxing fun thing to do I'd have to say I'd do it from time to time anyway so I got to get back to a buddy's good kart recommended if you guys are on a budget can't afford those 50 60 $70 cards if you guys you know need something that is trustworthy none of that added flavor [ __ ] known on cannabis deprived terpenes then go buddies man they're your buddy all right they just want to be your buddy all right they fit in your pocket very discreet easy to use 510 thread so they fit almost almost every [ __ ] battery out there and like I said man just they're trying to be your buddy be their buddy follow them on Facebook and Instagram

episode I really appreciated all the support if you haven't subscribed yet feel free to go ahead and subscribe hit the notification bill today we're going to be reviewing shattered house now shattered house is a brand I don't know if you're familiar with the Central Coast of California but they have them in dispensaries up and down the coastline up there and it's a really really good brand so you know I reached out you know lucky enough they reached out back to me so I have this skittles right here now this isn't live resin or instead of C so this is a clear dissolute oil and we're going to take this out and we're going to go ahead and give us a test right here so you know it's in the packaging very very nicely packaged and I will open this up and go ahead and get to work on this well we are that is so like I say they have dispensaries up and down Central Coast if you don't know that's like soundless Obispo Santa Barbara all the way on down to Ventura Oxnard Carpinteria you know it's a nice little trip you never get to California check it out sometime so I have this cartridge right here already nicely thoroughly tested so I know it works see hit the button is blue ready to go this is a twist bottom but we'll talk about that in a minute let me go ahead and get this situated and we'll go ahead and deal with that in a minute so like I said this is clear distillate skills they pronounce it with that ass I mean as e-excuse me you know so if you see them with the S then it might be something different but the real skills they pronounce it with the Z is more like the gills as ki TTL use these gills so you know just so you know but uh so as you can see it's a clear Desa Li right there the viscosity level is looking real real nice I don't really get caught up in the twist now that I learned a little bit more because like if they just put something in here then they could go ahead and you know you can add it and tell you that it's really not the good stuffs not in there but the viscosity love was looking good like I said these are seaso cartridges but they still have the ceramic coiled it's a little bit different then they have the red top right there on there so you know it looks like gunmetal kind of a futuristic type of looks still looking cool so let me go ahead and put this on make sure that you have your batteries adjusted to the three point six to three point eight votes or supreme superior performance of the cartridge and make sure that your battery source is always fully charged the better charge the better performance so it's that 2.0 right now so we need to get it to you know and leave me I like mine at three point eight so we're going to try to get it as close as possible and put the cartridge on there and as you can see the desolate is clear nice and clear and everything is looking good so before I take the hits I like to first you know test it make sure that the cartridge is actually working then I like to very very nice very very nice you know it's good to actually you know it's good to actually it's good to actually have someone actually good cartridges that's actually good because now with the gang didn't so oversaturated with a recreational in dispensaries popping up everywhere people is just going crazy with the manipulation and everybody you got a brand and it's done another so it's good to know that there's still good brands out there like shudder house so I appreciate you guys stopping by oh these ones are hey nice you had to forgive you I don't know what I was thinking you judge uh-huh yeah told you shatter house

definitely taste the men in this one can't taste the kush like i said it reminds me of like a christmas peppermint is what this is reminding me of um it is a distillate cartridge i i thought i would be more excited about it but i'm not too excited about it bro i'm not i'm i don't know man i'm just not i don't know that meant that mint mint taste uh [Music] i don't know i just i'm not a big fan of it if if that's what you say it is good i'm not i'm not knocking it i just um i still have that taste in my mouth and i'm not a real fan of it i mean if you like mince i guess kind of like a

see what's up let's see what it tastes like on a hot hot hit cheers too hot now that just tastes like a burnt mint distillate and done going hot too hot let's try 4.3 and then i'm in this video nothing expands in lungs i don't know i'm just not really a disliked fan a dislike cart fan and this is what i think 50 bucks at maryland health and wellness center i would much rather pay the [ __ ] the extra 15 dollars get the liquid live resin cartridges but the [ __ ] up thing is like i said an earlier video homeboy down the street can get two of these for what the [ __ ] i pay for which it's sad it truly is it's sad all right let's go in at 4.3 about in between about the middle heat and let's see what happens let's see if i could taste the difference or anything and i am getting the buzz off of it don't don't get me wrong it is good medicine and the color that oil is [ __ ] always fire grass roots color their oil is always fire no matter what the oil always looks that that same color the same consistency cheers that's more like it not bad not bad i definitely like the concentrate better but uh yeah if you like mint stuff then go go try this mint kush from grassroots if you don't

title the video as you guys can see man I'm be telling you guys how to bring in either your pen how I got it in I'm gonna tell you guys what I went through why I brought it I'm pretty much like this is gonna be a little story time because I wanted to make a video and while I'm out here so when I get back I could just upload and you guys could see something while I'm out here so yeah today guys we're gonna be ripping on the West Coast curd I'll take up close a close-up after this yeah very very nice man I'm like I'm a little bit more than half no a little bit less than halfway he's done with it but I've been trying to use this so scarcely but we're gonna take a quick rip before we get into the storytelling stuff like that oh so cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you guys know the deal [Music] man it's nice to being able to smoke outside dude my tolerance has gone down a significant amount surprisingly cuz since I haven't really really been able to smoke all day how like I usually do or at least every couple of hours like literally the past week that I've been here has only been like maybe two times double so if you guys are coming in from any legal state flying out you know it's an illegal state I'm gonna show you guys what I'm not gonna show you guys I'm gonna tell you guys what to do cuz I'm already over here there's no way I can do to him so the way I did it first first and foremost let me show you guys the way I did it so if you guys are have a girlfriend a wife girl that you're going with on a trip this will just make things a hundred times easier so what you can do is just obviously attach your cartridge to your stick and then just all you do is it'll just pop drop it in her makeup bag and then that's it dude you're good to go you could probably do up to two or three cartridges I don't recommend doing a lot of them and I don't recommend compact inch if you're gonna take we do not compact it because I learned a few tricks over here my uncle he works for the airlines and he knows a bunch of tricks up his sleeve and stuff like that he was telling me like what they live for so I mean let me just boss you guys up in a little game right now so we're usually in airports what they're looking for is in drugs that's not what they're looking for like you guys making like oh they're looking for toys and looking for my wood and my weed you know things like that but that's not the case even though it's not gonna be hard for them to know who has it like just don't don't overdo it don't be stupid don't just go in there thinking like oh they're not looking for drugs so I can go in there and go ahead and walk in with an ounce that's definitely not the case so all right they're looking for obviously explosives guns anything that can pretty much cause any damage or danger to anyone inside the airport like if you guys don't know lax is one of the biggest or not well this isn't only lax but I'm referring to LAX abuse out to the airport that I flew out of so yeah and LX are looking for explosive guns et Cie things like that so drugs is it's not one of their top priorities so as long as you're not overdoing it man there should be no issue to be honest like he was telling me as long as like one thing that you have to do if you're like I'm not advising this I'm not telling you guys go do this and go like try it out but if he has you know I have medical issues if he has I have anxiety like me personally I have so much anxiety dude like that day that I was flying out I had so much anxiety that I literally [ __ ] was crying bro like once I landed it was horrible I mean I'm not ashamed to say that I cried cause it's just anxiety man it's where humans everyone feels it specifically you know and cheers to them here I remember take up a trip for you guys so yeah like I was saying oh yeah this car is so amazing by the way by West Coast cure if you guys can see it hopefully you guys can very very amazing and yeah let me just get back to my story so one thing he told me if you're gonna bring weed um weed in general cartridges don't really matter because it's a liquid usually everything scans through liquids you can tell very very hard to detect and yeah so I'm not saying this isn't me saying like oh you can take as many cartridges you want I'm the same be smart and take one or two three hemos you know you don't really need to have more than that unless you're a fiend bro so now on to the weed if you don't like cartridges and you guys are more about weed them he said he went from what I know he told me that all you have to do is just you can carry in there just make sure it doesn't smell and make sure you just like wrap it up stash it you know but don't compress it too much because usually what comes up on the RFID readers it comes when they're passing it through the little readers what they're looking for is compact compressed items so basically because if you guys don't know that's usually how bombs are made you you compact what it is whatever the material is and then that's what makes a bomb you can't have a bomb with a little super piece of [ __ ] you know material it has to be very very mass amount compact until like it doesn't have to be a ball but you guys know when I'm referencing to so that's a little trick and then honestly you guys there's another one that I've done it at like shows and stuff like this I've never tried this at an airport I mean I don't recommend this type if you guys really are trying to get through when you can do is just hide the cartridge on the bottom of your plastic piece of your shoe and when you're passing through the metal detector just slide your foot like walk put left foot over whichever isn't carrying the cartridge and then on your right just slide slide it down you know just fairly you can barely lift it I think it's like an inch from what I've done before so yeah no more than an inch so you should be good after that and yeah I'm just sorry if I keep you looking away there's just so much scenery around me and it's just catching my attention so we're gonna take another hit and just keep talking keep ranting seeing what what this day is about man so yeah I brought this on here I left on Monday it's currently already Thursday it's Friday tomorrow man I go back on Sunday so which means I have two more days out here and this pen has been coming in clutch because like I said my anxiety dude my anxiety was kicking my ass since the morning I had a good on the plane like it's not that I'm scared to fly or anything I've flown before I've flown to Mexico I've flown to other places but just the anxiety of being away from home it's just something that I've had you know there on my whole life so wait to whatever this is this is something that has helped me a lot throughout my last couple years I'm dealing with anxiety and stuff like that so and I'm gonna show you guys this one I know I already made a video on this with a West Coast cure cartridge I'll go ahead and post that in the link in the description below if you guys want to check out that video but I've made a video on this um battery before and it's called the X tube so basically what it is it looks ugly right it looks ugly like this and okay whatever you're not supposed to have a beautiful battery but that's just a [ __ ] thing in your head for if you if you're one of those people that likes things that are aesthetically pleasing I don't blame you man I'm some sometimes I'm like that too so but this battery isn't for you so this value what it does this little detachable piece right here so as you guys can see I have a little a little oil bubble right there right little air bubble I mean so what this does I'll screw it on there click it twice and then what it does it'll start preheating right you'll see it oh it's already dead because I've been using all week so I can't use a preheat function but what it does it'll heat up the outside of the cartridge and then it'll make the oil warm enough for it to move up and so how good that is is because most a car batteries that pre-heat your [ __ ] they preheat from the coil within so basically what that is it's burning the oil that's why when you take hits you can still puff like with this if I were if it was charged and I were to do that you wouldn't know smoke would be coming out at all like sometimes the only downside is the tip does get hot sometimes because it does get heated up a lot so if you guys are looking for a cartridge that I mean for a battery that does it all now this is my favorite one for sure the only bad thing about it is I don't think you could fit like a tank of apes and [ __ ] like that it's more of that just the regular - really really slim cartridges so yeah man I'm gonna take another hit hopefully this battery still yeah so we're just gonna oh no it's still it's still going you just can't preheat it because the preheat function does I think that's what takes up most of the battery life because it preheats it for like a good 20 to 30 seconds because it wants to get all the oil out obviously man this West Coast cure is amazing yeah I'm gone man I'm just gonna go ahead and end this video here enjoy the rest of my time here I hope you guys are enjoying the rest of your week you guys are gonna see this on Monday so enjoy your week from now on you know and for all the new people here thank you for conforting me and for the people who have been here for a while thank you for the continuous support you guys are gonna be seeing some big things coming within the next couple of weeks so look forward to that and yeah if you guys enjoyed today's video go leave a like comment sub and we're out you can", "PJ4K50zYyZA": "oh it's not above to make

there man it is like what is it like four weeks into the the quarantine man your boy is bored out of his mind I ain't gonna lie I I feel like I've done everything possible to keep myself entertained and I feel like I'm gonna lose it man I'm this close to losing it but you know I still gotta grind out these videos for you guys so for today's video man I got myself a raw garden right here no we're not doing a review for you guys I mean it is gonna be a little bit of review within this video but for the most part I'm gonna be talking to you guys about live resin man so lately I've had a lot of live resin cartina from raw Gardens dizzy from other companies I will not mention it rassee I feel like I have been feeling a lot like what the heck man what the heck is up with library the library is supposed to be better than you know dis Allah it's supposed to be overall better than this lit and honestly with the whole point of this video is that I feel like I get more smacked off of desolate cards then I do get smacked off of you know freakin live resin cards the only card that that is like live resin and smacks the living heck out of me would have to be raw garden guys so for today's we got a sweet dose see right here as you guys can see I'm gonna go ahead and crack this sucker open it using it on the new lose battery right here the yellow one if you guys are wondering about the giveaway I am extending it because I wanted to get give people a more chance to enter the video so I am going to be extending it until Friday it is currently Monday you guys are gonna see this video

dough see also we are inside the car it is raining it is gonna be raining this whole freakin week man so I'm excited for the weather I mean honestly I'm excited for it by the same time not because I'm kind of used to it's been raining for like the past like two to three weeks like on and off though but this week it's supposed to be raining all week alright guys and before we get any further into the video man let's go ahead and get the freaking vibes going guys I'm gonna go ahead and take a nice little hit off of this sweet dough see if you guys sittin nice and pretty off of this booze battery and yeah man if you guys were smoking long with me make sure you guys are over the age of 18 and 21 you know YouTube makes me tell everybody that so cheers guys oh I forgot that this thing was not even on its brand new I need to go ahead and turn it on so turning it on honestly this I'm really really liking this yellow one by the way so let's go ahead and hit it 3.3 volts cheers guys oh that is very very sweet tastes like it has some berries in there boys honestly like the whole purpose of this video was RC because I really wanted to make a video talking about live resin you know not even what lye resin is about but just the fact of how how you should be how you should how it should make you [ __ ] and honestly like the main reason why I made this video what probably have to be because I kind of want to know your guys's thoughts on the whole debacle versus you know dis Allah versus live resin versus live rosin and things like that and because all right so you guys know distillate everyone hates on distil ages because of its beta it's basically tears like this alright so there's this lit and carts in carts when I'm saying there's distillate and there's live resin and then there's live rosin carts so those are the three main ones that that are out there right now obviously you have seen cannabis drive terpenes pods that come from like 710 labs and things like that but I'm talking about like the main main ones that you will see anywhere that you go there's always gonna be the live resin cards there's always gonna be the distillate carts and there's gonna be very few not a lot of the live rosin carts those are you're gonna see them from low well farms you can see them from 7-10 labs and things I actually I don't know if seven telling us makes live rosin ones I know they make that the cannabis drive terpene pods but I'm not too sure about the live live rosin pods right so honestly so I copped a copped a couple live resins in the in the past couple weeks and I was not satisfied with him at all man they were not raw garden all right I'll tell you that much right now but I was not satisfied at all and it really made me think man so is life resin like BS you know is live resin bs the the whole the whole process of live resin versus live rosin versus distillate I feel like live resin come somewhere in between like like you know it can either really really freaking good or it could be it could taste good alright so I could be either really taste taste really good and gets you really really high or it could taste good and age it you're not getting that that really good high and the reason being is because I've noticed that a lot of life resins right a lot of life resins they are very very low in THC percentage I don't know why I don't know why maybe it's just the products that I've used that I've used in singing things like that but most live resins that I've seen they're just really really low I'm not really too sure I'm it's I'm guessing it's because there's not a lot of concentration going into the into the process you know whereas distillate you can really really get those highest numbers because of the process that you that you get the distillate you know you can obviously get there's been cartridges out there men with with well over ninety three percent THC men and that's something I've never seen on a live resin pod so or cartridge whatever you want to call them in only on raw garden light I think raw garden like I keep bringing them up but there's just so outstanding man and I don't I there's a whole debate going on with raw garden in itself right now because you know that what they define their product to be is refined like residence or pretty much what that is is they're refining the live resin more than it already is like you know at the most peak state possible and the refining I think they're refining like excess fats and oils that they didn't want in their products rightly so that's why it looks like this that's why it's as good as this and it's crazy to me how how companies nowadays are give basically setting their own standards in terms of live resin and because you know in a community like this you should feel like alright there's already a set of rules at every single person company whoever you know makes this plant this produces this planet and this concentrate they should at least follow the guidelines and you know that there you go the real live resin that that's been known to be real live resin throughout all the decades you know from the people before us from the people that's gonna be after us they're gonna have the same with the health some freaking lint just fell on my lens and they're gonna be the ones that are gonna be you know the people in the future they're gonna be the ones that are gonna carry on what we make and like like I really don't know what's to happen 15 years from now but then again I you have to think you have to think you know marijuana right now it is still developing it's still developing in many many ways so I feel like I'm [ __ ] talkin too damn much do not even hitting the card enough sorry guys this thing just tastes so phenomenal see this is why I didn't want to be smoking throughout the whole video because by this time I would have been blasted I would have been saying nonsense still had to keep the peace of mind you know still knowing what I'm talking about boys so yeah I guess like I was saying there's so many people you know redefining redefining these term these life resins these librarians making them into different different methods of like you know cartridges who waxes edibles but they're putting flick and solving lists rosin in edibles like I saw that on a packaging I was a holy [ __ ] you could do that dude so yeah I'm just like amazed by everything that's been happening you know but I just really questioned it at the same time you know it should should you be following a guide line within with thing you know the marijuana industry of how I resident is made of how live rosin is made all that stuff or should you be you know creative should you be like raw garden in 710 labs and make or now 710 labs actually does stick to the to you know the actual processes that remain they're not doing any redefining of any live resins or anything so I guess in this term it would only really be like raw garden should you really should you really like you know branch out and start making like getting getting new forms of life resident getting new forms of you know distillate you know but just a different branch within within that own subject itself if he doesn't get what I'm saying I know this might sound very very very hard to capture you know but if you listening if you understand me I appreciate you man so let me know what you guys think do you guys think there should be a basic guideline that should be falling and it can be switched up or do you think it's better to you know follow the guidelines though but also find your new ways to make things better I guess in a sense you would say one of those two let me know in the comments below what you guys think if you guys have gotten him this far into the video man I appreciate you guys I feel like I was rambling a lot but I honestly I mean I'm liking this video I'm not going I'm liking this video it's a chill session it's it's a smart session man it's something that's gonna make you think so cheers guys I need to give it a break bro he's gonna freaking destroy my lungs man the last time I smoked like like what was it like to rock gardens in a week for like months straight like three months it literally [ __ ] up my lungs I'm not gonna lie it messed up my lungs like I could I am i I noticed that my lung capacity was good

Pushkar lucam you guys are awesome", "_zL_uHV6fQQ": "all right y'all today i'm gonna be making a video on the friendly farms cured resin cartridge this is some gmo so let's get straight into it all right y'all so this is the friendly farms and gmo cartridge this is going to be cure resin they have a live resin version and then they have a um cured resin version so there's going to be the cured version um i don't know what the difference is i never personally had live resin one but uh somebody tell me what's the difference between cured resin and live resin because i'm pretty curious to see or if actually i'll probably just look it up and put it up right now but this is this is what the packaging is going to be looking like man like i said gmo is going to be an indica it's going to be a black box with a yellow writing that's kind of what they're known for that their main color is a yellow so it's gonna have that up front fresh cure liquid you guys can pause that to read it it says uh farm friend all natural from plant to pan no additives distill it free and this is the bag looks pretty cool in the back i'll put a picture of it [Music] and the top is just the uh sticker of the dispensary that i got it from i got it from a firehouse in sherlock california um west west main street turn like california i forgot the address but it's called firehouse uh just look it up on we maps um so when you open so to open the package it's gonna so to open the package you're gonna have to rip the sticker right here and then you just open it like this and it's gonna come with the cart in there and it comes with this piece of paper uh i'm not sure if it's actually scanning or some [ __ ] to receive fifty percent off or something i don't know something or something like so my honest thoughts about this opinion so my honest opinion so my honest thoughts about this pen man i will not get this card again and i don't recommend that you guys get it um this card as you guys can see i'll give you guys a closer look right but the now on this is [ __ ] horrible man the taste of this reminds me of taking the hit from a dirty bomb like that's exactly what it tastes like dirty weed from a dirty ball or it tastes like good weed hitting it from a dirty ass bong you know what i'm saying uh you guys here with a bong if you guys have hit a bomb before like that you guys know exactly what i'm talking about but uh the guy told me this was his favorite one but i caught cap i think he was just saying that you know so i could get so he could like sell me like sell me this um this tastes like trash man i let all my friends hit it and they do not like the taste but i will say nah i'm gonna say this this is probably one of the worst pens i've had um this is better than the jeter cart for sure it gets you way higher than the jeter cart and the only way i'm able to enjoy this pen is by doing uh the the dab cap with the with the bong because it gets rid of the flavor and that way you're able to get a lot higher without the nasty flavor and one thing about this is i forgot where it said on the i think it was on the box or maybe it's on this paper that it says in hell for one second using a low voltage battery 2.0 through 2.7 volts recommended repeat this step after a couple of minutes if you like if you would like a stronger effect adjust your battery to under three volts and inhale for four three through six seconds let the cartridge cool for 30 to 60 seconds between hits to ensure that that you do not burn the oil so with that being said the maximum that i recommend you hit this car is like five seconds um i haven't hit a blinker of it yet just because i don't want to burn the oil and there's so much left but i'll probably take a blinker of it for you guys just for the video just so you guys can see and i'll let you guys know it tastes like burp and so that way you guys don't have to do it yourself but i'll recommend using at least the max 3 3.3 volts max i believe this one is vaping at 3.3 volts in the lowest setting which is green and then i have another honeydew battery which also smokes at 3.3 i don't have anything lower than that so that's all i was able to use but for me it's been working fine even though they did say to not use a battery above 3 volts so if you guys have that problem just 3.3 is max i would recommend so you guys have a 3.3 volt battery you guys are good don't need to worry about that um but the flavor man i had to give it like a three like a three out of like a three or four out of ten man horrible horrible flavor um the high i would have to give it like a five uh maybe like a five and a half um like i said it's one of the worst cards i've had but not the worst um i would recommend a lot of cards over this daisy kingpin select a lot of things i would recommend before this and i had a lot of friends telling me not to go not to get it but i have not made a video on it so i wanted to see for myself and it turns out they were right i have yet to try the live resident win so i'm not sure about that one but this one man the uh cured resin is a no go for me man i have not tried the editing labs yet though so i don't know how that would work but um sorry for my long hair too man i'm about to get a haircut on i haven't cut the top of my hair for over a year and a half and for or like about a year and a half and i'm gonna go get an undercut on the sides real quick so next time when when you guys i'm gonna upload a dispensary video if you guys didn't see the video i just uploaded before this one i'm gonna make it uh i'm gonna film the dispensary run today and i'm gonna have my hair cut in here so you guys can see how fresh i'm gonna look for the ladies watching if there even is any but um but yeah man like i said do not recommend this car just um if you tried a lot of carts already and like this is one of the only ones you haven't tried or this is all you could get it's not that bad to the point where it's like if you haven't had it um you know don't get it like go get it see if you like it it's worth getting it it's gonna get you high you won't i'm not saying you won't be disappointed but you won't regret that you bought it because i don't regret that i bought it just because i've never had it you feel what i'm saying but uh yeah man if you guys were just wondering this is a good card and it's not so get another one but if you want to try it i would recommend to try it because who knows you might like it um everybody you know likes different stuff so let's take a hit of this cart man and so you guys can see some cloud production i'll take a blinker right off the rip i've never done it like i said because i don't want to burn the oil but hopefully it doesn't burn the oil and if it does you guys don't have to burn your oil because i'm doing it for you so let's take a hit with my dirty ass rig if you guys haven't seen my dab cat video make sure to go watch it you just put any type of pants dizzy plug and play any type of pen circular anything you put it on there then you grab your rig put it just like like this into the hole and take a rip so i'm gonna take a bleeder for you guys ready cheers came up that's my first hit of the day too first time the day took a blinker like i said i've never took a blinker from this car and i've had it for like a week already so holy [ __ ] so like i said man it's not a bad car by any means but i would definitely i'm not gonna buy this car again for sure it was cool to try it though because i was really curious i've been debating on buying this for a couple couple months now so it's cool that i got it um so like i said man buy this at your own risk you guys really want to try it you guys might like it who knows but if you guys want to take my word and you guys [ __ ] my channel and [ __ ] like i like [ __ ] my channel but like if you guys want to take like if you guys believe my word i wouldn't get this man there's a lot of stuff that you could get um besides this oh and if i didn't say i got this for 36 out the door um that's after taxes and everything you guys can see that i'm pretty sure you guys saw that in my last video in this bench for you but i showed it to you guys but yeah 36 dollars out the door when i cop again [ __ ] no overall rating man like like a six maybe like a five just because the flavor is horrible i would not get this unless you have the dab cap and the rig because that's the best way to work like that [ __ ] hit bro when i took that blinker right now i have not took a bleep from this cart so that was crazy i doubt i could take a bleeper without that because it's just too nasty but that's gonna be for the video y'all hopefully y'all enjoy the video hopefully that's awesome hopefully i'll learn something and uh hopefully i'll inspire y'all to go get this or not get this but maybe i'll save your ass may save you some money but uh hope you enjoyed the video and i'll catch you on the next man peace okay bye", "9-q7FfMtyAw": "what is up you guys it is you're gonna make 69 back get it again good fine with a new YouTube video and disclaimer disclaimer my face on products ran through review or talked about approximately yes if you don't like it you can do what now say with me suck the forward up oh yeah also if you're under 18 you got it kick rocks don't welcome mmm so welcome welcome my chair my name is Michi Michelle may be 69 upload on mondays around Leon other days and they do crappy comedy and I ever you and smoke tons of cannabis cuz I'm a medical cannabis patient here on Florida so catchy bag subscribe assist my channel assist if you're new here welcome if you're over here welcome back and if you're hater well so I did ask you guys what you wanted to see review next and it was the wax which I did and instead doing weed comedy Wednesday today we are going to do a review on the blue river alive rosin Carl rosin card as I should call it from true leaf this is an indica I did not get them the day that they launched but when I went on a true leave like a week ago I was like so you guys got any and they happened to have two of them I got one and so did the cat next to me you're welcome okay so let's read the stats on this guy so this one is a indica it is it's just a rosin carts in a cut 9 pound hammer and it was clocking in for a total of sixty four point five percent I had to say it was a little baffled by the lower THC because of rosin is Zoe such a high THC but with that it is what it is also I'd like to throw out a shout-out to talking to him I'm pretty sure all you guys are subscribed to him Tim I hope you're feeling better he did have a bad experience with these cards like the carts were uh he said that people haven't unclogged he was having issues he got a puck yeah he said it was a punk no so let's talk about this 9 pound hammer and now like I said it was a little bit low on the THC right but let's see it and see what's what's up I haven't smoked in a minute I will say it tastes good and also you guys they know they are recommending to buy the battery that's with it but really in talking to them I was actually able to find out it's because it needs to be on a lower setting because of the way the oil is but if you have a battery that has multiple settings just use that just throwing that out there oh oh the taste it really does taste good I haven't been using this all week I've used it for a couple of days it's just because I wanted to review for you guys so I saved the last for today okay see I'm feeling a little bit more than I did the other day but that's because I had been like when I got it at edibles Indian stuff so I do actually really enjoy how I feel right now I will say this because it was so lower on the THC scale as far as like a concentrate further pens as far as the rosin is concerned it's pretty high up there so I was gonna assume that this was not maybe it's a process I don't know how it's done if anybody has any ideas go ahead and comment about that bill alright guys let's talk about it okay so as far as like vapes go that thing tastes [ __ ] good I'm not huge on vape cars I probably won't buy it again because I highly enjoy dabbing I like dabbing I like also for the people who don't think dabbing is convenient like I have this de box I've had vape pens dab pens they [ __ ] work great so there's that um so I'm not really too keen on it because the price at 60 bucks for the car which is good if you're a cart person um I guess I don't buy cards tell me I don't really look at the prices on carts but I the taste like let's say in comparison to the cure leaf there's was a different it was a live resin cart I really did enjoy that car but I didn't buy it again because I'm not a car person I don't know if I like that one better or not I don't know almost I was gonna say I did enjoy the cure leaf one now more so but now that I'm smoking this out and smoked in a minute and its really hitting me actually I like this one too so hang on it yeah it's good [ __ ] so if you're a cart person this is a great thing for you if you don't like the dad and you want the effects and the taste of rosin Fogerty know some people had they bad experiences with him and it wasn't just the product I guess it was the actual car itself like I said go check out token Tim's video on it and I'd like I mean I'm sowing I'm medicated right now I really really am medicated right now how many hits do they take hey and let me rewind this just kidding I use like four or five but yeah okay then it's it's a-workin so oh and a double bonus is there is no added solvents in that so if you are worried about solvents since having like a solvent let solvents less solvent like this whatever google it hidden your vape cart that would be a way to go I'm just throwing that out there on Monday I'm going to review so it's also an indica L from grow healthy I am gonna go try to get down to MU V and get some of this live rosin just to try for you guys cuz it is [ __ ] pricey but the things I do for you yeah there you go if you guys request I want to see me review anything in particular I did try to order for some crumble from the cetera by me somebody asked me to get that I can't even [ __ ] get it so there's that so yeah drop that in the

high-class energy all right I'm gonna keep this kind of like playing this simple I mean I've seen you see the tide well you know you know what you clicked on this video for I mean minded that's my desk is a little dirty this where I'll be running my tree and it's like if you get more work done it's it I see you know this why I put it so you know if you could mind it ignore it it's all good so before if y'all haven't checked out my videos uh I like to do we sit and game and sometimes it like that going to check out my videos you know boom about of being two times one to you give me like just go check them out real quick ain't nothing big but pretty much before I start off my videos I like to take it here easy so let's just get one get here real quick still hit a little bit so these are my kind of like mmm am I gonna say five cuz I really know how many I have but i'ma just kind of list it so most of the time people can't really tell if their cards are fake or not you know most of the time people are like oh I think oh yeah my cards real my card real you can't talk [ __ ] about my card like I'm sorry if he's really had does not come straight strictly from the shop it's most likely fake but I'm gonna give you guys a little bit of tips a little bit of like you know a little bit of background maybe this will help you so first off this is tip number one any exotic and any banks are 90% fake exotic especially especially exotic some Danks are real I mean I've missed them I've seen somebody Oh take that back my thought you guys but I've seen a couple of real banks and I've seen a couple I've seen a couple real days I've seen a couple real of real exotics I mean you know there's not I'm not gonna say they're all fake but most of your time those are the carts you gonna stay away from especially cuz I know they they're super cheap you get one for five bucks you won for six bucks and people are sending for $25 like people are making money you could really really just like look these I know I sold off a lot I've been selling out I literally just read I just read up on a little funny piece about it being quick to make my money Katie's never go wrong Kathy's so that's my tip number one n\u00e8 Azadi any banks and really reason why I say DS is because sometimes they're not always dark sometimes you don't get them dark first off if you ever see a dookied art cart throw it away throw that [ __ ] away that is fake don't even smoke it just cuz you've got it just don't do it you're gonna thank me tells me you're gonna wake up ooh wheezing in your throat you're gonna hard to breathe you know it's just it's just trust me it's not worth it you're gonna feel sick you're gonna throw up you're gonna have the shit's you know everything is it's just not worth that's all I personally don't like like my team member to it so at the bottom of each of cart he usually has these little look okay I wish I could show you guys pretty much if you look at the bottom of your cart it's a pretty much say C so like C so that pretty much is like the factory that they come from it's pretty much that's like like where a lot of carts no I guess you know that's just like what my [ __ ] has been feeding me and he says that he where he gets him from he gets him from this premises factory where he like his plug is he's super big super blah blah blah so boom that's pretty much my tip number two they said have some type of engraving at the bottom or some type of like something something like you could even see like with this one like it literally says charity babes you know it says C so has like the factory card number under it you know it has it has it like you give me yeah it is it's like it's official that's all I know and number are so pretty much that's kind of like like the to little touch I'm kind of like laughs talking I don't wanna keep going and just like talk on and talk on so but so pretty much um charities like there I don't know I just I just love them so much I just I could rant about him alright but number three is is when you hit a fake cart usually when they like after a while when it heats up it like it's turns to slush like like what I can hit this I'll hit this way I did that sort to burn a little bit more oh look that bubble is not moving I promise you you see that you see I know it's kind of blurry but that bubble is not moving I just hit I just took a nice little fat hit and I that bubble is not moving that's how you know it's a good car is when you heat it up and it doesn't start sluicing around alright and it doesn't do that hard my tip number four would happened to be watch where it comes from so well I'm I've sewed it up before carrot ease boom it comes with a little seal my other video if you ever see that move our meds if you ever if you know the car you know if you check that out those cards um they have no they have like a little seal over it - it's a way better way bigger seal you know it's way more official in my opinion I think and Matt is it's just way better you know so just watch you gotta watch for you if you if you get a car some dudes like oh boy you trying to buy this off me you know don't take it and first off I just want to say this cookies they don't make full gram cards so someone ever tries to sell you a full gram cookies card it's fake 100% I'm just telling you now cookies carts are only come in half grams they they are real only half gram stuff so most of the time is gonna come in a blue box and a half gram most and most of the times cuz if the full grounds on I've been tricked before I've been tricked through Rove's they just they don't bang trust me I'm telling you now I'm trying to give you guys these tips just because so you guys don't get scammed in the future I'm telling you if it's you could tell just by the wax honestly you can tell by the wax if the wax is clear if the wax doesn't look right or something it's obviously fake obviously you could tell it's just honestly just just have the wax and honestly if I was you I'd ask to bang you first especially if they if they're like oh it's my last one or something dude be like oh yeah I'm banging one time especially if it does not have a seal because if it doesn't have a cylinder who knows maybe they banged it you feel this this guarantee that only you will bang it you know don't let are you all know like it has the void you know the void [ __ ] you know right there you will know if I if I if I smoke they're not trying to sell it to you but that's pretty so pretty much I

to dev connection and here i got the herb delta 8 thc cartridge now um all what delta 8 really is in a nutshell um is just it's simply a form of cannabinoid right and it still has a similar properties to thc and delta 9 and all that stuff and still delivers good effects you know it's not as strong as regular thc cartridge you get from your dispensary but you can still get really nice effects and it's uh we recently actually reviewed a delta three shy delta thc and those ones actually liked a lot they uh they have a seesaw cartridge hardware so they deliver really good hits and i was surprised with the high right but these are herb a and um taking a closer look i like the packaging a lot like this is pretty cool so it stands the whole time never falls down but i thought it was a c cell right and i realized once i like unscrewed it and everything it is not a c cell this is a it's ceramic coil so that's good but there's no improvements and there's no imprints on the anywhere around it and it's uh i don't know i could just tell the way until it wasn't a c still just by hitting it to be honest because the hardware is not that great it gives really light hits it's uh uh yeah like i said after hitting it i knew um you could tell right away because it just delivers really smooth really soft hits or really light soft hits but um as for the taste i mean the oil is really good it looks really good it's like doesn't move at all the taste is uh here we have two different strains we got chill indica and sweet sativa and uh sweet steve is actually lemon haze that's what i'm actually smoking right now it's uh the taste doesn't deliver that there the cartridge doesn't or this strain doesn't deliver that great flavor to be honest like it says it's lemon haze but i don't know i didn't hear i didn't really get that good of a taste it isn't really i don't know it just kind of takes a little harsh burn and just doesn't really deliver that great taste taste here i'll show you i'ma hit it right now and see show you guys all right yeah so i don't know if you saw that but this uh this cartridge delivers really soft hits and when i pull it when i pull to suck in like smoke it actually feels like i'm pulling kind of hard you know so i didn't like the hardware at all and the cartridge itself it doesn't taste good it tastes burnt to be honest it has a harsh flavor but it has a harsh taste but delta eight is a cannabinoid that is like known to be harsh itself the three-shot delta was pretty harsh but i still like the taste of it way better and they use they actually use sea salt hardware but and like i said the main thing with these cartridges is if they had you see some hardware that'd be so much better because um here's the challenger right it actually broke on me i uh pulled it out this didn't break here right i pulled it out and i already got most of the oil out and um i always hate taking out oil or replacing oil to another cartridge because you'll always lose some oil you'll always lose some oil regardless how good you are at it uh even if it's a little bit but still you know it's like who wants to lose oil you know but it didn't break from here i pulled that part out but right here is where it broke this piece came off i tried pushing it back in and just pushing it as hard as i can but it didn't work i didn't even push it that hard i just you know push it in to see if it would um fit back on and hit but no i didn't work it just i ended up replacing the oil to an actual sea salt cartridge you know and it did hit way better than this and the you know i can't really say anything about this flavor because uh it when i hit it in this thing well the heart was way better right and it still has leftover like flavors from the other cartridge that i had so it gave it tasted a lot more like that you know so but as in regards to the flavors to this strain it didn't deliver that great taste it was harsh it was uh it was just all right effects wise it still delivers good like pretty good effects right like you actually get a pretty nice again a nice uh nice eye right it's not nearly not the same as a regular thc cartridge but at the same time it's a the way i see it personally is like a high or it's like a strong cbd you know it's like strong cbd or a high quality cvd or they're like high quality bait pen that's the way i see it you know but it still delivers great effects uh similar to a regular high not nearly as strong as a cartridge but still nice you know great alternative if you don't have access to thc cartridges or you know if there's a lot of sketchy sketchy brands out there around your area this is a great alternative but this one these ones in particular i wasn't a huge fan of you know i much prefer the three shy delta a thc that one is still harsh right after if you take long hits but it's still i don't know i felt it to be more potent and it was a lot way more tasteful i uh i really hope this one tasted better but i'm not too sure like i said and the taste like just wasn't that good effects were not nearly as strong as the deltae thc but they were still there you know and like i said this is a great alternative if you uh prefer if you are if you're unsure of the cartridges that are around your area if they're pricey like here in illinois cartridges can go for half grams gold for like 60 and a full gram would go for like 80 to 120 you know and that's before taxes the these or maybe you're around an area where all you see sketchy carts are unsure cars that you're just unsure of you know in that case this is better delta a thc is federally legal and legal in most states they'll ship to you and it's just uh something pretty nice to check out if you're like maybe trying to switch up or like you know trying to want something uh reliable something something that trustworthy but more trustworthy than sketchy cards but yeah this is dave connection this is the herb delta athd cartridges and i hope you guys have a great day peace", "aiWVkxPev7A": "[Music] all right so I just got this thing to like hold my phone there's a [ __ ] Center people around me whatever I'm about to leave and it works nice oh yeah just ignore my it my shirt always like but today I'm gonna be reviewing these a cartridge Big Chief extract or extract whatever teach Sid to sleep cartridge lap tested high potency pesticide free whatever the strain I have right now it's an apology the oil right now I just got it done preheating it because I was ready to record but there was just a [ __ ] so people I wrong that's why I like stopped but yeah this is the oil and awfully proud what I like about this cartridge it's that when like you do get high it's like a really clean hi I like that and as you can see the oil it's a really good quality oil um what I don't like about this cartridge though is that if I put it too tight on my battery like if I put it all the way so it doesn't move or anything it just doesn't work on my battery as you can see I press it and he just blink I'm gonna take one hit and then I'm gonna go buy food I think I'm gonna get a tropical smoothie [Music] and what I'm just gonna go all right that was like a two minute drive I'm here yeah alright so I just got home I didn't record on my way back from like I got since it's something smoothie it has like strawberry then also got my sandwich I want to talk about how I taste this real quick it taste is like a secrecy I don't whatever that was Oh houses in two chance the rapper's new album dude - it's [ __ ] fire actually - it's [ __ ] art it's amazing it's not giving that out stupid look I'm sorry I apologize alright okay before anyone says why why why didn't you take a [ __ ] blinker man [ __ ] [ __ ] all right this battery doesn't even have leaders like [ __ ] compare my cartridge but if you present [Music] [ __ ] it does plank cheers guys [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "NOl3lkgTT-Y": "yo what is going on everybody this is weed them boys on the we dem boys Channel I'm here bringing a tutorial on how to unclog your vape pin this goes with like any cartridges you know of any sort for smoking like a some sort of liquid of or oil you know so basically this is showing you how to get this part in clogged because what happens is I'm just one on a little trip to the desert basically and uh it's really too hot to even take these things out there the temperature is like war about you know ranging from a hundred degrees like 110 and riding in the car they see worked okay and even then you can still feel the heat in the car so what happened was the liquid started just heating up too much and it just got filled here like it would get liquefied and I guess I got blocked so if you take a flashlight to your cartridge look in here you'll see it at the block right now mine isn't because well I I kind of just found out my way how to fix it this is um and this may not work with all cartridges as a disclaimer because this is a heavy hitters I'm not sure throw the same like that inside where it's a little bucket and then a narrow hole for where the vacant escape anyway let's just get to tutorial so what you need is a cartridge you gotta need a lighter not preferably a lighter because you don't want to use a tortured you're way too hot and are a liar would be safer so not everybody has torso lighter I recommend having these these are alcohol swabs relying on so I recommend getting a couple of these you can find those at Walmart Walgreens I can't guarantee you will find them out get the which called 99-cent store but if you don't have those you could use like a q-tip or maybe a q-tip what some alcohol higher grade would be better like ninety percent or something anyway first step you want to get your vape and get your vape you're gonna hold at one side I'll show it while recording is call me crazy I'll hold it one side and you get the other you light the lighter you basically have to hold it till this gets hot now you wanna be careful how you're holding it because the liquid will start dripping out so you want to make sure your hands will not be touching the liquid because when it falls out its gonna be like hot cuz it's melting scumbag lava high if it gets on you it's gonna burn so this is just example just to show you but be careful how you are aiming the lighter you don't have to buy it like this to use your hand like that just make sure you're getting the metal part and this will take like maybe about a cool minute you'll know it's gonna be hot enough when you start seeing the the chrome tip starts to look like blackened will start to singe the actual chrome tip doesn't actually burn our mounts because it's metal if it's plastic you know melt and that's not good so don't worry about melting we'll be fine you wanna do this for a minute and then after a while should be hot enough to where the liquid should just see I think I'm pretty good already because you could see the gunk previously that was in it there's all that and it was just uh not good and there is a little bit still there I guess you can see how it blackened around there please do not don't don't touch the chrome tape because that's just gonna be hot so just be careful guys cuz may be doing this you know when you uh that's a little bit mess and your system so just be careful with that and once you're done you're gonna want to get the alcohol wipes and I don't have another one right now I could just reuse this one real quick is still kind of moist last week check this out all right so all you gotta do is I just get that thing oh [ __ ] is still hot you just you might want to wait give it like five minutes let it cool off I not still hot but just for the sake of the video lightly touching it with just the cloth it wasn't super hot but it was still hot enough for her gotta be careful and like I said this one's not as dense but once you use the alcohol swab or this in this case I'm using an alcohol pad just make sure you wipe off any excess side from the lighter and make sure you also another thing is to outside the mouthpiece kind of clean inside just in case so you're not you know getting any of the fumes that you're using the lighter from you know and after that well check the inside make sure it's clear if it is go ahead and give it a test suck you know take a test hit basically and like I said be careful cuz this this is real metal so it's gonna conduct heat it's gonna stay warm basically and I will get another one but I'm recording on my iPhone so I can't like pause and restart the video kind of sucks but I'll give it a test suck real quick just to make sure just kind of want to cool it off because it is really still kind of warm I'm not trying to burn my lips it feels ok to get like a quick heat off of me okay making sure all this is off and it may take a little longer there's not really much of a long process just making sure that you get you empty out all that burnt hardened wax that was in the mouthpiece little hole I kind of just still trying to I'll just put in my fridge real quick you know all right I'm just over here in the freezer just not put it on there but just kind of keep it in here so my hands it's gonna be too hot to still get like a test test it over I may see only just cooling it with the ice now basically by now you will you would have been done already and giving your test to it but yeah basically at this point or just moment I'm you you're your vape should be cleared and you should be able to get a test hit half of it and I show you right now I'll do a quick test in oh one other thing to other thing if you have a second alcohol swab or tab I recommend using it on the bottom of here because sometimes there can be a leakage for some reason because the air I live I've had it where this part will get sticky and you also want to clean the inside or nothing of what you have inside and also make sure make sure you clean that content because of that contact I can't hit this part of the vape it's not going to get any it's not even like conduct any electricity to you know melt the vape and for you to take you know the vape it so make sure you clean the bottom of your cartridge as well as the inside of your vaping ping once you do that make sure there's no leakage or no blockage excuse me do this again I would say started off slow you know right now my pan I could go up to a 4.3 volts which isn't much but honestly it's the perfect amount when I'm using it for right now I'll play like a 3.3 now but I'm glad I got 3.5 so I get some juice going take the hit I'll try one more time but it was a pretty good hit it's cuz there's not much in the cartridge to begin with it's kind of like most of it got stuck up here but here we go yeah it still needs it very clean it's like I said make sure you clean inside real good because I feel like some of that suck get in there too you know yeah so make sure you give it a good clean other than that guys that's pretty much how you get your your vape unclogged this is the Alpine one you want to be careful cuz like I said this is heavy hitters you can see how these Alpine ones really it conducts electricity and then they not my bad electricity conducts heat and this rubber band that kind of like a seal for this could maybe break or get worked so you wanna be careful depending on what kind of vape in your head you queue and see here how it looks like there's a coil in there and it's more like a direct passage compared to how the heavy hitters is just like it starts off flourish and then it goes in thin and so I hope this video kind of help you guys out look a little tutorial just kind of found it out yeah so next time guys deuces", "UtdQYChTXQA": "YouTube what is up literally I think the the best I don't know about this new one Fresco's new cartridge it don't have the blue around it no more it says

cartridge video this was actually part 2 and I give a shout out to my boy Christian who actually requested this video you know I feel like when someone requests a part two of a video I'll try and do my best to provide that for him and also I'd like to shout out my 15 members you know I haven't shouted them out in the video lately so for all 15 of you thank you I'll post them right here and all that stuff but getting on to the main topic of this video is fake cartridges obviously you know there's many fake cartridges that have basically just faked from a real company you know we got raw guard and brass knuckles all that stuff and every now and then you get other companies that just come out nowhere that may have been legit kinda cleared I mentioned in my first part video and then another one where one of you guys mentioned that there's another card called Lions breath something popped up in my reddit and for another thing when it comes to fake cartridges and you're very unsure of if you have a real one or a fake one just look it up online and ready is a very very good source for basically anyone uploading their opinion on the cartridge so it's easy to find if these cartridges are faked or being faked QR codes are fake or whatever but the other car in question is called Lions breath and these look pretty legit too QR codes holographic stickers all that [ __ ] and it's very hard for people to tell if that's legit or fake and honestly in my opinion I haven't seen that it like near me I haven't heard of Lions breath until I made that other video on the fake cartridges so I feel like it's my duty and other cannabis content creators to make videos spreading awareness on you know all the fake cartridges that are possibly out there so we can say hopefully save someone's lungs from permanent damage you know I'm not saying they're all bad but when there's so many fakes out there is it really worth the risk you know and this is not this is like he's like counterfeits and fakes aren't like you know if Louie Vuitton or fake then you buy something it doesn't affect your health you know it doesn't even affect your bank account as much as a buying a real Louie Vuitton would you know that's why people buy fakes but when you talk about fake cartridges this is something that we consume that we ingest so it's a very real possibility that maybe you might get permanent damage smoking nice you know backyard cartridges you know and I want to spread awareness on this as much as I can you know I don't really but I like making these videos but I feel like it's my duty as a cannabis content creator to make videos like this so that the public is a lot more safe when it comes to purchasing just anything cannabis you know I feel like I want my channel to be where like people will go to to find legit products just have a good time in smoke you know and hopefully I'm getting close to that goal every day you know I try and you know every now and then I try to make these videos you know and like I said Christian Torres requested a part too so I'll do my best to do it this is not going to be the only video uploaded today this is going to be the first video uploaded today and then I have another UFC video from like a week or two ago that I want to upload so yeah definitely stay tuned for that this is not gonna be the only video you know as much as these videos are important I know that not everyone watches them you know they'd much rather prefer like a smoke session or a vlog so I got you two videos today but this one's gonna be the first one because I feel like this is very important I should really get it out there and yeah shout out to Christian be aware of Lions breath carts you know I'll post it right here this [ __ ] looks pretty legit holographic sticker all that stuff but in that reddit post that came up it said that it was probably the worst tasting cartridge that he's ever had so just you you know as much as packaging influences your opinion on the product you still gotta be careful you know even though the packaging looks so [ __ ] legit you know you gotta be careful and best way to avoid you know getting fakes is to buy from a reputable dispensary if you're in a legal state I mean you didn't have to wait until you know cartridges are in your area but you know just be safe out there guys because permanent lung damage does not sound good you know saying so please if you guys have fake cartridges I'm not saying they're bad I'm just saying that there's a chance they could be bad you know there's a [ __ ] chance you know and it'll be pretty ignorant of you to say that there isn't a chance you know so just be careful other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video like I said there will be another video out today 4:15 p.m. peace out [Music] you", "-DLv-IvXmsU": "okay what's up youtube so if you're here today you're probably wondering how to transfer thc oil from one cartridge to another so you probably have like one broken cartridge and you're trying to get it into a cartridge you know works so you don't waste your money so i know a lot of you found me in the first place because of this video right here so here's the thing youtube took it down because all they said was that i violated their policy they didn't even explain why i didn't save this video unfortunately but on the page that youtube shows me my deleted video it lets me play through it i'm cartridge i have dispensary the other day and i'm re-uploading it now and so the quality is a little shitty because i have my phone recording my laptop screen basically so the quality is a little shitty but you'll get the gist um and i basically just tried to cut out the reason why i think youtube deleted the video so hopefully there are no problems this time because this video helped a lot of people so i'm gonna try to re-upload it now and hopefully we don't run into any issues all right you guys so i bought this [ __ ] brand new graham cartridge at a dispensary the other day and it doesn't work like i connected it to a brand new battery that i just bought and it didn't work so i tried it on my friend's battery it didn't work and i was like cool so i've been looking up tutorials on how the [ __ ] to fix this and nothing that i'm trying is working and i guess you can transfer the oil over i didn't know that so um i didn't spend money for no reason so i'm little miss [ __ ] i'm trying to not waste 50 [ __ ] dollars is makeshifting so what we're gonna do is because i already had like two of these a few things to mention step one um untwisting the cartridge doesn't work with every single cartridge uh the ones that i had in the video were happy stick and for the most part i got a lot of questions on how you actually remove the cartridge cap you just twist it that's it like it might be a little sticky because the oil but that's it you just twist it um and then make sure that you're wearing gloves so that you're not like so you don't burn your ham with the hairdryer i honestly think that youtube took my video down for a safety violation because there was some things i mentioned in the video that i didn't clarify and i think it got flagged for safety reasons and when i said wear gloves i mean rubber gloves like the kind i'm wearing in the video not like latex plastic gloves i mean like actually protect your hands gloves the kind i was wearing in the video are actually dishwashing gloves but that protects your hands so basically i heat up the oil and this one with the [ __ ] hair dryer and then i pour it into the one that actually works i haven't tried smoking it yet so we don't know if it's gonna work or not so stay tuned okay so you take the one that doesn't work heat it up once it gets to a consistency that it'll start moving easily and you grab your cartridge that does work kind of let this stuff start to fall and i just take it and let it fall into there okay so once i get it to like that point take the hair dryer again because that [ __ ] metal thing is in the way i guess one bright side to having to redo this video is that i had some copyrighted music right here even though it was hella [ __ ] funny but it's fine um now at least i won't have a copyright strike you specify this but your hairdryer needs to be on heat not cool obviously i thought that was a given but you never know um so now you can see the oil is transferring into the empty cartridge so it'll take you a couple tries to do this because you need to keep reheating up the oil but i'll be back after i like transfer it all over um and we'll see if it works all right y'all let's put the cap back on unfortunately i couldn't transfer all of it over but see i still got a good amount there which i got like half a gram which is [ __ ] annoying because i had a full gram but since i tried this twice already i lost some of my weed but it's okay all right and then i didn't actually feel like going outside to smoke to show you guys the after result because i can't smoke in my apartment complex so i would have to like go all the way like outside outside like far away from the apartments so not doing all that but it does work i swear by it i promise um this method is 100 solid so yeah so yeah thanks for watching i'm really sorry the video got deleted and i know this quality is probably shitty but at least i was able to get it back up for you guys i really hope youtube doesn't delete it again because i think i fixed the safety violations that it got deleted for um but yeah thank you guys so much for watching like comment subscribe i love you guys so much peace out", "HxbthKzHWNE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is another fake cartridge video I recently came across this fake cartridge if you're curious about the title about fake cartridges evolving let me get to that first of all my homie my homie comes up to me and asked me if this cartridge was legit or not not like actually physically coming up to me but like through a facebook Messenger and this brand the so-called brand that he brings up is can i clear he tells me that the oil was slightly pinkish which was like a red flag right off the bat you know you never oil that's pinkish come on like bias the the branding question is called can you clear and why ice titled this video fake cartridges are evolving I mentioned it in my lives recently so if you guys were in there you probably know what I'm talking about but basically when you think about fake cartridges you think about think face or supreme babes and a really good indicator of them being fake is that they're using copyrighted material maybe like cartoon characters from a beloved cartoon series or smartcards you know taking a brand's name and running with it with their own thing you know basically taking the brands likeness and applying it to themselves anything with Bank faves just their names already give off a red flag but this one can a clear I'll post it right here it's probably the most out of all the fake cartridges the most legit looking and I'd like to mention that you can just tell by the box shape that is very similar to the box shape of dang babes mind you that the packaging outside appearance is different it's still the same box shape everything's still the same and before I start this any further I do not have never tried a canna clear I've never heard of canna clear some people probably would assume that maybe it's a real brand then then they kind of just you know the black market kind of just took their name and went with it in the into the black market that could be the case but as far as I know my friend came up to me with candy clear said it was pinkish oil and it was like 30 bucks okay first of all you know I told him go to the club you know you can get a cartridge from the club for $30 now you know I'll be it's not gonna be we're all guarding quality but it's still gonna be good I got the free cannabis cart for 2350 at one point you know I just want to make this video you know I know a lot of this debate related deaths have actually been slowing down now that coronavirus has been here I don't know if that's uh actually like you know goes together in any way but I'm pretty late with this because I went to read it and they said kind of clear six months ago was faked so this is something new to me like I said my friend brought it to me I was unaware of a brand like this existed I know there's other brands out there but I feel like this one is probably the most dangerous one because it's it looks [ __ ] legit you know so as I'd like to just make this video and you know tell you guys let you guys know beforehand like myself you know I'm know probably some of you guys have probably heard of this brand already but like I said I only heard about it just a few weeks ago and I figured some people are like me as well and don't know about this brand so it's good to spread awareness for those of you who tried canna clear let me know your opinions in the comments down below you know did you have a good experience where'd you get it from did you get it from the club but just be aware you know that there are fakes out there and that's the thing when it comes to fakes you know it really just makes you paranoid it's kind of like this whole coronavirus thing where you don't know who has it you know and I don't know it's just just be aware guys you know I'm not saying all of them are bad but like I said there's fakes out there what raw garden is kind of different because raw garden if you go to a legit Club you don't have to worry about fakes at all you know so I know some dispensaries have had fake cartridges and I would assume that those dispensaries were either non licensed dispensaries or that they were just ignorant to the fact that maybe they just bought stuff thinking that it was real you know but like I said can I clear it's crazy it's dangerous you know I'm saying can it clear it's a very dangerous fake black-market cartridge because like I said it is it looks legit you know it really does but like I said the box shape is still the same as database very same [ __ ] all you're gonna see pink oil I mean need i say more oh yes I'm gonna take a sip of this t be aware of can of clear guys okay so if you enjoyed the video or if this helped you in any way you know please feel free to like it if you want you know I'm saying but other than that have a nice day [Music]", "UZ0zeLFENp8": "hey guys welcome to thc productions my name is daniel and this is my first video today we're going to be reviewing the muhammad's we got a hybrid today it's an orange i'm pineapple gonna lie to you i did smoke on it a little bit just to try and it should got me loaded as [ __ ] as you know um the real ones will take you straight to the muhammad's website you put the code in and you're all set i'm open all right it comes in this as you see hold thick oil doesn't move at all", "U3ZldGnlGvw": "what is going on guys it's your boy 7g back at it again with another review for us so for today's review guys we're just gonna hop straight into it man we know we haven't done a review and so long I've been kind of trying to like you know since its first of all it's the end of the year so there's not really too many other cartridges to try out and plus I am if you guys didn't know trying to evolve my content I'm not only doing cartridge reviews anymore because I kind of want it I want to do more you know I want to do more stuff so that's why I've been expanding so I've been doing a lot more collabs and more hablok sessions a lot of [ __ ] that normally wouldn't you do right but I do miss those reviews man I do definitely miss doing reviews because I don't know I feel like since that's my thing that's my thing there's there's so many people out there that tell me what like you're you're the originator of the car reviews brother like I've been watching you you're the first one to with your car because I was like I mean I didn't say the people said it man I'm kind of happy you know that people kind of know me for that because you know that's that is where I started technically some reviewing cartridges and I'm kind of I'm so happy that you know I built I built this platform from literally just reviewing cartridges but like this thing is pretty amazing he's pretty amazing so it's getting straight into the room you guys today we got a special call I have a special collab man I've been waiting to review this for the channel for so long and if I was able to go out and comp a couple of these because these are not easy to find man these are not easy to find anywhere if you're in California if you're over the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal state and you just have this make sure you guys try it man because honestly it's pretty crazy so happening - they're so friendly farms cool friendly farms X alien lab - Cola this is the area 41 hybrid and then I've I've already achieved if you guys haven't watched my top 5 cards of 2019 that video is up in that video will be down in the description below but yeah like I said I cut I copped a couple of these and I already like I literally just started chipping around this this is by far one of my favorite cartoons you know just because the taste is phenomenal everything about this cartoon is phenomenal and all right so like I said I'm gonna slap it on here when you guys get it you guys are gonna get the black tip with a little alien engraving in it and full spectrum you already know the oils gonna be a little bit darker no need to worry though full spectrum if you guys don't already know what it is pretty much you're getting every single spectrum of the cannabis plant from the taste to the feel to every pretty much everything row all inside of a pen so that's pretty amazing so I know a lot of you like to see the packaging and stuff so let me go ahead and give you guys a little closer the close-up look honestly dude friendly farms is doing some sick-ass things with with their packaging because mostly all their packaging looks like this but this alien labs co-op specifically is pretty damn sick dude I'm not gonna lie this alien labs co-op box is pretty unique dude honestly in in terms of artwork it's pretty sick it's pretty sick alright now that you guys saw the close-up of that man let's get to chief and boys I'm pretty much in this review we're gonna be media as the full taste test with a full body effects high head effects all that stuff what I like about it what I don't like about it what I wish they would have done all that good stuff you guys already know how we get down with the review guys so I'm excited man I'm excited like honestly this is this is so this is a whole different type of cartridge like honestly the taste in this is such unexplicable like insane it's insane like I've never tasted anything like this so give me you guys the full rundown on this review so area 41 alien labs ex-friend firms let's get it cheers guys and by the way if you guys do end up copying the proprietary battery from the feliforms I do recommend using a green setting anything higher than that which is I believe like the orange setting it's too hot it's too hot you're burning it too much you're wasting your oil it's always good to get such a little a little lower temp but obviously you're still going to get the clock so cheers guys if you guys are over the age of 18 21 whatever it is in your legal state I don't want any little underage kids in our that stuff in here you know we can't even enjoy it so choose [Music] so tasty bro all right so that my battery literally just died after that second hit back with that first hit so if you guys didn't see too much of clouds it was because that my the battery is dead so when also that brings up to another topic if when you use it as battery I do recommend charging all the way because it makes such a difference man that hits our way Milky Way flatter when it's fully charged compared to when it's obviously low and low and battery so let's go ahead and test hopefully this is fully charged simple choosers you could definitely tell when it's fully charged man the hit is just so much more strong I dude I'm telling you alright if I had it compared I know I said that the taste is not it's very very distinct you know I can't really compare it to anything but if I had to compare to something it has to be fall under like the lines of the cannabis drive terpenes from Suzy like those pods are so Turkey and so flavorful and when you hit them they're just so gassy and you honestly only taste like the straight-up but dude you just just trade it like straight bud no no preservatives no additives into that [ __ ] whoo shout to hydro hydro flaps if he has her oh geez on the challenge guys know I've been having this thing since day one right so uh for that first first two second initial hit you know right off the bat I feel my eyes getting heavy and that's that that has a lot to say dude because those two hits were very very very small in terms of the vapor products that you know yeah so for it to have that much packing so it's such a little hit it's pretty crazy so and the taste like I said super gassy super Turkey you don't taste no oil as it doesn't taste boilie and all I can like dis lids they usually do and it's something that you want to keep on hitting honestly and something's just so distinct that you're like hmm well you just want to keep tasting it because you've never tasted it before so cheers guys let's go in for another hit and then right away you want to enter your lungs they're like the longest benches instant dude it instantly guy I want to coughing so and on that exhale I'm getting like a little like some undertones of you know how like when you take like a pretty wanna temp tab you get those little it's taste like Turkey dude it tastes like turkey warm Turks in there you know and it just like fills up and lingers in your mouth and it's like cow like like like if you just baked some lie president you feel me like not not not cooked it bake it it you know when you bake something you get that aroma you get that full flavor taste that's kind of like what like you know baking out here boys I know I don't know if that makes any sense but you know making up new terms every day so when you go in on another one man because this thing is phenomenal I can't get off of it so even what I know I said let's not go to higher setting but I just want to see I just want to see how it compares on this cartridge so choose oh yeah that is what that is definitely way too hot like it tastes a little bit more burn so than anything not even burnt but a little bit too hot in my opinion like a hot attempt ugh I like those little lower temp ones and honestly man I know I keep saying dab and this is a pimp but this pen literally makes you feel like you're taking a DAB and the funny thing is I've tasted their full spectrum salt and it's literally it tastes exactly similarly super super similar like this taste that this taste that friendly firm produces is very very unlike be replicable and like it's kind of like like just just straight-up fire dude I don't know how to explain it like the taste like I keep trying to like bring out what the what the pinpoint tastes this but I just can't I just can't mmm so like I said the hi man I'm definitely feeling it more drawn my head than I am my body and then again it we've only been pinning in for like five to seven minutes so I'm pretty sure the longer I wait the more I'll feel their effects and it's a good smoke man it's a good smoke definitely you know and something's so exotic this isn't something gonna be picking up on the regular man definitely not getting picking up gonna be picking this up on a regular bed because the price there the price range is a little bit more up there you feel me compared to other cartridges that's why a lot of people don't really mess with with filming phones because they go into the shot they see the prices and then they're like the bounce I'll go to rock garden whatever whatever the lower end price is you know so but if you guys are in the market you know got a little bit extra money that you know is there the Christmas and maybe you guys got some extra Christmas money and you guys are in the looks for new cartridge alien laps X from the forums definitely check them out so we're gonna end this review out here guys I know it's it feels a little bit different reviewing this time I don't know what it is I just maybe I'm falling out of the reviews you know I feel like a lot of people have been coming out of cartridges so there's not there hasn't really been a lot of search for a new cartridge reason I feel like the time that I got into it was perfect because I was when cartridges were popping you know I got my I got my people and I got my viewers locked down you know things like that I think it's time to now progress on to the next thing which is you know going out session event doing big big whole lives with bigger people mr. TC you has seen that collab with Edwin sparks you guys having go ahead and go check that I'll put that description below and you know which is we're just working man we're just working we're just we're still trying to find ourselves in this little wee tube thing because I wanna say this is still as a hobby I'm not taking this thing too serious and I don't plan on taking it too serious because honestly I have bigger things to myself and then just only YouTube if you me I got way big things I hope hopefully you guys get to see those things I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be able to bring them to YouTube soon enough and see ya guys well we're gonna have that video here if you guys enjoyed it go ahead and leave a like comment support let's try to reach 500 likes of yours Kim and they'll be amazing so we'll catch you guys later you do", "rUScX_Qlvq4": "today I'd like to do a quick how-to video pertaining vape pens and specifically a vape pen that utilizes a prefilled cartridge so this one in particular is from pure hemp botanicals and you can purchase this one of two ways you have this prefilled cartridge this is has the CBD in it for you you could purchase this cartridge by itself and that would be a perfect option for those that already have a vaping device at home so people that already have some sort of vape pen vape battery bait mod now the key there is that this cartridge fits on a 5-10 thread that is what that's referring to it's called a 5-10 thread so as long as you have a 5-10 thread you could put this on your personal vape device if you do not already have a personal vape device of any sorts then you can purchase this as a kit off of pure hid botanicals calm so as a kit you would get your pen slash battery because this part is rechargeable you would get your prefilled cartridge and you would get the USB that recharges this pen for you so that's what comes in the kit and the way that this works is you just take the cartridge place it on top of your pen slash battery you just screw that right on there and to turn the pen on you're gonna click it five times in a row one two three four five you'll see that blue came right on that is indicating that it's on and ready you are going to simply press this button and inhale at the same time as you're pressing the button this is what is heating up the cartridge for it to vaporize so that's how the mechanics of how that works and I will do a little demonstration so you can do whatever feels good to you if it feels good to do a long draw if it feels good to do maybe a couple of light draws in a row whatever is feeling good you'll know it's working for you there's a lot of different style of pens I do like that this one has a button because I feel like it gives it a little bit more of temperature control but any pen that is 510 thread will work with this if you if you find that your pen is dying or it is dead all you do is you take your USB piece you're going to screw that right in and then you could put this directly into your computer if you do have a USB port in your computer you could use something like this this is just from my phone and I would just put that directly in there and then plug it into the wall and it will recharge for me so that's how that works and as far as taking care of your pin you want to be mindful of not to keep it in high heat like you wouldn't want to keep it in a hot car it's just making it so it's more likely to leak or have problems um if you do ever find that something sticky or leaking I just clean mine with a little bit of rubbing alcohol from around the house super easy keeps it all clean and nice and then it is a common if so for instance like I've had this I've had this cartridge for a while I've gotten lots of uses out of it and I still have a ton of oil left um but it's common for the oil to change color over exposure to light and even heat so you know this started off a little bit of a lighter color and over time it's gone a little bit darker that's nothing to be concerned about that's totally normal it doesn't mean the oil is bad by any means so this one was cool because I chose caramel which is one my favorite flavors of terpenes that they offer but you could choose any other terpene that sounds good to you you can get this device at pure hemp botanicals calm and you can use my coupon code for friends and family which is Lanie 15 and that will save you 15% its la whaai in IE one five and you go you can put that coupon code in and um what a lot of people are interested in in this product for and what a lot of people are using it for is that fast relief you know CBD can provide especially when inhaling it like this like a vaporizer it can provide quick relief for things like nausea or inflammation maybe you're in pain um or maybe you're you're having anxiety this can really give a calming effect so people use this in a wide variety of ways I get a lot of questions about this in particular and that's why I wanted to make a video so I hope that this does help you I hope you got some insight out of it it's pretty straightforward once you know all the pieces and I'm really excited to see the amount of people that are interested in vaping especially interested in vaping to either wean themselves off of cigarettes or you know they're using it just as a stress reliever and you know it's just a lot more natural than a lot of other things out there you know so it's pretty exciting that this is available so if you have any questions at all please let me know and thank you so much for watching today and I hope you got something out of this Pease love Lanie ganja", "C0I-fw0LvPM": "what's up YouTube welcome back extinct 420 here with another medical marijuana review got my new uniform today that's what took me so long to put out this next video yo your school shirt it's gonna be my new uniform for all my videos I might get another one I'll put the link in the description just the case you guys want one today we're checking out some of the cheapest the best vape pens you could get on the market right now coming from Liberty Health Sciences that's gonna be the THC count on that and then on this one this is gonna be a jack hair it's pretty good stuff I'm smoking on this you spin here I've had these a couple days so this is gonna be the gelato mmm tastes it tastes delicious these are the reason I say these are the cheapest is because these are $35 for 400 milligrams of THC and a lot of people they are misconstrued about how they sell them and whatnot dispensaries usually sell them by the milligram counts and not like half gram or grams like you see all these street cartridges have in Liberty Health Sciences is selling these which have 400 milligrams THC for 35 compared to true leave that it would be 47 for 350 or cure leaf which is they get a hundred and fifty for 18 or even move which has 250 for 35 or sir Terra which has 250 for 35 but that has a disposable pen with it this you have to have your own little vape pen I got this is for free from a friend of mine Wow it's killer right there mm-hmm you could check out the app hmm the oil in that stuff nice golden color it doesn't move you can hold it upside down for as long as you want it'll move eventually but all these cart Street carts are ugly and brown all right we're gonna try this Jack Harry this one's unopened this is what a car looks like fresh out of the pack 400 milligrams THC like I said this one it's got like a fruity taste this gelato got that delicious oh man alright we gonna try this Jack hare I didn't even tried this yet I had the flower in my last video it was pretty good I actually still have a butt of that left I'm saving it you know special occasion not so special occasion just saving it alright I'm already ripped you off that [ __ ] gelato you know I'm tell y'all what this does cuz I'm ripped definitely not like uh that one's like a citrusy taste that gelato this one has more of a berry taste man I'm ripped y'all the first batch I got which is this gelato had 75% THC the second batch 87% THC so I mean they're both really good yeah so there you have it guys these are definitely the best bang for your buck if you're going for any kind of dispensary cartridges in Florida I mean you could pay I mean yeah these people on the streets and say that oh I could get a gram for 40 or 50 but that's like of like Eric Conn says some hot dog water or something I mean hot dog water probably be better for you but I mean it's not that expensive look you off y'all get invest in your in your card which cost two hundred and seventy eight dollars and then you can get the $78 discount earth no $75 discount on $150 so I got five of these cartridges for $100 so that's that's two and a half grams for 100 bucks compared to these fake-ass half grams y'all get big-ass grams y'all getting for full 50 or 40 or whatever and this is real legit delicious dispensary lab tested quality stuff that's just you know my opinion my channel is here for people who are curious about getting their card and don't want to get ripped off or waste their money and don't know what they're getting because like you would like to see what they get before they buy it and none of these dispensaries show you any flour or any any cartridges that you can't taste it at the dispensary so that's what I'm here for guys but I'm gonna get off here I'm gonna smoke this Luke's tendo right here that's coming up next I mean I'm ripped but I like to smoke so I mean we don't get it and here check out the shirt y'all want it I'm gonna leave a link in the description thanks guys catch y'all next time", "P7aLZ7R5RSg": "you can scratch all ten of them down nothing hi guys welcome back to my channel hope you guys are having an amazing day I'm gonna little awkward position don't think that I'm driving I'm my vehicle my wife is driving though today I am going to be as you guys can see by the title eating a thousand milligrams of edibles from heavy hitters those by far definitely are my I filled in the record those definitely are my favorite edibles they're so gummy they don't they're not weedy at all not too sugary either they're like pretty good I also brought well I didn't bring you my wife brought it for me cuz she knew that I was gonna be thirsty so here we have this big underarm where uh like water it looks like a water tank but it's like cute and yeah water right here prepared we have something's to take care of so - already forgot what we have to do you have to go get our phones replace and then we're probably gonna grab something to eat really sorry yeah we're probably gonna go grab something hopefully that edibles kick in before I eat you know and then we're probably gonna get back home but I'll definitely keep you guys updated so yeah I'm like oh it's not even falling and I was like I did that ugliest face right now it could change 20 milligrams only five pieces a total of I mean 25 20 milligrams each piece and there's five pieces that total up 100 plus 400 milligrams and a pack in my hand focused on me by seven [Music] like I said I'm not driving around she's gonna help because she don't [ __ ] with edible she ready smokes and she's having experience with edible so that's just like I know for her I'm like you should just try like one piece to see how it makes you feel you know not start up with a hoe ass pack don't like start off with a little bit and then make if you need more to use your eye you but no and I'm like no and either strawberry flavor years and like eating candy that much like ever we're nothing here back I have finished all five now what we're seeing to finish you know extra eyes are better even though light it sometimes we'll go we'll be going on like all right it's like all right second bag ding-ding-ding so like usually you would go out like town a lot to a lei or whatever two more hours though and [Music] eating a thousand million the process thinking I don't remember we done the mama I do remember Susie where a couple sleepers in already like I had never seen a cartridge like feature that high because you never take that many acres you only like you coulda cured there you know yeah but like you hit it a lot I love finding like new things like that say I had weed that I didn't even know I had and I find it find it like a month later or like a card like I have a full ass [ __ ] full gram of a cartridge but I didn't even know about and I found it today I was looking through a bag MRT um slowly moving my thumb as well more like I have stitches though I should probably go back like Friday or so to get them removed just to make sure give me a little bit more days have you guys ever had stitches or anything like broken I've never broken a bone but I didn't have this incident this year at age of 21 where I had like black me I don't know what it felt somebody said it was black free-cos at me hello video on it and then my thumb got [ __ ] sliced the [ __ ] I sliced that [ __ ] and wait till what happens next week we'll find out next week no wonder sounds good my astrology said I'm going to find a new pet a straight anymore something's gonna come into my life and I'm gonna keep it but I can't keep it be sure to keep it because it's maybe it's a sign over here alright so actually change of plans so due to the cove it they're not allowing two people they're limiting limited e limiting people so my wife went in I'm gonna go ahead and finish the rest of the 300 milligrams I guess it's meant to be back to back and then I'm so knocked out that I can't hear that she's like trying to open the door and knock on the window and I'm just all [ __ ] blown and so into my sleep I don't you [ __ ] I definitely prefer chocolate Marlo but even there like eating so much chocolate after a while we just like oh you guys and it's all tired I just ate a little snack bully from the brew babe that's a car brand I don't know what it's called a classroom yes tomorrow [Music] the right forever edibles what they're gonna become look not so good anymore because for more one to three 400 600 700 800 then good day friend I have another one if I don't get that [ __ ] look it you can scratch all 10 of them down nothing ah nothing and it's only 1:30 so let's see how she goes for the rest of the day because a lot of times she had a thousand milligrams more than twenty minutes she was asleep but right now we have [ __ ] to do so I'll get our phones so we can't I can't go to sleep you know but wait till we get home what's up guys it's curtain 936 I'm gone we got home and I definitely knocked out sort of have food unlocked out till 8:00 I woke up and then I started eating while we started eating and yeah I just feel like super loved definitely feel it in my body and I can definitely go to super soon well yeah it's pretty chill and would I recommend eating it in the whole process yeah no you crazy yeah let me know down below if you how what's the most edibles you've paid in the Surfing until next time bye", "pGTxdIoeNrQ": "ayyyy YouTube Alex here back again I figure out it shoot that video see I got the kangertech here miles will do the video on the critical purple kush this is a reserved line now the reserved line is their top shelf top quality highest you know there they take really good pride in the reserved line this is a half gram cartridge critical purple cush is the strain you see those little letters it is coming in at like 81 percent but the THC this is a LLR cartridge liquid live resin said reserve line that means it's there top top [ __ ] top top of the shelf top line stuff let's get it open and I'll put it on the kangertech but you know what I think of this now I did pay a hefty tax on this you guys are gonna talk [ __ ] like I said I paid $70 for a half gram of this gal lr cartridge yeah 70 bucks for the half gram of this reserve line you don't believe me go on the menu and look it up yourself and sandwich it cost a try ziri for a half gram cartridge of critical purple kush live resin cartridge it's expensive but I figured I'd never had it and you know you only live once so I'm give it a try like that sound nice oh look at that it's even got that it says reserved believe it says reserve reserve line it looks like a little bit different if you see the cartridge here it says reserve and read not your typical looking Cresco cartridge you guys know the Crisco it's got a black mouthpiece on it it's got a black mouthpiece nice very nice looking cartridge fresco reserve line LLR wow that's a nice looking cartridge of hoots a blue for the indica built all the way to the top I like that it says reserved in red and you see it says Cresco you guys know that and usually this is a clear mouthpiece this one's black on here no very nice-looking cartridge to get it open take this rubber thing off the bottom very exciting critical purple push reserve line LLR cartridge looks real nice on the pen Cheers happy Halloween still is xxx same day taste hmm a sweet grape taste reminds me almost like maybe like a grape now later I'm kind of like that like a sweet but hint of a grayish kind of taste but still what the kind of cushy flower taste man that's good really good let me get another hit I don't want to make this video too long very nice cartridge critical purple kush by Cresco liquid live resin cartridge reserve line you guys know you get another head that was nice oh yeah dang that's good it reminds me of a now later or hubba bubba you know the bubble gum hubba bubba the grape man that's good I don't even understand how that could be so good like that oh wow yeah price is a little bit hefty but if you ever got a few extra bucks to spare I definitely recommend try the reserve line by Cresco their reserve line cartridges they only have this one I think and they had a blueberry space cake it was another one or something this one had a higher THC level that's why I grabbed this one critical purple cush mmm that tastes so good you know more about what I thought down in the description let me know what you guys are smoking on happy Halloween I probably upload this video tomorrow on Halloween Day so if I don't see you tomorrow happy Halloween be safe if you out there trick-or-treating with your kids yeah reserved critical purple kush by Cresco very tasty very good likening the cartridge hits like a champ very nice taste yeah I'm gonna wrap this video up you guys said you know what you guys are smoking on let you know a little bit more about what this feeling was like and so forth down to the descriptions but I could probably tell you it's probably going to be pretty darn good there's the stats for you again peace I'm out", "prSd4jwLKHE": "yo guys what is going on it's your boy and we are finally back after two to three long old months with another cart review first things first I want to get out of the way why I haven't uploaded in three months I actually haven't been smoking at all in those three months I did a week ago with my girlfriend who came into town but that was it there's two reasons I quit smoking one was because I just wasn't getting high as I wanted no matter what it was like flour or dabs or carts even edibles edibles don't work on me for some reason oh no about that one but quartz edibles or carts tabs and flour were the main things that I smoked and none of them were getting me a nice high that I wanted or you know used to get so I decided to take a tolerance break and then with that tolerance break I also ended up trying to get a job at an airport with one of my teachers but they ended up not hiring anybody that applied because they just couldn't get enough work for them so that fell through so we are finally back to our normal routine being a stupid-ass stoner so you guys are gonna get tons of videos coming up I already have the next one planned it's gonna be the same brand as today so if you guys heard that then you already know that's what the next video is you know I could get this train or anything like that so you're gonna have to wait for that one but today's video is gonna be on a cool brand that I've never tried before it's been highly requested it's been probably like 10 times I've gotten okras to do this they're more on the expensive side of carts but they're pretty potent at least I've heard and they're pretty nice but this one is the item 9 labs it is a pink champagne it's up 500 milligrams so half gram card that's pure indica so it's no hybrid no sativa nothing like that just indica it's coming out at 94 95 percent potency on the THC count which is a crazy high number I don't know if I've ever gotten that number on any one of my cards I feel like sweethearts has had like 80 90 percent somewhere on the box I don't remember that exactly but somewhere like that I remember selects are like 86 it sound like 90 maybe I think I seen a new one of select so this is I think as far as I know the most potent cart I ever tried on this channel it could be wrong but I do think so so I'm super excited to try this um I ended up getting this cart on the website they say there's $44.99 eight carts which is pretty expensive for a half gram right when I can get a baby pen or something like that for maybe 35 well I have the other one right in front of me I can pick it up so you guys can't see it but I got this one in one warm which will be the next video for 45 so we got 20 to 50 for a half gram part of item 9 which is kind of crazy so I couldn't pass on this deal I really wanted another car because like I haven't had one in a minute so I was like why not we're just gonna send it so they went in but I just said an online order with all this [ __ ] so yeah so let's go ahead and just pop this back wheel we're gonna get right into the review and we're postponing this oh it comes into like a little tube boxes just stop catalogues nothing nothing special this tube is kind of neat it's like a little boob tube almost there it goes cool nice little - a little protective case so well I already smell it well it's got a black tip so that's kind of cool there's the wax trying to block my [ __ ] ugly ass face yeah looks pretty nice nice quality wax is pretty dang thick I don't think it's moving at all it might be no no looks pretty steady yeah that's a solid car trippin I have heard a lot of good things about this brand so I'm pretty excited I do have a little bit of high expectations for it could be good be dog [ __ ] we never know but we're gonna go ahead and throw it on that canal battery here so local dispensary I don't know if they have others in other states if they do let me know all right well for 20 seconds so might as well her four minutes 20 seconds might as well hit one now so let's take the first set guys choose okay so right off the bat it's pretty smooth honestly it's not like over empowering or anything like that the taste it's like like an earthy taste almost a little nature it's kind of lacking any other flavor anything like that which is weird because I think on unli fee said I had like a fruity taste or something like that I don't get that out of all you guys might if you try this and again this is pink champagne the indica but yeah it's it's a nice nice car I don't mind the taste actually guys already know we'll just do a quick hydration breaker oh yeah it's been a minute since I said that I don't try to think this is the first one I've ever had I think I had the black tip in the old circle [ __ ] mouthpiece whatever you guys call that um so that's neat I'm not gonna lie guys I'm already feeling it my tolerance is a little low obviously cuz I did take that break but I also smoked two karts in the process mine and my girlfriend's so not I didn't smoke the whole things obviously we shared up with friends in her and stuff so I'm not like you know like a fresh fresh you know so I can I could handle it okay those funny I'll tell you guys after we take another one if you guys wanna hear a little story time it's doing over truth this is a simple little hit right there yeah I actually really like this car it's a really nice anyway so the little story time we have for you guys I was on FaceTime with my girlfriend Anesti her name is Kaori she probably watching this if you are again um anyway so I was on FaceTime with her and we're just talking we're like talking about her we're gonna smoke when she comes out here she doesn't live in the same state as me unfortunately and I'm like we're like talk and we were like oh yeah we should smoke and do all this stuff while we're here you know like chill like okay I'm down like even though I haven't smoked in a while like whatever we're gonna do it anyway so I have a card graveyard basically it's just like a bunch of old piled up cards and I just never throw it away cuz I'm too lazy and I end up like going through him and looking which ones have like the tiny little little bit amount that he's just never end up hitting and since they were sideways they all kind of merged together in the little bottom part right on her oh man so they always work out right well my don't-ask decides to hit some of them I hit in one and I'm like I'm not feeling [ __ ] so I'm like okay I hit it again still nothing I hit it again nothing less like after 20 minutes right I hit it again five minutes later every single one all four hits just hit me like a bus I've never green doubt in my however many years of smoking weed except for that one night and that was like a couple weeks ago never have I ever green doubt but that one night and I'm so upset about it you win some and you lose some I guess and I definitely lost it yeah yeah it is what it is don't say all right guys let's do one more hit and then we're gonna call it a video you guys know what three hits a vid nothing less sometimes more not today though all right guys last one oh no we straight we straight that one that one I came back up that was not a good not a good one I also want to let you guys know Rena I am I am so gone item hi it's been five minutes it's like literally like yeah it's been less than five minutes I've been doing this with you I hit this card at least less than five minutes since I hit the card my bet I am [ __ ] joint guys I highly recommend item nine labs again this is this one is the pink pink champagne oh it's right there I'm so sorry it's stupid pink champagne right there half gram I got them for 45 each I'm sorry they're 45 each normally I got them to for 45 so basically a BOGO I got them at Emerald dispensary here in Phoenix Arizona with my med card of course buy off anybody so yeah if you're in Phoenix go check out on world they have some really good deals also real quick I just want to say stay safe with all this like coronavirus you if you guys are sick I hope you guys get better hope you guys you know fully recovering the wheels and your family gets any any health problems that you come soon so with that being said yeah I you know wish you guys the best you have a good one thanks for sticking around appreciate it", "BMSHUp-OMew": "what up guys it's my clear three back here in another cartridge review I know

more so I'm more of a strain specific dude but Abe I try whatever like as long as it's like some good stuff and evil lab out here in Colorado is known to make good cartridges all right let's get into the details you can see it says the total cannabinoids is 80% which is okay I mean it's pretty good actually THC seventy six point six seven percent and there's no CBDs in it and this is that it's called colors people lab has three different kinds one called alchemy a full spectrum 100% cannabis derived this is a hundred percent a hundred percent plant derived flavors so anyway let's just get into it man do the unboxing by the way I like I really like the packaging like so is that they really care about like their customers and they really promote their product comes in a little tube like this again all the back all the health information batch number you know all that legal stuff tech you got to do and she I mean screw this battery today I'm not the same as last video I'm still using this smoking dragon battery it rips well that's all I could say like I've tried different batteries like a Willie Nelson battery and anyway here we go here's the actual Clarke real looking nice cartridge says evil lab right at the top and like there's virtually no arable move like this is sealed all the way to the top just show you how it looks up it's a white background no runny oil so

cannabis review today i'm going to be doing a review on a cartridge i'll be doing a review on a select co2 oil cartridge the strain is cinex which i believe is a cross between cindy 99 and pineapple express so um i grabbed this one because this one looks really really nice you've seen it you can check my other videos if not but um check out the other co2 oil carts from them and they look like some standard co2 oil like fairly dark oil this one looks incredible same price same like batch as all the other co2 oils but it looked great so let me turn the camera around and show you then i'll take a couple puffs [Music] hmm [Applause] [Music] hey [Music] wow [Music] alrighty so let's get into this um first off i'll correct myself by saying it is actually a cross between cindy 99 or cinderella 99 and vortex i had not heard of vortex prior to this but seems like a good strain um very interested after just reading a quick leafly article about this strain seems like it's heavy on um less on the mirror scene in the cardiophiline which i get bored of seems like it's heavy on pinene and limonene potentially which i really like so first off trying to make more videos but struggling to find the time and motivation and also more so just not get greedy because i recently just bought like a gram of six star hash rosin that i was wanting to make a video on but i just got into it way too quick and didn't even take a picture prior to me opening it so i feel like that's not the best way to make a video so i'll buy another gram eventually and get a video on it and it was super great um but first let's start with what we have here cine cynix um so let's see it first off amazing for their co2 oil you normally don't get anything besides like that dark black oil basically which i'm not against for the price that it goes at it's pretty good stuff wow that's one of the best cards i've had in a good while um definitely has like a little base layer i always notice a heavier notes first a little bit of like that peppery taste but it is strong with the definitely taste a good bit of pinene in there and then maybe some like lemonade as well lemony is always light to me so if there's a lot i couldn't tell anyways that really really evens it out it's not it's always like such a standard boilerplate co2 oil taste which is a lot like whiskey or like there's usually a lot of humiliating in there this one it's got i mean it's got the slightest bit of that taste to it but it has so many other like terpenes going on that it overpowers that easily and that it's good it's uh it's very citrusy but it's like a heavy citrus it reminds me of grape with but it doesn't it's not like grape flavor it just reminds me of grapes grapes like a heavy fruity taste to me it's like um orange and mango is kind of mixed with like a peppery peppery main taste yeah so that's all i got on this one really but i mean that is a solid cart right there for their select co2 line highly highly um hats off to them because that's really really well done so thanks for watching i'm going to try and get more videos out especially some new brands not just the same old stuff but unfortunately there's not many new brands to work with so yeah i'll see what i can do but thanks for watching and grab one of these check it through the window of the cart first but even the dark ones look are pretty decent in my opinion but i mean if you see one like this go for it alright thanks for watching you'll have a great", "z8Ga2A0sTwQ": "[ __ ] Boise man and today I got a wee review I was gonna post this up yesterday but I enjoyed it too much and huh I liked it anyway so today's strain is a Thin Mints Girl Scout cookies and the cartridge is a distiller 1/2 gram and it's made by Burano I believe that's a Maryland company that's one from and it's a hybrid so THC percentage is 80% and I don't know how I think CBDs got 3.11 and yeah so it's got a good taste yeah unbelievable I mean I after like through two seconds I'm coughing my ass off like this is for all the people that said that my cookies cart was fake right but i'ma show y'all this one right and y'all gonna see oh hold on hold on why I said look the same okay so this is the box right y'all and that's right yeah Girl Scout cookies yeah 60 bucks four or five or you know for a half a gram and here we go right here so look at that beautiful oh yeah I'm beautiful too so beautiful man so perfect so I'll just drive it right I'm a little pen so we're gonna do a pre I think this is dead it would die on our view huh so",

itself it is in a pocket vape like cartridge so it is um good hardware battery so that is the cartridge on my environment so you guys can get a better view and then here's a box it got freaking squished so that's pretty much all i can show you oh and then there's front and then there is top but yeah there's all that so i know it's a bm brand but from what i heard the oil is pretty good so that's why i want to go ahead and give it a try so let's go ahead and take it so it does taste like a regular distillate do you eat the little lemony taste let's go ahead and take another so i'm hitting this off of the toki 510 thread battery and like i said the lemon haze not elapsed cart so i'm probably going to be doing a couple videos i think i have four other flavors so i'm going to be trying a couple other ones but yeah make sure you guys like leave a like on the video because it really helps me out so when i'm not uploading make sure you guys check out some other some other people

so I don't really have the time to break out flour smoke it or bring out my rig heat it up torch it you know to all that 9 yards just to get a quick buzz so I've been sticking with a company called lifestyle farms and they're out of Oregon I'm in swimming our distillate cartridges premium with terpenes reintroduced into it here's a quick little view what comes in really good stuff it ranges out and it's really blotchy so I guarantee a total profile it's a full spectrum 83.8% THC in that it's live that's what they say so I haven't tried this kind I've tried the blueberry and a blueberry tastes really really good break this out there we go comes with a little plastic piece on the bottom you can smell it through there this is a granddaddy purple and it's the strain that I got if I didn't mention it already I'm so tired you can see it I got bags into my eyes so I can't usually I can smell it you can definitely just be really good with the terpenes on that one granddaddy purple strain that I got alright so I've got the Uzi pin just to test it out I'm going to put it all the way to the lowest voltage I can turn it all the way up to like 4.8 actually let's do 3.8 because I can turn all the way up to 420 we'll do that prime it real quick 1 2 3 pull through wow that tastes amazing that's he's just like I just like the smell of the taste of the button does that make sense so if you took the bud and you just smell it that's how it tastes through here this lit always freaking kills me so let's see if it puts me in the dirt this time oh yeah goods definitely that's a good hit it's definitely a granddaddy purple see if you can get a view on this purple full profile 83 THC CBD 78 full-spectrum 83.8% in the bottom over here it kind of explains oh sorry the side THC involvement my CBD total fro pile total I can't even speak right after that dab so total profile would be 83.8% yeah 150 milligrams per serving so that's with a five second draw and it blows your mind that's all I gotta say good stuff shoutout to lifestyle I made good stuff again didn't smoke in that buddies still I purchased at least over a quarter of it so far and its really good [ __ ] shout out

gonna see this within the next couple of hours after I make this video man maybe an hour too after I'm gonna hurry up and try to edit this and pump this out guys and I wasn't even gonna do a video

by the title of the video man just hop into the review because I don't want to be yapping around and [ __ ] like that so we're gonna hop straight into the review man and this has been a long waited like I swear how long has it been since like someone has asked for this video it's been a long time dude like to be honest it's been a long time like I think when I first started my youtube channel people were started and we're asking for this cartridge at that time so it's been almost a year since I have made a in my youtube channel I think it's been a year I'm not even too sure if but yeah man we're gonna get started Los Angeles kushman hometown man if you guys don't know I'm from Los Angeles man like straight out of the hood Inglewood [ __ ] like that and then I was raised up until I was there like 4 4 or 5 and I moved to another city and then we got raised up there but I'm originally from LA man I gotta send love to my hometown city bro so today guys the flavor in particular wouldn't be trying to is strawberry blondie and this was I try to do as much research as possible or try see what cartridge was the best one that they had and from from what I saw people were saying that the strawberry blondie was out of this world so this is brand new I haven't even tested it I literally got it probably five to ten minutes ago so we're just gonna do a first [ __ ] like hands on so let's see what's up so when you get it this is a packaging it comes in a little blue box and on the side right here imma show you guys all of this right now in a bit so it comes in a little wipe pouch it says Los Angeles cush on it and then we might have to take some photos of this [ __ ] or something los angeles cush and then this is a lot of the box like I said and then I'm gonna give you guys a little up close there let's see manufactured in La Vie that vat of it on 128 19 which is January packaged on two 13 19 and expires 128 21 so total THC 7785 let's see CBD 1.60 total terpene concentrate alright guys and this right here is a little close-up of the oil it doesn't really look like a full gram to be honest I mean these cartridges might be a little bit bigger than others but it doesn't really look like they give you a full gram they definitely didn't hit this because it was still inside the the sealed packaging so I wish I had a scale to weigh this out and things like that but I'm gonna take it into consideration and just hope that la cush really is giving you one gram but it looks very very clear kind of reminds me of the raw garden it's a very very nice video so now that you guys can see how clear that oil is it's pretty honestly this has to be some of the clearest distillate I've seen yet and not come like I said in the last of a not compared to raw garden dude raw garden and refined live resin is a whole different thing so this is by far one of the clearest I've ever seen so alright and I really like the packaging so far the white tape the whole sea salt thing is very very nice and I'm gonna try it on the rock garden battery first because it looks pretty nice man it looks like it fits very very nice like it's just one long white stick so we're gonna be taking like I said this is the first impression so I'm really really stoked about this and like even though they're a hometown brand I've never even considered trying them just because I was like LA cuz you know it's probably over hi brand because if they're just local you know locals always hype up their their local [ __ ] supporters things like that so cheers guys we're gonna be taking the hits off of this right now just gotta get straight into the video man I feel like I'm rambling too much so I gotta get straight into the video so if you guys are 18 over 21 and over you guys know the deal man and cheers boys os definitely that is delightful dude this thing has me coughing like crazy so right off the bat off of the first hit it wasn't really too much of a hit but I got a very very strong strawberry not like it doesn't taste artificial at all but definitely doesn't taste natural or it does taste natural but then again like I'm trying to figure a way to explain this but like it's like how strawberry smell is what I'm tasting you know so that's kind of that's kind of different but we're gonna take another rip and see what's up so yeah definitely getting this thing is good all right so now that I that second hit was a little bit more artificial than it was naturally it tasted more kind of like strawberry strawberry Fanta it has like a really really strong strawberry fan to taste to it in my personal opinion whoo but the high is very nice dude for two hits that I just took I'm already getting a head change I'm feeling my eyes getting a little bit low this is an indica dominant strain so I'm gonna and like plus me working ten hours today there's no why no like plus Eddings indica is like go to sleep dude and so that was the rock garden battery we're gonna be trying it on the slim twist so get that on there whoo airflow is nice bro so we're gonna start this off at three point three and then see see what's up with it so if you guys are smoking along with me let me know what you guys are smoking in on in the comments below and if you guys are enjoying the video so far man just hit that sub hit that sub button and let your homies know to to hit that sub button also so cheers yes Wow dude like this is definitely this is very very enjoyable like even though it doesn't taste like naturally like strawberries it does have that artificial taste it can pass as if it was like strawberry weed and um don't quote me on this I'm not too sure what the strains are in this I'll make sure and put that in the description below you guys know I always got you guys with that like but is this amazing dude this thing this car is definitely about 100 percent cup like I'm definitely happy that I was able to try this out and give it my initial thoughts and we're just gonna keep ripping it and then keep ripping it and then tell you guys what the full effect is I mean I'm not even too sure how many hits already taking but it's a very nice high so far and I haven't taken many so Wowz is dude not even gonna like the high on this is so good so good oh the more you hit it it's like a very refreshing drink of strawberry soda it's not it's not a bad though it's good it's amazing like alright where is it where has this been all my life ever I would have tried this months ago this definitely would have been on my top-five list this definitely is getting bumped up to number two right now so right now guys raw garden and then Los Angeles cush and then West Coast cured but this this right here this distillate right here is some of the best some of the best for sure I haven't tried any other but better just looking this and it keeps going better and better as I try a new of products like some guy some guy I've commented below and he said he said this I think he said um oh you think every new cartridge that you try is better and I'm like yeah dude cuz like it a new cartridge you never know what you're gonna get you know it can either be shittier than the last one you tried it could be better it can't or it could be just up I mean I've never really had a cartridge that's the same level as the other cartridge so you know that's that's my thoughts like I always try new things that I think is better than other things and I'm not gonna sit here and think that those old things are the best forever you know I'm always trying to find new product I'm trying to find new things for you guys especially because you guys always have questions about Oh what what should I cut what should i do I don't want to waste my money that's what I'm here for man this is what I'm here for like things like this like go cop this go cop this for sure I'm gonna take one more hit imma do the official review on this for you guys so yes can decide if you want to go cop it or not so who like this thing is gave me stone I'm gonna switch it to the raw garden battery because it was a really really smooth it off of it man this weather change got me with a little like the allergies my nasal congested dude freaking coughing horrible so we're to take one last hit like I said and then when you get to the final review guys cheers I'm like I said I'm happy that I picked this out this is by far some of the best distillate so amazing room sheesh man this is like another level of higher right here this is so amazing let me get into detail right now so all right so a initial taste I already said it tastes kind of like a strawberry soda Fanta it's not too dominating so don't they you're gonna get an overpowering ly strong strawberry taste it's very very subtle but you can definitely taste it and depending on how your palate is you know the way you tasting is it kid it can be you could like it or you can't but for the most part in my personal opinion I feel like you should like it as a consumer of thta's like if you guys like most of the things that I reviewed in the past you guys are definitely gonna like this one like this off the tops is taking over the best distillate this is from Oh taking over Stacey it's been taking over West Coast Cara like I said top distillate by far and you heard it from me and then so the high it's a very very very soothing dude it doesn't automatically just pop just hit you and then you're automatically like super stone you know you don't get it enjoy it go go like a level up level up you just cut you know there's been things like that and like this this cartridge right here dude it like you take one one hit I mean it gets you a head change you know it gets you a head change and that's what I like about it get your head changer that my I start feeling a little bit heavy definitely getting that indica right away and that coughing sensation who it man I killed like on that second hit if you guys go back in on the video and notice it I couldn't even hold that hittin I can't hold it in like that's how strong it is very very potent that turps are super super flavorful man there they hit you in the back of the throat along with the strawberry and it's like it's just a conjunction of just flavorful miss man it's amazing so Los Angeles Kush you've outdone yourselves man I'm definitely gonna be copying you products um I want to try the ill oh gee and then the Burberry cheesecake is next on the list - man I'm gonna be doing some more Lakers for you guys if you guys like this video man imma ended up here go cop the LA Kush and if you guys enjoyed today's video make sure you guys go leave a like comment sub and I just wanted to say man rest in peace Nipsey Hussle man true legend out there he did a lot for me growing up I just want to speak on this as an innovator cuz he did die on them on Sunday which is very tragic like I said hometown legend for me and he was like someone that I looked up to growing up because he was a very very motivational man he always gave that word out to like be better for yourself like it doesn't matter where you come from if you like he even showed everybody he was from the hood he was from the straight up like hood bro like Slauson like the where the bad [ __ ] happens about and he made it out multi-millionaire this dude was Boston up he just bought his own like that little store that he used to kick it out in front of he just about that whole entire building really the things he was doing was were out of this world he was true a true motivation that a lot of people should look up to instead of looking up to these other people that really aren't doing much but talking about money girl weed and [ __ ] like that so yeah rest in peace Nipsey Hussle man true legend imma have to get a tattoo for him soon bro so if like I said if you guys enjoyed the video make sure you leave a like comment sub and we're out", "ZHJqEUTD11U": "hey how's it going i'm here to uh make a quick review for this vape cart right here called the willys reserve oro blanco distillate card as you can see here it's made by buckeye relief and it does have cannabis derived terpenes and cannabinoids and as you can see the uh thc percentage is actually a little bit above the uh 70 legal maximum here in ohio and the terpene content is quite high uh two i think 20.9 milligrams per gram is the same as two percent and i actually got a couple other carts out to show this was the highest mercedes content that i've seen on any cart so far and it was a buckeye relief aeropro live flower series so that should be really comparable to this because they both have distillate and cannabis derived terpenes and here's a little container you can see this one has 20.9 and mercene is the highest and on this one it actually has 40.75 so aeropros are just extremely high in terpenes and that's why they're probably my favorite but i really do like this reserve cart and i actually have a little bit of the willy's reserve flower here that i got a while ago it's not the same strain but this one's called cocoa and i really like it i have a couple little buds i've been saving and then also i just ordered a couple things uh from a uh a guy that i know from reddit and uh discord he actually makes these extensions and also this like this base thing right here it's pretty neat i haven't really tried it out yet um and see how i have it set up now is with my divine tribe atomizer here but i'm gonna take that off and just use use it with the cart just to show it but um here's my regular little card atomizer or battery oh and he also sent me this too which is a nifty little luster pod holder so that's pretty cool has a nice little ohio with the cannabis leaf on it on the bottom so it's really nice yeah so here's my regular seed battery pop this thing out of here i've been using it um i definitely i like it so far wr for lily's reserve has a little thing in the top there a little plug yeah i'll just go ahead and take a hit off this first it has really good flavor um just like i would expect from buckeye relief i've really enjoyed all of their products that i've tried so far [Music] they seem to have really good effects they uh you know they they seem to work um they have really good customer service i've emailed and contacted them a few times um oh another cool thing about this mod that i bought is it actually already has the uh different firmware on it so that's pretty cool so hopefully i'll be showing you guys more of this setup soon but anyway i have my dab cap here i don't know if you're familiar with those but it just lets you use a cart with uh like a water piece so i like this a lot let's take this off for a second let's see here just unscrewing the divine tribe atomizer base right now and attaching the cart it's not really meant to use a cart with this extension but but i figured this would work okay so here we go oops this would be easier just make sure it's not turned up too high that's pretty good all right just set that there just hold it like this now just go ahead and hit it works pretty well i'm a big fan of this this little guy this uh dab cap here that uh accidentally turned my phone off there so hopefully i'll get these two videos connected to each other but um yeah take another hit off this i forgot to push the button yeah i i'm a big fan of this so far um the willys reserved cart oro blanco which means white gold um i think that's that's about all i have to say um shout out to fear and lawyering who is the the guy who made this stuff this uh little carousel thing uh and base here and then also the extension um yeah that's all i have to say thank you bye", "duKNE8y28yA": "it just goes to show and proves you smoke he smokes these every day every day he took a couple blinkers and he's done that's how strong these are educational and [Music] what's up youtube dope is y'all here hope you're having a dope ass day guys the other week we did a video exposing fake bad cards and i got a huge response about it i [ __ ] love that you guys loved the video hella information went to the lab shows you guys what's up the biggest complaint i got the only complaint i got was you didn't show how the [ __ ] you spot these bad cards how do you tell that it's fake i got a fake plug play guys these are real i talked to them after that video or actually while i was making the video and told them what's up and they hooked me up with real ones these look nothing like the ones that i brought to the lab you could tell they're [ __ ] different today guys i brought the man himself peter from plug play yes the guy you see on plug plays instagram all the time i brought peter he's gonna actually sit down with me show me and show me how i can tell everything's fake how to tell their bad how to go through all the packaging the seals everything because honestly guys i mean i got played so i have no knowledge in this but let's get started so guys here's the investigator dopaziola again my homie has somebody i told him i was doing this video and he says oh i have a homie that makes fake plug plays and i go hey man can you get me the guy's [ __ ] number so i could talk to him and see how cheap these [ __ ] carts he's doing because these are real i want to know how [ __ ] cheap does it really get i'm going to call him real quick hello hey what's up dude yeah i got you yeah no no i'm looking to uh get some of the plug play cards i know that he said that you probably haven't cheaper than my guy how much if i get 500 they're they're 10 bucks for the cart package and everything ready to go do you do a price break at a thousand eight bucks um could i give you a call back just want to make sure that we're good to go all right dude thank you bye-bye eight thousand dollars for a thousand plug play cards i want to show you guys right now look at i'm in my house and i could have ordered a thousand fake plug play cards just like that here's your phone back thank you so much yeah that never calls you back block it this is what's going on today while i'm doing this right now peter's on his way over here with the plug play team he's at a trap spot buying fake plug play cards yes the guy that you see does plug play is going investigator 2 to go buy fake ones he's gonna buy real ones and fake one every question you ever had today guys is going to be answered how to spot fake cards let's get this [ __ ] started all right here's peter right here hello here oh oh i see the car you know we had to make it official oh my god thank you brother get this side real quick just real quick you're rolling around in this to drop drop off orders and [ __ ] yeah it's a moving billboard all right guys here we are this is peter from plug play i'm sure you guys have seen them online what's up everybody so please do me a favor just tell everybody what plug play is about would you guys start and just the whole get down of it so we're a group of homies started the company three years ago came from the streets hustled our way became compliant became legal and now we're trying to build this as big as we can possibly do it but most importantly have fun with what we do you guys know this is the most asked for thing on my channel of all time for um for of all time the second i ever did a vape video people just asked all day like yo these are the best ones you guys gotta [ __ ] try it out i'm glad i'm sorry that it's uh that the first time i ever showed you guys on my channel it was a [ __ ] fake ass car i'm sorry about it i saw that [ __ ] man i saw that and i was like wait a minute to school me on what the [ __ ] happening bro it's a headache for not only us but everybody in this industry right now we're all battling it and most importantly it's up to our community to make sure that everybody stays aware of you know what the [ __ ] is happening they see your car however much they cost and then they see the ones i get two for 20. yeah but it's poisonous you don't know what it is and people are choosing like i want the brand name but i don't want the brand name as far as legalization and and the point that we're in right now it's just a very crazy difficult challenging time for the industry itself because this wasn't legal before and now it is with that change there also comes this area where we have to learn how to adapt to what's about to happen there was a time where nobody was compliant three years ago because there were no licenses there was none of that so it was like literally the wild wild [ __ ] out right it was just trapped but there was a code during those yeah it's bad because now it's the everyone jumped in because they saw money here to me so the people that really cared are getting pushed aside because they don't got money like that i feel like right now it it's eventually gonna find this perfect median to where everyone's happy the taxes are cool um i hope things are just different the black market that it's all trash products because there are some there's some bran there there are some good ones that have really clean products true are trying to make a name for themselves because everybody started off as a trash product and got legal yeah it doesn't mean that this was bad before it was legal they're entrepreneurs and they want to get into this space they want to do it right but the the industry is holding them back to to do it the right way never really thought about it that way because i mean i'm already in this [ __ ] i never thought about what it'd be like i'm trying to get it as a legal company as a compliant company that sells safe products we're very big on quality and making sure that there is absolutely nothing that gets through for everyone that that does [ __ ] with plug play this [ __ ] smacks right and smacks for a reason we focus on quality we focus on opponents he put that into our device i'm gonna be honest bro i do those blinkers i just don't wanna ding ready go [ __ ] i gotta take it again yo shout out to the plug play fam because everybody's been doing an amazing [ __ ] job with like banging on like unlicensed retailers right what we've come to find out is like we started calling around and a lot of these spots that that had been reported they no longer had them so it was actually it was actually pretty challenging for us to find a spot that had the fake ones all this [ __ ] that's getting sent out of state right where nobody's really informed they just see one what they want to see here busy brand here but this video today is going to show you how to never get it again i sent david in go go check it out and sure enough you know like they were fake he ended up buying a bunch of different products just so we can kind of [ __ ] around and look at it and yeah see uh what you can see what it is this is the bag that they give it to give you a paper bag it's a paper bag this is my wig at least staples this paper bag for me this is a shop this is a shop oh my god that's not good that's not a good look all right oh no that's trim look look what fell out that's trim automatic i'm gonna tell i'm gonna tell everybody why when i look at this it like freaks me the [ __ ] out what is it yo it says springfield cards that has bart literally guys do you think the simpsons licensed this no that's why you could tell it's automatically [ __ ] fake this this can fool some people so how can you tell that these are fake because this is the same looking one that i got but they've even made copies of these with the compliance package and the stippling and the sticker they can knock the sticker off yeah they knocked everything off the only way you can tell really is the way that the letters are printed so the difference for like the the fake ones that i've seen they don't have these plastic tabs on the side the ones that i've seen they have older batch numbers we sell out a product pretty quickly so if it's two months old you know it's probably fake let me talk about this specific one if you look at the difference in the actual sticker that's on here this is a completely different sticker i want you to compare it you see him oh [ __ ] it's not even that it says one gram on here and this doesn't have a shine watch so yeah point them out yeah look at it apple slushy looks identical dude except there's yours is outlined there's isn't yeah like such small details if you look at it even the color of the blue it's different yeah it's a little bit it's just different and then right there look at the exotics is a different color yeah and there's knockoff says but look at this this is the scary part look at their oil it's like clear just like yours clearer than ours oh [ __ ] but that doesn't mean there's this actual oil exactly it could be something else it could be something else all right which one's fake what do you [ __ ] learn so far there one gram automatic fake basically look on your instagram and see what the updated logos are too this is scary show us what is that this is tangy bang we don't even have a tangy bang flavor how can this can somebody go to like a website and see that what flavors you have your ig huh yeah just follow their ig guys so you can stay up on what flavors for sure it says packaged last month yeah this one this is this is ten this one's real that's the one you brought also this is scary this is scary too this oil might not be oil and say it is say it's [ __ ] great say it's [ __ ] bomb oil it's not tested well if these guys are doing such a great job at making this type of quality if it is good quality i'm not gonna chance it if they're doing that type of quality like go compliant right that or stop knocking off my brand and make your own [ __ ] brand for that damn good we have a responsibility to make sure that like we take care of our community so if anybody sends us a dm about a fake car or a concern about a fake car we gotta look at it that's your [ __ ] if someone were to get hurt i did i didn't answer dm and then that person had gotten hurt that's not like i don't want that it really is on you though that's the worst part about it i never really thought about it it's the stress yeah yeah it's so stressful the water building up i have like a body high now you're right oh yeah oh man i'm pretty big you're gonna get high as [ __ ] at the end oh my god no no i'm doing that i'll put my sunglasses back on have you ever seen the [ __ ] on the news where these [ __ ] vape pen batteries explode yeah and basically it's shrapnel to your eyes yeah i don't want that did you know people knock off plug play batteries everyone's batteries i didn't know that these can explode i got one right here he brought a fake battery they're knocking off these the batteries and it looks the [ __ ] it looks better than ours what you smoke a lot i do but not this extreme real plug plays real ones will [ __ ] you up apparently he's definitely not hitting the fake ones hell yeah yeah he's getting he's gonna be good jesus jesus christ just wait till the end we're about to get oh my goodness thumbnail right there i gotta go lay down your time oh my god my video came out try and hold on there as long as possible [Music] i had a pause for a moment because it got way too lit and needed to take a quick nap on this table they bought a fake plug plate uh battery also remember if they could blow up in your [ __ ] face how can you tell that they're fake well the thing is though with the box you couldn't even tell right i couldn't tell where the box was out of the box it's like boom like just look at the print so right off the bat the fake ones have white is this plays in white right yeah plays in white for the fake ones two months from now they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna catch on to this they'll catch up when you guys update your [ __ ] so it makes you guys on your toes all the time huh that packaging's dead on the same oh guys when you see the packaging look look at the [ __ ] barcodes they got it down they wouldn't bought a real one copied your barcode that's crazy right peter yeah almost there why is the big deal buying a fake uh battery there's a protection chip in there so when it's being charged and it's like fully charged it stops pushing energy into it yours yeah what's the big deal those could they could burn your house down they could blow up in your face anything they blow up right there because the chip they don't have a chip so it keeps pumping energy into it so it like overloads it too much basically the fake ones don't have the protection chip because that costs extra money exactly they're trying to pay pitch everyone's trying to get into the market right now corners like i said cutting corners man [ __ ] people up you back to life slowly that's because you're dope as yola bro i smoke a lot of weed i'm pretty much an alien when it comes to weed tolerances oh it's like a box all they don't hit they don't do [ __ ] to me that's what we does i'm high but i mean i'm here it just goes to show and proves you smoke he smokes these every day every day he took a couple blinkers and he's done that's how strong these are so i'm going to let peter get out of here so you can go take a damn nap peter thank you so much for stopping by i'll see you soon so thank you so much peter for stopping by these are right in front of me and i could still not tell they had the same barcodes so like peter said they can get this packed this is the knock-off box this is the real box they can knock it off they can make the same sticker everything guys they're getting so good with it how can you tell you're not going to get some fake stuff that could poison it could poison you so make sure you pay attention to this stuff this doesn't say one gram this does say one gram is outlined apple slushy on the fake one is not outlined those little things matter you literally have to be like antique roadshow [ __ ] to be able to go well you see this is here that's how you have to be right now those counterfeiters are following me too they're going to watch it they're going to watch us go damn all right we got to switch it up guys plug play you everybody all big companies they update their packaging often for counterfeiters this is the reason why counterfeiters are they're good they make fake gucci they make fake nikes and you couldn't even tell i'm sure somebody one of you has bought fake jordans once you guys can get dupes so don't get duped on shoes that's cool don't get duped on things you put in your lungs you guys heard it earlier i talked to that [ __ ] on the phone that means he's packaging these making them for probably five dollars five dollars there's no way that's thc real fake if you have any questions come back refer to this video and make sure you have the real ones real quick guys before we get out of here these right here they said they got for free for coming to the dispensary can we get a close-up i want to rip this open they gave him six free joints for coming in no no what is that why is it brown and yellow you see it there's yellow chunks in here why oh it's dead leaves oh it's trim oh this is true so guys this past month has been pretty wild we did exposing fake cards which led us to this because you guys asked so much how to spot fake cards how do you know if your cards fake how to spot fake packaging i'm so sorry i got you so high man but that's just that's what happens sometimes over here peter thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to first off go to the trap spot and get all these fake ones and then bring some real ones just to show us it was super informational dude even like i said even i got played i had no idea how to spot these because they look so [ __ ] real this has been how to spot fake carts with plug play thank you so much guys for watching pass this information along thank you guys so much for watching i'm dobaziola have a dope ass day oh [ __ ] damn i", "ozu0K0MkU-s": "[MUSIC] The prosecutor said,\nwe would recommend life, if

classic cannabis infused gummy uh it seems like if you are a weed company and you want to branch out from whatever your starting project product is you go gummies and that's what looks like it's happening with moxie uh this packaging is pretty uh nice it's uh kind of like a aluminum can little puck here uh pretty substantial actually uh this little tin is not cheap i'm sure uh but you got all the stuff you want to see on it uh we've got our lab testing results here on the side uh and then we've got uh our dosage instructions which these are uh 10 milligram gummies they're 10 10 milligram gummies in here for 100 milligrams in total uh and these gummies cost me 17 bucks at my dispensary which puts them at the ever so slightly above average price point for a 100 milligram gummy in my neck of the woods uh it does say on here that uh moxie has won 90 plus industry awards neat uh i always find those things to be more annoying than edifying or clarifying uh if you're not gonna tell us what awards you've won uh why should i believe you anyways uh we need some more uh you know packaging regulations here but uh that's neither here nor there let's get to the moxie good stuff i did not actually mention what flavor this is it is the member berry flavor or strain i guess i didn't realize there was a member berry strain before this it does show member berries on there uh i don't know what k i assume member barry got its name from the south park episode which minor rant here boy south park uh on the air for 24 seasons now i remember back when people were making jokes about the simpsons getting along in the tooth back around it's like 15th 16th 17th season uh and now we here we are with south park uh at its 24th season i think there was even a time where south park mocked the simpsons for being uh so long in the tooth that is not to knock south park it's just crazy how long actually and resilient that show has been around anyways member berries uh i don't actually have never seen the episode i don't really watch south park anymore still appreciate what those fine folks do but um i do remember hearing on the internet for about 24 hours people saying remember when a member something like that remember barry who knows uh i assume it tastes just like berries uh let's go ahead and get into this edible here this is 17 thing of gummies uh with my experiences with moxie have been good uh nothing to write a home about like um totally fine makers of cartridges uh and i've had some of their wax before too in non-cartridge form and found it to be totally unobjectionable uh nothing stand out but nothing uh to be suspicious of either all right well here is our here are our gummies rather got a little moxie logo on them uh 10 gummies in there i i guess the idea that every gummy has to be five milligrams everything has to be five milligrams is becoming irrelevant that was a law but i see everything lots of things now uh packaged as 10 milligrams so uh getting lax cool shut up siri she keeps thinking i'm talking to her uh anyways here is our moxie member berry let's give this a shot hmm wow very pleasant very pleasant starting taste um kind of a chewier gummy i don't really need to tell you what a gummy gummy's gonna taste like it's pretty fruity to start uh but there is actually a very strong cannabis aftertaste i mean it's not grotesque most gummies don't get uh offensively bad you've got enough sugar in there to mask the taste but there is a pretty strong weed aftertaste here so if you are very sensitive to it watch out fine for the first two or three seconds and then there it is actually about five alarm weed taste there you got a couple of seconds uh before it really hits you wow that is powerful that is one of the uh more weedy tasting gummies that i've had uh in some time i wonder how they infused uh if they did something different it looks like uh same process as far as i can tell just a very strong weed taste uh that does make me a little optimistic that these are gonna be pretty potent uh there's not necessarily a total correlation between oh well somebody just subscribed apparently that's what that noise was um there's not always a correlation between taste and potency but there sometimes is so fingers crossed that these member berries are going to be as potent as we hope uh for me guys i am gonna eat all 10 of these it's probably going to take me oh i'm going to do over the next half hour 45 minutes or so and then 90 minutes two hours after i have that last one i'll come right back here and let you guys know the most important part about the edible review is it gonna get you high and i've got really really high hopes no pun intended for these with that aftertaste until then guys thanks for sticking around we'll see you right back here in just a bit oh there it is bye welcome back to wheats guys it has been about uh just over two hours since i had my first member berry uh cannabis infused gummy from moxie and that is a really sticky inside of a container there a lot of residue anytime i'm talking about residue it means i'm pretty high uh so these are pretty good gummies these are um i would say um on the good end of average the high end of average they're uh good not outstanding not the absolute best i've ever had uh not the best test tasting gummies by a long shot but they are certainly going to get the job done uh for anybody who is familiar with 100 milligram edibles um 100 milligram gummies uh if they work for you these are going to do the job they are just a total uh thumbs up in terms of quality uh really the only thing to talk about here uh is gonna be the taste and price uh the taste didn't offend me that much uh i quite used to a pretty bitter cannabis aftertaste and uh there was that potency you want with the with that uh taste but it is a stronger cannabis aftertaste if you're looking for gummies with no weed taste these aren't for you uh and that these were the only other thing to mention is that these weren't the cheapest gummies these aren't the cheapest gummies available at my dispensary um so i would not necessarily buy these myself because i know that i can get just as good of a gummy for a cheaper price at my dispensary say a um punch edibles or a buddha's best they have a couple of different gummies at a i at my place for sometimes uh like five bucks cheaper than these so that is a thing to consider uh it really is just going to depend on the price at your dispensary because there is nothing again in this package that's going to say uh it's worth a premium over any other gummy um but you know totally perfunctory and good i'd say these moxie may not have moxie but they have gumption gumption what a weird word speaking of gumption no speaking of moxie let's do a little cherry on top we're gonna do something with some real moxie uh and cherry on tops by the way anytime we have a review that we like we like to give a little something extra that's not weed related uh and let's do something with as i said somebody with some moxie now normally i have a policy i don't like to uh give any cherry on tops for anything that i've actually finished uh because you know i like to it's a wheat thing we we do the entire experience but i've been enjoying this book so much i'm confident that even though i've only got about a uh i don't know a couple dozen pages or so left to go i'm confident that i'm still uh if enjoyed enough to give it my recommendation and that book is a nonfiction book by the author maria konokova uh former writer for the new yorker called the biggest bluff uh she is a fantastic writer and a psychology phd from harvard uh who uh decided to take a break from writing and instead uh spend a year training to become a poker champ after having never played poker uh she just decides that she wants to see what it's all about but really it's a book about how to make good decisions how to avoid making bad decisions why poker is a good analog for decision making it's a pretty fascinating stuff she's an excellent writer it's a really cool concept again the book is the biggest bluff by maria konakova uh that is an excellent book from an author who has a lot of moxie and somebody who has a little bit of moxie is moxie and their member um edible i almost forgot that's what we were talking about but that is what we were here for pretty good from them really good from maria and that guys is gonna do it for everything here on wheats until we see you for our next review or whatever it is stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "3qqP7SXaAVE": "hi tim here i just wanted to talk about one of the new cartridge products that we got called core pods this is the core pod hawaiian haze is the flavor of this one these are a little different than all the other cartridges that we carry and that they're not actually a cartridge they're a pod system so it's going to use a different type of battery than the standard c cell that the rest of our our cartridges use but i really like these they hit really well they have really good strains this one is hawaiian haze it has like a really nice smooth coconutty flavor really smooth hits really strong and it's from the brand core which if you tried any of our tiara grow flower it's the same same company that's making these core pods really high quality i just really like them be sure to make sure you have the right battery to go with them if you do get them but it's definitely worth the investment to get the battery because they're great great price great effect i really like", "3EeEQLZgEVQ": "hey there youtubers how's it hangin oh this is just video I'm putting together taking apart one of these disposable of eight pens because I've had a couple them clogged up on me and kind of wondered why so there you go I'll show ya this is the tip of it this is where you inhale through that's where your Hall on and it's got a hole in the tip and it's got more holes on this side and it's got a little rubber gasket on it and that creates a nice seal on here and all the air just like comes through the pen through this and I'll show you what this is this is the reservoir where all your resin goes this is your plug that goes into that like I guess they fill it up through this little hole and that plugs it and also holds the whole unit together it was kind of nice it feels pretty solved there's a little passageway on the side I don't know if you could see it but that allows air through and so not the hole in the center that's like I said that's where the reservoir is so but yeah there's a little tube and it runs along the side channel here and that's where your air pulls through so you've got this little plug here for the other side of your where your resin goes into and this little plug also is your wick and in the center that's where the resin goes through and allows it to douse the wick and the wick goes obviously up against your coil and that's what burns so like your wick kind of which usually over time you got to replace but with these ones being disposable you don't got to worry about it so that's pretty cool that way you could see it's got a little flat edge I think and that goes and fits nicely to allow that air passage through there so once all this burns and your resin gets vaporized by the coil then that air passes back through the tube here and goes into your lungs and I got a little battery here and all that operates pretty cool so a problem is this little tube here though it's it's like they had to leave room to have a big enough reservoir chamber in here like they should to make it longer and have a like a like a bigger tube but maybe it's meant to like limit the amount of air yeah I don't know but anyway so yeah they say that with larger halls you're gonna get some resin that builds up in the tube like if it's too big of a hall like it's probably gonna be a little more denser smoke and allow a little more residual build-up on the sides there so yeah this this one here is kind of cool though because it has a little flashing light so when you've been hauling off for too long so there's a little sensor in there I don't know how it senses it but it's all in this little thing here it's pretty cool and because this is all the battery right here this other guy right here that's all battery and all that fits in here but I mean it's pretty cool that limits your your your topes or your halls and mmm that that way it doesn't get rezzed up but this one it still happened to so that was kind of one thing I was thinking and the other thing is when you're storing these you can't you got a I feel like you should store them with the mouthpiece down because that way the wick it sits up like the plug and you don't get the residue running down if you had it like facing down and yeah like that's kind of what I think you should kind of store it like facing up because otherwise you might gum up your coil and that might be a reason why it like leaks down through because I mean I don't know it could be either either way but I don't know for precautionary measures put it that way because that way it's just sitting up against the plug so nothing's gonna run out it's just gonna stay there your wicks still gonna have some residue on it probably you know tilt it forward and tilt it back every once in a while maybe but like don't leave it the other way is kind of what I'm thinking another way that might be why but that's pretty much it other than that just I hope you liked the video and like it if you like what you see all right man hopefully I helped cheers guys happy smoking", "ikmfHObhYjk": "[Music] what's up guys simplisik here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is the reaction video to clean carts part two requested by brandon horsford shout out to you you know what i'm saying you know with these types of reaction videos i like to basically put the comments from the previous video on the screen so let's go right now [Music] now that we got that out of the way today is november 2nd and i will be uploading it tomorrow on tuesday but i will not be going live because i do have to take my dog tomorrow to the vet and it could take all day so uh here is this video and you know to make up for it but usually on tuesdays i usually go live i don't really upload a video so this will be for today i don't know if i'm going to be going live but at least i have this video out so uh yeah i'm gonna take a hit of this bear labs cartridge the gorilla glue 4. i do have a video on this but you will probably see it later in this video cheers boys good stuff let me take another hit good stuff all right so here we are here on clean carts we are gonna go to the new post need help with some cheap touch lists and pawn batteries uh the coach run you know what i'm saying i don't know how much this is this is a company based in canada so i don't know if the shipping fee is going to be a lot more than usual you know so um but yeah i would have um maybe the yo can as well and also the pocket uh the dash vape all good stuff just such a smooth feeling never seen this before looks pretty cool looks like a bullet or no no it's a very long magnetic bottom piece we got a california gold pin legit or not so on the last video i didn't mention that they do label the things fake or not you can see there's a fake right there so this one's fake um but honestly it's all ceramic card all ceramic cards just look really nice to me i don't know it's just it just looks really nice all white and uh i don't know smoking on that orange platinum cookies or orange cookies platinum dates from michigan potentially dangerous why the reason this is because the michigan branch of beauty has released some shady products okay that's good to know so a very cool subreddit they they'll tell you right away or a moderator will at least mark it so they'll let you know the possibilities the potential dangers of what it can have that's really that's really dope you know what i'm saying and i really [ __ ] with that and uh with the cartridge connoisseurs out there you know i would definitely you know go in this site you know what i'm saying so or the subreddit we got the dime like i mentioned dime contacted me so we might be getting something in the future for the channel you know then all that you have to prove my car is going rub it in the mods face someone just put [ __ ] post that's funny 93 thc let's just read some of these comments i mean the oil looks good but here's the thing with oil when it comes down to oil you can't really tell you know you don't have a microscopic [ __ ] eyes where you can see down to the [ __ ] the you know the atoms or some [ __ ] you know it's it's harder to tell with weed you can see you can smell you know you can see it looks like trash it probably is trash you know but with the cartridge unless you really hit it or i mean if it gives off a smell like yeah it's really hard to tell you know so just be careful let's read this is just an entire starter guy thing that accuses in defensive violence not gonna lie when you flag my dc medical bias suspect it wrestled my jimmies but you're right why did the dispensary that took my money under a state mandated medical marijuana but not follow all the rules in the program is a question i now ask and the question only serves to protect my dumbass is it all right yes sadly at least it seems to be the case based on the interactions has it been experienced there seemed to be three types of coming here to brigade the first and most obvious are the fake and dirty card cut hardware sellers who come here to push and get banned you know my poi works at krt and he says they are made by raw garden just sold out the bag i've heard that before right there's a couple hundred of these on the banned list the second is people who come here asked about fakes who were told they were fakes couldn't provide any proof to the opposite then this is the key part either responding by trolling or pushing fakes as hard as they can or by flipping the [ __ ] out and insulting and cursing myself or other users and so were banned calling me and and variations other than the course of action double down on the breaking rules of launching personal attacks and get them in there's another couple hundred of these people on the ban list damn okay he wrote a whole story i feel it you know that happens there's trolls on everything my channel [ __ ] this subreddit on every type of forum possible you know and it's just you're just gonna have to deal with it and that's why we have good moderators to just put that [ __ ] so no one else can see it you know i do have a lot of moderators on my channel and i do see some of the contents a lot of bots and stuff and it says banned by moderator and all that stuff so i know my moderators are helping the channel out because if i leave that on myself most of the time it just goes to hell to review or spam but if i leave it on itself it gives people an opportunity to get ripped off you know maybe they're not or very gullible and they call one of these numbers to order some these [ __ ] products that someone's selling on that comment you know and it's my responsibility so like i try to get rid of that as much as possible because no one wants that no oh hit me up on whatsapp and shut the [ __ ] up no smoking from that clean loud questions about extract labs delta 8 have a lot of things going for them and possibly question them they're good but delta e still seen sketch but they have live results i have no comment with delta eight but i know it's legal still i don't know if it's still legal i know it was legal or it still is and uh i have no opinion on that but like honestly if this is a legal way of people in illegal states to get high then i'm all for it you know you can buy it off the website if it's tested and all that stuff are indeed all that stuff good then i'm all for it you know because it's better than buying off the street if you can buy legal delta thc delta eight thc you know what i'm saying like [ __ ] the streets i'm not saying [ __ ] the streets i meant to [ __ ] the street cards sounded um but anyone know if crystal creek organics delta is legit it says fake right there this one was it fake as well potentially dangerous okay see they still mark it you know obviously there's not much on delta eight so it could be potentially dangerous these ones are fake as well [Music] let's see i was loving eureka and that was fake a lot of people have been mentioning um if i've ever tried eureka i've never tried eureka i've never even seen it near me um but it says fake right here so entry base cleared you know this is a legit brand i have never tried to this day um tree tree base clear i'm not sure if it's this i'm pretty sure it's this is water clear i don't think uh yeah see it real or not the worst pictures ever what was this another one of those uh plug and play copies uh just steer just be careful you know what i'm saying like they could be good they could be bad you know at the end of the day that's 50 50 and that is not good chances at all you know so heal this up with the letters no that's what he did i mean i thought this was like known you know when or when oil is hot it's very runny when it's cold or room temperature it's gonna move like molasses you know so we got the blue dream i don't know i don't know about these this one at least i don't know what that is suspicious they marked it revolution craft live resin okay looks pretty good real or fake 4 000 scans what does that mean fake damn they made his market fake picked up a lot of raw garden highest thc and they got a lot of flavors on the back is that the flavor rx what is this green dot so you know just because it's legal and i don't know it you know i don't know all this every state's legal carts okay so please just bear with me uh i don't know all of california's carts and this is the state i live in so like i said just because i don't know it um and i say maybe it's fake uh it could be real as well because i don't know i don't know all the information on that [ __ ] so it's just me reacting to the subreddit shout out to brandon for uh you know requesting it but puffing on the knife strawberry call i actually tried stizzy the other day with uh my uh my cousin's girlfriend had it and she let me try it it was a skywalker the this lit really really good for distally you know i'm not really a fan of the or like a weird like pine terps i'm not a fan of that i mean it's okay you know um but if i had to choose it would definitely be like more of a cannabis derived terpenes that's what i prefer i like cannabis derived terpenes with distillate i like that raw garden hole formula that they have a lot of people don't like it i actually do like it i think it's the best of both worlds highest thc raw garden i've ever had wow 93 okay so we got the g leaf distillate it's very dark for distillate but i've seen darkness live before uh plug-and-play had some so first homie cart from wax not bad not bad at all not bad at all brother all right so then we got the red sky i've never seen this it says fake damn here's another windy city cars oh my god really chicago cars i know chicago is legal now recreational so uh this i mean it says fake right here who knows who knows he posted it twice it was like reinsurance he wanted some he wanted some opinions on that okay exhale new pickups drip someone mentioned this recently um they do look like they have the sticker manufacturer date and all that stuff these look pretty legit it says clean i think we're going to end it off on those all right so that is going to be it for the clean carts part 2 reaction on reddit hopefully you enjoyed it let me know what other reaction videos you want me to do and like i said i won't be i don't know if i'm gonna be coming back home to go live on tuesday or tomorrow whenever you see this video if i don't at least this video will be up so hopefully you enjoyed it like the video subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next one peace out [Music] you", "E3urMq9M4XY": "yo what's going on youtube welcome back to another video with your boy sebi g guys so check this out all right guys so i got this um this very kind person who just made me this piece right here gave me a whole gram of this stizzy um watermelon cherry pie wax all right brand spanking new i did not it's not open at all right it's a full gram right here so i was thinking man i haven't i haven't the next hour to to just sesh to myself so i was like i want to get pretty freaking baked so this is what i'm going to do all right so i'm going to use my dip device um e-rig by vape dynamics and what i'm going to do is i'm going to try try all right i'm going to try to smoke this whole gram in one sitting i don't know how long it's gonna take me i don't know if i'm gonna be able to even do it man i like i got lungs i got lungs but a whole gram by yourself is like a lot all right so i'm gonna go ahead and smoke try to smoke this whole gram by myself out of this e-rig right here and just sesh it out with you guys man just have a nice little session with you guys talk with you guys all that good stuff all right but before we get into the actual video if you guys can do me one big favor smash that like button on this video and also if you haven't already man hit that subscribe button alright guys we're so freaking close to 50k and i know we're gonna be able to hit it by the end of this month there's there's still not a doubt in my mind bro so if you haven't already hit that subscribe button just join the fam and hit that button alright guys so let's get this thing started cheers all right ladies and gentlemen so now that i got the camera set up on the tripod man let's just get straight into this man i don't even want to talk so three clicks goes ahead and turns this on one two three all right there you go and then um i am using the stock piece i kind of want to switch it out i'm not even too sure but this is a custom piece that goes on the dip devices um usually i always i like the stock piece on this one honestly it's it does a phenomenal job it has a lot of water in there you get a nice chuggy you know feedback but this piece in particular you get to put even more water in my opinion i think it's actually kind of similar it's actually very very similar this one's a little bit more narrow but i like this piece i like this combination just the purple going on and then um yeah man the overall like look of this the visual appeal is very very nice so let me go ahead and go show you guys the function very very nice feedback right there like i'm telling you guys all right so we're gonna go ahead and set that to the side and then bust into the wax real quick like i said brand new this is a full indica and the funny thing is that this um watermelon cherry pie this is actually one of my favorite curated um one of my favorite curated strains from stizzy so shout out to um the person who made this i think their instagram handle is blaze blades by or i'll go ahead and put that up on the screen so you guys can go ahead and give it a follow if you guys would like all right so brandon you guys heard that seal cracker right go ahead and boom and you got that right there take that off and then give you guys a little bit of a close-up all right so yeah man this is a full untouched gram of wax so shout out to blades by aurora for blessing today's video and i got the nice little um what do you even call this a little picker dab or whatever the case is so we're gonna go ahead and get ourselves a nice chunk i'm gonna be loading it up i'm not gonna lie with a humongous dab every single time now this bowl it's actually pretty big now i do not recommend doing this every single time honestly this is just something that i'm doing for the purpose of this video just so i could get some fat nice um so i could finish the wax kind of quick all right so my plan is to put like three to four fat scoops in there and hopefully it'll be done but let's go ahead and my favorite setting you guys already know it's the purple slash violet color but um we're gonna start off with something a little bit light which is the green setting right so go ahead and hold that and that's already gonna start warming up for you guys and um man i need to prepare my lungs i need to prepare my lungs right so the e-rig if you guys haven't watched my videos on this um you could vape flour out of this and concentrate and it's super budget-friendly all right guys one of my favorite e-rigs out on the market personally for the cost it beats the puffco pro in my opinion if you guys haven't watched that video where i compare the two i'll put that down in the description but this one the function is out of this world like it kills you it kills you so i'm kind of scared because like you get really really fat ribs alright so we're starting off small though on the green setting and i hope you guys are doing good man i'm doing good i'm ready to get baked i'm scared though because i've never really smoked a full gram by myself in one sitting so nonetheless it vibrated so cheers dude this thing gives off super amazing flavor too oh yeah two hits right there now this is the first hit off of this device right now so that's why i'm not really getting too much vapor production you really have to like use it like the first dab in any e-rig that is you're not going to get the fattest clouds you kind of have to warm up the bowl and once it's warm you're gonna start getting fat clouds oh yeah that's super smooth honestly man this might this might be a breeze who knows fat clouds the water filtration on this is actually super super nice now you don't get the biggest chugs out of this but honestly you get a really really decent like you know feedback from the water because there's there's rigs out there let me give you guys a little bit of example right this right here is a really really cheap one and i don't really like the function of this i don't really i think it's like that the feedback of the airflow is just like too too much open airflow let me give you guys a little example like there's so much water in here yet still i'm not getting enough of that that super chugginess that i like right so that all depends on the type of glass that you use honestly and let me give you guys another example so this one right here is a leisure piece that i just copped recently and let me give you guys um example on this chug this is what i love to see that is chug central man this is one of the with um one of my most favorite rigs just because of how much it chugs so let me go ahead and hit this with another reheat real quick because we can't there's there is a little bit of a puddle in there but i don't want to waste anything just for the purpose of this video we're going to try to you know maximize the wax man we're not going to be taking weenie dabs but um yeah man like i said back to the chugs this one has a very very nice chug me personally that's what i call it like you know the little airflow that comes back i call it chugginess because i don't know it feels like a chugging water you feel me so look cheers for an e-rig that's actually really really freaking good right so man this thing is smacking bro so i'm not getting any more flavor off of this it's just straight up smoke so i'm gonna go ahead and clean this up and then we're gonna go ahead and load up another dab so far so good man i haven't i've coughed a little bit but not enough to the point where i'm like all right i'm not gonna be able to do this this is possible but remember guys remember to always keep your water at hand or gatorade or something that's gonna keep you hydrated because when you're coughing when you're smoking it actually really does deplete your body um i'm not really too sure in what way but i there's been every single time that i feel like i smoke i feel like i i lose a little bit of energy you know so keep your water handy man that way you're always hydrated so going in on dab number two all right guys and i'm doing this all on camera so you guys don't think like oh he's not really putting all the full graham so the next one's gonna be kind of a stinky binky big ass one dude look at this one right here right this one's actually pretty freaking huge um it is gonna fit in the bowl i believe yeah it's gonna fit in the bowl perfectly so the only thing though is if you put this much wax inside of the bowl you got to make sure that you keep it leveled because if not it's definitely going to spill and you do not want hot oil spilling over all right so next up i'm going to go ahead and keep it on the purple setting because um i don't know man actually no the green setting was actually perfect the purple one was for the reheat but the green one honestly i was getting a very very nice terpy flavor from that one so we're gonna go ahead and do green alright guys so while that heats up though i just want to know man how is your guys's day going my day is going actually pretty freaking good i hope you guys have been enjoying the content lately man because i i've actually been putting in uh effort like you know i feel like there's there was a slump and you guys and i feel like everybody noticed that i'm not gonna lie i feel like i noticed i feel like my like if people around me notice that i feel like you guys as fans as supporters notice that and it's okay you know it's okay to have slumps but i feel like what is most important is how you pick yourself back up how you come back from that slump and um because that's really what defines who you are man how strong you are right so this is not this vibrated so cheers one like this is my favorite stream because you get a lot of that cherry pie flavor i don't know what it is but that cherry pie flavor that they have in this is just phenomenal man massive clouds bro but nothing but terpenes now if or even the white setting i would have been getting a lot of clouds but i wouldn't be getting that terps now the like in my opinion is the terps are a lot more important than the actual you know vapor production because the terps in my opinion are what gets you faded now don't get me wrong you do need a decent cloud to get you faded but with this device you get the perfect cloud but it gives it really really brings out the terps right and the green setting at least so i'm getting a little reheat on this because it ended a little bit too early i was doing a little bit too much talking so i'm gonna go ahead and hit this man i'm starting to get bait i'm not gonna lie i'm starting to get that head change um but we were already like six dabs in i'm actually pretty faded man but either way cheers oh yeah it's starting to taste a little bit burnt for me now no more you know it's like you know when it doesn't have any more terpenes because it's just straight up smoke it doesn't really taste that good i'm not gonna lie dude it started to get hot boxed in here and i was like dude i started like choking up bro so i went to go turn on the ac made sure there was airflow in this damn freaking house because i was about to [ __ ] pass out bro so cleaned it out dude and i must say i all right so this is this is no no bs all right so i've had this rake for over a month used it multiple times and the bowl is freaking pearly freaking white i don't know if you guys can see that i'm pretty sure i don't know try to take a look in there but it's pearly white man this thing has lasted me so freaking long and i've taken at least 50 dabs out of it so it definitely definitely holds it has durability so i'm freaking faded though that's all i can say right now it's all i can think about is how my throat was just getting graped right now bro so that was technically only the second dab in and um we still have so much freaking more man uh i kind of want i really really want to beat this to challenge so this is what your boy's gonna do you see that i'm gonna just clear this [ __ ] out right now man i should i should honestly just title this video easiest way to waste your wax all right like this isn't even i mean it technically is a challenge though because i am getting super super big like i honestly am on another level right now um i'm baked dude like literally my head is on like in the next realm i i'm just freaking high as heck right now and all i want to do is just like listen to some music and just chill out but i gotta finish this video out i honestly don't even want to take this last dab i'm not even gonna cap but it is what it is um i'm gonna go ahead and take it on the blue setting just so i could get a lot of that freaking terpene profile and i don't really want to cough man my throat is killing me right now like the last two dabs that i put in here i literally reheated them to the point where the the oil was like burnt so that that says it all those first two dabs were killer so it's time to really just minimize it and taste the terps out of this because it's kicking my butt it's kicking my butt alright guys so i'm going to go ahead and actually we're supposed to be hitting it on the freaking blue setting and all you have to do is just hold it like i said and it's going to go ahead and start heating up and i need to go grab some water i'll be right back boy is back in time it still hasn't vibrated but dude this thing all right hold on i need to give you guys a little bit of a close-up i usually don't like pulling out my phone and doing close-ups but the bubbling of the freaking oil is just beautiful bro so i'm going to go ahead and give you guys a little bit of a close-up for that so you guys can really see how it looks it's just so eye appealing it's just so beautiful the oil just burning up in there it's just phenomenal all right it's a it's a beauty it's a beauty to see so this thing is ready and cheers guys oh yeah that's it the blue setting is just super freaking smooth all the way through nothing but terps oh yes oh yeah baby this might be my new favorite setting you're getting a really really nice cloud but nothing but terps bro this is fire alright that i'm not even going to reheat this dude that that was enjoyable as heck i'm not gonna lie now we did it we actually did it it was actually not that hard and all right think about it this way the first two i really really freaking burnt the crap out of the oil like it literally started tasting like it was on fire and then but this one it was just straight up terpene profiles and i must say like judging the the different temperature settings on the dip device i feel like it really does its job bro because when i was using it like i said on the green to purple setting i was getting really really fat clouds and it was like i was getting terps but it was in maximized terps right and as soon as you level it down to green temperature which is supposed to obviously like the lower the temperature the more terps you're gonna taste i started tasting the heck out of those terps like phenomenal so honestly this still to this day is my favorite e-rig i must say so we did it boys we did it we finished a whole stizzy gram go ahead and show you guys that right here in one sitting it was pretty fun i'm not gonna lie i did i did cough a little bit here and there but it is what it is that's the name of the game right so i'm baked really freaking big like honestly like i'm i'm happy like i'm there there's nothing that makes me happier than being baked as heck so with that being said i'm gonna go ahead and shut this video out here i hope you guys enjoyed it as much as i did all right guys if you did do me a favor hit that like hit those comments most importantly if you haven't already you yes you hit that subscribe button i know you're just

the boys one time and see if I still like it man see if it's still there see if they still got it so if you guys know me you guys know my love for this part right here boys raw garden yes sir one of my favorite cartridges of all time if not my favorite cartridge of all time and you guys know I've I think raw garden has to be one of the one of the brands that I've done several several videos on like I'm talking about probably for the first half of my youtube career I did nothing but carb like cartridges on raw Gardens sauces and things like that man it was [ __ ] phenomenal so hold on I don't even tell you guys what we were smoking on so right here they feel if that book hopefully that's focused in but we got some gorilla gas berry and this is an indica sitting at 84 point 86 THC men and to pair that up though we got that Relaxo m9 battery right here that's this divot this giveaway for this battery is actually still going on it was gonna be a full month's worth of them it was gonna be a full um a full month that I was gonna be doing it it's a little bit over a month so I don't know if you guys are even still aware that's going on but all you have to be doing is following my Instagram page which I'm gonna be playing down description below man and be subscribed to my page so yeah cheers guys get it crack this sucker open you guys know what a raw garden looks like right you got the little yellowish tint little clearish go ahead and smack this on here oh quick one time and man what saddens me is that I cannot find my green ooze battery I don't know if you guys remember my green ooze battery that um that was the my daily driver for a while yeah that was my daily driver for a while I mean I am ended up finding up about this battery and this battery honestly Chuck's so this has been my daily driver since then I've been using on almost all of my cartridges if you guys want to check this one out I'll make sure to put their info down in description below relax om9 thank you for this battery and it's on the red setting let's go ahead and take a Cheers I mean my cheers hey cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over man we back at it with the raw garden videos baby cheers guys I think that might have been a little bit too hot yeah the wrong guy always makes me called you off of that little hit I'm telling you this battery dude the water use on this patty are insane it makes that makes your hits and extremely freakin huge so we're gonna go in on a green I think Green is lowest setting for this so cheers goes whoo oh my goodness that was the perfect hit yo Wow Wow Oh holy [ __ ] you're on e open on my window or something's kind of I'm not gonna lie I'm pretty [ __ ] hot in here so hold on this way for the beep Ian stop all right cool so like I was saying man's been a while since I smoked the raw garden I decided to call a cop went in oh my gosh all for those two to three hits man ah it is phenomenal though that was pretty freakin lame man I finished recording like 12 minutes a 12-minute was supposed to be 12 minutes total of the video and then um it just stopped recording man I was talking about all right so I finished when I checked back the recording it ended off at I was a 2 to 3 hits in and then after that I ended up taking like another three hits and I ended up talking a lot more talking about the battery talking about the giveaway talking about all that stuff so I guess I'm just gonna have to I don't even remember what I said I'm gonna be honest with you guys I don't remember not a damn word that I said B is what I shoot most of these um cartridge videos it's off the top of my head because it's a review video and things like that so it's nothing as planned out nothing is planned out now you guys know that so [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] get into this thing man alright guys so like I was saying two to three hits and deep I mean now we're like 6 or 7 i'm high [ __ ] right now guys we're gonna try to brainstorm so you see where i left off alright so this rock garden cartridge right here that i'm gonna show you guys this is this is the setup that i've been running as of late and honestly this setup is honestly pretty fired like it's it's the m9 Relaxo battery with whatever cartridges but this this battery right here honestly has the best voltages for any cartridges from low temps to high temps it hits all the spots you know and the raw guard you can never go wrong with raw garden man you can never ever ever go wrong with raw garden i think the only thing that i have an issue with with raw garden like i said is like i have an issue with how many times they cross the same strains over and over and over again and i know they're just trying to be like you know creative and trying to find new strains are gonna smack and things like that but honestly do have it's like if you see if you see things not progressing you see them digressing and being the same thing over and over i it maybe you should just try something else you know you're not gonna get better results doing the same thing that's facts this thing gives the fattest hits like oh my gosh that one got me dude I forgot how hard these raw garden cartridges met I honestly I remember I used to freaking get like baked off of like like two to three hits and right now I'm like ten hits deep now I'm obviously frickin blown I'm probably gonna have to just sit here and just be on my phone and chill with the a/c on for a little bit before I do anything but your voice is baked as heck so like I was saying man the my overall experience with raw Gardens I love it there there indica smack all the times for me I feel like the sativas and the hybrids are a no-go I feel like that's not only with rock and I feel that's with all all weed or anything in general men are actually not even but I think with bud and dabs I'm cool with but when it comes to cartridges the hybrids don't do anything for me it has to be a straight-up indicator and that's why I like indicas a lot more than anything oh man this that hate got me bro like I said I'm super baked right now let's give you guys a full rundown so the flavor profile on this [ __ ] already forgot bro [Music] so it has like a little fruitiness at the end when you Excel but a gas the earthy taste when you when you inhale it's pretty smooth it's smoother than most of the raw gardens that I've tried definitely it has a little bit more of a yellowish tint to it also and man it is this is an indica dominant I definitely feel the indica hitting me I'm lumped right now like I said my eyes are actually turning a little bit red so that's actually quite crazy I need a damn very good and then um yeah but like the Tate like I said the taste is phenomenal like every other raw garden that I've ever tried nothing too special but at the same time you know it's better than most of the cartridges that I've tried so raw garden you get you get you get another 8 out of 10 from you man you guys need to make something that's I don't know man you guys need to do something you guys need to do something different for the community I feel like you guys have done a weed thank you for everything that you've done that Bo we kind of want something different man at least from from me man I want something different from you guys so yeah guys I think I'm gonna go ahead and out the video here hopefully we at least reach to 10 minutes so you guys can have a good video to watch man let me know in the comments below what you guys what is your guys's experience with raw garden you know what do you guys like about it what don't you like about it what are your what are your favorite strains above them you know because I know they have some of this like I said they were they have some of the same strains that they cross with multiple times so let me know what you guys is favored right now in them in March 2020 man let me know which one's the best one you saw I think that's for me

pushing ready salute", "AZynhX-qcc4": "it's been a nice two hours of high getting a little bit progressively stronger i'm back you guys i hope you missed me i'm finally moved into the new home i'm so excited to be here expect to see videos from me regularly again now that i've moved in i have no excuse if you're not already subscribed make sure you subscribe right now so you can see all my new videos in your sub box but today isn't going to be my typical smoking video i'm going to do something a little different i have 500 milligrams of rso capsules in here there are 10 capsules and they're 50 milligrams each actually looking at this many pills is pretty intimidating i'm not gonna lie i'm pretty much just going to film the aftermath of this so i hope you guys enjoy that this is a little bit of a different video for me but i think this is going to be a lot of fun got a nice tough glass of water to wash these down here's number one here's number two here's number three number four this is the point in our return at this point i'm getting [ __ ] lit number five all right halfway there number six i'm so scared my body like didn't want to swallow that one it was like dude don't do it i'm gonna start a timer right now before i forget so we can tell how long it takes for this to actually kick in i've never actually consumed rso before so i have no idea and i'm stone sober right now so it's gonna hit me like a brick wall all right number seven number eight number nine and last but not least number ten the point of no return wish me luck you guys this is gonna be a long day well it has been an entire minute and i'm not high at all yet i can confirm that honestly i'm a little nervous i've read online that rso can take up to 15 hours to kick in i don't think it's gonna take me that long but that's some of my brief googling told me and before this kicks in i'll explain to you what rso is for those of you who don't know it stands for rick simpson oil it's a cannabis extract but it's not meant to be dabbed like most cannabis extracts let me reiterate please do not dab this it tastes like [ __ ] it is not a fun experience it's much better to be consumed orally like through a pill or through some food it really doesn't have a nice consistency to it or taste so honestly the pill form that i just did is the best way to consume it so you don't have any of that weird flavor rso offers a lot of medical benefits when you're doing what i'm doing not really but it actually does especially for people who can't smoke but as i said this was a super [ __ ] high dose so i'm really curious about what's gonna happen to me i'm really not a huge edible guy like i said even when i've done 150 and 250 milligrams i really just don't enjoy the high i get so i'm really curious what this 500 milligram high is going to be like all right guys we just passed the 45 minute mark and i'm still not high i feel like this is gonna take as long as an edible to kick in so within the next 45 minutes i'm expecting to feel pretty rocked i was just going through my snapchats and somebody messaged me though and said that it took four hours for theirs to kick in so i'm really hoping i don't have to sit here for four hours waiting for this to kick in straight up it has been over an hour and a half and i'm really not that high like i might feel a little something but i honestly think it's all in my own head ultimately i don't think i'm high yet i hope this isn't a fail because i'm gonna be really pissed if this bottle just does nothing to me there's the stats for you as you can see 500 milligrams pack of 10 thc terpenes all that all right let's kick it oh my god i feel like edibles here you're talking [ __ ] bro it's starting to kick in i can like start to feel it in my chest and in my head a little bit it hasn't hit me like a brick yet i just thought this is gonna hit me way harder it's definitely a gradual high i'm actually feeling now it straight up took two hours and 13 minutes for me to feel anything but i'm feeling pretty hopeful right now finally my eyes are getting pretty heavy my whole body's getting that like slow feeling that you get on edibles so i have a feeling it's about to kick in all right well i'm bored i'm gonna go play with my dog or something paper paper high piper you're a dog dog oh my god you're a dog oh my god come here i'm so high oh my god oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] i'm piper sit high five oh i'm too high yeah shake my hand good job piper you guys want to see something kind of funny my dog is an overbite i honestly feel like i'm just melting at this point like oh my god these edibles kicked in pretty strong my entire body just feels heavy i'm gonna try to catch a quick dub on fall guys let's see how this goes bruh i've never felt like i've been running this low in this game i think like time's been slower for me no bruh bruh right i got this i can do this i can do this i can do this oh yes i'm going to qualify let's [ __ ] go bro i'm in like the top three right now [ __ ] okay that [ __ ] me [ __ ] let's do it let's do it let's do it yeah [ __ ] i was gonna be the next one all right [ __ ] this game i need to just like listen to music it's kind of like vibe and [ __ ] [Music] [Applause] i need more water i'm so [ __ ] thirsty if you have the option to get crushed ice and you don't just don't text me back anymore because we're not friends that makes a [ __ ] mess all right let's hydrate before we die drink oh my god that was like the kiss of life all right as you can see we are approaching the four hour point and as you can see my eyes are very heavy i'm not gonna lie man i'm getting higher and higher and higher which is cool i guess but do you really want to pop some rso caps and have to be like still getting higher in four hours like maybe at like certain situations but ultimately dabbing and smoking weed are still my preferred ways to consume cannabis but yeah these aren't so cascade hidden i don't know what it is but i have like a little double vision right now i'm like super foggy it's a different type of high for sure it's definitely more like a foggier body high than like a typical dab high or a typical weed high which more focuses on like the head i feel like this is mainly the body and then like the head is secondary like the head high is there but the body height is so intense that you don't even really notice the head high almost but i think i need a nap like that's not out of their own possibility for me today i'm so [ __ ] high i was really worried like i was talking a lot of [ __ ] on these for a minute there like it was two and a half hours before i really felt anything and it's been another hour and a half and i'm so much higher than i was then so i'm curious when this is gonna like cap so it's gonna be a long day you guys i hope you're down for the ride i'm sorry if this video isn't interesting i know i'm typically smoking and [ __ ] more but i'm just riding this high out dude like this is [ __ ] nuts i low-key just want to keep smoking on top of this to see what happens kind of see if it evens out the head high with the body height a little bit but i don't know if that's the wisest idea but i'm not here to make wise decisions that's nice it's [ __ ] nice i just stabbed on some white widow from calypso big fan of their concentrates they're a little bit on the more expensive side but the terpene profile is just unreal that dab actually made me feel a little bit better i feel like the body height was just too intense now that i got a nice little head high there too i'm like all right all right i'm back in this how long has it been oh how about that 420 blazing four and a half hours in and i'm still feeling very [ __ ] good the cotton mouth is just not going away no matter how much water i drink it just will not stop she's gotta pee and then we're gonna make some wings in the airfryer popcorn turns to food porn the other side hope you are liking this [ __ ] high as [ __ ] home style vlog because this is what you're getting hope you missed me now we are going to turn the air dude do you hear me i'm so [ __ ] big we're gonna turn the airfryer on um boom if you smoke weed and do not have an air fryer i really hope that you can take one thing out of this video and go buy one because it will truly save your life especially when you're high and you want some fire food now we're just gonna drop them in and oh yeah those are done all right food porn is in full effect you guys i'm so [ __ ] high let's determine how one of these is that looks fire oh yeah i think these need some buffalo sauce all right my high i should not have used hot sauce because my dumbass spilled it all over my shirt but i found one that's pretty much the same color to keep the aesthetic piper's pissed off she didn't get any chicken wings saved a couple for later but i honestly think i hit the peak of this high you guys it's really not as bad as i thought it was gonna be for some reason i just thought it was gonna be super intense i've had a lot of 100 to 200 milligram doses before but this is the first time i ever had a 500 milligram dose and for some reason i just figured it was gonna be like two or three times the intensity but i honestly don't think it is i think there's like a peak high you get when you smoke and probably even with edibles and probably just with how much i consume cannabis right now my tolerance is so high that this just wasn't too intense for me like i definitely couldn't drive or anything and i definitely wouldn't recommend anyone try consuming this much you should definitely ask your doctor before consuming any amount of thc don't ask me and don't go off my uh experience probably should have said that earlier in the video but yeah i'm really just [ __ ] tired at this point i'm high as [ __ ] i feel like i've had like all the phases of the edible at this point i feel like i had the giggles i feel like i had the like just chill high part i feel like i had the munchies and now i'm just at the like chill slumped part of the edible like i'm exhausted that's really all i have to say right now i'm gonna have a good night's sleep i'm pretty sure i just confirmed you can't overdose on weed we've been doing this just under six hours and ten minutes it'll be six hours but you know the high only kicked in three and a half hours ago if i did my math right but still being high as [ __ ] three and a half hours later that's not too bad i still don't think that this is the way i would like to consume most of the time like i feel like this is really just for people that can't smoke or like really just don't want to for whatever reason but like this just isn't as fun for me because i hate waiting for the high i like it to just come pretty much instantly it probably will come out quicker if you have a low tolerance but that's not the situation for me you know you really just don't know what how you're gonna get and i'd rather like find out right away when i rip a bong if it like got me high or not then like find out four hours later if you got high or not you know i'm just kind of rambling at this point you guys but that's the video click like if you enjoyed thank you so much for watching i really appreciate it make sure you subscribe i got a lot more videos on the way in my lovely new house with my adorable little pup leave a comment let me know what's the biggest edible you've ever had i'd like to know but it's time i take a nap thank you guys so much for watching i'm

name is 7g if you guys already don't know man and today I got something that I wanted a document man so I bought this a couple days ago I still haven't sparked it up because it was that special right so I busted on my camera man and I was like you know what I'm getting I'm gonna document this specific moment because it is gonna be my first time ever trying this product and I want to see what all the hype is about alright guys so getting straight into this man because I'm I'm excited I'm excited so we are gonna be trying a 710 labs noodle dough Inc alright guys and for those of you are here let me give you guys a little bit close-up of what it is right so if you guys don't know what it is man is basically a special 710 labs pre-roll that they make using a little alright actually got it got to got a little thing right here so noodle doings for breakfast alright hand-rolled with gluten free fusilli for those that are new around here ten packs and singles available around most states that they sell it in and yeah basically man they're just really really special handcrafted joint man with little noodles as tips so that's what kind of what makes them special so for today's video guys I went out two strains copped one of these it is zine Z money number four hopefully yes could get a little close-up of them and because this cameras a beast man and it will show you everything so if you guys don't know man 710 labs are one of the most premium freaking rosin companies out there right now on the market they make some of the best high quality you know we draws in all that good stuff and that's why I wanted to buy it man because this and this one right here costed me $25 right 25 dollars yesterday I know it is a it is a lot to pay for one single one gram joint but I just thought it would be worth it to make a video about it I wanted to try for the longest man so yeah guys so before anything though I'm not gonna read this because I feel like if you know what seven ten laps is you kind of already know their little slogan about welcome to our brand and blah blah about how they take pride in what they do so alright so you guys see it's fresh imma open it brand new opening right here take their Snickle stick with it sound like a little two-year-old so boom if you guys want to pause the video and go ahead and read that that's basically what they tell you guys it's just like a little welcome to their welcome to their brand I mean a lot I feel like a lot of people have already tried it so right do it I don't even know how to open this bro actually you didn't even have to pop it off that much so you basically twist and just pop so out comes the doink right here and holy smokes man this is actually alright look at the two that they put it in it's just really really small eyes doing alright so let me give you guys a little close-up now hopefully that's focused then right there man because this right here goes Z money number four by seven ten laps pre-roll I'm excited to just get started to smoke this man this is supposed to like every single supposedly according to them you know according to their standards they hand roll them so they don't get an uneven burn whenever you light them it's supposed to be an enjoyable smoke the noodle is supposed to give it a really really nice air filter or airflow I mean and yeah man I'm excited right without further ado a man if you're new to this video though before we spark this up make sure you're 18 and over 21 and over whatever it is in your legal statement and yeah guys Cheers 7/10 Labs z money who that right off the bat has a very very very very different taste to it I really don't know if I'm hitting this right but it doesn't really seem like I'm getting too much on you know too much smoke out of this guy so I'm gonna try to get an even burn because so far it I mean it looks even all the way all the way through so far but I just am NOT getting any you know any smoke so let's go in for another hit and see if we could you know get some more smoke all right so what I'm noticing about these is like you you have to hit it very very lightly like I feel like with the winner or like you know a personal and joint that I smoke myself that I rolled I can be taking super fat hits and getting super milky clouds but with this one it's burning nice and smooth I'm not getting any coughing sensation I'm assuming that the that's the noodle filter you know has a lot to do with that so because it's just not going straight into your lungs it's going through a spiral going through that noodle so it makes it a little bit smoother man let me show it let me see if you like to get a little close-up it has such a clean taste like I'm not even cutting this out so just so you guys know I'm gonna be talking throughout this whole thing and see see if I Kaufer I see if I coffee at least one time because I promised you from what it's looking like right now it does not look like I'm gonna be coughing at all me so cheers guys this is actually mad relaxing and the reason that I feel like it's a matter of laxing it's because I'm not even taking like you know super fat hits but I am getting stoned this is the money right here sitting at a 21 percent THC so it's not it's not extremely hype it's either not not low you know and I apologize guys if I'm not talking much man but I'm just trying to enjoy every single moment of this I mean look at the white ash on this it's just stuck so perfectly together I don't want it I don't want to drop this though and on my penance so I'm just gonna hold my hand over it just for now right guys so let me know what I want to know though [Music] dude that is so freakin smooth like oh my goodness I'm not even joking bro it's it's starting to run a little bit uneven and I don't want it to start but dude this is the smoothest joint I've ever smoked in my life and I don't know I don't know if it has to do with the flour or the rolling techniques but now that we're into their flour man let me tell you guys something I bought 1/8 of their flour og Kimbo cush I believe I have 1/8 of a city on my house in a nice clothes closet where there's no sun rays getting in there to keep it fresh so what I want you guys to do men try to get this video to over 700 likes and I'll go ahead and shoot a video of my first time trying they're their actual flower I'll poly roll it up in a joint with a noodle also just to see how it goes all right guys so but look at the ash though let me show you guys real quick man this ash let me see if I could get a close-up that ash is just so nice it hasn't fallen or anything man is just sitting there nice and stiff so this thing is hitting though I just honestly though you guys know me man I'm a heavy smoker so I kind of like to feel you know massive amounts of smoke into my lungs but this is like this is just so smooth because it gives you like the perfect amount of smoke to get you like you know to get that nice hit and that's all you really need man you know you don't really need to overindulge all the time but one of my main complaints right now also would have to be at that for some reason like the paper that was originally a wrapped around this is not I don't know I just feel like there's so many gaps in this you know and it's not really properly closed but it is what it is man we're about to kill this whole joint I'm gonna try to not drop the ash man but yeah guys I also wanted to say let me know in the comments below if you guys have ever tried a 7/10 lapse product whether it was the rosin you know or the bud man because they only really make I mean they make different types of constant shakes concentrates like sugars and [ __ ] like that but they mostly focus on the rosin and their water hash and obviously their flour is something they're they're trying to perfect also but from what I've been reading they have been having some issues of you know being able to produce massive amounts of you know flour and there goes the Ashman it's all good that we got a nice piece of ass right here than dienophile anywhere else all right right there I had a cough but that was just cuz I had so much smoke held in my lungs not even because of like the actual thing right but dude this thing is burning so smooth and I'm kind of I'm kind of happy you know but now that we're getting to the end of it it kind of it kind of actually it's kind of hitting me it's kind of hating me actually pretty hard so I think 710 labs knows what they're doing you know you don't have to be smoking a freaking eighth in a joint every single time to get high man I know there's a lot of people out there that do it I personally don't recommend them and you know I try to conserve my stuff it doesn't matter how much money you have but you know you could always have more money if you save your [ __ ] man but you won't have any money if you buy things like these men these are expensive but are they worth the smoke is what is like the question that I'm asking myself right now and I'm pretty sure you guys are asking me that too is that worth the twenty to twenty-five dollars that I will be paying or that you will be paying and let me see let me take this here record oh no it's getting to the roach and it's still so freakin smooth I'm starting to feel a little bit of harshness but it's still smooth enough to like not even have me coughing so man 710 lives yes I do feel like I do feel like you know this is designer weed you know this is the true definition of someone perfecting their craft and giving it a price that they think it's worth now like a lot of companies I hear that they're putting I mean a stupendous amount of like a price tag on a product that isn't as good as nowhere near as good as this you know like I've never seen a company go out of their way take hand roll a joint with a noodle in it make sure that it's perfect every single time like I didn't believe them when they said is gonna run perfect all the way through man cuz most joints that I smoked like they start they start you know running all like so bad in its socks man and most stores that I know they do their plant tight they're the filters and you know it's just not doing what it's supposed to do and this right here I feel like it's perfect all the way around so yes I do think it's worth that 20 or 25 dollars that's why I paid $65 for the eighth that I bought you know because I was like man there's so much hype if you guys understand you know when there's hype around a product there's a reason for the hype you know it's not just because people are like oh well blah like seven 10 watts for example you know they don't have anyone famous backing them as far as I know it's just pure like just pure hard work putting into their craft and then what they give up to the community the community loves it man so you know that's what that's all that needs to be done is creating a really really well built craft and then just being able to enjoy it not only with yourself but with others man man this thing is just toking away now holy smoked I'm enjoying this video man 100% though there's not I do not regret not even a little bit about buying this joint man I would definitely do it again I think the next time I buy it though I am gonna consider buying the 10 pack because I heard the 10 pack is even better they even put I heard they put like 1.1 in the 10 pack but they don't tell you that so I might go out there and buy one so as you guys can see man I have tried not to cut it cut this video that much but I have not coughed at all like as much or even at all I've only caught when I have a stupendous amount of smoke in my mouth in my lungs for a long period but when I'm taking those hits like I mean look at this word at the freakin roach bro nothing nothing this thing is just so good right now I'm about to go do some work after this some more work I've been doing work on morning man so I went to go get some chiropractic work done and I have been doing homework working on videos things like that sponsorships blah blah blah and this is just such an enjoyable man smoke man am I cut off in the middle of that hit last hit right there guys so hey I was just going to cut off the rest of this video and end it here so I just want to tell you guys I love you guys I appreciate every single one of you guys man this is the money number for hit 100% so yeah guys I hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did make sure to do me a big favor and hit that subscribe button we're trying to reach that 40k up next guys and you guys are gonna help me do that so Cheers I hope you guys have a blessed day man smoke and get high", "0MAp-DXBknc": "[Music] alright what's up guys simplistic here back with another video this is going to be a lightweight spending spree not because of coronavirus but because of the people that are panic shopping and I don't want to go to the dispensary when I do need wax let's just say around Friday today's Monday and all they have left is funcles hash or some [ __ ] like that you know I really want to I'm gonna spend 100 bucks there I'm probably gonna buy like two cartridges of some [ __ ] and then two grams of wax but yeah I'm picking up Ben right now actually I'm outside his house waiting for him to come into the car but other than that yeah coronavirus spending spree in a way it's not really a spending spree because obviously 100 dollars isn't that much I probably could have bought like 10 grams if I really wanted to but 4 grams is enough I mean two cartridges and 2 grams should be enough for me I mean I don't smoke that much you know I don't really smoke that much I do about two three hits at a time and then I am sufficiently high enough to go about my day but just because it's me you know just because I do that doesn't mean that other people do that you know other people are different you know I'm saying but that's how much I smoke I don't smoke that much so four grams should last me about a month if we moderate it you know I'm saying but other than that hopefully you guys stick around I might film in there maybe not because I don't really like to film when there's hella people in there I really got lucky when I went to authentic 209 and asked in the film and this is like when they just started so didn't have too many customers just walking around everywhere and I was a lot more comfortable doing that but maybe we'll see maybe I'll film outside I don't know but I have mother [ __ ] we're on the way picked up be legit we got RJ eats at the back I'm saying I'm gonna say anything about your channel man want to say you know we're gonna have a great day today tonight we're gonna have some great concept for you guys today I'm saying yeah like I said earlier before these guys were in the car we're heading to authentic 209 because people are like panic buying right now and I don't want to be that one guy buying it in like a few days when there's only like fun uncle's funcles hash you know I'm saying or like some some [ __ ] that I wouldn't want to buy but I would probably be forced to buy because it's the only thing left you know I wouldn't want that good packed I'm talking about guys look at how many cars are right here in this this is barely [ __ ] full all the time [Music] what's up guys so we're back at Ben's house I already recorded the intro and a lot of stuff but like I said I was gonna spend a hundred dollars at the dispensary authentic 209 you know I'm saying I'm there real quick angles right so like I said I was gonna go to the dispensary I went along with a legit and RJ eats because we wanted to stock up before it's too late to stock up you know I'm saying and what better way then you start authentic no I'm saying shouts the type in you know I've seen thank you for watching my videos and for coming up to us and letting us know you know I'm saying like he said that it was like a trip you know not knowing us he knew us you know so if you guys ever see us don't ever be afraid to like you know confront us or ain't nothing fun or go up to us you know saying so come cry you want them to go you know what they say is we're just wet okay so as you can see right here I paid $94 all right are you doing good yeah all right ninety-four dollars total blues of it like really good it's not like focus easy you have to go a certain range close auto focus and Fox focuses on certain links changes to get one more time CK's 90-foot that there so first off I'm just gonna bring out these to the part that could be hitting it in there because I didn't bring a battery unless you have a battery he doesn't have a battery but these are gram cartridges each $23.50 these are free cannabis company I've seen these guys from all the flowers and actually picked up one of the cartridges inspected and these guys basically they want to be like the Affordable cannabis brand that's why I mean it's regal [ __ ] I guess but as you can see right here we got the strain white widow and we got the straight blueberry these are OG strains guys if you have never tried we like widow if like it's [ __ ] fire honestly and each of gram and they have 86 and 84 percent THC as well as you can see if you have a battery oh my god tsumuji first why just do it just slowly where's it at right there boom so you can see there's some percentage of CBD pretty good mm-hmm next off you got buddy's mango and this is and you know I've been buying buddies for a while now RJ actually had this so he still has it actually but she could see right here very very good stuff they actually won't list the type of terpene percentages that they have right there it's good to know these stuff because terpenes through the THC percentage and all the other cannabinoids they give up on taraji effect which is basically a mixture of all those effects into one I might do a video explaining that in the future just because it's a very good topic that I feel every person that used this should should know about but mingle live resin the THC percentage is only 60% which is a little bit lacking but it's not always fun didn't get it okay very good why do I have a hard time like focusing on your account so you gotta zoom in and then like at a certain angle it does it I'm used to it so it's that's why you're used to I'm not like if it's not focusing back up okay yeah Jesus I was lost me life resident cuz this autofocus it's not manual got it yeah so I had to explain no I know what it means did was just not like not worth lakhs that's good so I've actually had this before guys this is captain Kenny's and it's actually a strain that I've had from them before it's blueberry muffins few me got it yeah hey I forgot to open this show you guys good no oh yeah at it yeah baby the guy really little [ __ ] means alright and then which check out this one she's pretty ready know what it looks like the smells coming from this amazing okay I'm gonna try work with it right there yeah yeah yeah so what we're gonna do here we're gonna take a hit of one of these probably and try the main one cuz I haven't tried yet and deftly I'm trying to do an else video stay tuned because this is the next video we're gonna do it today but it's gonna be the next video I'm sayin so so yeah point B subscribe if I minded you want those figures that's okay alright just try it that's okay just try it even brought up in the video so you have to save yours I appreciate it no stuff see what I like to do is go on the side and just inch it on there you see that I'd do that like a pro just it's good to have a like a flat dad were to tool see on there baby I'm going to take some more hits of this get it give it to the homies now I'm saying this mingles pretty good that sounds good you know I look afraid all right and this is 30 dude it up slowly press it again whoa that's it here [Laughter] can you get the camera there could be coal buddy boy yeah there's any water Reba it's only cracking guys also I'm going to take one more hand we're probably gonna end this video the whole reason I bought made this video is because I wanted to do a video obviously I want to get a hundred dollars or spend a hundred dollars at the dispensary before the dispensary doesn't have anything to buy no I'm saying and I'm not really scared of the coronavirus but the only thing I'm scared about is how people are reacting to it and they're just buying everything every used each sensual thing that they need at home when you know but we can't even get bread last night yeah exactly get bread for sandwiches can get chicken how you run out of chicken that's so bad so I just wanted we just want to be prepared you know we didn't buy a lot you know I bought four grams just that's okay you know it's probably less me like a month or two these guys didn't buy too much but we got to be prepared a little bit you know last month this should pretty over to the next one April and [ __ ] yeah fat hit he wants to be - like oh damn my Cho [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "9d0gu0EDvt4": "[Music] [Music] hey good afternoon everybody my name is bruce oblin the owner of utoya organics i'm here with my general manager kelly and our it man joseph today we're going to introduce you to terpenes and terpene profiles it's really exciting because terpenes are being used in a lot of interesting ways now and we've redeveloped our skin care line to include terpenes and uh it's pretty cool and we're looking forward to telling you all about it so let's get right at it all right so kelly what are terpenes and how do they different from essential oils well terpenes are everywhere they are in plants they are in animals and to some extent they are you they are volatile hydrocarbons that are found in all life forms not just hemp and plants and things like that they're responsible for the scent and flavor of almost anything you eat or drink and the difference between them and essential oils is that terpenes are part of essential oils essential oils contain a variety of compounds and terpenes are just one of those but terpenes themselves are just that just terpenes and what are the benefits of terpene so in plants terpenes have a variety of functions including protecting from microbasalt and repairing damaged cells there are hundreds of different terpenes in each hemp flower they work with other compounds to influence biological processes they react synergistically with cannabinoids to produce enhanced effects popularly known as the entourage effect terpenes don't exactly get you high but what they do is interact with dopamine and serotonin in really subtle ways to enhance your mood and general sense of well-being scientific studies done on some of the terpenes that are in our products have been shown to improve mood reduce stress improve memory relieve pain as well as being anti-fungal antibacterial anti-parasitic and even anti-cancerogenic which means it helps fight cancer that's amazing that's why our mood enhancing skin care line is going to be so popular i believe because the terpenes we're using in the formulas are parallel with the results that we're wanting to achieve from the formulas and we've even created a really cool uh dank body spray and a uh can of breeze air freshener for uh automotive and and home use so terpenes by the end of the year you're gonna see more and more products coming available with more extensive terpene profiles more dialed in to reach the effects you want exactly and so when you buy your toy skincare line you're going to have a mood enhancing experience as well as a high level of uh quality in the products really totally it actually helps repair damaged cells and makes feel better well that's why we're looking forward to our thing body spray and our cannabis uh air freshener now you know when you smoke a joint in your car or a cigarette you got a stinky friend in the car and you use ozium or something of that nature there's a lot of harsh chemicals in there and our canterburys is natural terpenes all organic and they're mood enhancing so now when you get pulled over and that cops like to run and you just smoke the fat one in your car and you spray this in there you're gonna calm down so by the time you ask for your license and registration you're good to go no not promotion [Applause] so now i'm here with joe and joe is going to explain to us some of the specific terpenes that we're going to use in our product lines take it away joe all right we're going to start with lemonade lemonade is one of my personal favorites it's it's almost always inside of your high energy cannabis profile strains limiting can be found in high concentrations as a compound inside of household cleaners for its ability to dissolve oils easily wow and among that it's also used for mood elevation there were actual clinical studies that were involved in just using the limiting terpene alone and what they found was the presence of the limiting terpene being near somebody who is currently being depressed actually elevated their mood on a brainwave level very cool and that's one of the components we're using in our uh face and body cream so with the terpene profile it has a amazing kind of a creamsicle smell um it's a tangerine profile so when you use this you're going to change your mood hopefully you're in a bad mood and get good i don't know if it'll go the other way if you're in a bad mood the profiles that we're using in the uh skin care line linole is present inside of our skin care line mineral is excellent with analgesic properties and is also an anti-inflammatory property it has the ability to relax you similar to how mercy works however it's not going to date you it's just going to bring about more relaxed feelings and promote a more uh calm and relaxed euphoria hey so thanks everybody for

__ ] down below and subscribe today i do got a weed review you guys have been asking for it so here it is cbx the strain white walker og cbx is also called antibiotics i found this at blue fire dispensary in merced california around me 52 for the eighth people say it goes for like 80 in la and other places so i guess 52 was a steal the white walker og and this is coming to you at 27 and a half percent on the thc .07 on the cbd three percent of terps for a total cannabinoids of 33 it's got some nice buds they're really dense it smells real uh pungent gassy it was really sticky when i broke it up and like always if you want to see an up-close picture of the bud check it out [Music] as you can see there it looks really good this is indica and yeah i've never tried cbx before this is going to be the first time they say that uh white walker og is a indica leaning phenotype of san fernando valley og kush so that's all the information i can find on the white walker og and it did win first place at high times world first place best indica flower and high times and amsterdam first place indica flower so we got high hopes for it so cheers everybody let's get a bong load in hope you guys are having a great day the white walker og by cantabiotics okay our first initial thought after the first hit it's very pungent it's very strong it's gassy it's got that indica uh lung expansion that i'm looking for it wasn't harsh at all and the taste was [ __ ] amazing whatever the terps are that they added to this it tastes really [ __ ] good but like everybody knows two for the review yeah when i was breaking it up it was real sticky pungent nice dense buds i really like the way it looked and the way it smells and off the first hit i'm very uh pleased with cvx so far i will do a few more reviews of other strains by them but the first one is the white walker og and so far i'm not disappointed [Music] i want to give a quick thank you to all my supporters my channel did get monetized like yesterday or by the time you guys see this like two days ago so i am able to get super chats and super stickers when i do live streams now and um yeah so pretty excited about getting my

i got the second one packed we got a beer here let's get this beer out of the way cheers everybody you know what it is full sins or no sins my 49ers pulled off the win yesterday it got [ __ ] scary we were winning all game and at the last [ __ ] quarter they came back and started beating us but uh we came back and got the field goal at the end for the win so that was [ __ ] badass yeah i was surprised to see blue fire had this but it was the first time blue fire dispensary in merced california is the first time i've seen him get it and it was 52 out the door so and so far off the first hit i i really am impressed cheers everybody [Music] wow first one of the day yeah and this is cultivated by a four-star manufacturing i've never heard of four-star manufacturing so packaged on 11 920 so it's very fresh cultivated 10 26 so it's very very fresh that's a good thing i like the labeling too the white walker it's pretty dope cbx some of the label peeled off okay two for the review let's get it [Music] it's very smooth it gives you the lung expansion but it's still very smooth i like the way it hits me i like a good og kush you know strong indica that's my thing so this one i it is right up my alley i really like the effects of this weed i don't feel like i'm down like like knocked out but i feel super i feel stoned as [ __ ] but i can still like do [ __ ] it's a solid strain okay let's calculate it price at blue fire dispensary in merced california the white walker og is going to run you 52 out the door considering other people telling me it goes up words to 70 to 80 for the eighth 52 is a good price the look and the smell of this weed is really good it smells great the look is is good too it's well manicured nice and dense sticky buds the the taste is is great the smoothness is amazing and the high is definitely what i'm looking for in a top shelf indica where i'm going to pay 50 something bucks for an eight this is what i'm looking for so overall for the white walker og by cbx i'm gonna have to give it the 8.7 i really like this strain it's damn near is up there at the 8.9 it's almost pushing the nine so i'm giving it the 8.7 it's a [ __ ] great strain i highly recommend trying it out if you guys haven't that was my review i hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town [Music]", "vvOrD3iny_8": "[Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another delta 8 video uh this is another delta 8 hemp video i actually completely forgot i still had tincture i still had another one of these products to make a video on and uh what better way to have some apple juice but these are tinctures and with tinctures they actually are droppers or like you basically put it underneath the tongue and let it absorb into your system but i've seen people put it in drinks as well and i'm very fortunate enough to have the pineapple express one if you can tell from the intro uh it also says the amount per serving is 30 30 drop wait serving size 30 drops wait serving per container 30. okay so those 900 drops is what they're saying and then one serving which is 30 drops is 33 milligrams of delta athc so yeah let's see this i've only tried a few tinctures and they're mostly very i would say it's a very alcoholic taste because i believe there's like i don't know was it glycerin i don't even know what it was in there but i'm sure there was alcohol in the last tincture i tried definitely was not good at all so we're just gonna open this oh it shows okay so this is at about 75 milligrams i'm smelling it smells really nice so 75 one milliliter is 30 drops so we're at 75 so that should be about should be about 22.5 milligrams all right 22.5 milligrams here we go kind of tasted like bubblegum it's a very minimal taste at best but since it's the only thing i put in my mouth like i can taste it but like if i were to put it in this i feel like i wouldn't taste it but we're gonna do that um but no not bad i was honestly expecting a much worse taste so let's do another let's do another 75 in here so obviously the effects aren't gonna [ __ ] just immediately take over you know so i will be filming again in about an hour or so uh but yes i wanted to get a shot of me pouring this in here how many shots let's see seventy-five another 75 [ __ ] it we'll do another 75 all right so how many was that so that's about 70 milligrams of delta eight thc in there i think i did over 100 plus milligrams on this stuff so i'm excited to see oh [ __ ] you can see it's just is that chill in there what the [ __ ] so just like that's crazy there's like a layer on top yeah i drink mostly it well that tastes like pineapple and apple now pineapple and apple juice that's crazy good so i'm gonna get back to you in about 30 or 45 minutes to an hour i do have a fast metabolism so it might be a little bit quicker than that but overall you know another good way to take delta athc you know there's gummies there's actually dabbing it there's cartridges and now there's tinctures as well and for those of you who you know i think i feel like like some people don't like to um medicate you like normally you know smoking flower or vaping or dabbing or anything and they want more of a i wouldn't say a better way but a more i don't know how to say it but it's just you know you just put it underneath the tongue and you go about your day that's about it you know what i'm saying and uh you you set it in your mouth and you forget it basically but other than that yes i will be filming or i will get back to you in about an hour or so so [Music] all right guys so i am back uh it's been about 45 minutes i mean i do feel somewhat of a buzz but i honestly feel like what i take like 100 milligrams i think my tolerance is a little bit higher than that but i definitely do feel it i definitely feel it around the eyes and everything um as far as like the drink goes i drank most of it because it tastes like just apple juice now and uh as you've seen from the earlier clip it was just sitting on top i mean yeah it's still it just tastes like apple juice but you can still put some of this in here [ __ ] it so we're gonna end it off i'm gonna take some more but i definitely do feel it and for how little i took you know i didn't take that much i took like what 80 milligrams or something or so [Music] okay i'm gonna take some more real quick before i end it off but i definitely do feel a head change oh but yes uh definitely i would i would definitely recommend it for the people that um don't want to smoke or vape or dab or eat edibles because you know that's a lot of uh sugar you know all those gummies like that one video i did recently there's a lot of a lot of [ __ ] sugar especially in the morning but this is a more subtle way of dosing and uh and yeah it's just a great way to to get some delta into your system and it's legal link will be in the comments below if you're interested but other than that hopefully you did enjoy this video cheers to some regular apple juice i mean there's a slight pineapple but not as strong as it was when i just put it in there but yeah hopefully you did enjoy the video peace out [Music] do [Music] you", "ljc8Rl3WAmo": "go ahead and start you can cool so um yeah i'm rodney i'm with uh connor i'm khanna's demo rep here and uh hopefully we can share a little bit of insight on uh some of all of our uh gummies as well as uh who we're who's sponsoring us today so um welcome back to green gold's podcast if you guys don't already know i'm ginger and um yeah this is rodney before we get into anything if you really like our videos don't forget to subscribe so you're alerted every time that we are putting new ones out and uh hit the like button uh you know don't be afraid to even send us a little love in the comments with that being said today we are here to discuss connor treats and a couple of the new things that we got back in which i guess aren't really new um they've been on the shelf for a while um so while we are discussing connor treats we're going to be call quality controlling are nug thca diamond infused pre-rolls they are back in stock for 20 out the door so connor's got some new and fun stuff going on you want to go ahead and let us know what that is yeah definitely so i know a lot of people have been asking about our lychee gummies back so we just recently got those ones back in at a limited time those are those are one of our more popular ones i know i think we're going to be having the summer or the sugar plum just for a little bit longer too so the sugar plum is a really good one that one's very sweet i don't get a plum flavor off of it but it would be more of a sugary yeah it's just sweet but it definitely is worth it and it's nano so their nano brand is they take the thc molecule and you guys chop it up smaller basically they found a way to uh shrink the molecules below 100 nanometers so it has a very fast bioavailability it starts absorbing in your esophagus as opposed to having to travel your full gi tract to metabolizing your liver so you can actually get some of the delta nines out of the nanos as opposed to the regular gummies which would you know travel that natural process and you know give you along i guess it kick in a little bit longer takes about an hour to kick in and give you that hydroxy 11 high that you would see with most edibles yeah and um the that's the difference is you want something that's gonna hit more uh potent it's gonna be more it's gonna be stronger it's gonna hit you faster because the way that it absorbs in your esophagus and it wasn't it that you guys also wrapped a lipid so anything that hit your digestive system the lipid burns away before the thc that would actually be with the nano 5 tinctures that we use oh see we used to carry the tinctures but with the nano 5 or with the nano gummies they actually use a different technology called seds mr sedds stands for self-emulsifying drug delivery system uh which actually the scientists say is a little better than the than the phospholipid encapsulation okay so that means that it's better than putting a fat molecule around the for the most thc it's not necessarily that it's better but maybe it just absorbs it has a higher absorption rate so yeah better better better better availability so um rodney you were telling me that you haven't tried the lychee flavor yet i have not tried the leaves so one of the best things that we like to do around here is quality control much like our nut pre-rolls so i think it's a good idea to make you try them for the first time on camera so we can actually get to see your face awesome for those of you who don't know um uh lychee or lychee i'm not exactly sure the correct pronunciation on them they are berry right um so berry these berries actually can be found in lots of different things um i know them because of when i lived in orange county i lived in an area very close to little saigon so i know them from some thai style desserts that have like a sweet coconut milk berry we're just going to call it the berry now um and you know little like sweet corns and stuff so i know this is like an ice cream topper and like a dessert berry and the actual berry itself to me looks like it's bleached like a beach miller cheese flavor before which is weird but i can't say i've had pink starburst yeah that is probably here we go so a lot of people really think that it tastes like the pink starburst i personally have tasted the lychee berry myself lychee berry myself um i think it tastes exactly like the berry smells like a pink starburst it's pretty good i like it they all taste like candy so you can't really dislike them if you don't like sugar all right and then you are going to be our demo rep for kana so if you guys come through he's going to be here at least once a month i'm trying to talk him into coming in and seeing us more but at least once a month yeah with their super cool demos uh normally it's a buy one get one for a penny i do my best to mark them on our instagrams and to put them up if we have a chance to get them on you know the youtube channel um otherwise go ahead and follow green gold san andreas on youtube in greengold.cannabis and like i said we do our best to really blast when demo days are coming um or put up new products actually i went to point i meant to point out to you um there's one product that i'm really excited about it's completely novelty but it's um cannabis infused red style wine it's it's not wine because there's no alcohol in it you can't put alcohol on cannabis but it has like a juice like a berry juice yeah it tastes like a mascot it's not red i'm sorry the one that we have is a rose the wine itself it tastes like a moscato and it's only fifty dollars for or 50 milligrams not dollars 50 milligrams for the bottle but if you're a lower doser and you just want something to sip on it is so fun honestly like i had i bought um i bought a bottle it's 40 out the door i was drinking a couple i was like making dinner and it actually it was fun the cork smells like wine i would say does it taste like one it doesn't it tastes like moscato like the bubbly stuff like when you're at olive garden and they come over and ask if you want a little sample of wine it tastes like the slightly bubbly moscatos or that's really cool you can do a whole another wine tasting yes i was even thinking about doing a whole girls thing and doing mimosas with them i used to with uh me and my girlfriend and some of our friends we used to do wine wine wednesdays actually the third wednesday every month we do a wine wednesday get together with all of our friends everyone bring a bottle of wine so that could be like a new type of bottle to bring with you exactly yes and it is and like i said the cork you can actually pull it out and be like here babe smell it and then it doesn't have legs around it because of course there's no alcohol but it's still fun to swirl in the glass it was it had atmosphere and let's be like let's be honest if you're gonna drop money on a good bottle of wine it's gonna be about that you know unless you're getting the two buck chuck down the street just to get drunk but if you want something that's you know gonna taste good full body yeah i have to refrigerate those um well they're slightly carbonated so what it is is a top you twist it off and then you have to actually pull the wine cork out so you will need a wine opener um and the top is um the original piece that you twist off you can use that in case you don't finish the bottle okay i finished the bottle and how many milligrams is in it it's 50 so i finished it with a handful of gummies i i would i would finish that probably by myself all right uh we're usually gonna have to have our own bottle of wine tonight yeah um and then um i don't know anything else that you guys have coming out that's new and fun like i see the exotic series what's the next exotic flavor do you know i'm not so much sure about our next exotic flavor i know that one of our new popular um you know items are are built which are our hard-hitting builds high milligrams there's two belts um in a pack and they're 50 milligrams each built so if you have a very high tolerance like us yeah like us it's very good so you don't have to eat a whole pack of gummies feel like you're getting all that sugar in you can have just two of them it's gonna hit you just as hard which i mean unfortunately for me i have to have a few packs so right so having four having four nice strips is a lot better than having you know you know a whole bag of these two bags well it's yummy let's you know the bot at the end of the day that's still uh 20 grams of sugar you know plus all the carbohydrates that's in it as opposed to just having the belts which the belts um i did forget to mention those are in stock as well the texture on them honestly i kind of wanted to ask if you knew what um what sparked those because it tastes like i left the indica strawberries and the luscious lemon vegans together in my car and they melted together you know i wish i could tell you what was the inspiration behind it i haven't all i know is that they are a little chewier they they have a different texture to them right and that's what it is you're the vegan gummies that you guys have have that texture have that same texture yeah so i'm kind of wondering did somebody you know accidentally leave it in the hard car hot car and then they melted and hardened back up and they're like oh dude this is really good we just tripped yeah no i think that we i think when they first started they actually had strips okay they had but they were seeing you know what worked and what didn't work and then the gummies were more popular with them so um seeing with you know other companies that have the the the belts yeah that definitely was something that we wanted to also have um and we also wanted to make one that was hard-hitting so i think it just worked out really good com combining the two yeah um it definitely has worked out really well with those those sell really well and um especially we have a lot of um we have a lot of people who are you know higher dosers that come through here as well as you know even the bud tenders everybody in here is a higher doser but i was actually reading something the other day about the higher dosing could possibly have something to do with your gi tract if you have gi problems and you already have problems with digestion and absorption you could automatically be a higher doser due to the lack of ability to absorb the thc in your small intestines just suggest of changing your diet yeah i heard one one person was talking about detoxing doing a detox i'm like well i mean that's fine but if you're somebody that has like a deeper chronic illness like a crohn's disease or ibs like those people would automatically be higher dosers because the lack of absorption um i'm gonna have to go back and re-read it but the whole article is really interesting and i did really get into it um unfortunately it was a little while ago about a month or so ago and uh so much has seemed like it's happened the world's just and the world's a crazy place right now the world is definitely crazy thankfully that all the shops are still open and then we can still get weed yep absolutely all right well i think we pretty much covered everything we're almost done with our quality control of the nug pre-roll like pretty really yes it is it's almost out definitely was good though i liked it the flavor was fire and look it's already like got it hasn't clogged at all it didn't bend it's almost out and hasn't even run yeah it actually burned pretty slow it's not nice all right it lasts the whole video what is this i know what anyway thank you for joining and we hope next time that we're back you are too come in say hi yeah if you see me come say hi yeah always come say hi when the man's there because he's the one with the deals he brings the deals yup so um let us know what you think about our products if you have anything to add like i said like subscribe and come and say hi until next time bye", "v5yji_saTPs":

inquiry thank you", "UUEJMK1WCMs": "hey everyone uh this is luke with owls and today i wanted to talk to you a little bit about what is distillate first of all what is dystolos so distillate is the oil that you see in our vape carts um it is also used in our gummies distillate is something that is uh it's distilled right you you you see your um you see alcohol and they say like it's triple distilled so it just means it's more purified so for instance what you would have is you could have your preliminary extract that could be anything from an ethanol extraction to a butane extraction to a co2 extraction and the oil that comes out of there uh is basically distilled now what does that mean it's put into uh a boiling flask um uh and actually you know we can we'll take you down to the lab and we'll show you some of this stuff but uh basically um we uh we put that into a boiling flask and then the boiling flask uh is heated and when it's heated it goes up it basically evaporates and then it recondenses and when it recondenses it becomes more purified and it basically leaves some of the heavier or the the other cannabinoids that you don't want in the boiling flask and then the ones that you do want get purified and they get brought over here and there's also what is called a deep volatization that basically will also remove any of the volatile so for instance if you were to do an ethanol uh an ethanol extraction or a butane extraction when you put that into uh your your your for distillation uh the first thing that's going to come off it's going to evaporate first is going to be all your solvents so you can collect all your solvents in one area here and then you know that the the mains which is the good stuff is free of all solvents so let's take a trip down to the lab and uh let's talk a little bit more about distillation all right so here we are and uh this is a it's called short path distillation and uh and basically what is happening here is uh we have the boiling flask and the the flask is heated it's currently not doing a run right now but uh basically uh this is heated that heats the the contents of the boiling flask which would be crude oil or our conversion and then from there once that heats up at certain temperatures you will get evaporation which then will come up and it will travel down the condenser and then depending on um depending on uh where your ass will either be pulling you know the the volatiles it could be uh any solvents and then uh and then once you get off that then you get what's called your heads which is the the first fraction which again isn't really the stuff that you want and so from there you are able to purify the cannabinoids and then once you get to the end of that you can actually get uh i don't know if you're gonna be able to see it but this is basically we can take a video or a photo or something for it but uh you can basically see that there's uh stuff on the bottom here you're not gonna be able to see anything but um uh that's basically it in a nutshell so the the the undesirables are left here or they're or they're reclaimed somewhere else and uh the main uh the main parts of dislo is that's why it's called your mains um they are collected here and then from that i mean that's when they turn into like this you know so um that's how you make uh that's what distillate is and then once it turns into this purified oil you can then put it into vapes gummies edibles creams and so that's what distillate is and i hope you enjoyed the show thank you very much you", "89BV6rVYOBI": "and what's gonna be J it was good for us good bro what it's good faded family so you guys today I'm back with two thousand milligrams of liquid karma THC lien THC syrup whatever you guys want to call

halfway through one more [ __ ] time i'm going to [ __ ] lose it why did i go this way i can't go this way um anyway hi guys so it is 10 24 a.m on a wednesday i went to starbucks this morning i got my coffee i got a venti soy latte with five blonde shots it is beautiful beautiful guys i might have like a [ __ ] stroke just trying to say a [ __ ] sentence but y'all so i have so much to catch you up on so i've not been doing well recently i like i guess i just kind of feel like i'm less than everybody and i guess everybody feels like that sometimes um it's really been weighing really heavily on me recently especially because like i don't know i just like i want to be able to love myself it's just like i feel like i'm incapable of being loved and i want to get past that [ __ ] i'm not wearing any green i forgot that was a thing that you had to work green on same patch and say i feel like my energy right now is very susceptible to whatever i think about so let's do some cool manifestation you know what i mean so like i am manifesting that next year is just amazing for me like everything just ends up being so good like i can get my medical marijuana card because y'all like severe pain and severe nausea count as like one of the things on the medical marijuana qualifications for colorado do have terrible stomach pains if i don't smoke and i literally can't eat unless i smoke because i'll get so nauseous and like in pain yeah so i'm very excited for next year and i love how early it is because i can just sit here for so long but i also hate it because the day can be so hard to get through do you know what i'm saying like the day can be so hard to get through i'm so excited for my future it's gonna be so good and like i'm gonna decorate my room the way i want i've been like i have a um pinterest board obviously like i have pinterest and i have been saving like room ideas like my new life aesthetic like guys i'm so excited hey everybody so i just went to the dispensary and i picked up these and each little piece candy has 25 milligrams and i also got two of these there's 200 milligrams of delta eight in the whole thing and then there's one of these which seems more like a cbd thing like under 25 milligrams cbd and then it has a little bit of delta and even less of delta 9. um so this looks good but i do think that it's more of a cbd type thing which is cool too so i'm probably gonna i'm probably gonna eat these today and then save the rest for later hey vlog so i just came out to my car because i don't really know why i just don't really want to be inside um i just took a lot of edibles like an hour ago so yeah i'm a little high right now um they were delta eight they're the ones i showed you from today i look so ugly oh my god i i saw the sign guys this like right here is like a picture like holy [ __ ] hip hop i need to take my car into the shop [Music] you know what i mean i want to lay in the grass but i also don't want to lay in the grass because it's just not fun here i don't feel free does that make sense this mountain thing i need to take you guys on to on a hike onto like onto a hike there my arm is warm i'm so sad guys i just thought like i'm just sad hey everybody so i just got out of my first class i woke up this morning and like still very high from the delta a edible i had yesterday like y'all also i am going to the dispenser today um to get more of the chocolate bars because i want to start taking edibles just for a little bit like the delta eight edibles so when my when i go back to like smoking like blood like i feel like it'll be different i'll also like i'm most out of like wrapping papers so you know um yeah and i'm almost out of bed too so i'm gonna get some edibles um so i'm very excited for that also yeah i lost my little stud in my nose yesterday so i had to put a little ring in there and like it looks fine like i'm not mad about it but like i'd rather have my stud now that i'm going to get my coffee like i'll i'll be fine yeah i mean also you dumb idiot um but yes that's about it i think my eyeliner looks really good today like i'm pretty happy about that i don't know what i did with my eyebrows i did like little like i don't know like drawn on eyebrow rings i don't know and guys in class i felt so bad but like i was just like i'm suited in class i was not expecting that let's just say that y'all i like really like my hair like this oh okay so i'll catch up with you guys later um i'll probably take another edible tonight so i'll let y'all all all update you on that too um i liked what i did yesterday i like smudged a joint after i took the edible and when it kicked in it was like perfect hi vlog so it is the next day i guess i don't i don't know i have no track of like no concept of time right now i am going to get gas right now and yeah i'm excited to pick up some cbd that'll be fun i have class and an hour of spanish and then i'm going to go to the cbd dispensary on my lunch break and then afterwards i have ap lit whatever whatever did you all see that oops hey everybody so right now i'll be on my way to pick up some cbd from cbd dispensary i love there are a lot of dispensaries around me like a lot and i'm so grateful for that guys i feel like i don't talk about how like grateful i am just like to myself or on this channel like i feel like i don't express my gratitude very much i just kind of take things very like not even i don't it's not even i take things for granted i just don't express how grateful i am for something we are stopped this is surreal like this feels surreal to me i hate this [ __ ] i'm just glad you guys are here i'm just very glad you all are here because if y'all weren't here i'd be bored out of my [ __ ] lines and also if y'all weren't here i would feel so alone y'all make me feel safe what the [ __ ] is going on but y'all oh life hack if you ever have like a starbucks cup you should always empty it out and like um i mean like after you drink it like clean it out and [ __ ] like that and then if you're ever worried about the cops like pulling you over and thinking that your cbd is actually weed you can always put in a starbucks cup that is empty and like all cleaned out obviously and [ __ ] like that you know what i mean but yo what the [ __ ] is going on like i'm so upset right now if we don't move soon i'm going to cry but y'all it's okay because this will end soon and i will be at the dispensary and i'll take a different way home because i know better hey everybody so i'm driving in the rain and y'all i wanna i'm i think i'm going to starbucks i don't really know if i'm gonna get anything or if i'm just gonna like turn around and go home after this because i don't know why but that's just not the point of why i'm filming right now because i just got out of philosophy class today they were like so anyone who would consider themselves consequential as like a consequentialist with the knowledge you have already like obviously we don't know everything about it so we can't really say like i'm a consequentialist but like with the knowledge you have like everybody who would consider themselves that go over here and consequentialism is like basically judging the morality of your actions based on the outcome it's more like like they take intention into consideration as well but there's another one that a lot of people might classically agree with which i was really surprised about but also it kind of fits their personality like um like there's a rule and like you don't break it and if you break it you're automatically doing something immoral and like obviously it's like like let's say like you're smoking weed and then the cop walks up to your house and it's like [ __ ] what you doing and then you say well i'm smoking weed and then they say well i'm taking you to jail because that's illegal in consequentialism you'd probably be able to be like oh well i have terrible anxiety and this helps so like is it actually bad like am i hurting anybody is there any bad outcomes from this the cop would be like like if we lived in a consequentialist society the cop would be like i guess you're not hurting anybody and there are no bad outcomes okay you're good keep smoking your weed like in the cup would just walk away but the other theology which a lot of people actually agreed with it was like you make a rule it's like the cup gets your house i smell weed oh yeah i'm smoking weed okay you're coming to jail um oh actually i have really bad anxiety and like i really need to do this too bad it's a law you're coming to jail with me that's what the other one was and it started with the d or something but i'm not sure what it was um but a lot of people agree with that and i was like really and like i guess our government does do like like we have federal laws or like whatever and we have like just laws of like um not just federal like i'm some really smart guys hi could i have a um could i have a ham and swiss panini not heated up okay cool uh that's all i don't know if they were done i was just like okay that's all and they just did not say anything i literally work here though it's like fine but like so weird also when you go through the [ __ ] drive-through turn off your [ __ ] windshield wipers if it's [ __ ] raining stupid [ __ ] idiot not you not you that was not directed at you it's just directed at one customer who literally saw us like getting splashed every two seconds and just like left it on hi vlog so it is so wet outside like it's raining or it was raining and my like i'm soaked like look like i do kind of want to change up my hair a bit um i mean like honestly i could just cut it all off like honestly i could", "jkZ-G3cog0c": "[Music] so [Music] welcome to vote pro podcast the award-winning cannabis news podcast brought to you by votepropot.com here are your hosts phil adams jay britton and andrew mccready's biden's pick for drug czar is a bit out of the historical norm we're gonna tell you why uh jay speaking of history is gonna give us a little cannabis history lesson and uh jay you've also got a little bit of business news right for those who follow canna business um we've got all of that and so much more thanks a lot uh folks for coming and joining and sitting down or driving or whatever you're doing but listening most importantly to our humble podcast thank you and welcome to another episode of votepro podcast um we're gonna get started with um some inside the beltway news what about that sounds good but first let me just interrupt no please do can you see we we do this on zoom so he's looking at it see what i got today i just got this what it is i don't know i'm going to say it this i bought a cartridge a vape cartridge from my vape store in virginia which is not thc it's just this is right delta 8 thc have you heard about it that's the big craze now there's a little loophole in the law delta eight is very close to delta nine which of course is what we all used to using to get high phc delta nine delta eight is a molecule a compound rather that's in the plant in the flower on a much smaller quantity but what happened when they passed the uh the hemp bill the farm act the farm bill whatever the hell they called it farmville making hemp 2018. what they what there's a loophole where they go in and they can pull the delta eight out of the flower and concentrate it and sell it and what it does is it gets you high but it's different from delta nine it's a it's a sister to delta nine gets you high but it's how do i explain it it's like you feel you realize you're high but you don't have that lack of focus you know how you get you know you do a couple bonuses you're always done and you're standing at the kitchen sink or you have the refrigerator open for like 15 minutes why am i standing in the time thing you don't get that and you don't get the paranoia so anyway you can buy this now legally and it's pretty interesting pretty easy now so so you're enjoying the effects of the delta i took a couple hits before the show so let's see how that goes but no i've tried it and it's a uh it's hard to explain it's not like a stone thing like what you're used to smoking a joint or something but it you feel it do you feel a physical uh sensation you feel a little bit of that euphoric kind of i feel good thing and i feel relaxed wow yeah but i don't have that like what time is it man so anyway i just thought i'd throw it out there for those of you what did i come to the kitchen for again you know what i'd love if some people would write us write us you know podcast that's pod pod cast at votepropot.com let us know what you think of delta eight i'd be interested to see yeah let's get a little bit of i didn't mean to interrupt your very important up-to-date political news phil i just don't patronize me man okay go for it no i'm kidding we've got two separate bills that now these are both been introduced into the house and senate before but uh didn't go anywhere and as we know when the senate was controlled by the republicans senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is not in a rush to get any of these things done that's for sure so they've been reintroduced and there are two of them and i'm going to start with the secure and fair enforcement banking act it's called the safe banking act it was reintroduced this week by colorado representative ed perlmutter and this has got a lot of bipartisan support they're more than a hundred co-sponsors um and they're from both parties that's great and it's got a very strong chance of passing now what the legislation does uh would allow financial institutions to basically serve the cannabis industry without facing any federal penalties which many banks and credit unions they don't want to take on any cannabis clients because of these federal sanctions the fear of right um and what happens well they have to operate on a cash basis and crazy and it's it's a pain in the ass and dangerous i mean these guys are walking around millions of dollars right yeah they're vulnerable to all kinds of crime and it complicates you know they've got all this financial regulation compliance and it's just so complicated on a cash basis it's just it's not worth anybody's time in the financial world i don't know who on the republican side is sponsoring it but it might be uh kevin kramer do they have a fair amount of republican support yeah they've got strong republican support i think it will pass i i have a feeling it would have passed if if mcconnell had ever you know dated to to put on the floor um but that's hard to say but it's a good bet to pass now um promoter said uh quote it's time to enact safe banking to align federal and state laws and reduce the public safety risk in our communities and and that's true and uh we're just inching our way towards some sleep legalization this is inching our way this is this now this is in the house um and a similar bill is expected to be introduced in the senate next week i don't know who is going to sponsor it but um that's that's the scuttlebutt the other bill is um called the claim act and again this is how i don't know how they come up with these acronyms but it's the the clarifying law around insurance of marijuana act you know it is what it says now what what it would do is it it basically keeps the federal government out of the insurance uh uh out of the penalties for insurance companies covering cannabis industry firms um it just would prohibit it it would are they penalized now yeah you can be penalized simply for offering coverage oh my god to uh to a cannabis firm and and uh and and the same thing as the same lines as the banking yeah and the same line as the banking it's a sort of a financial industry and um it would also now there's a lot of provisions of this bill but it would also the other thing is it would require the gao uh the government accountability office to study and to report on any barriers that are being imposed barriers to the marketplace to financial services licensing any of that stuff the gao will be responsible to keep tabs on this and make sure that this all flows smoothly and and people are not being unduly burdened and the senator on the democratic side who is sponsoring this is bob menendez of new jersey and on the republican side is rand paul of kentucky well rand paul's a libertarian right so he's always going to be on the side of getting the government out of your face that's right and he said here's what he said the principles behind the claim act are simple respect the voices of the states and their people and stop shutting out legitimate businesses from obtaining basic protections ah how do you argue with that you know how do you argue with that right yeah exactly so why are they doing this doing this being federal legalization in such an incremental way why don't they just if they're gonna take the time to pass all these bills why don't they just pass a bill that says it's legal you know why all these little incremental baby steps yeah that's that's the way government works as well the the old saying is that politics is the art of the possible yeah so they're doing what they can what they can yeah well you know what the uh with the makeup of the congress and the white house being what it is they have an opportunity why are they doing this all piecemeal i really don't know because they can but they but they're doing what they can i guess send us your thoughts at

remember we had on um we had on a guy i don't know maybe a year ago or a little less than a year a fellow by the name of warren bobrow oh i remember warren well he had a great time with oren yeah a lot of fun he's a he's a big wig in the industry you see him on tv and you see him all over the place he uh he writes for forbes magazine he writes for forbes and a bunch of other magazines uh on cannabis and he's also known as the cocktail whisperer that's right and he was on the show uh to talk about a lot of things but one of which was promoting a new line of uh infused beverages he has which i believe are out now called claws k-l-a-u-s oh cool yeah so this is a story out of there i suppose with a k yeah the original version right um this is a story out of marijuana business daily by bart shannon and the title of the story is how are cannabis infused beverages doing in the market basically sales of the cannabis infused beverages are up 40 last year as companies sought to capitalize our new marijuana customers seeking a familiar form of consumption and those looking for an alternative to drinking alcohol okay according to data from seattle-based cannabis analytics firm headset sales of marijuana infused beverages increased 40 last year versus 2019 recreation and recreational markets such as california colorado nevada oregon and washington state cannabis infused beverages rose from 67.8 million to in 2019 to 95.2 million in 2020 wow so that sounds like a pretty significant growth does to me but what you have to realize is the overall industry grew 40 too so they grew kind of you mean the overall cannabis industry or the overall beverage industry cannabis okay all right but they didn't lag behind so that's good right they're at the same 40 growth despite the strong growth of infused beverage market um there's a small port there's still a small portion of the overall mix they're about one percent one percent of the entire cannabis sales are beverages now that kind of surprised me i thought it would be a little better than that but this year they're at 1.2 percent 2021 so far so david they're edging up a little it might seem obvious but kind of the marketing idea i think for most of these companies is that you've got a lot of people who are new to cannabis yeah either have never tried it or haven't in a long time and some of them are a little cautious about rolling a joint or doing a bong hit or buying a dab rig you know right but it's easy to buy a drink pop a top and drink it another thing is they say that um this is again how they're marketing it it's much more acceptable but let's say you get a cocktail party with a bunch of friends somebody lights up a joint right everybody turns around and looks what the hell is going on yeah right you know what i'm saying it's like but but if you go to the refrigerator and grab a can and crack it and pour it into this i'm just gonna give it a second thought nobody thinks about it so they're thinking that's kind of the uh the whole idea so so it's a kind of a social fit in type of a thing social acceptability now here's the question um you've had cannabis infused beverages before i don't recall that i ever have um i understand they don't taste so great well again that was warren's that was warren's deal that he was going to produce something that really was good he's written six books on making drinks yeah and he says that he has come up with a formula and a way to infuse drinks and market them that taste delicious we have not i have not seen his drinks i think they're in can uh california yeah i don't think they're available in maryland or virginia or virginia yeah no but i would like to try some clothes me too me too i have had a couple of different uh and and i've they're fine if you the kind i've had or you put a little cap full and you drink the capful like fruit punch or something so it's like a little five hour energy or something i have not tried like you know one of the seltzer drinks where you're going to drink 12 ounces right i don't know what that's like i wonder how much [Music] thc is in one of those salts or drinks it varies a lot of them are actually um making them fairly low like five to ten yeah yeah so that you know you can drink a couple socially and not get hammered you know right and uh i think that's kind of the intent i mean why would you buy a drink that's 40 or 40 milligrams or something you know they're five and you can drink two or three and and get a little buzz and it comes on slowly and that's one of the things they talk about in this article was some of the people are cautious about china because it takes a while for it to kick in yeah so there's a couple of uh manufacturers who claim to be coming out with products that kick in in between five and 15 minutes well that would be helpful i think yeah like you have a glass of wine or a drink you know and you feel it and yeah 10 minutes later you know how it's affected you right and the problem you you and i both know that edibles is sometimes you it's an hour an hour and a half and you don't think you've gotten any effect from it and you drink six of them so the drink the drink market is doing well but it's not blowing the doors off anybody so uh you know good luck to uh to warren and all the all the manufacturers anybody have any experiences with some of these cannabis infused beverages love to hear from you bye he's the president oh right the president um i've heard of him yeah been around a little while he has been busy you know setting up his administration and uh we've been sharing some of that with you in the last few segments or last few episodes this week um and this is an article from marijuana moment um which i love by the way there's all kinds of great stuff um about his top pick what a lot of people believe is his top pick for the director of the federal office of national drug control policy aka the drug czar and rahul gupta is the leading candidate for the position of drug czar he was the former chair of the west virginia medical cannabis advisory board um and he served on biden's transition team what makes gupta a little different is that he has actually publicly recognized the therapeutic benefits of cannabis whoa that's encouraging yes he has really and and he has and he worked in west virginia with the control board advisory board on a legal cannabis program so to authorize medical use of of marijuana so um that's a little bit different take on a drugstore you know drug czars are usually the enforcement czars saying no no but this uh rahul gupta may be if he's picked he may be ready to break that mode what an interesting what an interesting pick seriously what does that say well i i think the the what how do you read those tea leaves you know i don't know because the sum total of biden's picks um since really mixed messages right there was that's my point the other one uh uh oddly enough also named gupta of anita gupta um who was uh confirmed i believe as the assistant attorney general is not in favor of legalizing or decriminalizing drugs she just said flat out and we told you about that last week merrick garland who was confirmed as attorney general may be a little less strident about it we just don't know so i mean up and down the biden administration i i just i'm not getting any strong indication uh of a pro-cannabis bent from these folks although i'm not getting an anti-cannabis spent either so i mean that's something yeah it could be a couple things could be just that that's just not a priority for them and that's not one of the things that you're looking at on the resumes of these people or because drugs are you with things drugs are that's what i was going to say but drugs are a guy who's very pro that seems to that kind of i don't know well i think it's it's it's encouraging if if you're going to read anything into those leaves exactly whatever whatever kind of leaves that you want it's encouraging we but again wait and see the odd thing is that the the drugs are the director of the on dcp is required by federal law to oppose any legalization effort of any drug banned under the controlled substances act so i don't know where he's gonna fit or or what's gonna happen but instead of a dilemma he's in there but maybe it's time for that law to go as well so yeah um let's let's let's hope got a new segment we're gonna try this out all right on a regular basis we're going to do a little piece on history history is related to cannabis last week we did a little something on on the beatles yeah and uh cannabis remember i got a 100. thank you you did i got both questions right i think the idea is to we'll cover a lot of different topics you know events that occurred you're not going to quiz me again are you i might have a question for you yeah uh but you know just just it could be anything it could be 2 000 years ago the chinese and what they did with it it could be you know how marijuana became illegal in the united states in the 30s we'll cover all that but we're going to start out with something fun this week and that's cheech and chong all right so are you really mad all right well you know there's a lot more to cheech and chong i think than what people assume by the characters they played well the characters we grew up with the characters we grew up the stereotype stoner you know many people suggested that you know that they were detrimental to the cannabis movement because you know they they created this stereotype the stoner stereotype they they defined what the stoner is i disagree with that oh i heart will heartily disagree with that do you good because i would argue that chieftain strong did the exact opposite that they through their comedy kind of shined a spotlight on the culture of the 60s and 70s and part of that counterculture was cannabis now and as much as anything they made fun of it exactly but if you look at cannabis and the way that cannabis was perceived the use of cannabis before cheech and chong before the 60s right before the counterculture it was the reefer madness thing right our parents generation the 50s the 40s and before yeah they believed that people that used cannabis were you know mexicans black people yes and that they took it it was like heroin and it made them go crazy and rape women this is what people believed and i think they opened the eyes in some ways them and others right through their comedy and just regular dudes yeah and just to get a perspective of what they did cheech and chong the ones that you hear on the records in the movies and the stage were actually two really hard-working really intelligent comedy writers performers yeah they created these characters you know and there's not unlike what you know uh three stooges or you know the lord or something exactly you know it's a character to make fun of and laugh at right but the stoner characters that they portrayed was an artistic creation it was just something they did them that was funny and and it was a vehicle one one of many i mean he listened to their records they had all kinds of characters kinds of stuff that's right right cheech marin said in an interview that he never smoked pot while he worked ever not once not when they were on stage doing comedy not when they were making movies or records oh i believe it he wouldn't be able to this guy was really smart he went to i'm talking about cheech he went to uh cal state at northridge and he was an english literature major oh yeah and he only he dropped out eight credits short of graduating to run to vancouver canada to avoid the draft vietnam to avoid the vietnam draft and that's that's that's where he met uh tommy tommy who's the canadian right exactly not only that cheech was this cracked meal he was a member of the five sigma kappa fraternity sure why not if you ever listen to an interview he's a smart dude he went on the first uh jeopardy uh celebrity remember that celebrity oh he knocked it out he kicked the ass of no other than cnn's anderson cooper crushed him crushed him didn't just beat him and crushed him but he's a smart dude yeah um so anyways a little history the guys met the two of them met in 1968 in vancouver and marin was uh delivering carpets and he met tommy chong tommy was a musician and he was running an improv group in a strip bar that his family owned and so he talked marin into joining this and they after a while doing the the the stuff they became a stand-up duo right and they became quite popular in vancouver and they decided they've kind of done all they could do in vancouver they said let's go to la they went to la and they were discovered in clubs there by no other than lou adler now those of us who follow music know whoever is he was a huge producer he owned the roxy right he owned uh uh a couple of those clubs on the strip oh yeah couple clubs of strip he owned um dunlap dunlap dunhill records he started that record company huge record label he did he produced tapestry yeah one of the biggest selling albums of all time yeah he saw them in a club said hey let's make a record they're like a record yeah let's make a comedy record right so like in 1970 they made their first album which did really well it's just called uh chichen chong 71 and they followed up in 72 with an album called big bamboo that's right big bamboo and that began yeah well that was the biggest selling comedy album in history at the time yep and then their third album won a grammy so i had that one that's right after they had all that success with records they decided we need to make a movie right well so they put the script together they went around a bunch of a bunch of the studios in la nobody would do it nobody that that was too controversial a couple stoners it's not gonna be fun it was stupid you know um so what happened is paramount lou adler worked with paramount and they said paramount said hey what we'll let you use our studio and our facilities but we're not going to finance it so they financed themselves they were eating peanut butter and sandwiches by the time they finished that movie they spent every penny they had yep making that making up and smoke up and smoke which was huge yeah i think they spent a few hundred thousand which is nothing for me it grows like 50 million or 45 million uh so they did really well yeah so that's kind of their history and they actually split up at some point and i think they're mid 80s yeah a little bit of a falling out and they each went their own ways actually cheech had a very successful solo career in television oh yeah he was a regular on uh one of those cop shows well no cheech was on the cop show nash bridges nash bridges right tommy chong was on uh the one with tim allen what was that show uh home improvement home improvement yeah yeah that's right so they they they had a little bit of a falling out and uh and they did get back together eventually and and that they made an appearance on the late show as stephen colbert in 2018 in a response to john boehner remember boehner sure he was a republican uh speaker of the house and he left he left congress and he became he found himself on the board of a big marijuana a cannabis entrepreneur now yeah yeah so they went on to talk about that and they expressed their displeasure that uh marijuana was no longer rebellious and i i love this quote i'll finish up with this cheech said that um he could now buy weed from a store in a strip mall when we used to have to buy it from behind the store in the circle so anyway i think cheech and chong did a lot to kind of reverse the stigma and kind of make it fun yeah light-hearted make you realize that it doesn't make people who use it murderers and rapists and addicted like regular people just regular guys now you may remember this back in junior high school jay and i have known each other since then yeah that's right we had our junior high school had a very good basketball team and we would have pep rallies each start of each season and one year we had a pep rally do you remember michael alexander oh yeah tall skinny black skinny guy he did they did a version of basketball jones which was a big it was huge he he had a basketball with him and he wrote the words on the basketball in pen in case he forgot them and he played what was the character's name tyrone shoelaces that's right and i think a lot of the teachers had no idea right [Music] that was like early 70s man yeah yeah yeah 73 74 something like that here's the final final question all right let's see how let's see how your trivia is one question for you their first film as we said was up in smoke what year was that film released 76 77 78 or 79. 78 bam you're good man nailed it yep i just you know remember where i was when it came out that's great that's great all right so i'm three for three on one and the thing about tommy chong is you know when i when i wanted to learn how to do the a canadian accent or those kind of i i listened to tommy chong is that right oh yeah man you know he's got one of the best canadian accents out there you know i never even know what he's talking about but you know he's got a great one well it's funny because cheech marin does the best like hispanic southern california compton accent yeah but that's how he speaks at all but yeah well he doesn't normally speak but i guess that's how what he was brought up on but he was but the two of them man well what a great comedy team some of the best comedy ever guess that just about does it for us this week we are glad that you joined us um we hope uh you enjoyed the show and if you did tell a friend about it
