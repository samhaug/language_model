take heart while you can't actually cure garlic breath there are some things you can do to help neutralize it first you should understand that garlic breath actually comes from your lungs not your mouth according to the Mayo Clinic garlic is a food that contains special oils that are absorbed into your bloodstream these oils then get into your lungs where they can give off odor in breath until the foods are eliminated from your body you may be dealing with garlic breath in the meantime what can you do you can try to neutralize the garlic odor chewing fresh parsley may cut the smell a bit also chewing some herbs like peppermint or spearmint may help chewing fennel seeds or cardamom seeds may also help to neutralize the smell of garlic not enough you can try to mask the odor of garlic breath be sure to brush your teeth regularly for several minutes also the American Dental Association recommends using a mouthwash to help mask bad breath odor the effect may only be temporary however and you may need to repeat mouthwash rinses periodically chewing gum may also help to cut the garlic breath smell a bit and WebMD says breath mints may be able to temporarily mask bad breath voters

we're back for another strain review today we are checking out some flour from a company that we have not featured yet on the show this is some garlic breath from pistol point that's right this is an organ company originally they just started popping up in Cali I've seen them on the Shelf that a few different shops I believe they're on the Shelf at Garden of Eden up in Hayward but yeah this stuff is Dave so this garlic breath it says right here Barbary Coast times pistol points so this was a collaboration between them I'm not sure in what capacity Barbary Coast collaborated in this all I know is it's exclusive to them it's the only place that you can get it Barbary Coast in San Francisco that's where we pick this stuff up the first impression and the jar appeal were what made us go with this one honestly it was some of the best looking flower that they had on the show this is a cross right here GMO cookies and a GMO being that chem dog GSC cross obviously that's where you get a lot of that garlicky smell at least when I had the GMO cookies a very peppery garlic the fire nonetheless we love [ __ ] with chem dog in it as you know having a lot more screens on the show lately they kind of have some of that old-school Kim lineage I don't know if I put this one quite in that class but a little bit of the influence in there this stuff looks incredible first off we'll just talk about you know the way the bud catches your eye when you peek into the jar I mean this isn't really what you want your [ __ ] to look like it's completely caked up the structure on this stuff is really really nice it's not you know it doesn't look blown out it looks natural but at the same time these mugs aren't banging they are banging not really sure what the THC percentage is on here it says 895 point three milligrams in the eighth so we're just gonna have to get used to this we're gonna have to figure out this conversion y'know this or just stop doing it because we all know the THC percentage doesn't [ __ ] matter but I always like to throw it out there but I'm saying it less and less which is kind of weird I feel like that's definitely a marketing tool so start putting the damn percentages back on there and game guys come on anyways garlic-breath it definitely caught my eye that's why I bought it but when you crack it it smells really good almost smells like Cash's grandma's cookies that's what I was gonna say so we've we've reviewed a bunch of strange lately crazy crazy names I forgot we've had this you actually did this the other day on the video we rolled up a [ __ ] cone or the strand of you forgot we even had it I almost just did the same thing let me just get this thing going real quick but we've been doing a bunch of strange lately gushers skittles all these different streams that have a name that implies how you would think it would taste or smell this one kind of falls into that category for me but honestly I'm not getting as much of the garlic thing as I have just even on some other GMO like you said it's kind of giving me that cash vibe that grandma's good mr. keen oh yeah I like the name but you're right I've had GMO and to me GMO should be called garlic breath you know that smells really garlicky to me this smells more you know skunky doughy very cookie ish I'm getting a lot of like every cookie almost like a really really really good form cut so growing medium on this stuff was a 50/50 mix of soil and cocoa that's kind of cool that they put that some of that information out there online on their website and stuff for people to check out they give you a little bit of info on how they actually grow their weed if more companies start doing that that might kind of be a cool thing to be able to compare because obviously we will have a little bit of experience growing in different mediums but most the time when I'm trying weed unless I get it from the grower himself or herself you don't know I don't know what it was growing it yeah yeah it's kind of nice to have that little tidbit of information I personally like soil don't I mean there's nothing against coca some of the best growers I know you scope though pretty nice to know that this was a 50/50 mix you know super soil and cocoa because you know I think Shane can say he probably likes soil too is just that's what I feel like it gives you a little bit more natural flavor of it brings out the flavor of what the strain should really taste like and I could be completely wrong but that's just my preference yeah I don't know why I don't know the reason behind it but personal preference for me soil again because of the flavor like you said for whatever reason we just tend to taste a little bit better but I would imagine there's you know a perfect mixture that you could find just like for you know hash oil we always you know a lot of people did straight butane a lot of people did straight propane I always like that like 70/30 mix yeah 70 butane sorry okay I'm sure there's a you know depending on the grower depending on how you do things I'm sure everybody has their own kind of sweet spot for their style you know yeah and growing medium is just one of those factors you know the effect on this [ __ ] is great bro I mean regardless of THC percentage or milligram each it's hitting me right between the eyes it's almost making me like get a lazy eye super heavy honestly for me I know it says it's a 50/50 mix but I think it's hitting me a little more indica getting harder and harder to talk but I do know one thing I know that 895 milligrams and 1/8 is a lot so I'm guessing that's gonna be somewhere around 25% I feel like maybe I am getting a little bit of garlic my taste now through the through the joint yeah a taste I didn't I don't smell that at all when I smell this again when I said oh this it's not that it reminds me more of like the OG k be cooking us or the Cash's grandma's cookies that's the smell for whatever reason that I'm getting that out of this but the taste is a little bit different and actually getting some a little different joint ya know I mean I can see why they called it garlic breath but it's just not as strong as some of the GMOs that I got when I smelled the GMO like damn that's one like sure you garlic shit's crazy super peppery this has some of that in it it's just not as present we should get a microscope to do these reviews that meets a little like USB microscope like a pretty decent quality one I'm sure that's pretty inexpensive now that'd be cool to kind of get an up-close look at just the trikes on it and get you know kind of the macro shot of the bud this stuff to the naked eye looks like it just has those tiny tiny trikes but they're just covered every however you live especially on the underside of the inner bud I mean it's got that typical really good top top shelf cookie look this was what top shelf cookie looked like when it first came around a little more calyx II a little bit so somewhat a little bit more crazy looking at you know but I don't know I just mmm I like the smoked purple crush almost every day of the week yeah this is close to it but not quite okay going on another rip from the bong here what would you go with this if we were gonna give it a radiance so I'm gonna give this one a solid 9 I think the flavor could be a little better looks our 10 effect is a 10 I'm very high but you know when when judging Bud critically it's also a little dry for my liking like like you can feel this now here there's really no moisture to it it's very dry yeah so this this bud a bunch of the last few strains we checked out have past the stick factor you know so this bud does not want a whole dick factor it like wants to grab it this is not sticky weed I would not you know yeah it's like this right this it wants to grab but it's just not sticking very kind of more of a dry resin or just not as sticky of a resin I don't know man I would say this wind looks really good it's something a little bit different I am enjoying it I don't think this would be something that I would smoke personally like on other faces it just doesn't pack quite as much of a flavor profile for what I'm looking for it definitely has set in kind of a nice buzz I'm feeling it set in up top I kind of work its way down really like the high a lot that's why I bumped it up nine might be a little generous but pistol when I'm talking with you on this [ __ ] I'm giving it a nine yeah I'm gonna go with an eight on this one like I say just maybe not quite it may be more of a personal preference thing on this one for me with the flavor but it is interesting this is I like to try something new every now and then and this is definitely something new I would maybe try it again but if I wouldn't you know see this being something out I'll put in the regular rotation I feel like I feel I'm just giving it a bone because if you get a ten on Lex and ten on effect ya there you gotta give it respect so a nine and an eight that does it for this strain of you please like and subscribe down below do all that [ __ ] do your homework appreciate you guys joining us for another one we'll be back next week for another strand of you once you're out of the CCC I'm Shane I'm Daniel peace bye this is probably down the Dow still smokin oh gee Danny [ __ ] with some Bank doubt good smoking back in the trees so sticky Yoji smelling", "AeSYJHR4HGs": "garlic-breath is unavoidable especially if you're a hardcore and garlic lover like me now people have come up with all sorts of different ways to get rid of stinky ass garlic breath so today I'm gonna do an experiment to see which method is the best way to get rid of garlic breath all right here's what's gonna go down before every method I'm gonna chew one garlic clove do the method and then I'm gonna have my trusted breath sniffer give each test a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down first up good old tooth brush and floss supposedly if you brush your teeth and floss immediately after eating anything garlicky it gets rid of the smell I've done this before and I don't think it really works but let's see what leo things just work out marionette grillo that I'm gonna brush my teeth this is weird I've never done this on camera let's just speed through this shall we this is very intimate experience the floss okay come yeah breast Tessa you know those things yeah I can still feel the garlic penis are really scrub for my mouth so this is not work next step chewing on fresh herbs the reason why garlic gives us such a bad breath is because got sulfur compounds k that stinky stuff so it is known that fresh herbs like mint and parsley have chemical properties that can bind on to the sulfur compounds and then freshen up your breath kind of like minty gum another garlic oh I made my eyes water all right here we go I'm just gonna put all of this in my mouth parsley and [Music] what happened in my mouth I know a good trick a little less garlic Sarkar come every working I'm a pest Oh okay Lea it smells like chimichurri so what do we think of it yeah next drinking green tea through a stainless-steel straw green tea is known to have polyphenols just like herbs which are supposed to help out with the funk and if you know that stainless steel trick where you've been working with a bunch of garlic's your fingers smell really bad and you just rub them on a stainless steel sink and it removes a smell that's kind of the theory here with the straw so I'm thinking if I drink the green tea with the straw I rub this straw out of my mouth it should get rid of the smell it's so strong I'm just gonna take little bites a type because apparently I'm still garlicky [Music] imagine if you're on a date and you just had some garlic knots or something wow it's less than that really oh oh they're buddies laughs we toss up stainless steel straw good for your breath and the environment next up stainless steel soap bar I thought I take that stainless steel technique to a whole extra level by sticking this entire stainless steel soap bar into my mouth I'm gonna twirl it all over don't be grossed out this is lucky to be in my mouth it doesn't get better oh don't do this at home you may choke and die don't do it I don't smelly oh it's very very very little so uh Vito one next up mustard rinse mustard is known to have antibacterial properties because of all the turmeric in it that's what makes it super yellow I love mustard but I am NOT looking forward to this one mustard okay snip me I don't know that garlic at all hey what next apple cider vinegar is there nothing this thing can't solve let's see if it'll cure garlic breath because just like the mustard this is known to have antibacterial properties as well bottoms up [Music] ah no I just smell like a dressing this smells like a dressing I still take this our electricity next chewing on coffee beans I think this is supposed to overpower the scent of garlic because it's just straight-up bitter ass coffee means I wish these were the chocolate-covered kind but I'm just gonna do straight-up coffee beans all right garlic and first I really hope this works [Music] smells good it's just coffee works right goes up and finally vodka I don't really know why people suggest this I'm glad they did because they feel like this is a frickin award for this entire experiment well you know what right God used to soak garlic cloves in vodka put the bottle in the fridge and then you just take a shot every day please dad was good for no circulation everything she'll salud [Music] smells like darling still swell yeah very strong all right we've put together our top three methods you've got the green tea with a stainless-steel straw mustard and coffee bean the green tea with a stainless-steel straw I feel like is a very easy method to do especially if you're already out eating it's just a little awkward toiling that straw around here tongue you're still left with a little faint faint smell of garlic breath but it's still pretty good second runner-up is the mustard now this completely got rid of the garlic smell instantly but it's not very fun to do now Leo made a point that it might be easy to do on the go because you could just carry mustard packets do little do-gooder in the bathroom and spit it out and the winner of all these methods coffee beans it completely got rid of the folk but it's not very pleasant to chew on you might get a little bit of stain your teeth but nothing like turmeric so the next time you're in a funky situation give these methods a try and let us know which one works the best for you see you next time", "jaFFIR9srhE": "Oh such a shot darling that was out back of the head here we go [Music] I to lemon will have to be the milk [Music] so house goes first [Music] oh that's definitely the basket quite garlicky I'd say like that's three I can't smell anything that's actually perfected that's like that's probably like a nine I'm going to go with like five and a half I say still getting some garlic ah okay so a little really garlicky oh yeah that's like the city like say like seven oh seven eight like seven and a half probably like this is what that is bit it's like creamy dressing that is such there's like zero so as they say as they taken whatever this bacon I just basically made a garlic sauce creamy garlic look past it that works really well eat a whole one of these by Dennis you carry it around on a day and pot them up as flowers [Music] you [Music]", "ovK_S85xOGM": "garlic bread garlic pasta garlic Pizza anything with that garlic flavor is great but you may even not like the taste of garlic and you've been eating it to fight off vampires or viruses anyway whatever the case the fact is that eating garlic makes you smell so unless your aim is to keep the vampires away then the smell of garlic would be a good thing but in all the other cases garlic smell is considered an unpleasant odor and can cause all sorts of awkward social situations but don't worry if you are a passionate garlic lover and you just can't go without eating it and not that you should here are five ways you can quickly and effectively mask reduce suppress or completely get rid of the bad garlic breath first brushing and flossing this is the most obvious one but it is surprisingly effective good oral hygiene is essential for combating bad breath and when done correctly brushing and flossing could be already enough just on its own to effectively get rid of garlic breath however brushing and flossing should be done as the first step regardless of whichever of the following methods you would use second chew on fresh mint leaves besides easing heartburn and indigestion chewing fresh mint leaves will help get rid of compounds in your mouth that cause bad breath mint as well as parsley contain chlorophyll and the act of chewing the leaves will help to scrape the odor causing compounds from your tongue and teeth third drink hot green tea green tea is very high in antioxidants called polyphenols same as the enzymes in the mint and parsley polyphenols are very beneficial for covering up the odor causing particles left in your mouth from eating garlic drinking green tea has shown to be even more effective than chewing gum or mint leaves fourth use chlorine dioxide mouthwash research has that using a chlorine dioxide mouthwash is especially effective at removing bacteria plaque and small food particles from your teeth and tongue for the best result to neutralize the smell immediately use the mouthwash right after eating a garlicky meal fifth drink a glass of milk it is not just an old wives tale even scientists say that drinking a glass of milk can really get rid of garlic breath and effectively stop the lingering odor the research has shown that drinking milk significantly reduces levels of the sulfur compounds that give garlic its pungent smell and flavor so if you're worried about garlic breath and you don't have mouthwash on hand then drink a glass of milk some of these methods are more effective than others and some work really well when combined together I will cover all the eleven smell Buster's in my latest article that I have left in the link for you in the description below this video in this article I will also reveal a new type of garlic that is quite unique this really is the ultimate garlic lovers dream this garlic is even more nutritious than regular garlic and it won't leave you smelling bad after eating it so you can eat as much of it as you like I've been eating it for the last six months now and it is absolutely amazing I never have to worry about the garlic smell and it also tastes great to read more about it follow the link to my full article below this video check it out now", "Lj7AqN2ap3A": "in this case I'm gonna show you how to take the germ of the garlic so when you eat it you don't actually smell afterwards from garlic you don't have a smell staying with you take a girl you go garlic clove get the end out peel it once this peeled that's your garlic turn around and just slice it through the middle once you slide it through you should be able to see what's inside on the inside you got germ in the middle which is this here depends on a garlic where the garlic is from and hold it is by using the most of the garlic they have a German side it's very easy just put the knife through and should come off very easy and there's a germ same with the other side because once you split in half it's in both side and you take the German and this is the only thing that your stomach cannot digest is too hard for the stomach so you don't digest it for the next day that's why the smell stays with you hours after hours", "lMEIek-FwTs": "hey guys I'm going to show you really really this is like a super quick video and it really works everybody loves garlic it's like the best tasting stuff in the world anything you make with it it kind of just brings out a great flavor unfortunately the next morning you wake up and you smell like it it's in your skin it's in your breath and you just can't get rid of it so you eat it and you know you're doomed to like maybe up to three four days sometimes depending on how much you eat so this is a really cool way for you to get rid of the garlic and you never have to worry about again it's really simple and here it is tada mustard okay so this is what you'll do the next time you eat garlic and you eat a ton of it and you're worried about it just go get about a spoonful and a half of mustard okay it's not the cutest thing in the world but it works get a spoonful and a half a mustard and you swish it around your mouth and spit it out kind of like you would thus terrine um rinse your mouth out so you don't have that nasty cook in your mouth and then you take another like heaping spoonful and if you have to squeeze your nose whatever you have to do swallow it and it kills the scent and so the next day when you wake up in the morning it's like you never had it and I can tell you I've made clams and white wine sauce with tons of garlic in it like the cold clove in it and I've eaten it all and I'm fine and next day like I no longer have that nasty taste in my mouth I no longer smell it nobody around me I've asked like look tell me the truth dude I don't care if I'm funky I'm funky just let me know no one smells it so the next time you have that urge to go crazy with garlic try it yourself I promise you you'll be back here - just tell me thank you it worked it really really is a good thing and that's it that's all I had to say um next time you get that urge to have this little little thing you just go ahead and add some mustard to it you'll you'll be fine all right have a great day bye", "AD6yUfZAHVw": "hello I'm Simon Whistler you're watching the today I found our YouTube channel bend in the video today we're looking at why garlic makes breath smelled bad there are a few things going on to course this bad smell but principally the root causes various sulfuric compounds from the garlic initially most of the bad breath resulting from eating garlic comes directly from the sulfuric compounds introduced into your mouth garlic also promotes the growth of some of the microbes in your mouth that already cause bad breath which further exacerbates the problem you may have noticed that even if you brush your teeth rinse with mouthwash and other such methods to clean out these compounds and various microbes from your mouth the bad breath caused by garlic still remains to some extent this has to do with the fact that some of these sulfuric compounds get metabolized eventually making their way into your bloodstream the primary smelly culprit here has been found to be allyl methyl sulfite which is passed into the blood during the digestive process once it's in your blood it gradually gets passed out of your body through various bodily excretions which includes being exude 'add through your pores and also passed into the air that fills your lungs so as you breathe the air goes into your lungs and is contaminated by the owl metal sulphide this in turn causes your breath to continue to smell even after you've cleaned your mouth out as mentions this sulfuric compounds will not only find its way into the air in your lungs but also be exude adorn pause this causes your whole body to smell not just your breath as you are excreting this sulphide you essentially are wearing a stinky perfume this effect lasts as long as it takes for your body to get rid of the stinky sulfuric compounds which can be anywhere from a few hours to as much as a day after eating the garlic now as to why eating asparagus makes your pee smell the smell in this case comes from the way that certain chemical compounds in asparagus break down inside people's bodies this is why cooking asparagus in various ways does not result in the same smelly byproducts the specific digestive enzyme that breaks down the compounds the asparagus to produce the smell aren't present until you eat the asparagus as to these specific resulting chemical compounds that ends up causing the smell it has long been thought that it is from methanol methanol is a colorless gas that smells a bit like rotting cabbage it is composed primarily of sulfur but also contains hydrogen and carbon more recent research by Robert H white from the University of California proposes an alternative theory white used gas chromatography mass spectrometry to try to identify the cause of the smell and he concluded that it was actually from the s methyl bio esters specifically s methyl fire acrylate and s methyl FeO propionate fire esters like methane fel are primarily sulfur-based except they are formed from sulfur bonding with an acyl group in either case the ability of a particular person to produce the necessary smelly compound in their urine after digesting asparagus was thought to be a genetic trait unique to only some humans until relatively recently recent research done in France China and Israel all independently showed that this is not the case rather all humans appear to produce the smelly compound but only some humans can detect the smell the ability to detect the smell or not is a genetic trait further according to the study done in Israel only about 22 percent of people have their genetic ability to smell the odor from the urine of people who have recently eaten asparagus so I really hope you found their

Hey, it\u2019s good for your taste buds and good for your body, but you\u2019ve got to wonder, how can something that adds such a brilliant flavor to food leave you with such bad breath after you eat it? Our buddies over at Compound Interest have some answers for us, so sit back, get peeling, and get ready for some hard chemistry facts about garlic. Garlic contains four major volatile organic compounds that are responsible for that notorious garlic breath. Interestingly enough, none of these compounds are present in garlic until it\u2019s crushed or chopped. When garlic\u2019s structure is damaged, enzymes convert the compound allin to allicin \u2013 the compound responsible for garlic\u2019s distinct smell. Allicin is then broken down into the four compounds that were just mentioned. Once you take your first bite, the allyl methyl sulfide compound is broken down in the body much slower than the rest of the gang, so it\u2019s mostly responsible for your garlic breath. This compound is then passed into your bloodstream and organs, and is excreted when you sweat, breathe, and when you have to pee. But hey, if you\u2019re worried about garlic breath, try eating some parsley or drinking milk. These two foods are actually known to reduce garlic breath! There\u2019s also more to garlic than its delicious flavor and accompanying bad breath. You may have heard people tell that you garlic is good for you health. Well they\u2019re right! Garlic carries antibacterial properties, and three compounds in particular do the dirty work: Diallyl sulfide, diallyl disulfide, and diallyl trisulfide. Sulfur-containing organic compounds like these can penetrate the cell membranes of bacteria cells, and combine with certain enzymes or proteins to alter their structure, which ultimately damages the cells. Also, along with these organosulfur bacterial assassins, allicin has similar antibacterial properties. Well now all you people out there are properly armed with some chemical facts to back your love affair with garlic, maybe you want to check out this other video about the chemistry of Sriracha, and hey, why not check out Chemistry Life Hacks Volume 2 \u2013 it\u2019s got a little tip for an unwanted effect of the other most loved allium, onions. So thanks for watching folks, we\u2019ll see you again soon, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe.", "iAJA6b-6DEk": "this naughty girl has been like a leech would never leave me for the last about the

friends I am totally confused not totally confused I don't know what to tell you and what to talk because I saw so many good things so many creative things so many innovative things and so many good things happening to mankind that all my depression about mankind being the enemy of mankind is almost wearing out slowly after seeing all of you with I always go around telling people that man's greatest enemy is man today and it's nice to know there are human beings in this world who really mean for Okakura them-- you know sure Ihram you're all very professionals belonging to several

at the outset thank you all for allowing me to come and meet with all of you because this you know this is such a nice feeling that you forget the whole world worries when you see good people doing good work and all the brothers and sisters of this wonderful city Nagpur where I keep coming now and then and it's a wonderful place I like or everybody here plus I like the maharashtrian food that we had this afternoon it was subpoenas election we are very nice what did we have Cuddy and we had a buck Rika bar green but Vacaville Oh mockery Scot is it what is that okay okay whatever and but the last thing was very good mango American American so nice so nice that was the bonus of coming to not put friends people say he has done this year than that don't believe that I now almost feel like echoing what one of those great people of Germany of your fawn johanna Gertie said one day he said I know no philosophy physiology jurisprudence and even in Las geology how much from end to end with labor scheme but here I stand Oh fool with all my lord no wiser than before friends man must try to be wiser whether look at this a hairdresser I like it because most psychiatry she hate me they would like to see me see the end of me because I am dead against psychotic drugs because each one of them derived from either rocket fuel extract over from naphtha extract of no Joel damaged the human system it's not only the circuitry trucks are the trucks also because there's a beautiful study done by an American scientist a great scientist he is actually professor of genetics in the Washington State University Douglas is called Douglas Dec Douglas Douglas did a fantastic study he created a chip called them MIT chip mitochondrial chip a computer chip which attracts the drug when it goes into the human system and it tells you where what it does and he took lot of our modern medicine we call it as modern medicine ways it's called modern medicine I don't know anyway we call it as modern medicine and the other horrible drugs mainly debate in Chinese and Indian herbal drugs and what came out in that study is something fascinating the minute we give any drug when I give any drug it may be anything from aspirin to statin it the body says this is something new I have not seen it you know my ancestors have not seen it mankind has not seen it so it must be a poison that's the wisdom of the human body so any poison which goes in the body tries to throw into the chemistry chemistry Factory in the body called the liver so it's thrown into the liver every drug mind you mark my words every drug now what the liver does it does its best to destroy it thus it's best to destroy it supposing the liver is not able to immediately destroy the whole lot something comes out of the liver which we teach pharmacology students as first pass effect I used to ask a lot of professors of pharmacology when I go around medical or this lecture what did you teach about the first Oz effect so that comes after a circulation in the liver but what is it about what is the philosophy behind it would you believe not one person ever answered that question the answer should have been or the student must have told trying to prescribe as less drugs as possible as less strikes as possible because every single drug when it becomes a chemical is not recognized by the human system as its own this is the beauty I will give you an example there are 43 studies on garlic in the world literature 43 studies of garlic and the conclusion is garlic is good for cooking but not as a medicine now there was an editorial in the British Medical Journal and the editor was a good friend of mine so I told him I phoned him and said I am going to write a letter to you Richard you have done one mistake you are not seen what did they use garlic studies what they used was a garlic pill now what is garlic peeled wasabi garlic anything that we e we want it to be either nice to the body into for taste or

gets the message saying that look mister RBC your time is up so the RBC responds the cell is intact apoptosis is intact cell becomes smaller smaller smaller smaller and becomes a morphic the losses in structure form and at that time it becomes a speck of dust and we have lotta scavengers and they have so efficient inside they don't require even that machine to grow they come eat it up phagocytes phago fish is appetite they have got so much of appetite for cells any cell that is dying they eat it up so you're fine but now what happens you make the surrounding of the cells so bad that the cell

what how do you get rid of the heinous toxic fumes floating off every word that comes out of your mouth how do you get rid garlic while garlic does provide many health benefits it's also the bane to many singles going on a first date or employee hopefuls going into an interview actually it's just awful for everyone on the planet who didn't eat garlic garlic is eating a compound called el methyl sulfide or AMS for short is not broken down during digestion ends up being absorbed into the bloodstream from here it moves to our loans and sweat glands giving you garlic breath and Bo here in a whole new level the reason garlic is super smelly is due to poor sulfur-containing compounds that can be difficult to mask mints just are not gonna cut it here one study from the Ohio State University the school I graduated from explored numerous possible remedies to neutralize garlic's odor and came up with three solid methods number one eat an apple not just because this would be good for you but also because apples left in the open air oxidize or turn brown right and fruits that oxidize contain an enzyme that deodorizes sulfides found in garlic number 2 drink some green tea green tea contains poly phenols that not only function as antioxidants but also neutralize all four of garlic's smelly sulphide components number three take a tequila shot all the tequila a lemon-lime slice or any acidic beverage with a pH lower than three point six can destroy an enzyme called Alan X when this enzyme is mixed with garlic enhances the sulfuric stench so lemon lime it up and get rid of Alex bonus BAM Oh drink some milk professor cheryl behringer who conducted the garlic research at osu found in a previous study that a small glass of milk can reduce the presence of a MS and hence reduce the garlic smell up to 50% so for the Royal anti garlic odor flush consume a green tea apple lemon-lime smoothie with milk although I'm pretty sure that's gonna make your breath smell much worse than the garlic itself but if you guys try it let me know how it goes in the comments section below", "UqwhjE6FjNo": "me and garlic we have a special relationship I love this stuff the more garlicky something is the more I'm gonna like it but everybody knows that when you eat a lot of garlic you get some stanky stanky breath so I have an easy solution which is chomping on some parsley leaves it's not exactly the most appealing thing to be chewing on but the oils in the parsley are actually going to neutralize what causes bad garlic breath so unless you don't mind offending everybody with your stinky stanky hot breath and go ahead and choose some parsley the next time you indulge in a little bit too much garlic and everyone around you well thank you", "EwiLCxV5Qxg": "why do I smell like garlic did anyone ever tell you that you smell like garlic or onion funky breath or stinky underarms can happen to anyone at any age whether or not you've noticed them some body odors can signal a health problem but most breath and body odors are normal let's explore why do I smell like garlic reason one eating too much garlic foods with strong odors such as onions garlic and cumin can contain oils that may cause odor as they are excreted through the skin adding a clove or two of chopped garlic can have a transformative effect on the overall flavor of the dish you're cooking however this extra flavor can come with a particularly smelly disadvantage the result of a chemical compound called allicin which makes garlic sweat emanate from your pores what is Allison Allison contributes to garlic's antioxidant anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular protection properties however the benefits are only seen in raw garlic cooking or heating garlic can lead to the destruction of the enzyme hollandaise which is responsible for the production of Allison and for making garlic one of the foods that make you smell bad compounds that are transported through the blood can also be released through your sweat glands that can make your armpits and skin smell bad it's normal for stress to cause smelly compounds to be released through your sweat how to solve drink a lot of water in the case of a sweaty garlic odor it is said that the lack of water will cause sweat to easily develop a sticky smell drink water diligently to activate blood flow and sweat gland function and aim to have a good smooth sweat mineral water is recommended for drinking as a measure against odors if you sweat minerals will flow out together mineral water can replenish the water lost by sweat and also take in minerals shower with antibacterial soap wash away sweat and odor causing bacteria by taking regular baths or showers be sure to use antibacterial soap as these are designed and proven to remove odor causing bacteria take time to thoroughly wash areas of the body that are more prone to sweating such as underarms and cap it off by drying yourself thoroughly to prevent bacteria from breeding on skin wear breathable fabrics the kind of fabric you wear can also affect how much your garlic sweat as you go about your daily activities choose fabrics with better breathability such as cotton silk and wool to allow air to enter your clothes and keep sweat from building up for workout clothes moisture wicking synthetic materials are best as they may be able to keep the sweat off your skin when you sweat less bacteria on your skin cannot grow and multiply as easily to cause body odor don't forget to change your socks and wear breathable training shoes to prevent foot odor as well then let's see why do I smell like garlic without eating it reason to liver failure in the case of liver disease sufferers can experience excessive sweating and a foul-smelling odor that's been likened to garlic or rotten eggs your liver regulates your body's blood sugar if your liver can't function properly toxins will build up in your bloodstream and give you foul-smelling breath that takes on a sweet musty odor as the liver becomes more severely damaged more obvious and serious symptoms can develop such as yellowing of the skin whites of the eyes swelling in the legs ankles and feet caused by a buildup of fluid swelling in your abdomen caused by a buildup of fluid known as ascites if unfortunately you encounter these conditions you should consult a family doctor immediately for a full-body examination how to stop smelling like garlic garlic breath remedy why does garlic make your breath smell so bad garlic smell is created by the sulfuric compounds that are present inside it furthermore garlic is also known to be a promoter of some microbes inside the mouth that are often held responsible for causing unpleasant breath you may experience mouth odor for up to 24 hours or more after eating raw garlic the reason why the garlic breath is hard to get rid of is primarily due to the fact that it is simply not just on your tongue the compounds that produce the bad breath are also in your bloodstream your lungs and are emitted through various pores in your body 24 hours is a very long time for your mouth to be smelling bad especially if you intend to interact with people need to go to work or if you have a partner who can't stand the odor let's see what we can do to get rid of garlic breath one drink water drinking water after meals can wash garlic or onion remnants from the tongue or between the teeth it also stimulates the production of saliva which helps to remove some of the odor producing bacteria from the mouth 2 green tea tea is effective at reducing odor from the breakdown of food in the mouth by bacteria so why not enjoy a cup of green tea with your meal or soon after one study suggested that green tea eliminated bad breath more effectively than mints chewing gum or a product containing parsley oil green tea may have additional oral health benefits another study found that a mouthwash containing catechins which are beneficial compounds in green tea was able to reduce plaque as effectively as antiseptic mouthwash 3 brush and floss the bacteria that contribute to bad breath are usually found in plaque on the teeth and underneath the gum line brushing the teeth and flossing after meals can significantly reduce the number of bacteria in the mouth and eliminate other causes of bad breath including plaque and food particles depending on your kind of toothpaste brushing also temporarily masks the bad breath in your mouth by getting rid of garlic residue on your tongue on your teeth and below your gum line of course you have to use some of the other methods below to be able to get rid of the odor completely still brushing your teeth thoroughly as an inevitable and necessary first step 4 eat apples we all know that if you cut an apple and

causing sulfides in garlic 5 drink lemon juice this works particularly well with crushed garlic the acid in lemon juice neutralizes all anaise and enzyme produced by crushing garlic that causes our unfortunate odour situations we know this option doesn't sound too appealing if drinking a cup of straight lemon juice are sucking on a lemon isn't up your aly try squeezing a fresh lemon into some hot water instead six drink milk surprisingly you can also get your garlic breath under control by drinking milk a study published in the Journal of food science reports that milk significantly reduces the concentrations of the odorous compounds produced by garlic and helps to move garlic out of your digestive system faster whole milk deodorized some of these smelly compounds more effectively than fat-free milk 7 chew gum if you don't have much time chew a piece of gum to quickly freshen your breath the gum will leave a fresh smell behind that will temporarily mask the garlicky odor plus chewing gum helps to stimulate your salivary flow and that extra saliva can wash away the garlic food particles that are still in your mouth while any gum can help cover up your garlic breath it's best to choose a sugar-free variety this is because sugar containing gums can contribute to tooth decay as explained by the American Dental Association eight scrape your tongue a lot of smelly bacteria can build up on the back of the tongue and most people skip that area when brushing their teeth although the American Dental Association says this is an optional oral care step using a tongue scraper or toothbrush to clean your tongue may help temporarily freshen your breath you'll also want to avoid these foods that give you seriously bad breath we hope you learn more about garlic

Even consuming garlic supplements in capsule\nform can give you garlic breath. So, the best course of action is to go natural\nto get rid of garlic breath instantly.", "UE8v_zKwSC0": "oh you never guess what a pen so in this day and age boy starting to like the gills you play hard to get uh so i took my knitting needle his neck and I said wait take me on a date so we're going on a date oh I'm so excited but though I have a bit of a pickle because you know I really like the source but I also really skid of my breath smelling like garlic so I don't know if I have enough time for the garlic beware of my breath before the type but I really like the sauce so if I just have a little bit it won't make a difference I it won't I oh I really like this source so I'm just going to go brush my teeth I'll be right back okay", "ox-dzJ6qDdI": "\u266a Intro \u266a So you\u2019re out on date, and really jonesing for some Italian food. You head to the restaurant, have a nice dinner, and it\u2019s not until after the fact that you realize your breath and your entire being reeks. Oh, garlic\u2026 So delicious, and yet so treacherous. Why do you do this to us? Well, garlic breath, like most things, has to do with chemistry. You may have noticed that whole, unpeeled garlic doesn\u2019t smell very much. That\u2019s because the chemical compounds responsible for that classic garlicky aroma only form if the bulb is physically damaged. When you chop or crush or otherwise mangle a clove for your favorite recipe, you end up releasing alliinase enzymes, which quickly get to work breaking down odorless alliin compounds in the garlic into allicin, the stinky stuff. So it\u2019s the allicin you\u2019re smelling on your hands and the cutting board, but it soon breaks down into a bunch of other compounds, a lot of which contain sulfur. And those compounds are where your garlic breath comes from. Take a bite, and it\u2019s these guys that hang around in your mouth, stinking up the place. One compound, allyl methyl sulfide, or AMS, really tends to outstay its welcome. It\u2019s the one that takes the longest to break down, and it can linger for a whole day or two. Now, brushing your teeth and physically scrubbing these molecules off your tongue may help lessen your death breath a little, but part of what makes garlic breath so notorious is its persistence. Once it\u2019s ingested and absorbed by your intestines, that stinky AMS enters your bloodstream intact, and eventually makes its way to the organs that will ultimately excrete it: your kidneys, lungs, and skin. Which is how that distinct garlic smell can resurface again in your pee, your breath, and sweat, and continue to haunt you long after your last bite of lasagna. Okay, so you love your garlic, but you also enjoy talking to and/or or kissing people without making them recoil. Is there anything you can do to get rid of the smell? Well, some research has found that eating certain foods, like parsley, apples, spinach, mushrooms, basil, and citrus may help make garlic breath at least a little bit less intense. We\u2019re not exactly sure how they work, but researchers think these foods may contain certain enzymes or other molecules that help deodorize or break down those smelly sulfur compounds. And a 2010 study published in The Journal of Food Science suggests that the high fat and water content in milk may also help deodorize AMS molecules more quickly, especially if you drink it while you\u2019re eating your garlic. Still, I wouldn\u2019t count on any of that stuff to bail you out before an important meeting or romantic evening, and a lot of food chemists just recommend trying to mask the smell with a different odor, like a breath mint. Or twelve. And uh, try not to sweat too much.

Fame and fortune might lead to nice homes,\nfast access to top-notch surgeons and personal trainers to keep up their looks, but when\nit comes to halitosis, their battles are just as real as anyone's. You may shudder to think of your favorite\nstar or starlet as offending everyone around them every time they talk, but it turns out\ncertain celebrities are known for their funky breath. Here are some celebrities you might not want\nto have a close encounter with after all. Ben Affleck Forget Kryptonite. Word on the street is that Ben Affleck only\nneeded to open his mouth and breathe on the Man of Steel to deliver the fatal blow in\nBatman Versus Superman: Dawn of Justice. \"He has the power to wipe out the entire human\nrace.\" Rumors of Affleck's halitosis problems have\nbeen around for years, apparently dating back to Forces of Nature co-star Sandra Bullock,\nwho allegedly complained about the leading man's bad breath. Multiple female co-stars have complained of\nAffleck's bad breath over the years, but even so, Affleck seems to have no trouble courting\nwomen to share a smooch with him on-screen. Jennifer Lawrence It's no secret that Jennifer Lawrence is a\nnotorious prankster, so when her Hunger Games co-star Liam Hemsworth revealed that she brought\nthe funk to their romantic scenes, it was pretty obvious that she did it on purpose. \"She's one of my best friends. I love her. But if we had a kissing scene, she made it\na point of eating garlic or tuna fish, or\u2026\" That certainly puts a damper on all those\nTeam Gale smooches, but we'll just have to assume that when Lawrence isn't making her\nco-stars weep over her eating habits she keeps her mouth clean and pristine. Britney Spears The Princess of Pop has also been accused\nof being less than minty fresh, and some suspect her fad diet to prep for her turn on X Factor\nmay have factored into it. Spears slimmed down in anticipation of the\nshow by taking in a mere 600 calories a day, and experts speculate that her weight loss\neffort might've had a negative impact on her mouth in more ways than one. \"I feel uncomfortable with you even staring\nat me.\" While Britney Spears may have felt the slim\nwaistline was worth it, those around her seemed to suffer the consequences. One source even told PopCrush her breath would\nbe smelly again within twenty minutes of brushing her teeth. Lamar Odom Khloe Kardashian's family might have loved\nLamar Odom while he was still happily married to the reality star, but sis Kim Kardashian\nmade no secret about the fact that his oral odor offended them. \"Khloe, I almost throw up in my mouth everytime\nI give him a hug.\" Ultimately, the revelation lead to her forcing\nher brother-in-law to get some much-needed dental work done and extract the decayed tooth\nthat was stinking up the joint. Jason Segel How I Met Your Mother star Jason Segel's bad\nbreath was an unfortunate side effect caused by his addiction to smoking, and his on-screen\nlove interest in the hit CBS comedy made him kick the habit before she would go anywhere\nnear him. He later admitted, \"[Alyson Hannigan] left\nme with no other option. So I quit the day we started working, and\nI haven't had a cigarette since.\" In addition to his overall health, Jason Segel's\nbreath improved dramatically. Johnny Depp Despite being a heartthrob for decades, Johnny\nDepp seems to have no love for personal hygiene, and bad breath rumors have plagued him over\nthe years as a result. Johnny Depp came to his own defense in February\n2016, saying, \"When I met people they said, 'You do look like a hobo, but you smell really\ngood.' And goddamn it, I smell really good!\" Angelina Jolie She may be one of the most beautiful women\nin Hollywood, but apparently A-lister Angelina Jolie's breath is anything but dazzling. Her now-estranged husband Brad Pitt once reportedly\ngave her breath mints as a Valentine's Day present as an inside-joke, as Brad Pitt repeatedly\nteased Jolie about having terrible breath. \"Ungh, but yeah, yeah\u2026\" Jessica Simpson Not only did Jessica Simpson confuse tuna\nand chicken, but apparently the blonde bombshell has also failed to grasp the importance of\nregularly brushing her teeth. \"You don't brush your teeth?\" \"Ugh. Well. Not all the time.\" \"Maybe three times a week.\" Apparently, she really hates that \"slippery\"\nfeeling that teeth get when they're super clean, so instead of routine brushing, she\ngets by with a combination of Listerine and daily flossing. Simpson also chews on Nicorette gum, despite\nbeing a non-smoker. Hugh Grant The Academy Awards are supposed to be the\nbiggest night in Hollywood, the one night stars are supposed to look \u2014 and smell \u2014 their\nvery best. But Hugh Grant was so smelly at the 2002 Oscars\nthat his friends reportedly gave him mouthwash to gargle before stepping on stage. \"Mmmm. Yeah. It was regrettable.\" We can only hope being so embarrassed on such\na big night will encourage him to take his bad breath issues more seriously. Thanks for watching!

excuses I got the ball back I should have made the three at the end I missed it I'm bummed out not only because we lost and I hate losing but dude I wanted to win this game for Kobe I wanted to win this [ __ ] for Kobe so it's it's like a loss and then on top of that I feel like I let Kobe down like he's watching from above and I let him down like whoa how those refs how like I hate blaming rest you play basketball you win as a team lose as a team the refs don't mean [ __ ] we lost but but all the rest were trash I'm just like I'm so frustrated I just want to win I want to win I don't want

24 cool like I don't care about scoring points I'd rather have zero points and wait like w-i and that's it I just want to win games I don't like losing games it pisses me off like I'm a competitor I like to compete Kobe Kobe won game though I don't get how as a ref you don't call that a an one in that type of situation like ten seconds left a game-tying situation the difference between a win or a loss and you call that an n1 I'm sorry and the rift had the nerve to call back no no it was on the floor dude you gotta be [ __ ] sick like you gotta be sick to cook dudes like that's terrible that's disgusting both so one of my teammates just texted me saying good job today bro what do you think I could have done better I can't believe I airball my shot now I don't I don't like that attitude I don't like people getting down on themselves it's a team sport it's not one person's fault that we lost it's a team we win as a team we lose out see if it's one person's fault that we lost it's my fault what do you think I could have done better I can't believe I bought my shop we'd almost send a voice message right now I told Gilbert the same thing listen to me bro I don't care if you airball your shots I don't care if you miss your shots if they're good shots good shots you guys are missing who cares about I could care less about that Kobe Miss open shots LeBron missed open shots Michael Jordan missed open shots I don't expect you guys to make every single one of your shots I miss shots that's not the point don't be mad that you airball the shot bro as long as it's a good shot I don't care whether you scored zero points or 100 points is not gonna make a difference of us winning or losing what I need from you and Gilbert and everybody else hustle and defense that's it and you did that good today bro I don't need you guys to be scorers I could score the ball Steve could score the ball Brian could score I don't need you guys to be scorers I need you guys to hustle and rebound

half of people will have halitosis, otherwise known as bad breath. Dr. Eleanor Weitzner says most cases stem from problems within the mouth like gum disease cavitities or ill-fitting dentures. Bacteria builds up and causes a foul odor. Bad breath can also be a sign of a systemic health issue, like kidney disease or diabetes, or a side effect of a medication. Some common culprits include some anti-depressants and  blood pressure drugs. A lot of people think that if you have certain foods like onions or garlic or spicy foods then you have bad breath. So yes, you do have bad breath but it's a transient thing. Halitosis is more of a long-term thing so unless you deal with the problem, you still have it. For true halitosis, prescription mouthwashes are available. And for everyone, Dr. Weitzner says, chewing sugar-free gum helps. It actually stimulates salivary flow and saliva actually lubricates the mouth and has an anti-bacterial effect which is what a lot of halitosis is caused by. It's caused by bacteria. Salivary flow is decreased while we sleep and that's what causes morning breath. She says two things to avoid are mouthwashes containing  alcohol and brushing too hard. Brushing teeth and flossing and good oral hygiene, super super important. But you don't want to overdo it because you'll actually be causing harm to the tissues. So see your dentist regularly to detect any concerns early. And know that most people can't actually smell their own breath accurately. So if a friend or loved one mentions there's a problem,  get it checked out. With Sunnyview, I'm Monica Matys.

now today what we're gonna talk about is something that I hear from a lot of whiners in the kitchen about like only only come a hint smell like garlic well forget about it what do you cook good Italian food for hands little smell like you're gonna eat it your breath is gonna smell like garlic so you're obviously around people who don't like garlic smell and my advice you got two choices one I would just cut those people off scrape them out of your life that's number one but two if you can't maybe they're just people in a lecture you can't get rid of it I could totally appreciate that understand that then we want to get rid of the garlic smell okay so well that's funny enough so a lot of times what'll happen is you'll cut the garlic and what's gonna happen is you to transfer that odor to your hands here so without making it too complicated real simple is you're gonna use some brushed stainless steel some raw stainless steel and by rubbing it you can use a little soap and water anyway it's not that you need the soap and water but it'll actually get rid of the smell of garlic on your hands isn't that amazing so just to show you something really quick I grabbed two utensils in my kitchen this one here is a polished stainless steel so this won't work as well you see how it's really shiny so it doesn't have the surface there it doesn't have the raw stainless steel so as a result it won't work as well okay but the other way that works really well see how this ladle is brushed see how it's it's almost it's non polished it's got a little extra stain I'm sorry surface area and as a result it's going to transfer the odor to the stainless steel how the heck does that work real quick simple a good chemistry lesson the smell of garlic which works really well with onions and fish owners and such is bound to sulfur in the sulfur molecules when you cut the garlic you transfer to your skin and that's why you smell that beautiful aroma of garlic or in your mouth right so what happens is when you rub it to the stainless steel the stainless steel has a greater affinity to those sulfur molecules as your hand it's and so it's gonna draw like a magnet it'll draw to the stainless steel as a result gets rid of the smell on your hands real simple okay so I've been cutting garlic we just did a great video right and don't forget to grab a bottle olive oil by the way video Jose Aldo okay but you know now adept its smell of garlic on my hands right so I'm gonna take the brush stainless steel I'm gonna come over to the sink right just the water going I was like do you use a little salt so you don't have to right and you're just gonna rub your hands as much as you can back in front of your hands over the brush stainless steel okay and done right dry up now you got the people I come over the house that don't like the smell of garlic everybody's happy okay there you go and they're literally there is no smell of garlic coming in it's okay I prefer garlic smell on my hands on my neck a little bit under my nose oh I can smell okay we'll talk but in any case it makes it simple it makes it fun makes it easy and it's a great way to get like I said onion or garlic our fish shoulders or anything that's like a sulfur-based food product it's a easy way to get right off and just rub your hands to brush down steel or water or soap or soap the one that simple that fun hopefully I taught you something that'll help you and your kids generations to come make sure you celebrate your heritage certainly set some new traditions have some fun in the kitchen until next week unless they won't have to eat them the ideal", "OsuUqGVFgUs": "what is up guys welcome back to the channel today we're going to be talking about how to get rid of bad breath so a lot of my patients have been asking me for solutions for bad breath or halitosis and i figure that it's about the right time to make a video on it first we're going to talk about what causes bad breath next we'll look at some conditions that make it worse and finally we'll talk about some at home treatments that you can do right now so what causes bad breath the primary cause of that odor is bacteria and this bacteria can be found all throughout the mouth along our gum line in between our teeth and even on our tongue and as this bacteria breaks down food it releases a sulfur-like odor that we associate with stinky breath now there are a variety of solutions that will help you reduce the amount of bacteria in your mouth and i'll talk about that later on in the video but before we do that let's talk about four main factors that contribute to bad breath dry mouth is one of the biggest contributing factors and it's associated with a reduction in saliva and what a lot of people don't realize is that saliva is super important because it cleanses all that bacteria that sits along your gum line throughout the day it also has a lot of amazing properties that help you prevent cavity formation and it helps with the breakdown of food in the mouth unfortunately this flow of saliva can be reduced in a variety of ways for example chemotherapy medications have side effects that reduce the salivary flow in your mouth this means that these type of patients will have a higher incidence of cavities at their periodic examination appointment and they're more likely to develop bad breath as well this is why these patients have to be extra careful taking care of their teeth because they're at a higher risk of developing these big cavities smoking tobacco is another huge factor that can lead to bad breath smoking in general doesn't really have a pleasant odor to it but also smoking can contribute to periodontal disease which is associated with a variety of bacteria and can lead to that really bad odor coming out of your mouth and we should also mention that there are some studies that associate mouth breathing with halitosis there are claims that mouth breathing can have a negative impact on the saliva and this is why it would lead to bad breath another huge contributing factor is your diet i think we all know that foods like garlic and onion can produce a really bad odor in your mouth once you eat these types of smelly foods the chemicals that cause the odor get absorbed into your bloodstream eventually transferred into your lungs and then exhaled into the air so i really shouldn't have to tell you this but if you're trying to have fresh breath stay away from stinky food low carbohydrate diets high in protein have also been found to be associated with bad breath this is found in people that are doing let's say a keto diet where their body is digesting a lot of the fats and then the ketones are released into the air it's not really that big of a problem but i would recommend drinking a lot of water throughout the day if you're on this type of diet so that you can flush the ketones out of your system now i've talked about periodontal disease in a previous video but i didn't really mention that the bacteria associated with the periodontal disease can produce an odor that is noticeable to people in a room large cavities can also produce this type of odor if it's housing decaying food or bacteria that isn't properly cleaned out so it goes without saying to go to your local dentist someone you trust get your examination done clean out any cavities that need to be cleaned out get a good cleaning in there so that you can be on the road to health and in this category i should also mention that if you recently had an extraction a tooth you know pulled out of your mouth you want to keep that extraction socket clean um because sometimes that extraction socket can carry food that's decaying and that can cause bad breath too so you don't want to pick around at it too much because you want that blood clot to stay in there but if food gets in there or if it needs to be cleaned out make sure you're irrigating with the proper solution and finally health conditions is the last major contributing factor to halitosis if you develop post nasal drip for example you can imagine all that mucus is a reservoir for bacteria and this can also trigger bad breath some people have really bad gi problems where they aren't properly digesting food for example gastroesophageal reflux disease can contribute to a bad odor in your mouth finally people that have diabetes can also have bad breath due to the ketones emitted from the mouth so now that you know some of the causes how can you start treating bad breath today well remember that at its core odor emitting bacteria is one of the major reasons you're having bad breath so it goes without saying that proper oral hygiene like brushing and flossing in the morning and at night and just keeping your mouth really healthy will reduce the amount of bacteria in your mouth and give you a bit of fresher breath but what i didn't really mention yet is how your tongue can host a lot of this bacteria so i would definitely recommend for those of you out there that aren't really finding a solution or maybe tried everything else to consider getting a tongue cleaner where you scrape the tongue safely from the back of the tongue all the way to the front to remove that bacteria that sits on the tongue throughout the day this is common in some people and not so common in others but i would definitely try it out if you're not finding a solution there are also a lot of benefits to simply drinking a lot of water throughout the day and keeping your mouth moist and also that water will serve as an irrigation device to remove you know plaque or bacteria that sits along your gum line and finally chewing healthy food items like fruits and vegetables can actually help stimulate the salivary flow which will be beneficial to reducing bad breath well this was a quick educational video and i hope it gives you guys that are struggling some solutions that will help you out thank you for taking the time to watch my video and i will see you for the next one thanks", "A0FAVR6_ZEQ": "hi I was wondering if maybe you would like to have a drink with me what I was wondering if I could take you to a drink what is that you totally blew it sorry bro has this ever happen to you bad breath can be a real game killer situation like this perhaps next time you should try to chew gum pop a mint or something but really that only masks the smell don't worry friends there's an answer to this problem and I'll tell you how to fix bad breath most common reason anyone suffers from halitosis is dry mouth this happens when you don't drink enough water are you been sleeping or traveling your body slows down the production of saliva then sells dry out on your tongue which bacteria break down producing a bad smell so the first thing you have to do to help solve this problem is great water regularly if your mouth stays hydrated and it's producing saliva you greatly reduce your chances of having bad breath the same smelly process happens when bacteria breaks down the food stuck in your teeth so the second thing you have to do is brush and floss after every meal seriously you can't forget to floss flossing regularly will remove the food particles that get stuck between your teeth more effectively than any toothbrush and if you want maximum protection you also have to clean your tongue there is nothing as effective at getting rid of bad breath is cleaning the back of your tongue regularly if you can ideally you should be cleaning it after every meal with the tongue scraper if flossing your teeth and scraping your tongue doesn't fit the decorum of your office you can always riff with mouthwash rinsing and gargling is better washing away bacteria than chewing gum or popping a mint but this is still just a temporary fix so not as thorough scraping your tongue the other Connery's for bad breath is the flu Joey garlic onions and coffee will make your breath nasty but there are many other substance that are really turned to thank back to rub first our wine and alcohol which Anna can mouth reek for up to 10 hours spicy foods are also bad for your breath and so is dairy and other dense proteins sugars will put your mouth bacteria into overdrive powering up that nasty smell and tobacco smoking will make your breath of the worst you're in a situation where breath is a concern the best thing to do is to avoid all these extreme low carb diets and fasting make the body break down and store fat releasing ketones which can also contribute to halitosis it's okay your solution for this - you just have to keep breath friendly foods instead of coffee drink herbal infusions like green tea you can snack on raw carrots celery and apple slices which will clear out mouth debris and help with hydration herbs and spices like cinnamon anise seeds cardamom fennel dill cloves and parsley will all improve your breath armed with this knowledge you should be able to tap with your bad breath problem once and for all hi ah wow that was crazy um so anyway I was just wondering how do you know if all these tricks to avoid bad breath actually work well now I'll show you how to check if you have bad breath the common practice of breathing to your hand is sniffing actually doesn't work since bad breath usually starts with your tongue that's the first place to check for a visual check a pink and shiny tongue is good a whitening skeleton is bad try licking your hand and smelling that or if you have a spoon handy you can take the tip of the spoon scrape the back of your tongue let it dry and then smell it oh yeah problem so you", "EICPwYUk1oU": "so I was edited in the video and I realized I didn't have a intro like I'm so stupid so here's your intro enjoy this video about me make it garlic bread like I don't it up okay bye so as you can see I'm getting the tinfoil out it's taking me a minute because my tinfoil um the box thing is  so yeah so this is the tin foil I don't know why it's taking me so long to rip some tin foil out but yeah okay boom got the tin foil I slit Leslie um then you get the bribe and what you want to do is cut the bread but me and my myself there's not a cut no bread and I spent over like a minute trying to figure out how to cut the bread so I asked my dad hey Dad can you help me cut the bread he's like just do it vertically see the way I'm cutting the bread is really dumb and you shouldn't try this at home obviously the two pointy things that the bond was meant to help cut the bread and I'm not even utilizing the two pointy things at the bottom I'm just being dumb okay you can see Carter in the background looking at me like wow like she's 17 and she's a dumbass [Music] to ask my deaf rope I just want y'all to see how ugly I am so next after the bread is cut what you're gonna want to do is cut those that slice of bread into smaller slices of bread and clearly I'm a pro at this are these key thing is too big but for some garlic bread now you got a motorman guess I'm not the shot that I thought I was in a minute cut it in town alright so once your bread is cut you want to put some butter on the bread I put my butter in for 15 seconds in the microwave to make it soft and easy to apply this is peer pressure at its finest please do not feed babies better I don't know why I did this this poor baby I'm making her eat butter and butters disgusting it's out for snapchat with us a lot no I'm making a video of how to make garlic bread so after you spread the John get out your car lake I like this type of garlic because it's easier to apply and it's because it's like what but yes so just take a little bit amount about like that much and put it on because garlic can get pretty strong on your breath like that don't let the pieces fall off like myself and a little bit more even though I just said put it like a dime up if it looks like it's too little clearly I'm putting a little bit too much on but whatever floats your boat so after this you're gonna want to put some garlic salt along with the garlic from the refrigerator I don't know why but I pour some into my hand so that I can sprinkle it over the bread and just sprinkle a little bit not too much because it's gonna be too garlicky if you sprinkle too much so after this you want to get your oregano seasoning and you're almost done just sprinkle a little bit of that all over each piece of bread after that add a little bit of Parmesan cheese to give it like a cheesy flavor was a dummy and I thought I could blow like the Parmesan cheese I was inside the packet so I was like hey mom look and I blew inside of the packet and all this part machine probably Jean cheese got all of my face boom done boom masterpiece [Music]", "xm2z7aK7RzM": "So studies have shown that in some\ncountries up to 50% of people suffer from bad breath otherwise known as halitosis in this video I'm going to teach you how to get rid of it so what\nare we waiting for let's do this now before we begin I have a few\nquestions for you which I want to think about whilst we go through the video so\nwhat's your oral hygiene like how often you brush your teeth do you floss do you\nsmoke are you eating a lot of sugary foods because all of these can\ncontribute bad breath so please think about them and now let's\nbegin so tip number one the worst smelling bad breath usually comes from\nbacteria living in between the gums in between the teeth and on the turn so tip\nnumber one is pretty simple maintain good oral hygiene and you might be\nthinking to yourself now but Abraham I do maintain good oral hygiene now if you\ndo maintain good oral hygiene and that's fantastic but a lot of patients tend to\nmiss a few important steps or do a few things wrong for example a lot of\npeople tend to brush their teeth with a fluoride toothpaste which is great and\nthen they end up rinsing their mouths out of water or with a mouthwash and\nthis is wrong because you're getting rid of all that good fluoride now a few of the\nthings about maintaining good oral hygiene include brushing your teeth and\ngums are these twice a day flossing your teeth at least once a day cleaning your\ntongue with a tongue scraper using a fluoride toothpaste and most importantly\nhaving regular dental check-ups also I did make a video not long ago with a good\nfriend of mine Dr Ehsan all about how to brush your teeth properly and I\nguarantee you if you watch it you will become a dental hygiene Pro I will leave\na link up here and in the description below as usual tip number two so\nremember the bacteria from tip number one well they love sugary foods\nand when they get sugar they go a bit nuts and when they go nuts they start\nincreasing the acidity in the mouth and that can contribute to things like tooth\ndecay and I guess nobody wants tooth decay and bad breath so what should you do\nwell you need to still maintain the good oral hygiene we need to limit your\nintake of sugary foods and drinks and this includes things like fizzy drinks\nalso its sparkling water as well this counts as well so you need to limit that\nand lastly limit fruit juice because that also contains sugar now you may be\nthinking to yourself but Abraham that's easier said than done\nI drink loads of fizzy drinks every day now\ngonna struggle with this well that's fine and that's understandable so try\nand cut down slowly maybe try having one fizzy drink a day or one fruit juice\na day and it slowly cut down from there also please remember that things like\ntea things like coffee water they're all fine to have they're generally less\nacidic but remember please don't add sugar and also another tip before you\nbrush your teeth then you've eaten something but it has something to drink\nmake sure you leave an hour this is so the acidity can neutralize and then brush your teeth which moves us on to tip number three consider using a mouthwash every single\nday now I think it's especially useful to use a mouthwash let's say when you're\nout and you've eaten and you don't have a toothbrush with you to brush your\nteeth then you can use the mouthwash that's going to neutralize those\nchemicals that can cause bad breath now next question is going to be well which\nmouthwash should I get there's so many to choose from well the good news is\nthat there's been a number of clinical trials that have shown various\ningredients in mouthwash to help with bad breath now this is quite long so I'm\ngoing to leave a full list in the description below for you so check it\nout when you get a minute next up we've got tip number four which is all about\nsmoking I honestly think there's no end to how bad smoking is for us we all know\nit causes various different cancers it causes lung disease it causes diabetes\nit causes heart disease and many more medical conditions and the cherry on top\nis it also causes bad breath so tip number four is pretty simple if you do\nsmoke please quit because the health benefits are there and on top of that\nyou're going to be left with fresh breath I'll also leave a really useful\nlink from the NHS in the description below about how you can quit so I really\nhope my video helps you and if you have any of your own tips please leave a\ncomment below because we'd love to

Broadly speaking, the source of a person's\nbad breath may come from 4 different regions: the nose, mouth, throat, and lungs. Before being able to successfully treat bad\nbreath or halitosis, one must first determine WHERE the bad breath is coming from. Is it coming from just the nose, just the\nmouth, or BOTH from the nose and mouth. Assuming air coming out of the lungs is fresh\nand pure, should bad breath emanate only from the mouth but not the nose, the source of\nthe bad smell is somewhere in the mouth. For example, this occurs with morning breath\nor patients suffering from a dry mouth or dental problems. \u00a0 If the bad breath ONLY occurs from the nose,\nbut not the mouth, the source of the bad odor is due to some type of sino-nasal issue like\na sinus infection or nasal foreign body. If the bad breath emanates from BOTH the nose\nand mouth, this suggests the source of the bad smell to be coming from the throat or\neven the lungs. Examples of lung or throat issues that may\ncause halitosis include reflux, throat cancer, and lung infections as well as more systemic\nissues like diabetes and advanced kidney or liver disease. Of course, one can potentially also have a\nsimultaneous mouth and nose problem. When it comes to the mouth, one can further\nlocalize where the bad smell is coming from by doing the finger scratch and sniff test. Basically, gently scratch with a fingernail\nthe front surface of the tongue, tonsil, and even the very back of the tongue one at a\ntime followed by sniffing the material collected on the finger. Once the location and cause of your bad breath\nhave been identified, only then can treatment be successfully pursued.", "kcsidfm4JeI": "hello everyone I suppose you are all doing fine and safe at home in today's video I will be sharing with you how to completely get rid of body odor whether it is your armpits smell e'en due to bad smelly sweat or down there you don't smell good down there or you have general body or double bacterial infections costing that down there not to really smell good I will be sharing with you two steps on how to completely get rid of that and smell so good plus I'll be sharing with you some tips on how to maintain that good smell always smell clean and fresh the first step to achieving that is consuming your garlic five days a week every month like half five days every month that you consume your garlic you can just wake up in the morning you get too close of garlic and chew so the fact that garlic has antibacterial properties if you have any bacterial infection cousin that obvious email you're not smelling good garlic is a natural antibiotic that is why I am recommending once every month you have like five days like Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday you just wake up in the morning you get two cloves of garlic you consume it helps to treat bacterial infections naturally saving you money and time spending in the hospital buying all the antibiotics of which doctors discourage the consumption of those chemically made antibiotics consuming something like that it is very safe it will cleanse your system is very important to always cleanse your system because when your system is dead from the inside you sweat just imagine that that will be within you it seemed else now it comes out with a very pungent smell and you end up being told you have body order on the rest so it is very important your system is clean from the inside and consuming and anti about it like this kills and destroys anybody we are coming out with that how ugly smell I will be sharing with you next a treatment you can make once every month with warm water like get like steamed up with that warm water treatment it is like a of traditional kind of treatment that cleanses you it is like a traditional treatment you cannot really explain but it helps a lot that is something I learned from my elder sister and whenever I do it once every month I feel so good I smell so good I hardly have all those issues we all face most especially as we men all those issues down there hardly happen because every month like five days I chew my garlic and secondly I follow it actually so these are two blows of garlic if you can't consume them directly to like this you can mix with honey but I'm so used to the garlic that I just consume without adding only anymore I just put like tool [Music] [Music] and what I done is it as easy as that I'm so used to that I consume without feeling anything but if it is your first time it can be a little bit difficult you can consume and follow it and arrange so you don't get that smell in your mouth and feel like discouraged to continue eating it because it can be not friendly in the mouth most especially if you are started so you want to consume something immediately after but once they gotta get into your system that antibiotic is there so whatever you consume any fruit of your choice banana what I meant on whatever just to switch in your mouth that is okay and before getting into showing you what you can use once in the morn is treatment is tradition that you may not be sharing with you I will advise that in order to maintain that hygiene make sure that any time you peepee you clean up me I just wash up you know how Muslims do I just wash up any time I peepee I have a bowl in my restroom in my toilet day I just peepee and I just wash up as easy as that so no peepee stays and culture bacterias you start feeling like you have it is down there you want to always poopoo and just clean up me I don't when I go out I mix I rush and come back to my house I don't know how to poopoo anyway apart from my house I come to my house so I can poop I'm cleaned up because those are the kinds of things that culture bacterias down there and you start having all those issues and secondly detoxification is very important you want to detox at least once every month and I have shared so many talks recipes detox is to help flush dead and toxins out of your system so your system always stays clean no dead in there coming out in the form of smelly sweat so once you consume your garlic like five days a month you want to take one day to detox detoxification cleanse toxins out of your system you don't only stay healthy and clean smelling fresh whether you open it equally helps you stay in shape you equally lose belly fat and have the very clear blew risk in there are so many tips like putting on just cutting parents and the rest I have a complete feature that I share with all these tips but it is important as a woman to always put on your cotton pants our white nylon pants because nylon pants culture gems they always stay wet most especially if you're someone will pee pee without cleaning up that remaining pee pee there since it is something that like dead from your system it stays there cultures bacterias you start experiencing that foul kind of ugly order on your skin you want to wear cotton pants because they easily like it doesn't accommodate all bacterias like nylon pants too besides which it is very important to make sure to just wash them each time you peepee or poopoo all those are the most important times you want to always clean up so those are some of the very important basic tips you should always make sure to do so you always smell good and fresh waste your time I'll check you now and show you the second step something you should do once every month just sit on these like it helps to cleanse you like it gets into you and keeps that area so clean smelling fresh normal and dry like so like intact I hope you understand madam chances so remember the first step is consuming two cloves of garlic for five days like moldy cheese or Wednesday Thursday Friday every month then you do this method I'll be sharing with you this traditional method once every month then once every month - it is very important you consume a good metabolism booster to flush all toxins out of your system as well so this acts like antibiotic for the bacterial infections the detoxification is to cleanse toxins in your system those dead body out in this form of smelly sweat you start having body order and this method I'll be sharing with you now so it cleanses you keeps that area so clean fresh dry and intact so let's get it so I'll be using this transparent bowl to mix up the mixture but our ten later on in the blue bucket to sit on top so you need you you don't sit on this pool you sit on the bucket so yeah this is what you need to do is to boil your water first it is very important you don't want to boil the ingredients you want to boil your water first and add in the ingredients in your boiled water so while my water is boiling the first ingredient will be baking soda so baking soda is to tackle that like that you know that this chance that comes out makes that area so moist and produce that pungent foul kind of smell oh my baking soda is almost finished so you just need like one tablespoon of baking soda anyway it is to tackle that moist that discharge that causes that foul smell it keeps that area dry and intact so that is one tablespoon of baking so that you want to add in your water your warm water fast into the baking soda so make sure to follow all these steps it is very important to put the baking soda first because it can't have that yeah the second thing you want to add in here is salt salt is so good as it occurs they discharge as well it helps with contractions to keep that area contracted without it really just you I hope you get what I'm trying to say I am limited to some words to use here so it helps with contraction keeps that area dry and clean as well so you want to measure one tablespoon of salt and add into the water and the baking soda in there the next thing you want to add is like four to five cloves of garlic and what you need to do is to peel your garlic and you grid so don't just put the full garlic there you want to breathe so you that so it like infuses in the water and the benefits get into you as you sit on top of that warm water the antibiotics the benefits of that antibiotic in garlic actually gets things up into you and helps with any fungi infection or bacterial infections so this is exactly what you got to do you get like four cloves of garlic oh five you use your grater to get something like this you don't need to stress planing just grit like this and you'll find it will still get infused in the water steamed up and do the job for you so that is what you need to do the next thing you want to add is vinegar so you can use anything in a guy of your choice white vinegar apple cider vinegar any is good but I wish you were apple cider vinegar you can just use regular white vinegar vinegar too helps to control that discharge causing that white smear that falls it keeps that area contracted and dry clean so this combination is kind of helping that area to clear up that discharge then the garlic is to treat any bacterial infections that woman as it keeps that it cleans deep cleans and this is so good so after you come up with your mixture you want to put in your booth don't sit on this white bowl you put in your pockets a bucket and it should be like halfway the water should be down you don't want the water to pop that it can make maybe touch your skin you want the water to get into the temperature that you are comfortable sitting on top like midway down and you can sit on top try this and come back and tranq me later all these steps I just said you will smell so good effortlessly so I hope someone found this video helpful don't forget to share with your family and friends so we can all stay healthy and fresh thank you for your time thank you for watching and see you again in my next video bye", "fgcNGwP0sZI": "[Music] hi I'm Natalia rose and today we're going to talk about how to deal with fasting bad breath charming I know the reason the breath gets especially bad when one is fasting is because the body in its given the opportunity to start to cleanse is pushing all the deep impacted waste matter to the surface through the eliminative channels this is a good thing but if they're in the interim it can be kind of stinky and gross um so basically what we want to do is we want to first of all acknowledge where the smell and the stench the grossest is coming from it's coming from within being pushed out and that's exactly what we want to have happen the second thing is that we can we can deal with it in two ways one we can help support the eliminated that the waste moves through swiftly and we do that by incorporating the help of colonics enemas and infrared sweating saunas and the other thing we can do is of course deal with it topically so when you're fasting you might find that it's suits you and those around you better if you're brushing your teeth maybe four five six times a day rather than twice a day and we want to of course be using a really high-quality toothpaste so nothing in my opinion nothing with fluoride nothing with any artificial ingredients using clove oil and cinnamon peppermints these are all wonderful things chlorophyll drops can be wonderful another great tool to employ while you're fasting and anytime is using a tongue scraper because most of the smell of the bacteria is coming through the tongue is is proliferating on the tongue so a tongue scraper will enable you get rid of most of the bacteria and the origin of the bad breath you can also brush your tongue with your toothbrush if you want to do that and then remember the teeth and the gums have little tiny channels that run through and communicate with the body at large they will even pass their waste excretions through these channels up into the teeth and gums for exit bearing in mind that your your teeth guns are communicating in this way with your organs at large will help explain why there's so much activity in the mouth and why there's so much bacteria and waste coming through thus the stench [Music]", "zQo2ixHcLuA": "hey everyone my name is Whitney and I am a dental hygienist if you're new here welcome if you've been here before welcome back today we are going to talk about how to prevent and/or get rid of bad breath okay so I made a bad breath video a few years ago but today's video should be quicker and to the point so let's go the clinical term for bad breath is halitosis or another clinical term is oral malodor occasional bad breath halitosis what-have-you can affect everything from your personal life to your private life to your professional life but once you find out what causes bad breath then you're able to treat it somewhere around 90% of bacteria that causes bad breath you find it on your tongue so use a tongue scraper twice a day or even after every time you eat I actually travel with a personal tongue scraper in my purse tongue scrapers are more effective at removing debris from your tongue than a regular toothbrush but if a toothbrush is all you have right now brush your tongue with that toothbrush because it's better than nothing right if you're looking to buy a tongue scraper and you don't know which one to buy I will link some tongue scrapers below in the bottom bar to help you get started having said that make sure you are using the proper techniques when you're brushing and flossing and/or cleaning between your teeth I've had lots of patients ask me about bad breath and right when I ask them so do you floss or use anything to clean between your teeth they say no groan tip about 40 percent of your tooth surface is missed when you're not cleaning between your teeth that's a large percentage of space for bad smelly bacteria to thrive so consider flossing or water flossing or interdental brushing or a combination of the three this way you'll be properly cleaning between your teeth to remove that bad bacteria if you are doing all of it tongue scraping brushing properly cleaning between your teeth properly and you still have bad breath make sure next time you visit your dentist to ask them they will help you find a reason that can be contributing to your bad breath there are two things they might notice or look for either dry mouth or gum disease or both dry mouth can cause bad breath because saliva is a natural barrier against bad breath so without saliva or minimal amounts of saliva you are more prone to getting bad breath I have a whole video about dry mouth so if you want to learn more about I'll link that video below now with gum disease we've learned that there is a specific type of bad breath bacteria that comes along for the ride when you have gum disease so if you have this bad bacteria below your gum line and it's calcified you can brush and brush and brush and floss and water flaws and do all that stuff at home until you're blue in the face and it will not come off at home you need a dentist or a dental hygienist to professionally clean it off for you I have a video about deep cleanings which I will link below in the bottom bar as well if you're interested in learning more however if you do visit the dentist and they take x-rays and they pareo chart and they do not find that you have any signs of gum disease or tartar below the gum line and they ruled out any signs of dry mouth but you still have bad breath maybe it's not related to your mouth at all apart from your mouth your nasal sinuses the back of your throat your GI tract and your airway can all contribute to bad breath so if you feel like this bad breath is coming from your throat or your stomach visit your primary physician and/or an ENT you might even have little pieces of food debris stuck in the back of your throat these are sometimes called tonsil stones sometimes gargling with warm salt water can help clean them out but not always so please go visit your doctor and they will help you out lastly I'll give you some examples of things you can eat and drink and do throughout the day to help you combat bad breath drink more water keep hydrated all day and for those of you who hate water like plain water adding a little lemon to your water is great even a little drop of lemon essential oil may help fight off other bad breath bacteria eat more yogurt yogurt can help because the probiotics in yogurt aid to kill off yeast and microbes that cause bad breath of course you need real yogurt not the sugary gogurts or anything like that drink the green drinking green juices without sugar can help alkalize your body things such as wheatgrass juice things that are high in chlorophyll like kale cilantro cucumber celery parsley all these can help cure bad breath also if you want to add any of these healthy options to your water do it just make sure you don't add sugar green tea this is another great beverage to fight off bad breath because the anti microbials in green tea work like a deodorant a natural disinfectant it's specific minimizes sulfur compounds in your mouth that contribute to bad breath and one more thing I just mentioned parsley is one of the things you could add to your water but something even more to note about parsley is that it's really good at neutralizing odor so after you eat something stinky chew on some parsley it can actually neutralize your mouth so more quick fixes are sugar free myths sugar free gum including xylitol products and other a DEA approved breath sprays I will link some product examples in the bottom bar if you're interested again though these will not get rid of the problem but they will help you out if you just ate something smelly lastly if you truly did all the things and nothing is working for you and you still taste something nasty coming from the back of your throat please please please visit your dentist visit your doctor and they will help you get to the bottom of it I hope this information helped you please

And when things that\nI noticed in my dad, before he knew he was diabetic-- he'd come home from\nthe train at night, and my sister and I would rub\nhis legs, because they hurt. This is one of the\nproblems with diabetics. His feet hurt. And I remember my sister\nNancy saying once, gee. Daddy smells like Mommy's\nnail polish remover. Which was acetone. And acetone is one of\nthe three ketone bodies, the other two being\nBeta-Hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetate. So what happens in\ndiabetes is, the diabetic doesn't have ample carbohydrate\nreserves within their cells as glycogen. So they're doing\na lot of fatty acid oxidation, rather than\ncarbohydrate metabolism. If you take a fatty\nacid, and you break it down to Acetyl-CoA,\nthe last step is called\nBeta-ketothiolase-- backs up, then your two\ncarbons of Acetyl-CoA will be four carbons\nof acetoacetate. And then acetoacetate-- a\nthird Acetyl-CoA can add to it to form what's called\nhydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A-- HMG CoA. And then rearrangements\ncan happen that give rise, ultimately,\nto the three ketone bodies-- acetoacetate,\nBeta-Hydroxybutyrate, and acetone. So in situations\nwhere-- of starvation-- and diabetes is\nbasically, my cells were in a technical\nstate of starvation. In a case of\nstarvation, what happens is you get this backup\nof the lipid breakdown, or catabolism pathway. And then these ketone bodies\nflush out into your blood. In starvation situations,\nthe ketone bodies will act as fuels for your\nbrain and other organs. It's a difficult transition. But ketone bodies are-- in the case of\ndiabetics, they're produced to excess, to such\nextent that they're actually quite harmful to you. The reason a person\nsmells of acetone is the intermediate\nketone body-- the acetoacetate\nbasically decarboxylates. It's a Beta-keto\nacid, and so it's a spontaneous decomposition\nto form acetone. Acetone is not, to my\nknowledge, biochemically useful as a kind of\nan energy source. But it's a sentinel,\nor it's something that is smelled, so that it can\nbe diagnostic of the disease.", "2B2xqmOEDZc": "and also if you have a hot date tonight for Valentine's Day you probably want

cardamom and fennel seeds are excellent at fighting mouth odor cloves and cardamom both have antibacterial properties just what you need to kill the source of that stinking odor chewing on phenol will aid saliva production and combate any nasty mouth bacteria one tea spoon should be enough for the job baking soda that magical powder you use to make your cakes pump up is another natural mouthwash that is readily available simply dissolve a teaspoon of baking soda in a cup of water and then use it to rinse your mouth you can also dip your wet toothbrush into baking soda before brushing your teeth number nine drink at least point five gallons of water every day we're talking about the good old water your mama told you to get enough of and she was absolutely right keeping yourself hydrated has many health benefits and avoiding bad breath is just one of them saliva prevents bacterial growth and water is needed to keep the salivary glands working efficiently drinking water is paramount when it comes to preventing the bacterial growth and bad breath caused by inadequate moisture and saliva in the mouth avoid sugary juices at night because they can aid bacterial build-up during the night number eight try herbal teas if water sounds too boring spice things up with natural teas make green tea your best friend after water the antioxidant army in it will easily beat the bacterial troops in your mouth three to five cups daily should have just the right amount of military units in them if you want to experiment and brew your tea from less conventional sources try boiling fenugreek seeds in a cup of water and consuming it once a day until you get some odor relief fennel tea and dried sage brewed in hot water for five to ten minutes will also do the trick number seven watch what you eat tale as old as time true as it can be you've probably heard that you are what you eat and you might disagree with it but your breath definitely smells of what you eat so keep it under control some foods are known to cause bad breath so it's best to avoid them if you want your mouth to smell minty fresh onions and garlic are the most common culprits when it comes to causing bad breath but remember not to do away with onions entirely as research shows that eating onions in moderation kills four different strains of bacteria that can cause tooth decay and gum disease also avoid foods that are high in fructose and acids as they encourage bacterial growth if you are hungry try eating apples or some yogurt apples contain hetero polysaccharide pectin a beneficial component known to stimulate saliva production the active cultures in yoghurt help reduce bacteria in the mouth number six experiment with essential oils we've all seen those toothpaste ads promising a 100% natural product but can we trust them not only are they not exactly purely organic but they could also kill the friendly bacteria while trying to combat the bad guys in your mouth essential oils come to the rescue to make this fight just and restore the microbial balance you can try gargling with peppermint essential oil or using clove or orange oil diluted in water for dental emergencies a few drops of tea tree oil even can grow directly onto your toothbrush together with your normal toothpaste eucalyptus essential oil helps reduce the production of mucus and boosts your immune system while also acting as a pain reliever Nature has all the solutions you're looking for just use them wisely number five scrape your tongue do you brush your teeth regularly how will God properly okay okay we trust you ready to grin but do you ever scrape your tongue as awkward as it may sound it does make sense and is essential for oral hygiene your tongue can be a breeding ground for smelly bacteria after you brush your teeth use your toothbrush to scrape your tongue of any bacterial by-product from the bacteria or plaque you can also use a tongue scraper for this number four brush twice a day and floss once brush your teeth for two minutes twice a day and floss at least once according to a survey published by the American Dental Association only a little over fifty five percent of women brushed twice a day the percentage of men doing so was even lower at just forty nine percent brushing and flossing helps to remove trapped food and odor causing bacteria from the mouth we don't know why Vivian in pretty woman was so embarrassed about her dental floss she should have been proud of it number three keep your gums healthy bacteria gathers in pockets at the base of the teeth which creates an odor gum diseases are known to cause bad breath to keep your gums healthy chews tooth page that contains fluoride in case you've been looking for another good reason to quit smoking here it is smoking weakens your immune system and is strongly associated with the onset of gum related problems more than that smoking makes it more difficult for your gums to heal once they've been damaged number two try breathing exercises as we already know you have certain bad bacteria to blame for a less than attractive odor coming from your mouth they thrive without oxygen and so getting enough of it the right way can help combat the problem can there be a wrong way to get oxygen yes there can be the proper way to get oxygen into your system is through your nose not through your mouth your nasal passages produce nitric oxide which helps the delivery of oxygen to your cells when you breathe through your mouth cold dry air goes into your lungs and your body gets less of it saliva flow also decreases and unwanted bacteria get right into your mouth and throat when you breathe through your mouth during sleep you can often wake up with the morning breath that makes you want to cover your mouth before you talk to any other humans some people also tend to breathe through their mouth during the day the good news is that there is a solution you can try breathing exercises to train yourself to breathe only through your nose hold your tongue behind your front teeth take a deep breath through your nose so that you can feel your belly rise breathe in for three seconds and then slowly let it out for four seconds it will only take two to three minutes of your time every day but it will give you impressive results number one chew fruit peel rinse the peel of a citrus fruit a

service spends billions of pounds on drugs that we might not need the food hospital is the first of its kind dedicated to treating illness solely through food pioneering this radical approach our three medical professionals who will treat conditions ranging from diabetes to depression and migraines to menopause the food hospital is on the front line of the food as medicine revolution [Music] this week's patients include a woman whose chronic body odor has taken her to the brink at one stage I was borderline suicidal with it a teenager who has to confront his crusty eczema he opened up your finger just look yeah there you go look at that I've never seen it this place is disgusting and a mum in agony with gall stones I've been through the child labor and out of that any day over this Aubrey plus how to deal with a hangover I feeling very fragile which molly's relish so a bit shake is still feeling rough now just need a cuddle and doctor pixie McKenna will unearth the truth about the things that claim to be good for us to health claims on packaging makers want to buy more expensive food and can even trust the claims they make [Music] first through the doors is a patient traumatized by a rare condition my name is Ellie James I'm 42 I currently live in Bristol and I have trimethylaminuria which is also known as fischoeder syndrome hormones illness and diet can all determine our particular smell but for Ellie it's much more complex I omit the variety of odors such as sulfur ammonia burnt rubber rotting garbage and marzipan trimethylaminuria or fish odor syndrome is a rare condition where the body loses the ability to break down a compound in certain foods this causes the sufferer to give off unpleasant smells ranging from fish to feces living with this condition is often socially isolating and can result in depression and other psychological problems it's not just that it's smells revolting you can be spreading a smell for 15 feet if you're in a small room or you're on public transport and you're having an episode of this you'll see people start rubbing their noses and because you are literally gassing them their eyes water they cough they sneeze for some people symptoms are intermittent but Ellie's are constant you stop going out in public you don't want to go to the shops I've been through the bullying I've left jobs because of this I've really really suffered actually at one stage I was borderline suicidal with it I went to several GPS none of whom knew when I had most suggested I had a mental health problem and that I was imagining it after 11 years of living with this condition Ellie only recently got a formal diagnosis like many of us she went online to research her condition when she read that her odor could potentially be managed through diet she took the extreme step of cutting out all but a handful of foods I haven't had any professional proper advice about my diet yet it's hit and miss it's trial and error Ellie's restricted diet is dominating her life so she's come to see GP Jia maletto for some advice Ellie you have a condition called fish odor syndrome otherwise known as T Mau which stands for tri methyl amine urea tri methyl amine is a compound that's produced by the body and normally got rid of very quickly by an enzyme trouble is in your case you don't have enough of that enzyme so it's not got rid of it builds up and it's released in the saliva and the breath in excretion of your body in the vagina the skin everywhere and the urine and it's very very smelly there is no cure for Ellie's condition but by limiting or avoiding foods that are high in a nutrient called choline found in fish milk and red meat it is possible to minimize the constant smells I've researched what foods are high in choline and completely cut them out and that has probably cut my odor by about 70 percent but I'm worried about it because I don't understand enough about the food connections perhaps to make informed decisions what would you like to achieve here I want to feel that I'm naughty no food prison anymore I'd like food to be pleasurable again Ellie's self treatment may be partly controlling her odor but the food hospitals dietician Lucy Jones has studied her restricted diet and has some major concerns so Ellie taught me through the changes that you have done I've cut out pretty much everything all right I've cut out coffee chocolate all proteins all animal products dairy most things actually so an easier question might have been tell me what you eat yeah I'll have strawberries and apples and pears and that's usually breakfast lunch and tea I usually soup made from a combination of carrots apples cucumbers sometimes peppers that's usually and has your weight been affected by this diet and yeah yeah I've lost three stones since I was diagnosed and I've lost two stone in the last sort of ten months or so after cutting out all foods containing choline from her diet Ellie is more than a stone and a half under her ideal weight it doesn't sound like you're having a lot of fat and obviously the overriding thing is protein goodness the female body has a finite need for protein you know 45 to 50 grams a day minimum if you don't eat that your body is going to break down your muscles in order to fuel that need and all the major organs in your body are made of muscles so it's going to be damaging weakening your heart potentially you could be at risk of cancer osteoporosis even things as simple as as your gum health and your teeth health I'm guessing that your relationship with food must have crumbled yeah it's not good I'm afraid to eat but I'm constantly hungry so I'm constantly obsessing there must be a wider range of food I can eat I think there has to be because you will not have a long life if you continue on the level of dietary restriction that you're having at the moment some foods are thought to increase body odor in all of us such as garlic onions and spicy foods but for people with fish odor syndrome foods like fish red meat egg yolks and beans are also a no-go you've accessed a lot of information on the web but not all of it complete yeah and so because of your fear you've always taken the cautious route which has left you just unable to be anything and actually loads of these foods you can eat safely I want you to be able to eat cottage cheese and I want you to be starting to have egg white omelet yes and there's no reason why we can't do that Lucy wants to put Elly on a loco lien rather than a no : diet the aim is to control the odor but gradually reintroduce some foods Elly has chosen to cut out to increase the essential nutrients her body needs I knew that restricting my diet so much was going to cause problems with things like osteoporosis but I justified that that was a decent trade-off I had no idea I was causing long-term damage to my internal organs that was a major shock quite a wake-up call and it's made me realize that although I'm short-term managing my symptoms this is not the way to do it I'm dr. pixie McKenna and this week I'm looking at the science behind these food health claims health plays a big part in food marketing and the emphasis on the health is very obvious when you go out shopping you've got bread which keeps your heart healthy you've got fruit juice packed with antioxidants you've got fish fingers full of omega-3 you've even got cereal that claims to lower your cholesterol do health claims on packaging makers want to buy more expensive food and can we even trust the claims they make would you be prepared to pay a little bit extra to buy a food that had a health claim attached to it yes I suppose I would to a certain extent yes yeah you have then I think it's important to read the label I do tend to buy things they're kind of aimed right no casserole and that kind of thing if it's just a little bit more I'd be inclined to buy it compared to not going for the health of your choice it seems like many of us are prepared to pay more for proven benefits I'm off to meet the editor of The Grocer magazine to find out why her claims in food and drink make us feel that they're worth paying extra for do you think making your packaging look healthier means you can charge more absolutely clearly a packaged goods like the one in the box there's more room for messaging and they're pitching it in terms of the cholesterol savings and lots of methods in there around saturated fats and no added nasties and so on the other product here is much more functional it's clearly pitching hitch in terms of just get this and get on with it part of the reason that you're able to charge more is because you've got more room to say more things about the product and to sell the added value but can we trust these clips just food always do what it says on the tin later I put food health claims on packaging under the microscope will this cereal lower my cholesterol the next patient into the food hospital is a 16 year old with an unsightly and painful condition that affects around 1 in 5 children and one in 12 adults in the UK my name is Tavian water I'm 16 and I suffer from eczema when it's at its worst there's a constant burning sensation in my arms and my hands I've experienced some name-calling slight bullying because of my eczema when it's really really bad if I'm at school I pretend to be sick so I can go home red dry inflamed and itchy eczema can make life miserable severe cases may be difficult to cope with physically and mentally often having a significant impact on daily life I feel that eczema does take over my life I can't do anything without eczema being prevalent when I wake up in the morning there's done my covers because I've been scratching the night and I haven't realized it my dream is to become cabin crew but I don't see that happening if I've still got eczema because I wouldn't want somebody serving me chicken or beef with some extra written arm and I don't think I'd want to be that embarrassed every time I'm working on a flight the exact cause of eczema is unknown it can run in families but it also seems it could be linked to allergies and the immune system I've tried so hard to do something about my eczema I go to the doctors and they just say just keep on using the creams that you're using just want some proper help every year the NHS writes out millions of prescriptions for steroid cream treatments for eczema tobey's come to cgo hoping for a more natural approach Toby you're here because you've got eczema when did that start for you since I was two so let's tickle it using the microscope here's the very dry skin around it and we're looking this is in between your fingers isn't it yeah I can see there I've got these golden crusty lesions and that kind of wetness can you open up your finger just look yeah they get look at that oh my god this is disgusting so that's staph infection so bacteria on the skin have got into the skin where it's inflamed and colonized it eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that most typically appears on hands feet and the skin creases such as folds of the elbows or behind the knees is it very itchy yeah really really itchy so that's the typical characteristic of expose that people scratch it the scratching makes the information worse and then bacteria that know where you live on the skin can get inside the skin and cause infections there's a bit of a cycle yeah the thing with eczema a lot of the time is that you don't really cure it's just a question of managing and controlling it I've tried creams I've tried everything under the Sun nah think out less than one in ten children have trigger foods which make their xmas symptoms worse at 16 toby is on the cusp between adult and child whilst conventional medicine says there's no proven link between adult eczema and diet gio is sending Toby to an allergy specialist with a dietary approach I do believe that your symptoms by and large are reversible if we're to look into the area of foods the best shot we have added is to exclude a number of common foods from your diet for a couple of weeks and see what response you get from you doctor Ekans has devised an elimination and challenge diet for Toby excluding certain foods to see if his condition improves if it does he can then reintroduce one food at a time to see if it triggers an eczema breakout in a nutshell I would like you to avoid to start with the most common foods for two weeks Toby will avoid all grains dairy foods yeasts citrus fruits and chocolate can I have a look at the menu see what they bail oh thank you he'll limit his diet to meat fish seafood veg salad and pulses elimination diets are a method believed by some to uncover food allergies but they should only be carried out under medical supervision we know that in around ten percent of children an exclusion diet can improve eczema and it's not actually been proven in adults so we're quite interested to see what happens for Toby [Music] the food hospital is committed to improving the health of the nation but it's also here to investigate the healing powers of food when it comes to the damage we inflict on ourselves [Music] Johnny Billy and James are students who love to go out drinking they have at least three binges a week sinking up to ten points a time this is way over the recommended 21 units a week for men [Music] and for every big night out there's the morning-after to endure the lads have come to the food hospital after last night's session to see if they can minimize the stomach-churning effects of their hangovers when I get out of bed massive head rush had a dehydrated don't want to look at food that's my own Arthur my headache so it goes away after a while but the queasy stomach sticks around so most of the day I'm feeling pretty fragile each morning Spanish a bit shaken and you just want to crawl back into your pit and sleep it's still feeling rough now just need a cuddle although drinking to excess isn't advisable many of us have experienced hangovers dehydration is responsible for most of the nastier effects of booze the parched mouth headaches and continual dizziness alcohol irritates the stomach lining which accounts for the nausea and indigestion and since your liver is working overtime during the night it means you're likely to wake up totally lacking in energy alright last night a few quiet by us I must have about 10 paisa cider right just on the side of these two died on the locker yeah and then moved on to the room at some point in its or went downhill from there many people reach for the coffee after a heavy night but the caffeine could mildly dehydrate you further and sugary drinks may give you a quick lift but half an hour later you'll come crashing down hair of the dog may seem like a good idea at the time but it only postpones the hangover and can be the first step to developing a real dependence on alcohol so let's talk about some things that perhaps might help okay first thing we've got here is milk milk has a substance in it called cysteine which is an amino acid it's basically one of the building blocks of protein and you actually need it to metabolize alcohol particularly if you have with it a banana bananas are lovely and high in potassium as well as having the extra sugar in a bit more slow-release than things like sugary drinks because they've got fiber in so that's going to help slow it down and give you more of a sustained response and the potassium is something that we lose in our we when we diuretics like alcohol so it's good to replace that as well so as well as the milk cysteine is actually in things like cheese yogurt eggs and even things like bacon and sausage and so that brings us nicely on to our magic healing hangover breakfast so the old tale about a fry-up is half true the ingredients are good but they technically shouldn't be fried because of the fact so a nice healthy grilled cooked English breakfast is actually a pretty good hangover cure drinking water is good for rehydration but Gio and Lucy have a more effective remedy another really great thing to start your day with if you're hungover is an oral rehydration solution water with a bit of added sugar and salt so in like a pint of water you'd have about four teaspoons of sugar and about half a teaspoon of salt now we've made you up an extra special one today using maple syrup for our sugar a bit of lemon juice because it tastes good and it's got some vitamin C and the salt we've also added a little bit of honey to go along with the maple syrup so the thing about this drink we've made up the reason it's better than water is because there's a mechanism in the bowel this there's a bit of sugar around in the water it actively takes out water into the body much more so than if there's just regular water around which is why this is very effective and it's used as well in travel medicine so people that go abroad and get diarrhea for example this is a really good way to rehydrate it's not but it's quite salty the salt is going to basically replace the losses that have occurred but where you've been weighing a lot if I'm a glass of desert like a few 20 minutes later has Lucy and Gio's simple homemade rehydration drink done the trick it was sort of going down it felt a little queasy put that obviously now it's sort of I settled the stomach quite a fair bit and my head is feeling a little clearer so I'm guessing it's doing its job I'm feeling quite a work now so he's brought me round a little but it doesn't taste the best but sometimes the things that don't taste the best of the best for you so I've got go through the pain to get the reward of English self-prescribed her own extremely limited low choline diet trying to manage her fish odor syndromes through food but Lucy is concerned that Ellie is becoming seriously malnourished as a result of this and because her condition is so rare Lucia sending Ellie to University College London to see a leading expert in metabolic medicine for specialist support we start off just by talking about trimethylaminuria and what it is and then move on to how we can treat it then we can come back to how that applies to you and what you're doing at the moment dr. Lachman and his team have devised a food plan which should reduce Ellie's body odors and also give her the essential nutrition Lucy was so concerned about decreasing her risk of serious health problems basically we split things up using a traffic light system and we have red foods that really contain quite large amounts of choline you should try and avoid and the other end of the spectrum there are the green foods which you should be able to eat pretty freely after two and a half years of her harmful restricted diet Ellie's new list of safe foods includes egg white sausages oats and bread which shouldn't aggravate her condition it's taking me so long to cut all of that unknown food out the thought that I have to cede control of that and start putting it back in it was actually really frightening but I'm going to try them in small doses say on the Friday night when I don't have to see anyone till a Monday and see how I get on with it but many people Ellie consulted the internet to get medical information and while that's empowering to an extent what she lacked was a broader specialist perspective on her problem and now she's got that the next patient into the food hospital suffers from a condition thought to affect up to 15% of the adult UK population - Michelle Jordan I'm 30 years old I live in cotton Portsmouth and I have cool stones in my gallbladder if I eat particular food I get pains in my chest it's that's with this weird feeling in my stomach then it just slowly rises up to around here and then it stays there and then I can't breathe I can't move I have to just lay and wait for the pain to disappear around one in three people with gall stones develop difficulties symptoms include sudden and intense pain in your abdomen nausea and vomiting and yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes the source of the problem begins with the liver which secretes bile into the gall bladder a small organ located under it which is used to break down fats and aids digestion gall stones occur when this bile becomes unbalanced normally with too much cholesterol and starts to form crystals which grow over time into stones millions of us have them without knowing it but when they grow too big that's where the problems start I've been through child labor and out of that any day over it'd be great if all I had to do is change my diet instead of having to go through surgery because that surgery is time off work it's also time away from my child which I don't and I won't be over to be as mobile as I am now having been hospitalized three times because of the pain Misha has come to see consultant surgeon Shaw summers in the hope that he can alleviate her agony without resorting to surgery this is a gallbladder that's been removed from somebody with an operation and there's all the little stones lots of different sizes swimming around in the vial there I've got a display case of a number of different sorts of gall stones here from the really big ones that have taken many many years to fall to the sort of sludgy gravel when you have fats with your meal the gallbladder squeezes concentrated bile down the bile duct into the intestine if the gallbladder squeezes and one of those stones gets caught in the outlet pipe of the gallbladder the buyer won't go anywhere because it's blocked and they call that a squeeze is really hard and that's what causes the symptoms that pain in the top of the tummy after a meal especially worse if you have something fatty or rich okay when gall stones get too big surgery is the recommended option 50,000 people need to have their gallbladders removed each year but michel has come to the food hospital just in time sure has run tests and the results show that rather than fully formed gall stones she has the small sludgy crystals which have the potential to be reversed through diet what we're going to do Michelle is to give you a diet that helps to make the bile a bit more runny the idea is that with runnier bile that crystals might dissolve and your symptoms get less frequent hopefully go away how long do you think that would take it might take a few weeks it might even take a few months it does depend on how runny the bile is and how dissolvable those crystals are unfortunately modern day eating habits foods are out of a box or they've been processed somewhere and prepared for you and that processing leads the foods to make the bile very concentrated the diet we're going to use is something called a Neolithic diet it's akin to what we used to eat in Stone Age and it it consists of unrefined foods sure and Lucy believed that a large amount of refined or processed foods may lead to the formation of gall stones evidence shows that a diet high in fat and cholesterol and low in fiber increases the risk of this condition our consumption of refined sugar has rocketed over the past 200 years research has shown that the equivalent of 40 grams which is really only about eight teaspoons throughout the day can actually double the risk of symptomatic gall stones so it's quite a significant impact there instead Michelle's Neolithic food plan involves sticking to unrefined foods those high in fiber will help prevent the concentration of bile and vitamin C and low fat dairy foods can also be beneficial this Stone Age type diet is also thought to lower your risk of developing heart disease and one limited experimental study found a link to certain foods that may trigger gallstone pain have you found any trigger foods that set off paints oranges oranges some yogurts okay for Chloe's curries well it's very interesting in this study they also identified oranges and apples they did they did they also identified eggs baked beans things like onions in some people coffee but all of this is very individual and what we wouldn't recommend is that somebody that's getting this type of paint just take all of them out for your diet but you might obviously want to keep a bit of a food and symptom diary to see if things are occurring that trigger your symptoms like you with oranges and apples as well as eliminating possible trigger foods Michelle will receive a list of recipes that include approved ingredients food treatment plans are specifically tailored to our patients if you want to treat your condition with food you should ask your GP to refer you to a dietitian Lucy wants to show Michelle a simple example of one of the dishes so what I thought we will cook is a nice family-friendly recipe which is basically a burger okay obviously this isn't just your typical standard burger it's the burger with a twist Lucy starts with a whole grain bun rich in insoluble fiber lettuce adds crunch and tomato is high in vitamin C the burger is made from a mix of kidney beans and chickpeas full of plant sterols also thought to help reduce cholesterol not that bad actually it's frozen oh I'm glad it's not absolutely terrible so Michelle will return in six weeks to see if she can avoid going under the knife it's a huge change from my current diet but I'm willing to try things if I don't put my all in I'm going to have to hope for an operation and I don't want an operation so I'm going to do this diet simple 16 year old Toby is desperate to rid himself of his severe eczema so that he can confidently apply to become airline cabin crew he's been following a strict elimination diet for the last four weeks but some of the recommended ingredients are proving a real challenge normally I'd probably be eating a packet of crisps or some biscuits so a buckwheat pancake but never mind it smells it really smells ah I've quite good but it's very tough pancake that's disgusting I feel half of me enough better soil what's of them it's horrible that is disgusting no don't like it they said like how this is a snack or for breakfast and eating this every breakfast would make me dread mornings it's revolting I don't know if my willpower is that good - maybe like have one bit a toast because my patience is wearing a little bit thin right now Toby's got another two weeks before he returns to the food hospital will he be able to stick to his plan [Music] I'm doctor Pixie McKenna and I'm investigating the truth about health claims made on food packaging cereal that lowers your cholesterol juice packed full of antioxidants and bread that keeps your heart healthy it appears that well-designed packaging outlining healthy ingredients helps sell products makes us believe they're better for us and convinces us to pay more but are these health claims true I've come to see dietitian and nutritionist Nicole Berberian to find out but guess what I want to know from you is can we trust these health claims a health claim is any statement which Associates use of a product with a health benefit such as lowers cholesterol or supports the immune system but you can't just put any claim onto a product it has to pass rigorous scientific testing the European Food Safety Authority is an independent food body which investigates every health claim made on packaging and ensures there is sound evidence to support it I want to look at a specific will this cereal lower my cholesterol well this product contains a substance called beta glucans that's a type of soluble fiber that has actually been found to lower cholesterol so yes it does contain the substance that has been proven to have the health benefit but the question is can we get it elsewhere because beta glucans are actually found naturally in oats and barley bran having a standard bowl of oats maybe adding some extra oat bran to it as well you're going to get quite a large amount of this beer to glucan maybe up to 2 grams the science says we need 3 grams per day of beta glucans to start to see cholesterol Naurang up to Vita has 1 gram per serving so you would need 3 bowls per day so the claim is true but that's not the whole story Nicole thinks it might be easier to get the three grams using porridge oats and bran so for the consumer there are much cheaper products on the shelves but do the same thing well the branded product does have the benefit of having the added vitamins and minerals but from the cholesterol-lowering point of view yes there are other basic products which do the same thing to most of us food labeling is really really confusing I mean you've got your low fat rich in antioxidants you know what do we look out for when we go shopping it is a minefield as soon as fat content is reduced for example they might add more salt more sugar more artificial sweeteners to get the same taste and texture so you've got to look at the labels to make informed decisions about a product you should always look at the bigger picture the best thing to do is look beyond the claims on the front of the packaging go straight to the ingredients and recommended daily allowance information where you can get a clearer idea of what you are eating you may be surprised at how little difference there is between foods that Clary claims and those that don't health claims on packaging have to be rigorously checked and they also have to be proven to true but what I've discovered is it's always worth checking the ingredients Packaging can make something seem healthier than cheap alternatives and when it comes to lowering my cholesterol I've discovered that there's cheap and simple bag of oats does the same thing as this more expensive alternative 30 year old mom Michelle came to the food hospital with excruciating pain from crystals in her gallbladder she was prescribed at caveman or Neolithic diet in an attempt to avoid surgery to remove her gallbladder the dietician at the Food Hospital advised me to use more fresh produce rather than processed foods instead of using a jar of sauce to actually make the sauce myself which I've been doing and also I've gotta have a whole meal pastor rather than the white pasta and home lab word rather than the white plate sometimes it's difficult because after hard day's work you're not that keen on coming and cooking from scratch but you do it and when you've done it you realize it didn't take that long actually it wasn't that bad after eight weeks on her food treatment plan Michelle is back for her follow-up how have you got on with it it's poisoning not too bad I've done everything I was told to do I cut out all the bad things and kept in all the good things before she came to the food hospital Michelle suffered around eight attacks of severe pain each month do you feel any better I've had the pain once which was at the very beginning of changing my diets but since then I've had nothing that's really great in yourself do you feel better for having had this change in your hungry all the time because I didn't used to have breakfast but now I do so I can actually last until the lunch time as they say I do feel better it's very early days but it's fantastic that you're feeling better and you're also adopting really healthy lifestyle practices because that's not just going to benefit your gallbladder of course it's gonna benefit your whole being I'm really impressed how well you've done Michelle you've taken everything we've suggested onboard and you've changed your diet hopefully that will have taken the sludge out of your gallbladder but we'll have to arrange a special ultrasound scan to check whether that's really happened if a future scan reveals her diet has reduced her gallbladder sludge Michelle could avoid surgery if we can carry on with this kind of diet with this kind of lifestyle I think the chances are have to put my knife away well that's not a bad thing it is surprising that changing your diet would do so much purely because I didn't think I ate that bad food but obviously just tweaking it here and there slowly as made a huge difference it's been nearly three weeks since Ellie visited the food hospital and was prescribed her low choline food plan Fashoda syndrome is not simple to treat as different foods trigger bad smells in different people so Ellie's regime reintroduces her to certain foods one at a time to see which might give her an adverse reaction I am still nervous that trying new foods and particularly foods that I associate with having a bad odor but I'm willing to give them the go on the list today we're gonna try egg white omelet Lucy wants Ellie to introduce more foods so she can eat a normal balanced diet and return to a healthy weight this is her first time eating egg whites in over three years I'm really really hungry I'm really looking forward to this and it smells really nice actually it's not angry at all it just smells like cooking hmm and don't taste too bad actually while it's essential le identifies foods that trigger her odor she still struggles with the psychological effects of her condition there are things I'm still anxious about I've still got the boundaries of things I know I won't try or the boundary of things I'll try this but I'll only try it on the weekend I did have a bad day last Monday a very bad day and I had to go and meet a lot of people who work and the knew I was having a bad day and that's very difficult that was all my psyche just going back to the beginning of the whole process will Ellie managed to hold her nerve and keep testing foods that trigger her fish odor syndrome and what were the results of the food elimination plan show for Toby's eczema when he returns to the food hospital eight weeks ago 16 year-old Toby came to the food hospital with severe eczema on his hands and arms Jia referred him to a dietary allergy specialist who put him on a strict elimination plan and the results have been truly dramatic Toby what's happened to you I thought you had excellent yeah I know me too this said disappeared that is that is really very very impressed so tell me exactly what happened you took some of the foods out of your diet yeah wheat gluten milk eggs poultry everything like that really and fruit and at Helenus take to start working it was weird because first four days it got worse and after the fifth day I started seeing a little difference so that was something maybe you know keep on going keep on going and by the tenth day I've saw a noticeable difference where other people could like in my family could like notice eyes going 8 weeks ago he was plagued by seeping and crusty lesions now it is completely dry yeah and it's 95 percent of it is completely normal the odd little skin plate there but otherwise it's very impressive and a really good result I've never known my skin to be so clear in in Fi keep on using my hands in conversation like that's like keep waving them around waving them about and they're not like always like tucked in them - my jumper there's anything like that so less self-conscious yeah the next step is to reintroduce some foods into your diet so you're looking forward to that or what you're thinking about it I'm looking forward to it and I mean I'm looking forward to eating some foods that I've missed even if I find a food that doesn't work and makes the xmin worse that's a positive because I know more about it Toby had been worried that his unsightly and flaking skin would prevent him from realizing his life's goal in terms of your ambitions wanting to be an heir Stuart yeah I only feel about it yeah I'm gonna go ahead and apply I just you know apply to every airline that's that's one thing I feel like it's achievable you know hopefully one day that it will happen what's very exciting OC very exciting and you're so happy yeah well done you Toby's skin has improved dramatically and I'm very pleased about that exactly why that is as a result of the elimination diet isn't totally clear however it's a good example of how food can subtly affect the way our body functions I feel so happy literally I can't get this smile off my face my confidence has taken such a boost and I feel that I'm not pretending to smile anymore but it's not like a false smile it's just sight on my face all the time it's it's great [Music] three weeks ago Ellie came to the food hospital with fischoeder syndrome which made her feel like an outcast and was endangering her health she's back to tell Lucy NGO how she's coping with her reintroduction of foods to try to up her nutrient intake I've been trying lots of different types of foods I was too scared to try before mixed results some of them have actually caused a bit of an odor problem but some of them haven't at all so I've been going through the list and working out what definitely is a problem and what is definitely fine but I'm really enjoying cooking and making food again and before it was just something I didn't really want to deal with so do you feel that like your relationship with food is evolving for the good yeah it is no I mean my diets still restricted and there's things I'm not ever gonna have again like me because I know there'll be a problem but just a wider combination and what I was eating I've been having things like bagels and crumpets for breakfast which I haven't had for a couple of years and Wow having a comfort in Jam breakfast teas it's I can't tell you difference it's made to my quality of life Ellie's previous diet was so restricted Lucy and Gio discovered she was seriously underweight and probably malnourished here we are three short weeks later you've gained a kilo which is actually over two pounds and the best news is that within the bit of weight that you have gained it's actually been lean body mass it's been protein making my muscles so you have more muscle which is fantastic news because obviously that's what I'd been really concerned about so your body is recovering I'm so impressed in the transformation in just three short weeks you've clearly really gone at it wholeheartedly there's no point screwing up an opportunity like this and I had no idea how miserable that was making me a nice fellow completely different person you do seem transformed to be honest like you just seem like the curtains lifted and yeah that's how it feels and I'm stunned by that I wasn't wasn't expecting that at all three weeks ago food was the enemy for early and she was doing untold damage to her body I'm happy to say she's now enjoying food and still managing to control her fischoeder syndrome I feel like I'm getting my life back I know I'm always gonna have the condition but I feel differently about it and it's like the world is opening up again and I know that sounds a bit unbelievable after three weeks but it's really how I feel I've got so much hope and it's just amazing", "yHIgCc9Bd7I": "hi welcome to my Channel today I'm going to show

easy garlic-breath remedy munching on apples lettuce and mint leaves can help significantly decrease the levels of odiferous compounds in your breath according to a tiny but compelling experiment by researchers at Ohio State University specifically certain compounds and enzymes in raw apple raw lettuce and mint leaves react with the chemicals that create garlic breath neutralizing the odor it's better than mouthwash garlic breath can come from multiple places in the body not just food particles in your mouth partially digested food in your stomach also emits this smell so brushing your teeth or gargling with mouthwash won't always do the trick by contrast the neutralizing foods identified by the study interact with the garlic in the stomach to deodorize the vapors preventing the garlicky compounds from making it to your bloodstream and being expressed from your lungs into the air you exhale brushing teeth has no effect on what you have already swallowed or digested explained lead researcher Cheryl barrier a professor and chair of OSU's Department of Food Science and Technology and Apple reacts with the garlic in your mouth or stomach to deodorize the volatile zin your stomach before they are digested into your bloodstream so yes eating the Apple is more effective than just brushing your teeth to test the effects of certain foods on garlic breath study co-author Rita Morano first chewed one clove of raw garlic for 25 seconds and then chased it with cooler water that served as the control treatment moranto then repeated the garlic chewing over the course of several days each day testing the effect of just one food or drink on her garlic breath she tried raw and microwaved Ethel's raw and microwaved lettuce mint leaves mint juice and hot green tea the researchers then measured the level of garlic compounds in nerado's breath for 60 minutes after each bad breath treatment and then rank the foods and juices according to how quickly they helped decrease the garlic papers they found that raw apple raw lettuce and mint leaves were the most effective at significantly decreasing the levels of most vapors that cause garlic breath white garlicky foods need a specific chaser Apple's lettuce and mint leaves are all high in phenolic compounds aromatic chemicals found in plants that react directly with the compounds that create garlic breath the foods are also high in the enzyme polyphenol oxidase which causes browning in fruits and vegetables and reductase which helps catalyze the breakdown of organic compounds both enzymes are thought to speed up the reaction between the phenolic compounds and the garlic vapors apple juice mint juice heated apple and heated lettuce also significantly decreased the levels of garlic vapors in the breath though they weren't as effective as the raw versions the cooked and the raw were similar but it's just that the raw foods have more enzymes which help speed up the process said fahringer but certainly eating an apple or drinking mint tea at the end of the meal would be a good deal Dreiser of course because this experiment was so small the results would have to be replicated across many more garlic-breath victims but

Shalini como dia and I'm a dentist at gentle dental care in Vestal New York today I wanted to talk to you about what you can do at home to help treat your bad breath Wow one of the major causes is not having a clean tongue so food debris and plaque and bacteria will grow on your tongue and if you don't brush it or scrape that off then you're going to end up with foul smell in your mouth so making sure you're using a tongue scraper or brushing your tongue every time you brush your teeth other things you can do is really focusing on brushing your teeth twice a day flossing every day getting that stuff out from in between your teeth so that you don't have bad smell in addition avoiding foods that cause bad breath like onions and garlic I know garlic is delicious and i love it sometimes what you can do is eat an apple after you've had a meal with a lot of garlic and that will help to neutralize the smell that you have if you want to use something like a mouth rinse then I would recommend an alcohol-free mouth rinse as the alcohol will dry out your mouth and that can cause more bad breath in the future or you can try oil pulling as well to help reduce the odor so starting tomorrow

to my channel if you knew my name is Alex Carson today we are going over one of the biggest confidence killers in the game something that will make your friends stay far away from you it will make girls walk away when you try to talk to them and it will make you feel like you're doing something wrong bad breath everyone has it right sometimes when you wake up in the first thing in the morning you have that morning breath or maybe you eat something that has garlic in it and then you can smell that as well you just have to be aware of it and neutralize it as soon as possible and here is how number one watch what you eat if you're going on a date in 20 minutes for example you definitely want to stay away from some types of food anything that's too garlicky or too saucy or too spicy try to eat something a little bit lighter so that it's not gonna linger in your breath all night long can you imagine kissing someone and tasting what they had for dinner two or three hours ago no matter how hot you are how many abs you have how cool your outfit looks that's disgusting no one wants to taste that so if you're gonna have that type of food that's a little bit heavier saucy garlicky or anything like that then you want to make sure that you're not gonna be close to a lot of people for the next hour or so number two floss daily have you ever smelled the little pieces of food that come out when you floss it is not pretty my friend I can't stress how important this is frosting will get rid of all the food particles in between your teeth and if you let them sit there for a while they smell really really bad and that smell is in your mouth all day I used to floss at work after lunch every day just to make sure I wasn't killing anyone with my breath during it working so if you can maybe just carry some floss with you to school or work and you're gonna feel so much cleaner after lunch number three use an electric toothbrush I didn't have an electric toothbrush into maybe a couple of years ago and I remember the first time I used my my mouth had never felt so clean you could literally see the difference in my teeth this one that I've been using the elements sonic toothbrush is from today's sponsor dazzle Pro it has for brushing modes clean soft whitening and even a massage mode for your gums and most importantly it produces 40,000 strokes per minute when you use a manual toothbrush just to give you guys an idea the average is 300 strokes per minute so this is over a hundred times more powerful than manual brushing it has a rechargeable docking station so you can leave it charging overnight and never have to worry about the batteries running out it also has a two-minute brushing timer so you know exactly when you need to be done brushing now one of the coolest things that I've seen in an electric toothbrush is this UV sanitation system in the docking made to kill 99% of the bacteria that can live on the toothbrush bristles once you go with an

linked in the description below the video number 4 don't forget your tongue to be a hundred percent honest with you guys I actually didn't know that I had to brush my tongue for a very long time and then I thought I could just brush it and that was it but actually that's not true when you brush your tongue you do break down the food particles on it but they stay there and you're actually just moving them around you need a tongue scraper like this one here to actually remove everything from your tongue after you're done brushing it a tongue scraper is so cheap you can get it anywhere and it makes a huge difference in your breath so definitely make sure that you get one number five use mouthwash and I feel like this one is a no-brainer mouthwash will make your mouth feel clean minty and ready for whatever or whoever comes your way make sure that you're moving it around your mouth for at least 30 seconds to get everything between your teeth your gums and then gargle to get the best results do this after flossing and your mouth will feel amazing tip number six drink lots of water you probably notice this before but when your mouth is dry your breath probably stinks and there's a scientific reason behind that you need saliva to neutralize acids in your mouth and wash away dead cells that accumulate on the tongue the gums and cheeks and if you don't drink enough water your mouth won't really produce saliva and these cells decompose and can cause bad breath plus you know water is good for you so if you should be drinking a lot of water regardless tip number seven always carry mints with you I can't tell you how many times I'm out with my friends having fun and then I reach into my pockets and where are my mints I forgot them and then all of a sudden your confidence level just drops a hundred percent it's so much easier when you have them on you because you know for sure that your breath is fresh if you just had a mint even if you just ate and didn't have time to brush your teeth the mint will help so every time I go out I double check for things my wallet my phone my keys and gum or mints and pro tip guys this one is very important make sure that you have some mints next to your bed so that if you end up having some company over and if you want any morning action at all you can just reach over and grab some mints in the morning guys if you enjoyed this

the teeth which we all brush in the morning is one of the reasons that and solve it is also known as morning breath that's the most common cause so the same flower which forms inside the gums or sticks inside the gums and the tongue surface is which leads to more gum issues called as gingivitis and periodontitis is the other most common reason for bad breath Tom we see so there are a lot of other reasons why bad breath happens sometimes it's the food like onions garlic that have a distinct odor draw that cause bad breath and some are because of general health issues issues can be like regular heartburn which is a very common thing that happy people and they do P the breath which is not good if they have any intestinal disorders and diabetics especially uncontrolled diabetes when

use to control bad breath air so we need to have some saliva gland stimulation for the bad fit so we can chew on engine seeds and seeds or just flows in your mouth just to chew on that that helps with the breath also and other ways of doing it is the chewing on any of the leaves like which are these we talked about mint or parsley or cilantro when these things are chewed it actually gives out

if eating certain foods can make you smell the food Tech's in green have been eating garlic for a week we're about to see if our blindfolded nose can pick them out of a lineup okay then that's smelling any food here actually smells pretty clean I can actually smell the soap though Thank You number one food tech number two please approach the nose are you getting anything from the skin of this food Tech I'm getting something and I kind of want to smell this again because I'm also getting something coming from a fragrance it's mimics being by the sea food Tech you smell of the sea fascinating and now food Tech number three okay here I'm detecting some food like odors but I don't believe it's coming from what she's eating I believe it's coming from a lotion that she's wearing and I can smell some fruity notes so tuck number four please approach the nose now definitely no food nose here and instead I'm smelling some wood notes scoop tuck have you been chopping wood and last but not least food tech number five oh and this harm I can definitely smell some garlic really food Tech number five thank you for your service now ray I believe you indicated that you wanted another crack at smelling food Tech number two yes it was two and if I could take could I also have their other arm because of detecting fragrance this is a little creepy I have to say okay Ted I am detecting some food now you can smell the garlic coming to the pork I see it appears that the nose knows garlic but how will he do with curry spices it's time for the spice panel get a little bit of powder but that's about it I'm not smelling any food on this as well yeah I'm detecting some food here there is like a chilly note all right very interesting Thank You number three okay what I'm actually smelling came from a fragrance you probably had out a few days ago and finally BlueTEC number five I have to admit that this is a little tougher there's definitely a food like spice and then seeing it more blended than I did before Thank You number five well that was interesting so apparently it's a little bit harder to detect curry spice than garlic it was definitely harder to do yes but I'm pleased to say that you were absolutely correct and so the nose evidently also knows spice even though it's a little more difficult than garlic impressive so food can make you smell our nose focused on the food Tech's sweat but bad breath can contaminate much of the air around you and research suggests that essential oils in garlic and spices are passed into your blood and aerated into the lungs

"welcome everyone my name is Tanisha pitch Avenue choke otherwise known to my students as chef teah I'm a personal chef caterer and culinary instructor at tea spoons my boutique cooking school in Ladera Ranch California in this clip we're going to show you how to clean the smell from plastic food containers now having a cooking school means that I always have to keep my food containers smelling nice and fresh so what I use is a simple combination of bleach baking soda a little dish soap and I'll also need some paper towels a big bowl that's big enough to fit the plastic container a sponge and of course my gloves because since we're going to be working with bleach I want to make sure that I protect my hands so first what we're going to do is put on the gloves you always want to make sure that you wear gloves whenever possible even when you're washing your dishes because you want to keep your hands nice and protected over time so now we're going to go ahead and turn on the hot water I'm going to go ahead and squeeze a little bit of the dish soap inside the container and give it a good scrub so this is just the beginning step of our cleaning here again just a little dish soap some hot water and our sponge I'm going to go ahead and rinse it out now now I'm going to make a simple paste of baking soda and water the baking soda actually helps to neutralize the odors in the container so I'm going to go ahead and sprinkle about 1/2 a cup of baking soda into the container there we go and I'm also going to just add enough water just to make a heavy pace so that's probably about 1/4 a cup of water then I'm going to take my sponge and give it a good scrub make sure you clean in the corners as well because that's where a lot of odors sometimes linger and get trapped in so make sure you get all the outside the corners and the little crevices in between as well so now I'm going to rinse out the solution of the baking powder and water so that's pretty good starting to smell good already so I'm going to go ahead and now fill up my glass bowl with some hot water I'm gonna put my container in there it's actually more like warm water so you'll be fine with just warm water there so just fill it up about halfway make sure it covers up the container and now I'm going to add my bleach solution always here there's a general rule about one cup of bleach per gallon of water so I'm going to go ahead and pour in my bleach there we go now I'm going to just let it soak for about thirty minutes just to ensure that we rid of any odors and smells that's still lingering in the container and we'll be back in a few minutes to check in on it so now that our container has soaked in the bleach and water solution for about thirty minutes I'm going to go ahead and rinse it out again I'm going to add a little bit of dish soap just one more time just to get rid of any of the bleach residue that may still be left behind turn on a little bit of the water and with my sponge just give it a good scrub with the soapy water here it's smelling great now I'm going to go ahead and rinse it out with some warm water again make sure you get rid of all of the soap and it's smelling wonderful what you also want to do too is take a paper towel and just dry it off a little bit just so that we don't have any water spots on our food container there we go you can also use a dish rag as well we're gonna go ahead and dry it off completely and then after this what I like to do is to actually leave it out in the Sun just so that we let it sit in the Sun because the UV rays actually helps to kill any additional bacteria that may still be lingering behind so we're going to leave it out in the Sun and you're good to go and you'll have a fresh clean smelling plastic

"bad breath is has many many reasons the one of the most common reasons is gum disease and a lot of people go brushing their teeth day and night to try and get rid of halitosis or a bad odor and not realize that they're missing certain areas they've got buried wisdom teeth with areas of infection around them and they just can't get rid of them so one of the best ways is to see a dentist or a dental hygienist that's your first port of call if you think that you've got that problem there are of course other reasons for bad breath such as medical conditions some people on certain medications it changes the body chemistry and produces bad breath and also obviously the most well-known one is what you eat so if you eat onions or garlic tuna things like that but that's usually temporary if it's a if it's a chronic problem then there's usually an underlying cause whether it's medical or dental and the best person to speak to is your dental hygienist [Music] you [Music]", "gNRe157cHNw": "hello perfect deities so today on TMI Tuesday where I cover topic that you want to know but are too afraid to ask I'm gonna tell you about bad breath and six quick ways you can gear it a bit so what causes bad breath in the first place well first of all stuff like eating a lot of strong smelling foods like garlic and onion will give you bad breath because the smell gets absorbed into your bloodstream and every time you breathe out the smell is coming out of you unfortunately you have to wait it out for the smell to get out of your system so toothbrushing gum chewing and mint will we mask the garlic smell temporarily so most cases of bad breath are caused by bacteria sitting on your tongue having a dry mouth usually causes the bacteria because your saliva isn't there to break down any of the particles in your mouth and keep things clean when your mouth is dry all those dead cells stay on your tongue and bacteria grows and breaks them down which leads to the release of sulfur and it smells putrid eating mints and chewing gum may not be able to get rid of the smell if it's coming from bacteria it will just cover it up so getting rid of the bacteria that's causing your bad breath isn't that hard and now here are five steps you can take to eliminate bad breath the first is to grab a toothbrush and brush your tongue and the roof of your mouth try scraping the bacteria off the back of your tongue since that where most of the bacteria lives number two if you don't already it you should floss daily food gets stuck in between your teeth and gums and toothbrushes can't always reach it so you should definitely floss and I'll help keep your breath from a smelling bad three is to drink more green tea and water drinking green tea or water will rehydrate you since the cause of bad breath is from dry mouth green tea can also eliminate bad breath from bacteria because it's shown to reduce the level of a sulfur compound in your mouth for is to use a mouthwash that doesn't contain alcohol and look for ones that contain zinc so zinc ions will bind with sulfur and turn it into a type of salt which doesn't release that nasty smell so try finding a mouthwash that doesn't have alcohol since alcohol will dry your mouth and worsen bad breath 5 if you notice a white film on your tongue a lot then a toothbrush isn't enough and then you might want to invest in a tongue scraper or tongue cleaner you basically place it towards the back of your tongue as much as you can and just scrape it off scrape it off scrape it off just kidding and all that nasty bacteria dead cells and other gunk will get scraped off leaving you with a cleaner mouth and fresher breath so if you follow these steps you are bound to always have fresh breath and everyone close to you will also notice how great your breath smells so good oral hygiene will also have a positive effect on your overall health too because constantly breathing in bacteria sitting on your tongue can cause respiratory problems so thank you all so much for watching on this week's TMI Tuesday where I cover a topic that you guys want to know but are too afraid to ask so don't forget to comment below and tell me what you guys want me to talk about for next week's episode and until next time don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys next Tuesday 5 so a UTI is an infection which involves through your wreath Row where you pee the bladder and the kidneys", "ZwkB1g0JE1w": "greetings my name is Joe Baron I'm a professor and department chair at the Department of Food Science and Technology at the Ohio State University and I am a researcher in the area of flavor chemistry specifically recently we've been looking at garlic breath and so I'm going to be talking about a recent article in the general food science they don't deodorization of garlic breath by foods and the role of polyphenol oxidase and phenolic compounds and garlic is a wonderful flavor it's one of those flavors we really like to have in our food but the downside is the garlic will linger on your breath up to 24 hours which isn't so pleasant so we've been looking at how can you use foods to deodorize your breath so some of our previous studies first we were looking at what kind of foods could you eat after garlic that would get rid of the garlic breath and then trying to explain why why do certain foods work really well at humber foods don't work nearly as well so looking at its number of other studies we looked at different foods that were effective and trying to understand why they were effective and our theory is that it comes down to two things one is for not compounds and the other is enzymes now phenolic compounds are things that are present in most fruits and vegetables you've probably heard that you're supposed to drink red wine and eat dark chocolate because the antioxidants and these antioxidants most of them are phenolics but most fresh fruits and vegetables also have these phenomics so we decided to test a range of foods and look at the effectiveness of these phenolic x' in deodorizing the garlic breath so when you chew garlic either from the moment you bite into garlic it starts it's got a compound called Allison and the Allison breaks down into a number of molecules they give you that very distinctive garlic flavor and when you consume them then they go into your breath and then they come back out actually they come out of your stomach and make them out of your bloodstream and out of your lungs and they cook this creates garlic breath so when you consume foods that have phenolic compounds these phenomics react with those volatiles and they destroy them so that they go away so they're not breathing out these volatiles anymore and the second factor is the enzymes and these enzymes speed up the reaction so if you have a raw fruit or vegetable that has these enzymes then this reaction happens faster and so this deodorization occurs more rapidly so the objective at this study was to look a little bit more deeply into the role of the phenolics and the enzymes and so to ask the question how does the amount of phenolic matter but does the type of phenolic matter and how much does the enzyme matter so we had the person consume the garlic and then they would consume the treatment and so we have the need things like mint and apple and lettuce and we did it raw and cooked because when you cook something you get bit in the enzyme first we were looking at the role of the phenolic s'right does it matter how much phenolic s' that you consume and so we took the apple or the mint and we made juice so we ground up the apple made apple juice when you do that what happens is the phenolic start to polymerize so we allow those phenomics to polymerize and then we actually filtered them about so you're drinking juice that has the enzymes but most of phenomics are removed and what we found was the juice was not very effective at all once you had removed most listen Alex it wasn't very effective you really need those phenomics in there that the amount of phenol it's is important to give you a good deal ization we also looked at tight because when we were trying to correlate the amount of phenolics to how well at deodorize we didn't get a really good correlation so we thought well maybe it's a tightness in Alex that makes sense the type of phenolics that are really important and that's what we found is very much that some foods were much more effective than others so we then took isolated the very specific type of phenolic compound that's in food and we did a very controlled little study where we mix the garlic in the phenolic and look at the ball tools that were formed and we found that rosmarinic acid for example which is the phenolic and mint was very very effective it was much more effective than any of other of the phenomics that we tested so in other words the type of phenolic really matters which sort of makes sense so some foods like mint are much more effective than other foods then we looked at the enzymes because and what we found was if you eat a raw food which has the phenolic and the enzyme it was usually but not always more effective than the cooked food so the coach food would have no enzyme so in other words the enzymes are helping but not dramatically many times when we protested the cooked in the raw food we actually got the same deodorization in other cases we got differences and again we did this really controlled study where we isolated just the enzyme and added it to the garlic and we found it it had a small effect but really the most effective thing was the type of phenolic compound and then the amount of phenolic and the amount of enzymes were important but less so if you're worried about garlic breath my short answer would be the apples the brothels eat raw meant both of those who are very very effective ways to deodorize garlic breath so the next steps in research are to continue to look even more deeply at the exact type of phenolic that's important we only tested three types and there's more than that so to get more into the exact type more into the exact amount and more into the enzymes because one of the applications you could do for this is you can make a pill something where somebody could eat their lovely garlic Laden meal and then have this pill which would have the amount type of phenolics that would give them a really good deodorization so they didn't have to worry about garlic breath afterwards you", "ScyQdo8gO8E": "please welcome the Brice while thank you faced uh we want to talk about a bit odorants yes body odor and bad breath you know we sort of joke about it but it's actually some people really are challenged by these things what might cause a body odor it spawns off a multi multi-billion dollar industry in North American by the way those babies are all real smelly good aren't they and that's what that's where a lot of the creams cutting on the smells and stuff that we also like to wear is that new fresh baby smell so it does affect a lot of us and the cause is really full circle are you know sometimes genetic yeah we by the way don't smell humans don't smell it's our glands apricot glands that let off a very tasty and product for bacteria and bacteria are what feed off of this the sweat glands you know release oil it's food for bacteria so some of us that's Matt they do and some of us have certain genes that dictate what bacteria may like that off you know production and then they serve either so some natural ways very effective ways and natural yeah and that's important because there's a lot of chemicals and things out there in the market today that we should probably be avoiding so medical concerns to keep note of you know me if yours is your breasts really sweet smelling that's a possible concern for diabetes either on its way and or your sugar is not really balanced that well and other things you know if you have you know unusual smell that's out of the blue could be a hormonal change or fluctuation when I get that sounds like orally or you're anywhere in the body and I'll put it this way it is a sign a symptom that you want to report to your medical practitioner as a possible cause for concern it also presents your doctor like this and say am i okay what's up right if something's completely out of their ordinary we're not talking about a three-hour workout your stinky you're supposed to psyche after that you know the common causes are foods as well and smoking we know alrighty I mean for your bad breath it could be there could be a tooth problem happening absolutely an abscess doctor colleges by the way four percent the population of a very unusual thing called tonsil lifts which is a you know Greek term for rock in the tonsil it's our Rock tonsils yeah and you know if you coughing up this really hard little globule and it stinks very badly you want to look into the tonsils and irrigate the tonsils because that's the solution even gargling with salt will be the solution but that is a major cause for bad breath for so got the doctor for that yeah consider that yeah okay let's talk about natural things that you might want to use when it comes to your topic we right so there's a lot on the market you know sage is a really interesting concept especially when you're menopausal because you have hot flashes and you tend to sweat sage both taken orally it's available in a tincture form and/or apply topically can actually help to manage excessive sweating remember I mentioned sweat doesn't smell it's a bacteria that grows off of the sweat and interesting enough in a post menopause lee and those people that have actually by a condition called hyper hydrosis excessive sweating yeah do really well from taking sage internally okay so you take this along with wearing a regular like antiperspirant well you know what I want to avoid the antiperspirant stopping sweating is probably not an excellent idea it's one of the ways in which we detoxify right right actually by the way girls are very sensitive much more than us guys walk into a guy's change room and you'll know right away and we don't really care about it women are like what the heck's going on and they're growing in their for that matter no the reason why we want to refrain from antiperspirant as often as possible and admittedly I use them once in a blue moon like today I sweat through my shirt live on TV but it's because of the aluminum chlorohydrate and aluminum we know is a major issue with Alzheimer's okay so if we're not absorbs through our skin now also beware and be cautious of the rock salt of the world although these are all alum potassium alum and and some suggestive resources that that doesn't get into us because they're larger molecules it's still aluminum so I like deodorants people make the mistake between you know antiperspirant deodorant all the time here's a natural one that you can make at home you know simply taking a little you know one of these applicators makeup applicators some baking soda which is what we're looking at here and I tend to like citrus do you like citrus colors nice and flat right nice and fresh smelling so a couple of dabs of this organic lemon extract which is also by the way edible we can make a mouthwash out of this right a couple of dabs like this and you dab that into baking soda soda did and almost everything it does doesn't it so universal cleaner and deodorize it well why do we put it in our fridge it's because it deodorize is right she dabbed that on and that's a very effective deodorant okay we're still sweat which is okay there nothing wrong with that and most of us don't sweat so much that actually drenches our shirts unless we're actually excessive stretchy well and some of us do maybe that's about hyperhidrosis in which in which case on my face but I sweat like I sweat like a man Lucy when I work out too much information soon here's another you know and some people do and that's okay here's something called vegetable glycerin and I'm gonna use this on your hands and again if you like citrus a little bit of vegetable glycerin citrus you can put this under your arms yeah you can even add a little bit of the baking soda that goes on your arms and feel that consistent to make a cream out of this as well smell that that'll actually help to subdue or reduce sweating yeah I appreciate if I smelt like Iran's right very nice you can do the same thing with something like peppermint you know and by the way this is applicable but let's try a little I'm gonna try a little mouthwash here we're gonna dip that okay into yours hey I get that I get I'm not saying anything I'm now you said you smell really good to me but just you know that is not only a sink and drink it right you can drink that as well so if you have a problem with that nice they're really strong strong yeah that's good ah Muslim armies happening in my mouth it's it's really minty moving on real quickly to oral health because if you're periodontitis and that's inflammation of the gums that is bacteria growing in the mouth in excess there's ways which to manage that's the number one cause for bad breath okay so remember to scrape your tongue remember to brush your teeth like your dentist says a couple times a day last thing you do but I didn't know there was an actual tongue scraper tongue scrapers this is one of my favorites okay so this is what's called an in-between this is put up by so I'm gonna hold out to the camera they see a tiny little it's like a pipe cleaner essentially that's yet that little that little pipe cleaner it's not better than flossing then it's well it's an example of flossing because our gonna get between your teeth but what you can do with this is you can take something like tea tree oil yeah and you dip this in tea tree oil or clove oil by the way okay dentists even use this you dip this in clove oil and then go between your teeth and each separate part in your teeth you go right between your teeth and that'll actually kill the bacteria that you're missing often when you brush and I'll deal with bad breath as well okay you're at the restaurant you've had some garlic cuz that's also very healthy for you just you know remember to ask the maitre d to bring you a bowl full of parsley any parsley will do there's all kinds of variations dip that neither a little vinegar just chew on it yeah so you're really a natural alternative to a breath freshener which oft often will contain you know certain forms of chemicals lastly that'll clear the that will clear your palate a medium your your palate and you know the the particular natural ingredients found in parsley are actually antibacterial bacteriostatic okay good garlic yeah real bad breath why a garlic so bad breath else actually help to cure sinusitis another contributing cause to bad breath if you're walking around with a subclinical chronic sinusitis bacteria and you go to the back of the throat out this particular stuff a Lemax or garlic extract which is a non odorous form of garlic will kill the bacteria and then you want to follow that with a neti pot and possibly using golden sealer hydrous about the neti pot yesterday on the show i still can't do it it's so effective i know it's just weird like i ha okay we got to go to break we got more coming up say what it reads well [Applause] [Music] I", "iOOze7KfL5M": "Is there a potential problem lurking under your mask? It's really unpleasant. Real estate manager Jennifer Verbeke wears the mask all day. My breath stinks. She's not the only one. Everybody's complaining about their bad breath. Dentists say they are getting overwhelmed with patients complaining about what's being called mask mouth. I'm seeing plaque accumulation. We're seeing a lot of people with more inflammation, more cavities, more gum disease. It's due to dry mouth, which happens when we try to get more air through a mask by breathing with our mouth instead of our nose. Hot. I feel so much better. I do feel like I have bad breath. If you smell your own breath, that means there's bacteria in your mouth and that's a problem. We all have a normal bacteria in the mouth which acts with our saliva, which bathes our teeth, so with the lack of saliva, more of this gooey plaque is sticking to the teeth, causing the bad breath. So, what can you do to avoid mask mouth? First, brush thoroughly. Then, use a scraper like this to remove bacteria on the tongue. That's disgusting. I can't believe that just came out of my mouth. But the number one tip, drink plenty of water. Mask mouth, be gone. (impactful music)", "UxfpGiPbo2w": "You're an oncologist, and yet, we've learned that your experience with cancer is very personal. Yes, and it really relates to this topic as well. The topic of unexpected symptoms. So, one of the symptoms of stomach cancer is actually bad breath. The cancer cells put out some molecules that get aerosolized into the breath and cause bad breath and I have a very personal experience with that because my dad died at a very early age at 61 and the first manifestation of his stomach cancer was bad breath, but nobody at all recognized that and when he first told me he had bad breath I was like, hmm, he's like a big burley strong guy who like wouldn't worry if he had B.O. or something like that. I can't imagine he's talking to me about bad breath and his doctors were dismissing it, I'm like, you better talk to this guy and listen to what he's talking about, and figure this out because this is not a person who's gonna be complaining about trivial bad breath and so they did, and they did work ups and tests were coming back that didn't make any sense to me and so finally I had to get involved in diagnosing it myself and in two days we diagnosed him with regrettably incurable stomach cancer and he died within a month of that. So sorry. (audience groaning empathetically) And the time that I jumped in was when he had what is one of the second other symptoms of stomach cancer is what's called early satiety and that is you'd fill up very quickly. Like so you only maybe eat half as much as you normally would eat and again this is a big, burley guy who loved food, loved to eat and he was sitting next to me right where you are Drew and he was sitting next to me and I noticed he left half of the food on his plate. And that wasn't like him. Never, never. So would it be fair to say that would be a later symptom, but the bad breath, if you're noticing something that you've never smelled before in a loved one and it's there all the time you know, that potentially would allow you to diagnose the stomach cancer soon enough that it might be more easily treated. Is that fair to say? That's exactly right, most stomach cancers are diagnosed when they're very advanced because they grow along the stomach and they don't cause enough symptoms or the symptoms are confused with common things like ulcers and reflux disease. Which are more common. Yup, so the bad breath may be the aerosolization of these molecules may be a way to diagnose it early. In fact, there are some tests now that actually analyze the breath and are able to do these finger prints of the molecules in the breath and detect stomach cancer from other things. And so, that's a very important thing. Dogs, you've all heard the story of dogs being able to detect cancer, well they're able to recognize these unusual scent patterns that come from this. And before we go to break, you raised a really important topic earlier which is, there's a good chance that if you're going to see a gastroenterology specialist, they may be more used to diagnosing peptic ulcer disease and things of that nature. You're an oncologist, so you're certainly more used to seeing cancer. How do you, as an oncologist, knowing all this, because I know our viewers right now are sitting here thinking how am I going to know if this is even worth advanced testing. How do you balance the knowledge that all these seemingly innocuous symptoms can be a sign of cancer or a symptom of cancer and yet still just enjoy your life? How do you know as a viewer right now, as a patient, okay I need to be steadfast I don't think my doctor understands that this bad breath this is something more than I haven't been brushing my teeth because I'm brushing my teeth, how do you do that? Now that's an excellent question and that actually relates to the story I just told you about my dad, in that we all have this interesting superstition that, like if something happens, that's shocking in your life like losing your dad to something like cancer at 61, you sort of got this idea when you get to 61, is that gonna happen to me, right? I mean everyone's thought that. So when I got to that age, I started. You don't look that old. I started...oh I set it up for that, thank you for saying that. And I'm a pro. (laughing) Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Yeah you're in the business. When I got to that age, I was like wow, this could happen to me so I started asking everybody how's my breath, you know what I mean? (laughing) It's like, you know because you're worried about it so, the answer is, it's really about persistence. You know your body, every person knows their body. You know the regular feelings you have and when you have persistent common symptoms, but they're persistent or they come out of nowhere they're things that you never had before that's what you need to pay attention to you can't angst about all these things, but doing your regular check ups, going to the doctor for your once a year physical, paying attention, getting your skin checked regularly, doing all those things. That helps you to know that you're in a good status and so if you get then unusual symptoms, that's when you have to go. And you need to share those with your doctor. As silly as they may seem or sound, you need to mention them. Absolutely because this woman saved her own life or maybe diagnosed her Hodgkins disease at an earlier stage than she would have because she said to the doctor what about this lump? And, you know it's too bad that the dermatologist didn't actually do that kind of an exam, it would have been nice, but doctors are very segmented now so you better tell 'em so that they have all the information, can make the best recommendation. Really appreciate all your advice today (audience applauding) and openin' up Dr. Piro.", "FvYFE9vDmGI": "almost everyone experiences bad breath once in a while but for some people bad breath is a daily problem and they struggle to find a solution approximately 30 percent of the population complains of some sort of bad breath halitosis which is the latin word for bad breath often occurs after a garlicky meal or in the morning after waking other causes of temporary halitosis include some beverages including alcoholic drinks or coffee and tobacco smoking some people may not be aware of their own halitosis and learn about it from a relative friend or co-worker causing some degree of discomfort and distress in severe cases bad breath may negatively impact personal relationships in a person's quality of life so what causes bad breath and what can you do about it bad breath can originate both inside and outside of the mouth bad breath is typically caused by bacteria present on the teeth and debris on the tongue so it's no surprise that most cases of halitosis are associated with poor oral hygiene gum diseases such as gingivitis and periodontitis and dry mouth a condition in which the salivary glands cannot make enough saliva to keep your mouth moist a visit with a dentist may help rule out periodontal disease and identify any mouth problem that could be contributing to bad breath tonsillitis respiratory infections such as sinusitis or bronchitis and some gastrointestinal diseases may be responsible for a small number of cases of bad breath advanced liver or kidney disease and uncontrolled diabetes can also lead to unpleasant breath in these cases a person is likely to experience significant symptoms beyond bad breath and should seek medical attention sometimes people think they have bad breath even when their breath is objectively fine this is called pseudohalitosis halidophobia or fear of bad breath is real and may persist despite reassurance from a doctor people with pseudohalitosis respond well to reassurance and may benefit from speaking with a therapist or psychiatrist who has expertise in the field here are some helpful tips to improve bad breath brush your teeth at least twice a day after meals with a fluoridated toothpaste avoid tobacco smoking and chewing tobacco based products rinse and gargle with an alcohol free mouthwash before bed if you have dry mouth make sure to drink enough fluids throughout the day and use over the counter moisturizing agents such as a dry mouth spray rinses or dry mouth moisturizing gel if you don't see any improvement you may want to schedule a visit with an oral medicine specialist oral medicine doctors provide comprehensive care for mucosal diseases salivary gland disorders or facial pain conditions and oral complications of cancer therapies among other things visit your dentist regularly and remember oral causes are responsible for most cases of bad breath thanks for watching subscribe us for more videos", "3oErUYZgjxM": "I can\u2019t smell because\nI never can smell.

garlic you get a spoon and put half of it don't take a full spoon if you have this table spoon then you can take one full tablespoon after taking coffee make my garlic you can see me taking one cup of water please don't forget to drink water while consuming yo garlic my name is Mimi aka natural living with Mimi I'm back with another video and today's video I'm going to be showing you how you can use garlic in 3 ways to get rid of bad smell down there yes that if he/she smell to get rid of all your infections to get rid of all your problems as women but dark is good for both we may not mean or getting rid of infections dalek has a lot of healthy benefits as well it helps to clear the skin yes if you want to blow your skin if you want if you want to have a glowing skin if you want to have health here good looking here garlic is the way to go so I'm going to be mentioning few benefits of garlic as we proceed so I'm starting off by peeling off the garlic I'm going to first read it all you just need to remove the skin nothing much I'm going to start by showing you the first imited this thing is so simple it doesn't take time you don't need a lot of time to prepare it so the first method is you just get like two of these ones you put in your mouth and she does the first imited I personally cannot afford so as you can see I'm feeling more girly causing this second method you will need a lot of garlic a lot of pieces like eight pieces but please tell it about the strong smell of garlic because I don't think anyone would want to leave those infections inside your body it's even better than taking those and bio tips that have side effects and apart from treating those infections garlic has a lot and a lot of healthy benefits garlic has and bacterial and fungal and viral and antiseptic properties from Alison Alison helps to kill bacteria causing packing so you're very sure that after taking garlic you can't have a glowing skin you're going to have a smooth skin you can have a clear skin and apart from helping us to glow our skins garlic has antimicrobial properties that help kill the jam and bacterias which are responsible for causing damage to this cup further inhibiting hair growth raw garlic is known to be rich in vitamin C content that is great for promoting hair health and apart from that garlic is good for diabetes that helps to control cholesterol levels guys I cannot finish all the benefits of garlic and I finish them via a lot and a lot so please do not care about the strong smell of garlic just know that you're going to carry that snow for only five days and you're going to be free for the remaining days of the month you can also go ahead and google about garlic so that you will know the an ending benefits of it so guys in this second method you see you need a lot some a lot of garlic cause I'm going to be blending this [Music] and putting your Valley this can take me for five days because I only take these five days in math I don't take it more than that five days in after putting your garlic anything you put two spoons of honey then you give it a mix you see how it looks like this is how it looks like so after mixing it well with honey you can keep it in the refrigerator for five days as you consume it as I told you you take it every day very early in the morning without breakfast you first take your garlic after you take a glass of water then after like 30 minutes you can have your breakfast so I'm going to cover this please don't make more than what can take you for five days cause you don't need to take what has of a stage just make that will last you for five days and that's it next month you just do the same process so I'm going to take you now to the third method what you're going to do is you're going to do this as well a lot of people complain about the strong smell of garlic but I personally I don't have any problem with it cause I would rather smell garlic then have a fishy smell down there you know all like maybe using antibiotics those antibiotics we get from the pharmacist or the hospitals those antibiotics have side effects so rather than taking antibiotics or moving around with a bad smell I'd rather smell garlic only for five days in man so I would rather move around with it smell of garlic when I'm very sure that after five days I'm going to be smelling fresh and clear with a glowing skin and health hair because as I told you garlic promotes hair growth it avoids hair loss and it from it gives you a glowing skin so after cutting these into small pieces you can put a little bit of honey like this and you can show this is the head method even this one is a use makin to use you make it and then and you and you use you can't keep this for five days no you make you take the next morning you're going to make and take and up to five days but for this one you can keep it for five days when it when it is in your refrigerator okay this method is for those people who don't have who don't have fridge or those people who don't want to use refrigerator do things so this method works better or the other first method of chewing but as I told you that method of chewing guys it it needs strong people if you notice wrong person please use this method or this method but please note that after cautioning knowledge you need to take a glass of water and after that like thirty minutes please don't forget to have your break fast yes cuz garlic is strong we all know that garlic is strong so please take water and after thirty minutes please go ahead and have you break first for so that garlic will be easily absorbed okay guys that's it for today thanks for tuning in please kindly go ahead and subscribe if you've not yet subscribed channel notifications so that what you

left to do if there is a date or an important business meeting pending time to face the music dental hygiene is important but brushing your teeth twice a day and chewing gum may not be enough even after such daily routine you may still have bad breath but wait no need to panic just yet there are scientifically proven cases of what may be the reasons behind bad breath let's find the root of the problem we at bright side have done some research and put together a list of dental hygiene do's and don'ts perhaps all you need to do is to adjust just one or two of your habits number 15 drink plenty of water water is never a bad idea a sufficient amount of water stimulates the flow of your saliva and helps to avoid dehydration which is often a reason for halitosis that's how scientists call bad breath here is some simple and unusual advice make it a habit to have a few sips of water every time someone calls your name at school or work number 14 don't drink too much coffee coffee this liquid of life we know that a sip of it seems vitally important in the morning but don't be too keen on this drink did you know that caffeine could slow down saliva production and therefore dry out your mouth this will lead to that breath odor it's better to drink a cup of tea during your lunch and dinner one more piece of advice for spicy food lovers sipping green tea can also help to neutralize the scent of garlic no more tough choices between enjoying your favorite dish or an embarrassment free talk with the boss number thirteen clean your dentures cheering for your dentures is as important as caring for your teeth so you should treat them accordingly practice the same or a hygiene that you would with your original teeth make the habit of cleaning them at night to get rid of bacterial build-up from food number 12 remember to floss after every meal this is dental floss yeah you should neglect your gums any food particles would stay in between your teeth for too long a time acted in the same way as if you left your trash beautiful they stink the bacteria from food go deep below the gum line and may lead not only to bad breath but also to an infection that's why flossing is no less important than brushing your teeth what is more that helps to remove the plaque which potentially leads to the decay of your teeth and the disease of your gums besides it's not a big deal just a couple of minutes but the result is worth the time you spend on this process number eleven change your toothbrush every three months time flies when we are busy and we may not notice how quickly our toothbrush gets old an old toothbrush may be as unsafe to use as simply having more bacteria to your mouth so change your toothbrush regularly do it once every three or four months depending on how frayed the bristles are this time may vary for example if you wear brackets it will happen sooner remember one more essential thing change your toothbrush after a bout of the flu so you don't bring those old germs back to your body number 10 do not neglect your time when you brush your teeth in the morning remember to clean your tongue with the tongue scrape you won't believe it but it has been shown to reduce odor by up to as much as 70% how about this recommendation that can make your life much simpler to kill two birds with one stone you can get a toothbrush with a tongue and cheek cleaner in the back number nine go for alcohol-free mouthwash many brands of Mao threads contain up to 27% of alcohol in their ingredients it dries out your mouth as a result as we have already learned it brings an unpleasant smell after that minty freshness wears off within an hour another danger of mouthwash containing alcohol can appear if it is used by teenagers let's admit it everybody accidentally swallows a bit or more of this liquid from time to time but for schoolchildren it's not only unpleasant but also unhealthy so next time you shop for mouthwash and check the label thoroughly to make sure alcohol is not listed by the way pay attention to the fact that mouthwash containing chlorhexidine may also stain your teeth number eight avoid Sugarman's sugar is normally added to the mints people are so eager to take after a meal you do so to freshen your breath and you think that you've done the right thing but unfortunately the situation is quite the contrary sugar in these mints is exactly what helps the bacteria in your mouth to grow an acid informed as a result is proved to eat away your teeth surface how terrible is that it might also make your bad breath worse once the gum or mint is gone thus we can conclude that sweetened fresheners are not for the long-run and are better off left out of your mouth if you must use mints opt for the sugar-free type number seven be aware of the medication you are taking this is your mr. chance after this there is no time such medications as antidepressants painkillers and antihistamines may suppress saliva flow and can be the reason for a so remember to ask your doctor about the side effects of any prescribed medications number six check for tonsil stones if you are not aware tonsil stones are a mix of debris and bacteria that sit in the back of the throat they look like white spots or bumps and smell nasty might have never heard of them but in fact they are pretty common for example research conducted in France has shown that more than 6% of all the examined patients suffered from this problem and that's a lot to prevent them from happening make sure you follow a proper hygiene routine and visit your dentist regularly if you've gotten to know that you already have them your further course of actions will depend on the size of the stones salted water gargling using cotton swabs drinking lemon juice or eating raw garlic can help with small tonsil stones however if they are big there's nothing to do but rely on medically treatment number-5 knott your scales is getting fatter we can't stop another risk factor for halitosis is obesity Tel Aviv University researchers have published a study that has found a direct link between being overweight and having bad breath the more obese you are the more likely your breath will not be as pleasant as you'd like what is the connection it probably depends on the diet of people with excess weight it may promote dry mouth condition number four would say no to a low-carb diet you're any thinner you wouldn't exist those who are keen on Atkins and low carb diets will recognize the word ketosis this is a process which forces the body to burn stored fats and proteins for energy due to the lack of carbs the thing is that if your diet is too strict your body will start to produce such chemicals as ketones they are released in your breasts and exactly this process causes odor so just to sweeten the pill if your breath stinks while you are following the Atkins diet you're probably doing it very well were three we consider your smoking habit all the sources of mass media keep telling everybody who's ready to listen but smoking causes cancer and fatally damages the lungs but this danger seems vague and distant is so not every person is ready to give up a cigarette with a cup of morning coffee what if the problem caused by smoking is more tangible did you know that it can result in damaged gums stains on the teeth and bad breath smoking dries out your mouth while nicotine tends to squeeze blood vessels as a result you don't receive a healthy amount of saliva it's not too difficult to quit this habit with a bit of extra incentive try using nicotine patches at first or visit your doctor to ask for their recommendations the hardest is to start number two eat more apples and other healthy food when you crunch celery apples carrots or similar food it removes the remains of food stock between the teeth what is more it rids them of bacteria that live on them more benefit is the fact that these products are very low in calories and rich in vitamins so you can eat as much as you wish and not worry about gaining a couple of extra pounds number one visit your doctor if you have tried everything followed all the recommendations but bad breath still bothers you probably it's time to visit the doctor your condition might be caused by some illness for example a problem with the stomach do you follow all these recommendations or maybe you have some advice of your own share your ideas and opinions in the comments below don't forget to like this video if it gathers 50,000 likes

it but my girlfriend does a fantastic job and letting me know that I do in order to figure out how to squash morning breath let's talk about what causes it during the daylight hours bacteria in your mouth are hard at work breaking down proteins amino acids and even that piece of broccoli no one told you about that's been lingering in your smile oh that's lunch thanks Jim this chemical process of breaking down food in the mouth produces foul-smelling volatile sulfur compounds or BSC s for short one of these sulfur compounds is actually hydrogen sulfide the same chemical that makes farts smell so bad so in a way morning breath is kind of like breathing Park Zoo during the waking hours our saliva washes away these vsc producing bacteria before they can create this sulfur smelling havoc however when night falls the bad breath boogeyman comes out as our saliva production slows down this nighttime dry mouth creates the perfect environment for the VSC causing bacteria I didn't whoa yeah now that these bacteria have been manufacturing wretch and smelling compounds all night when you open your mouth say - yes they're toxic masterpiece is unleashed as morning breath so how does one get rid of these bad breath bacteria well drinking water before bed will help physically wash them away while brushing your teeth will reduce the amount of food particles the bacteria can feast on but truthfully so wouldn't lie to you guys there is nothing you can do sorry there's actually nothing you can do you'll always have morning breath but the best remedy for morning breath is to simply not open your dirty mouth until you can brush your teeth and if you're not sure if you have rank morning breath just lick your wrist and take a whiff get the vsi's will spread over your skin allowing you to test the level of your own putrid mouth odor you disgusting individual you and you know well this could come in handy if let's say you're waking up in someone's bed who you might not know maybe

how people have reacted towards me like pulling away making comments behind my back and I feel really embarrassed like I don't want to open my mouth and speak I tried to talk him off like this close or with my hands over my mouth mysteriously she has magnificent molars so why is she here so how can I help me today what's your what's your problem well being suffering with bad breath how would you feel the bad that's been going on for it's been going on for years when you're brushing or flossing do you still find you get any bleeding of the gums yes I've noticed like a lot lately especially my lower and the top when I floss cleaning my tongue and would please a lot because I would literally be scraping with the tongue [Music] stick your tongue right out for me you do have slightly increased but pity which is the little sort of hairy bits on the tongue there I think some of the white this is almost a sign of the trauma that you've been doing to the time there was a little bit of gentle tongue scraping is okay I think you've probably going over the top a little bit just because you're worried about you know the bad breath jessica has been blaming her tone for her bad breath but in many cases tummies can be great health indicators a pink slap shiny tongue can indicate iron deficiency black and hairy can be an overgrowth of bacteria and a white cheesecake covering can be a sign of oral thrush so if you're worried don't bite your tongue bring it up with your dentist so if it's not the tongue what is it bad breath can be a symptom of something far more serious keeping really nice and still but James works as Detective magic and the answer is Elementary I think the really great thing is that overall your mouth looks to be in good health now when we were probing around the gums we've got some that bleeding that's a definite sign of information and before we think about any other causes for your bad breath I want to eliminate that as a possibility first of all Jessica goes to a dental hygienist whose tools will get to the parts most toothbrushes cannot reach Jessica's swollen gums have created pockets in which tartar and plaque have moved in 70% of us do not brush your teeth for a full two minutes so are more likely to have the same unwelcome bacteria who come in make themselves at home eat our food and then defecate in our mouths this in effect is the classic bad breath smell three weeks later she's back to see James [Applause] what would you know something let's see how how healthy the guns look from a purely observational point of view but that's what I want to do is just have a little feel around the guns with our probe and just see really if we can the stimulated bleeding or anything like that just with gentle probing compared to when I first saw you when I was doing a little probing when your guns there's a marked improvement in in how much being rich there's a lot less so it's a case of regular hygiene is keeping the plaque away keeping the bacteria away in your mouths can become more and more healthy I think you're gonna feel more and more confident my house or going my confidence has improved but I do need to keep coming to see the team and then hopefully we'll get to a hundred percent by breath can be caused by systemic problems such as liver kidney or lung infections but the main cause of bad breath in 99% of cases is gonna be gum disease so don't let bacteria use your mouth as a loo always brush twice a day for two minutes top tips parsley can take away the smell of bad breath and sugar-free chewing gum can stimulate saliva a moist mouth is less smelly than a dry one bad breath or halitosis as it's known affects 95% of people at some point in their lives the causes can be due to underlying health problems like sinusitis diabetes and gum disease where the most common factors are poor oral hygiene smoking and certain water interesting foods do either of you handsome students suffer from bad breath hangover pretty bad in the morning in the morning I've got a little test here if you rub on the back of your tongue that's where you get most of the bacteria that cause your breath to be a bit pong eek that's invaluable we are used to that stakes a coffee bad breath is caused by bacteria that live in the mouth and feed off the white sticky plaque and bits of food that build up daily on the tongue teeth gums and back of the throat if the mouth is left uncleaned for more than 12 hours the bacteria start to produce a gas called sulfur and it's this that causes the breath to smell if you're not unhealthy diet is the most common cause of that sulfur stench so what foods should you avoid if you want to keep your breath fresh well doctor pixie has enlisted the help of a bunch of Bristolian hairdressers who get up close and personal with clients every day they've agreed to help find out which foods give off the worst whiff so they've come to meet medical microbiologist and trained oral judge dr. Sally Hoffs and so if anyone's gonna tell you you've got bad breath this is the lady to do it they're all starting off with clean odorless breath and to see what type of food causes the worst stench our hairdresser's will be consuming different types of lunches all well known for harboring a hum first up is Louise with an egg and onion sandwich CD's going for garlic bread Shawn is chomping a chicken curry sarni Matt's on tangy tuna and Mitchell's having the no time for lunch lunch of coffee and cigarettes I will ask you to pop your head back open your mouth as wide as possible one I'll take this name dr. Saad uses two methods to test for bad breath firstly a good sniff with her expert sense of smell and to get an exact measure of the sulfur levels dr. sad uses a special piece of equipment called a hollow meter and with all the information analyzed port has created the biggest stink Zeus ad your sniff reading was very very high it was the highest of everyone and you had garlic bread so our judge thought you personally had the smelliest breath in terms of the machine Mitchell had the strongest odor coming from his breath and Mitchell had for his lunch cigarettes a coffee [Music] fifteen-year-old Maxine has been keeping tight-lipped about her embarrassing breath problems so she's in the clinic to see dr. Pixy people have said to me that smells at you that really stinks and it's just really upsetting because I can't help it hello have you succeed nice to meet you pixie now then ladies what can I do for you today and I've got a problem of my tonsils I've got really bad deep craters in them and this gets food stuck in them okay and how did this start Maxine um I was looking in the mirror and I horned and I could just see these things in the back of my mouth and I started panicking and I went to mum and she thought it was teeth okay it looked horrible and we went the doctors the next day and they said it was tonsil stones okay so he said to just leave them and let them fall out I went against his advice and picked them out and not sort of been doing ever since and how else does it bother you and I get really bad breath for there do you yeah so let's have a little good say a big oh now you've got big tonsils and you've got big pits you've got big craters in their holes dense nooks and crannies in which all sorts of food particles are gonna get stuck your tonsils are part of your immune system and they act like innate to filter out viruses and bacteria sometimes food mucus and bacteria can get trapped in them and this can calcify to cause tonsil stones these appear is why spots on your tonsils and can leave you with bad breath she's she doesn't snow book she'd be flying with their mouths open making a funny noise like just ripple a bit scary she's asleep doesn't surprise me when you're lying down at night these tonsils are obstructing and therefore you're breathing predominantly through your mouth new saliva dries up that causes bad breath their food that sits in these craters putrified and bacteria excretes and create gas and it's just manky really only your way to get rid of the problem is to get rid of the tonsils so let's get you to meet someone who can discuss what's involved and getting rid of these tonsils that's pretty all right [Music] staggering sixty-three percent of Cambridge men and 46 percent of Cambridge women see their partners of halitosis you know anyone with really bad breath ex-girlfriend Beckham I don't know that that's time we told you have bad breath cleaning your teeth yes actually bad breath can be caused by respiratory disease liver kidney or stomach problems but more often than not the cause is dental bacteria live inside a slimy white film called plaque eating up bits of old food what these bacteria eat they excrete and it's these gases that cause the terrible smell only regular flossing brushing and visits to your dentist can completely prevent this from happening but with so few of us making regular visits to the dentist we've brought the dentist to the people together with bad breath expert dr. Phil stammer it's not possible to smell your own breath but there are a couple of tests you can try yourself to see if your breath is something to be embarrassed about the first test is this commercially available bad breath detector now it's not overly scientific but it does claim to be able to detect those nasty gases [Music] you're halfway across that sort of borderline bad breath that is how'd you feel about those two brilliant an even simpler test involves taking a few scrapings from the back of the tongue and having a good whiff or getting a friend to do it I wouldn't be living in that smell anything but Wendy what have you done so it's going crazy well it is showing it's saying you know that's good that's really bad and you're halfway so do you want to come with me to the fresh breath today yes we're gonna hang for you yeah what makes you think you've got halitosis I can feel it feels wrong in my mouth and friends and family have also pointed it out to me what if I go and they said what exactly have they said I've got dog breath doctor stammer has a more expensive and scientific version of dr. Christians mobile breath tester but he in his nurse of something even more sophisticated their noses five one two three four five finally they've come up with a bad breath score one for all clear five for horrendous halitosis okay this four is three out of five you definitely have a noticeable problem with bad breath I get no comfort in the fact that my school was only about three out of five because it was still three out of five it's helpful to know what the cause of the bad breath is and I'm hoping to get some treatment for it now [Music] when you have an embarrassing illness it's best to talk about it for 20 year old Sierra Barrett that's when the problem comes out more it's about my breath it's very bad really you're aware of it what other people are aware of it sometimes I'm not aware of it ex-boyfriends they'll keep offering me chew gum I make a joke of it now personally what I think we should do is actually get you to use a tongue scraper and send a swab off to the lab and just see whether we can grow anything most of us have experienced bad breath in the morning halitosis however is caused by an excess of bacteria in the mouth that no amount of teeth cleaning will remove permanently super microbiologist boul Edward Jones has been running tests to get to the bottom of Sierra's bad breath with some shocking results some man colonies of Sarah's play it's this smell brought tests no wonder she's having problems she's going to have to be treated for this [Music] a few days later Santa's back at the clinic hoping the results will provide a breath of fresh air I think I've got some good news for you what the swab results has shown is that you've got an overgrowth of a normal bacteria in your mouth okay something called an anaerobic what we call the normal flora that keep your mouth healthy and keep everything else in balance but in some people and under certain circumstances those some of those normal bugs can get a little bit over prolific and then they can cause symptoms such as bad breath we're never going to get rid of them completely they are supposed to be there but I think what we should do is give you a week's course of antibiotic just to dump them down a bit get them back under control okay and that should do the trick okay great thank you and after failing doctor stammers breath test Wendy's visiting his clinic in London to find a solution to her long-standing odorous problem I think I've had a followed my breath since I was in my early teens so being here today and seeing the expert it'll be nice if it actually makes a big difference I just want to get in there and see what he says and see what you can do for me and I hope if we walk out of here with a fresh breath it doesn't take long for dr. stammer to find the cause it's that all problem gum disease if you've ever wondered what bad breath looks like you're about to find out okay those are your bacteria and if you see the large spiraling ones over there they're called spirochetes and they only arrive in the plaque when the Clarkes 10 to 14 days old so it means that some of the areas in your mouth you're actually missing with a brush on a regular basis absolutely horrible these creepy-crawlies have made such a comfortable home in Wendy's mouth that she needs to call in the bailiffs bacterial eviction specialist Mary coxton to open way there early first she needs to find exactly where the colonies are she does this by applying a special mouth die won't give you this mirror to look at there so anything that is pink or blues bad news the darker is so see this sort of quite dark blue and sort of purpley blue these are bits that you miss on a regular basis you probably don't brush them very often right next the ultra sonic blaster using the die as a target Mary blows away the worst of the problem [Music] it's good I'm really glad it's been done I'm a little bit sore now but they've done some real good stuff them they've taught me better ways of brushing my teeth and things I thought I was doing a good job before but obviously not say yeah hopefully it won't be long so I've got fresh breath you", "Z-s-HI4su6I": "[Music] bad breath is

Suresh Babu senior consultant ent head and neck surgeon working with the Apollo Hospital [Music] a foul odor and bad taste in the mouth along with the dryness commonly happens when the person breathes through the mouth predominantly especially in sleep that means the person is already having a bit of nasal block day times this nasal block may not be very significant but in the night when there is a lot more oxygen demand then automatically the mouth opens up allowing a much more air to come in and oxygen to be delivered to the body and this movement the movement of air in the mouth and throat region dries up the mouth and throat very easy so the dryness leads to the nerve endings being disturbed where they don't function as well as well moist normal skin right this leads to a bit of bad taste some burning sensation all these symptoms and scratchy sensation in the throat leading to some hacking or caring the throat regularly cough and all these things wait a foul smell inside the nose if the person perceives a foul smell inside the nose along with these symptoms then it definitely has to be investigated where you have to look at the origin of the fall smelt most probably some sinus blocks some pus formation somewhere and has to be looked at and created it appropriately and if you treat the cause of the fall smell most of the times the nose also opens up the person goes back to proper nose breathing regularly and all the dryness in the throat bad taste for smell all this way disappear you [Music]", "oNLIiSeVWqA": "everyone Stephanie Stewart here from original eating today I wanted to give you some tips on how to get the garlic smell out of your hands whenever you're chopping garlic so this is like one of the things that's always bugged me and you're chopping away you're trying to be healthy and make a nice meal and even though you wash your hands with soap and water this smell lingers nica's the snow and it just gets on your nerves so I have three tips here for how to get the smell out of your fingers the first one I actually did this one a lot and that is you rub your hands along the surface of stainless steel I actually use the knife that I chop with and of course avoid the blade duh but I have to say that because you know internet but so I also use like the inside of the sink or the faucet whatever you have that is stainless steel that's the first thing I do because after you're washing hands soap and water it's so easy just kind of rub your fingertips because really that's all that's touched is the fingertips so just rub your fingertips real good along any stainless steel surface if that doesn't work for you if you're just not interested you can also use coffee grinds so you you get a couple coffee grinds and you rub your hands in it real good and then rinse off and kind of treat yourself to a little spa treatment there real quick some exfoliation from the coffee grinds if you don't have coffee or you don't want to do that you can also use a little bit of lemon and some salt same thing just kind of rub it along your hand and rinse and go and you're done and and that smell will be gone and I hope this has been helpful to you if it has please consider sharing this video and never know it who is walking around smelling like garlic and if you haven't already hop on over to my website original eating calm sign up for my newsletter there I also have lots of free tips and tricks that are available and they're available nowhere else so just go on over to the website and always seeing you soon", "CkAMrjM9Yqg": "[Music] hey you guys it's carolyn from homesteading family and i have a great homesteading hack for you guys today have you ever gotten a jar from a thrift store or from a friend or maybe you've gone to the grocery store and gotten a jar of pickles because you wanted to use the jar itself but then when you open it up and you think hey maybe i want to store my dried prunes in here or some drying to apples or something in there and it smells like garlic or vinegar or pickles and you can't get the smell out no matter how much you've washed it i'm gonna show you how to do it really easily today now i just brought this jar home from a friend's place who does not do food preservation and i it definitely smells like garlic i don't know what was in here before but it was something that was really garlicky this is so easy guys all you're gonna do is you're gonna take about a tablespoon of dry mustard yes that is dry mustard powder now if all you have is like a prepared american yellow mustard in your fridge you can use that too you probably want about a quarter cup of that and i'm gonna put this in the jar now don't worry this is not gonna end up taking away the pickle flavor or smell but leaving the mustard flavor it all comes out after this and i'm gonna top this with boiling water now you can see i mean I need a second kettle full but this is all that you do you're gonna fill it all the way up you're gonna close it down you're gonna give it a shake every so often a couple times a day and you're gonna let this sit for about three days now jars that are really bad may possibly need more time than that and it may even need a second dose but you're gonna be amazed at how well this takes it out so you're just gonna dump this out wash it with hot soapy water and give it the smell test see what you think take care of you guys goodbye [Music]", "Nvphu7OO2iM": "[Music] today we will introduce a topic related to mouth odor when you eat things that contain strong scented ingredients such as garlic or onion you often worry about having stinky breath afterward stinky breath that doesn't go away even after brushing your teeth you don't just get that because you've eaten strong scented foods today i'll talk about mouth odor or bad breath that you don't know even know you have first let's check why sometimes you get bad breath the smell from the mouth is called halitosis or mouth odor and it's more likely to occur when you either eat strong scented foods smoke frequently drink coffee or you have poor oral hygiene management and people who don't get regular teeth cleaning can also develop bad breath also people who have diabetes sinusitis rhinitis or have a bad stomach can easily get bad breath if you look at the cause of bad breath as a percentage about 10 to 20 percent of bad breath is caused by digestive or systemic diseases and the rest is often caused by oral causes such as tooth decay gum disease and tongue do i also have bad breath let's start with a simple test [Music] one with one hand covering your nose and mouth exhale deeply and smell the breath you can also smell it when you exhale into a paper cup or bag two apply saliva on the back of your hand and smell it when it's dry three scratch the inside of your tongue with a teaspoon and smell the spoon if you're not sure about this one way to do this is to carefully ask your closest friend or family after brushing your teeth check if you develop bad breath without eating any other foods it may be a little embarrassing but it is said that the most accurate way to know if you have bad breath is to ask the people around you how can i get rid of mouth odor if food is not washed down properly and gets stuck between your teeth or tongue it breaks down and causes a bad smell so it's very important to drink water often in fact people with dry mouth often develop bad breath drink water frequently so that your mouth does not get dry if you smoke you should consider quitting smoking people who often drink alcohol are also advised to refrain from drinking as it can cause dry mouth if you have bad breath even though you brushed your teeth thoroughly after eating make sure that you wipe between your teeth and back of your teeth as well and also wipe the tongue while brushing your teeth after brushing your teeth rinse thoroughly several times so that no toothpaste remains in your mouth having your teeth cleaned regularly by the dentist can also help relieve mouth odor if you don't have prosthesis tooth decay or inflammation but still have bad breath you should get a checkup and medical diagnosis check your mouth odor with a simple diagnosis and if you have symptoms treat it as soon as possible to get rid of your stinky breath you", "Wwp7gl5CQdE": "dr.

Cindy Roark with coast dental", "qwlpeRtp70M": "(upbeat music) - Hey there, this is Brain Stuff, and I'm Josh Clark, and\nthis is the Brain Stuff where I explain to you\nwhat morning breath is. Pretty much all bad breath and all odors from all humans come from a\ncouple of different things, eating and being sick. Some of the foods we eat\nare actually pungent enough to make it through\ndigestion and be absorbed into the bloodstream\nand then into the lungs, and ultimately exhaled. Think of onions and garlic. But there's one thing that\ncan give you bad breath, systemic conditions like diabetes or a lower respiratory tract infection can also give you bad breath, and particles of food\nthat get trapped between your gums and your teeth can give you pretty bad breath as well. At the root of all this,\nthough, is bacteria. Whether it's from breaking\ndown food in our guts or breaking down food\nparticles in our teeth, or warding off an infection, bacteria can create\nreally, really big smells. As bacteria go to work\nbreaking down proteins, amino acids, and all biological material that they ferment as food, they produce waste products called Volatile Sulfur Compounds, or VSCs. VSCs are composed of things\nlike hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, and dimethyl sulfide, all of which pack terrible smells. And when they combine together into a super smell, stand back. But why is all this so\nmuch worse in the morning? Which is to say, what's the\ndeal with morning breath? The answer, it turns out, is dry mouth. When you sleep, you\nproduce much less saliva than you do normally,\nlike when you're awake, and saliva combats bad breath two ways. One, it simply washes away food particles giving bacteria less food\nto eat and break down and turn smelly, and also, using oxygen, it combats the number of\nbacteria present in your mouth. Both of those things together\ncreate a one-two punch that keeps you from smelling all the time. When it's dry, though,\nthese particles hang around and give you terrible,\nterrible morning breath. Now, don't be alarmed,\nmorning breath is normal, but there are some measures you can take to mellow out your morning breath. For example, you can brush\nand floss like a normal human being before going to bed. You can also just drink a\nglass of water before bedtime. It'll help wash out\nany nastiness in there. And, would it kill to brush\nyour teeth first thing in the morning? I don't think so. So, tell us, do you get\nterrible morning breath? Is it worse than average?

uncomfortable down there so this recipe is to cleanse you up so everything clears out of your system that area is so clean dry and smells so fresh and voila this is it you want to do this once every month to make sure that area is always clean so you don't experience that smell and you are free from bacteria infections and the rest so you make it and drink all at once once every morning and share this video with your friends your girlfriends even your brothers so they can share with your girlfriends so we can all smell so fresh and and equally do not forget to click the red subscribe button to subscribe to this channel if you haven't yet so you don't miss any of my uploads you get to watch them on time and yeah so let me take you and show you how to come up with yours yourself and voila so in order to come up with a cleansing recipe or cleansing juice we will be using mostly natural foods or ingredients containing antibacterial properties in them and the first choice will be onion for today we'll be using half and onion so what you need is just half an onion divide your onions into two portions and you need just half of it so i'm storing the remaining onions are very good as they contain large amounts of natural antibiotics anti-microbial antiviral properties to actually cleanse any bacteria from your system germs toxins culturing is causing that foul smell down there so this is to cleanse you so you don't end up with the bacterias causing the unpleasant smell in the first place so you can stay so clean and fresh so what you want to do is to get your onion washed totally because washing this time is very important i'm re-washing after slicing and this is my clean washed ingredients you want to always wash because you want to avoid putting in other dirt in your system yeah so what we want to do now is to put your ingredients in your blender so i will be adding in two more ingredients but this is the first onions are so good even you can throw them around your house to actually capture and kill any bacterias in your house as well that is something i learned from an expert so voila that is the first ingredient the second ingredient you'll be will be adding in here will be garlic garlic by now if you've been watching my videos you know i can swear to garlic because it has so many benefits it clears all bacterias that intend leave your system so clean free from diseases all types of illnesses lowers blood pressure it is a very powerful antibiotic it has antibiotic properties antimicrobial properties to actually cleanse your system of bacterias and germs toxins causing you even sick that culturing to form all the bacterial infections in your system different ways that some even get into your tubes and cause kidney infection consuming this is like preventing infections of your liver your kidney and even all that infection down there the bacteria infection causing that unpleasant house meal so this has a lot to do to your system garlic is a very superfood so what we need is just two cloves of garlic as you can see i'm using just two cloves of garlic you want to wash correctly slice into tiny sizes that you can easily blend so i am adding it in the first ingredient the onion i've added my two inches my two cloves of garlic so now it can be very difficult trust me to just consume garlic and an onion and they are the main ingredients pineapple two has antimicrobial properties antibacterial properties but i will not be using pineapple today so another option is pineapple so for taste and to calm down that taste of garlic and onion but i will be using orange today you can use pineapple if you have pineapple at home you can add in pineapple in it but i'll be adding orange to bring down the it can be so strong garlic and onion you need something to calm them down so there is a chemistry between these three ingredients in here so i have a reason adding this so you can feel comfortable eating while putting in those antibacterials in your system but not just like eating them raw i can eat ginger garlic raw but combining garlic and onion can be a little bit challenging so i add in my orange so it comes down the strength of the two so i'll blend this onion and garlic before i add the orange juice so just watch the recipe this is the fiber from the orange that i'm adding in my onion and garlic to blend so i'll add water to get directly above the ingredients that is a cup of water that is one cup of water i added in there it is directly above my ingredients and i blend blend blend you want to blend to get a very smooth paste or consistency that you are really sure the ingredients are really like smooth so you you can get the best out of it because i'm going to strain this out what we need is juice so you want to blend to be really smooth so you don't throw out a lot of fiber that could produce some a lot of juice for you so yeah this is it i'll be using um this cup and a kind of sieve to extract the juice from the fiber so i don't need the fiber in here what i need is the juice for instant consumption it's not you can make it in the night and consume the next day in the morning but store in your refrigerator if you're busy to go to work you can do it at night consume on an empty stomach first thing in the morning so your system is really empty and clean so it penetrates all those organs without any food or anything interrupting the journey of this cleansing juice or bacteria antibacterial juice so you want to consume it on an empty stomach first thing in the morning so nothing interrupts yeah so i am adding in the orange now the orange juice from one orange ice squeezed out at the beginning you want to mix mix mix that orange juice now has actually taken down a little bit of the strength of the garlic and the ginger and the garlic and the onion so but not no water has been added in again to like bring the this is really very effective and it tastes so good you can make in the evening as i mentioned cover it in your cup store in your refrigerator and consume first thing in the morning on an empty stomach i don't want you to consume in the evening because you must have eaten other things so the best time to consume is on an empty stomach so nothing interrupts it gets into your organs and cleanses out all those bacterias and germs from your system so you can be healthy and smell fresh and clean without your partner complaining so yeah i hope someone found this video helpful don't forget to share with your family and friends so we can all stay healthy and

if you are not scared you can actually use it to wash up with it but i prefer putting it in hot water and sitting on top of it they are all the same they will all clean out the bath smell from you but i prefer the steaming method that way i don't just add baking soda i add in my garlic i add in some other ingredients in that water to actually really cleanse me and i think i've shared that with you

Colgate Total remains totally fresh Colgate Total fights bad breath to help you achieve whole mouth health [Music]", "YCp3bZXQu_s": "[Music] gentlemen have you ever met somebody you start talking to them and all of the sudden you smell something first you think that it's possible you stepped in a fresh pile of dog crap you casually glanced down at your shoes nope it's clean that's what it hits you literally hits you in the face horrible disgusting horrendous halitosis aka bad breath everybody knows that guy or that girl who's got a horrible breath and you think to yourself you're like oh my god it smells like you ate a [ __ ] burger for lunch do you not taste anything funky the answer is no they don't because the reality is that most people that have bad breath have no idea they do gentlemen today we're taking the banned breath test we're also going over the five most common reasons for bad breath and how exactly right to stop it I'm gonna take the bad breath test there are three different tests you can take option number one is to ask a friend or family member simply go up to them breathe in their face and say excuse me I'm trying to decide whether or not my breath thinks the problem with this test is that it is flawed for the reason that they love you and they don't want to hurt your feelings we're going to test number two take your wrist as long as you don't have any Cologne smell it should smell like skin right then what you're gonna do is lick a really good lick from the back of your tongue on your wrist ready like that let it dry and then sniff now the lick test is more accurate than asking a friend but it's not as accurate as the third test aka the spoon test take a spoon drag it from the back of your tongue to the front being careful not to gag let dry and sniff the good news is that if you scrape your tongue and you don't have a bunch of funkiness going on chances are you're probably good but there are some other things that could be happening with you your body and your mouth that could be causing you to have bad breath so now let's talk about why so the first reason most people have bad breath and don't even know it is because they don't take of their tongue your mouth is the perfect breeding ground for a nasty odor causing bacteria right your tongue is like lays like ground zero right the reason is because your mouth is dark it's damp it's hot you've had food and bacteria I brushed my tongue twice a day after I'm done brushing my teeth I simply go as far back as possible and I give my tongue the business and this works but there are some people don't want to take their tongue clean game to the next level there are tongue scrapers there are also things like the Orabrush out there to keep your tongue bacteria free but your tongue is only a part of the problem the second reason why most people have bad breath is poor oral hygiene you should be flossing every day should also be brushing properly twice a day I personally feel that everybody should invest in a electric toothbrush so here's the deal I've used to be an old-school manual toothbrush kind of guy until I went to the dentist about two years ago he's like yo dude what are you doing to yourself I'm like what are you talking about he goes why are you using an electric toothbrush I go was it really that much different he explained to me that on average you brush or you brush your teeth with a manual toothbrush about 300 strokes or brushes per minute this thing 40,000 another issue with manual toothbrushes is that a lot of times when you use them you're actually doing damage to your gums because you're pressing too hard and being too forceful but with an electric toothbrush instead of getting all forceful and crazy you let the brush do the work right you put it in your mouth and then you systematically and strategically move it around you're super sexy grill now the deal is if you are looking for an incredible toothbrush you got to check out the new elements sonic toothbrush by our boys in today's video sponsor dazzle pro so I consider myself an electric toothbrush aficionado I've tried a bunch over the years but this thing I'm

shuts off you know that you're done one of the issues that I have and most people have with manual brushes is a right here you're right 30 seconds later you're spinning your rinse and you're done not

pro for an insane ridiculous alpha M exclusive price that price also includes for us shipping which is incredible the element sonic toothbrush boy dazzle pro in my opinion is the best bang for your toothbrushing buck guys link below discount code get you one flossing your brushing properly the third element to oral hygiene that I would recommend is actually using a mouthwash mouthwash kills odor causing bacteria it helps control tartar and it fights gingivitis like a ninja a third reason your breath may stink is that your mouth is dry have you ever had cottonmouth right and you know like that taste right it gets this taste you know it's not great right well it also stinks guys make sure that your mouth is hydrated right drink plenty of water also if you're somebody who suffers from dry mouth there are mouth washes out there that help replace replenish and hydrate your amazing mouth the fourth reason that people tend to have stinky breath and not even know it has nothing to do with your mouth it is post nasal drip or a sinus infection and acid reflux and last but certainly not least the fifth reason why your breath may smell and you don't even know it is because you're eating certain foods that actually cause breath to stink garlic one of those things for me it's a love-hate relationship I love and everybody around me hates it when I eat it because it comes out right and it doesn't matter how much mints how many mints I take how much gum I chew you still smell garlic don't eat it before you go to an event or you're going on a date or if you're on a date absolutely under no circumstances do you eat it the only work around is if you and your significant other actually have the same food that is the offensive one and then for whatever reason it doesn't seem quite as bad and you can get freaky hot stinky nasty bad breath it happens it happens to the best of us but gentlemen hopefully after this video it happens to them and not you", "iBqLIYzQ6OA": "don't think that living a life of mouthwash four times a day is always going to cure your bad breath if food remains on your teeth because you don't brush and you don't floss that food just sits in your mouth and is degraded by bacteria and you can just imagine the odor that that gives off be sure that when you brush you brush your teeth at night a lot of people don't realize again that when food just sits in your mouth overnight in the morning your breath will be far stronger than you could ever imagine and brush your tongue to bacteria accumulates in the back surface of your tongue and can also cause a strong odor also be sure to drink a lot of water when your mouth becomes more dry you have less saliva and we have less saliva food and bacteria tends to sit in your mouth for a much longer period of time but also remember that there are other things beyond just being thirsty that can make your mouth dry for example coffee alcohol smoking which is never a good idea and even some medications can cause dry mouth if you find that your breath is strong no matter what you do if you find that you're constantly having to youth mouthwash which really often times just camouflages bad odor you may have something else going on then poor hygiene so in that instance it's really important to see your dentist because other things that can't be cured by just brushing flossing and washing what you eat might be going on [Music]", "56f6b8o_1bo": "[Music] Nicole you say that you have a problem with that breath I do it's just I get dry mouth and it's been something dry man teenager yeah a lot of people have this yeah so 50 million Americans suffer from bad breath and people erroneously think that a student not brushing your teeth or due to cavities or gum disease reality actually it is not it's actually due to bacteria that grow way in the back of our tongue and it's called anaerobic bacteria and these bacteria produce what we call volatile sulfur odors these bacteria are actually very similar to the bacteria we have in our intestines believe it or not Wow and as we know that and that bacteria produces order to write so people get this back to here in the back we don't all have it only certain people have actual halitosis have it it creates this terrible odor and people find that it really affects every part their daily life there are treatments now to treat this this bacteria okay because the best way to treat then that's halitosis is not just to brush your teeth more but to actually scrape off and get rid of the bacteria in our mouths and so we're gonna have her use a pro fresh system and that's all this stuff right here so you have to scrape the back of your mouth that's that's right America your tongue so as of your tongue yeah it has two main factors number one you actually do a tongue scraping so you take a device like this you grab your tongue you stick it out as far as you can and scrape the back to get rid of those bacteria that are producing that foul odor gotcha and you can also use a mouth rinse that we have in these cups called chlorine dioxide chlorine dioxide actually will destroy the bacteria as well as get rid of that foul sulfur smells so you have to do both or could you just do the rim you have to do both now the chlorine dioxide very powerful we actually use it in waste treatment plant oh my gosh so if it's strong enough for a waste treatment plant it should be strong enough for bad breath and how often a day would she have to do that once every morning was that enough for it's twice a day you want to start exactly so you want to start we're gonna have or do it here in a second but you want to do that then afterwards brush your teeth wash your teeth brush your tongue brush the other parts of the inside of your mouth as well

should last a few months that's great people are finding that they can see a result very very quickly that's great okay so now the whole limiter here it's gonna give us a number of just how bad her breath is if the number is higher than about forty or fifty it means she has bad breath now I got up to 5:00 a.m. I brushed my teeth this morning but I haven't brushed it since then I tested on myself and I tested forty right so we'll see where she isn't I don't think I have bad breath but I just had a cup of strong coffee I'd blow the thing up all right here we go so go ahead and put it in your mouth and we're gonna watch this number go up right here so we're fourteen nineteen twenty eight forty fifty for seventy to ninety 109 125 139 156 I've never seen us score this high she's right around

quickly okay so you want to rinse with this for 10 seconds so go ahead and just put it in your mouth and you want to just don't drink it just kind of rinse it around and we'll go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and then you want to lean your head back stick your tongue out and gargle with it you're supposed to pretend seconds but for times sake let's go ahead and have you spit it out okay there you go and here's a tongue scraper and now you want to scrape the back of your tongue as far as you can get without gagging yourself or stick your tongue out and you want to scrape it 6 times back to front and then go ahead and rinse it and we'll just have you do one more time for the sake of time here there are you know what are getting back then you can see here the longer is all that back to you the more you do this the easier it will get a solution right back away and one more appreciated everything this is this allow wash products toothpaste I have to constantly to go and eat mints just to it'll fix

Suresh Babu senior consultant ent head and neck surgeon working with the Apollo Hospitals Bangalore whole smelling is usually arising from rotting material mostly organic either dead tissues or mucus or something collected inside the nostrils right so if there is a constant found smell especially which is perceptible to others then we should get that checked there are various reasons for this to happen especially in case of children they have a habit of pushing something into the nostrils like a peanut or something like a small rubber piece anything like that that can sit inside the nose create a reaction around it and if it is an organic material like plant the same seed then it will also rot along with the mucus collected around it and that will start giving that fall smell and there will be a profuse nasal discharge mr. myko coolant plus discharge from the nose only on one side this should alert the parents that there is something inside the nostrils and with the baby to the doctor get it check to get the nasal cavity examined thoroughly and whatever the funding material is there should be removed from there and a proper internal treatment administered there is a case of adult it is probably you know which is indigenous it is come inside the nose for some reason the mucus is becoming very thick and stagnant rather than like the usual one which moves backwards and gets swallowed as a routine if there is a problem in the mobility of the mucus or the consistency of the mucus again it starts getting collected inside the nose and that would cause their smelly there are other conditions like a tinnitus or a native speaker where again the mucus character changes and the smell comes up the of conditions like a traffic rhinitis the person may not feel the smell because he or she would lose the perception but the others could feel the smell and they alert the patient and bring the patient to the doctor whatever it is it is usually a rotting material like I said before so it has to be clear and you know in case of a long-standing disease the care has to be taken on a long-term and the regular cleaning required you know it's a line or something like that

times a day is always going to cure your bad breath if food remains on your teeth because you don't brush and you don't floss that food just sits in your mouth and is degraded by bacteria and you can just imagine the odor that that gives off be sure that when you brush you brush your teeth at night a lot of people don't realize again that when food just sits in your mouth overnight in the morning your breath will be far stronger than you could ever imagine and brush your tongue to bacteria accumulates in the back surface of your tongue and can also cause strong motor also be sure to drink a lot of water when your mouth becomes more dry you have less saliva we have less saliva food and bacteria tends to sit in your mouth for a much longer period of time but also remember that there are other things beyond just being thirsty that can make your mouth dry for example coffee alcohol smoking which is never a good idea and even some medications can cause dry mouth if you find that your breath is strong no matter what you do if you find that you're constantly having to use mouthwash which really often times just camouflages bad odor you may have something else going on then poor hygiene so in that instance it's really important to see your dentist because other things that can't be cured by just brushing flossing and washing what you eat might be going on", "KrNLYXRiHyw": "whether it's a cracked tooth or just plain old bad breath we've got answers to some of your mouth related questions and here to help us out as cosmetic dentists our friend dr. bill Dorfman welcome thank you so we've got a question from one of our viewers on Instagram it reads my teeth look fine but if I looked up my teeth with a certain light I see that they're cracked what would cause these cracks on my teeth going to end up breaking and falling apart all right so here's the deal they're not cracked what you're seeing are called crazed lines and their superficial they're very very very harmless they're not gonna hurt you at all and they're usually caused just by use and abuse as a kid if you hit your teeth and your traumatize them you'll get these crazed lines or as an adult if you're eating on hard things like ice or biting a pen or even you know biting a pencil or even chewing your nails you're gonna get these crazy lines the thing about it you have to remember they're harmless if they deepen and they actually become cracks they're not harmless and then you have to have them taken care of but just a crazed line I've never had a patient in over 30 years of practicing that's cracked or lost a tooth from a crazed line and if you don't know the difference ask your dentist all right next we got a facebook question from Emily and she says sometimes my 23 month old daughter has bad breath she brushes her teeth with a natural toothpaste but at her age whenever we put toothpaste on she sucks it off and wants more is there anything I can do okay first of all the chances of the bad breath emanating from the teeth and a little kid is probably zero unless they have a lot of cavities so just look in their mouth more likely there are other things number 1 mouth breathing when you open your mouth and your mouth drives out there's a proliferation of bacteria that can cause bad breath chronic sinusitis and then GERD acid reflux so if you have a toddler with bad breath take them to the to figure out what it is now you make such a great point when it comes to kids and bad breath you have to think about certain ear nose and throat problems that can lead to mouth breathing enlarged adenoids tonsils sinusitis like you said the worst things they Lodge stuff in their nose that'll get that creates quite an odor and horrible that's so really if your kid has bad breath take them to the doctor because that's just not normal and when should a kid see the dentist for the first time as soon as they get a tooth okay that's pretty early you only need one right you only need one take care of that one too okay we have another question from Instagram that reads why are my teeth breaking and falling out after I've had my kids am I going to have no teeth by the time I'm 30 I guess this both of I mean alright well here's the thing there's absolutely no medical correlation between pregnancy and losing your teeth there is a condition called pregnancy gingivitis and what happens is because of the huge fluctuation in your hormones you can get bleeding gums puffy gums actually like painful gums so if you have pregnancy gingivitis what I suggest you do is stop the six-month recall and go to a two to three month recall but as soon as you have the baby well and stop breastfeeding that'll go away and then the pregnancy gingivitis typically peaks in the third trimester and something that you can do when you have irritation is you can take you know a cup of water warm water and you can mix in a teaspoon of salt and sometimes that'll help with the irritation a lot but that does not replace a dentist's visit so for sure make sure you're following up with your dentist appropriately pregnancy is not a valid reason not to see your dentist if you're Jackie if your dentist needs to do something then they will contact your ob/gyn and we will make sure that we work together so that we're taking care of you and your baby safely dr.

time again and but those people that know me they know that I absolutely love cooking with garlic garlic has several health benefits but it also makes food very yummy it does have a downside though apart from a present you can have stinky Fred from garlic it is also difficult to get off your hands get off the kitchen counters and things like that now I've done a lot of research about the best ways to get rid of the smell of garlic from anything really and I have tried they've been all sorts of all right scales it could be running a tap and put in a stainless steel utensil on washing your answer then nothing has worked except one thing that's what I want to share with you today salt to simply get some salt and rub your hands together on that a running attack believe me the smell of garlic goes away if you use a chopping board to cut around it rub a lot of salt onto the chopping board misogyny very generously and then rinse off as well it is miraculous and it cost nothing because I assume most of us have sorted out closets so I see absolutely no reason why people using the excuse that garlic sticks should be valid anymore simply use salt salt anywhere when the countertops salts and sink salt and hands and that's it I have heard another one too about mouthwash but that doesn't work sir team salt we're getting rid of garlic smells when hands on your utensils and checking

Lemke you may see the title and you may think that I'm some kind of herbalist or nutritionist but no I'm not I'm just a regular guy who has interest in health and wellness I was doing some research and I want to explain some of the findings about garlic and thyme so first of all garlic garlic is one of those food that is like a very well-known in different civilizations in different cultures there are scriptures that are talking about garlic 1500 BC in Egyptian civilization and explaining all the benefits about garlic but I remember my my grandmother she used to say if people knew how healthy garlic is they wouldn't skip a day without garlic but besides a wisdom of my grandmother there are a lot of studies in a lot of research how beneficial garlic is so garlic helps keep the blood pressure under control it is a great cardiovascular supplement garlic is also anti-inflammatory so when you have inflammation just take garlic and garlic has these three C's so garlic has vitamin C a lot of copper and also calcium so it's great for bones another healthy herb that I would like to talk to you about is called time this is time and I love time number one for its smell it smells really really nice and it's a great ingredient for cooking for food and so on but it has many benefits for our health and one of the benefits is that it improves circulation in our body so it's a great cardiovascular herb it's also great to treat respiratory issues so for people who have asthma for people who have bronchitis and seasonal allergies thyme is excellent for that time is also very powerful antioxidant and it contains vitamin A it contains vitamin C and a lot of iron so for anybody who is low iron then time would be a great herb to take on regular basis one of the biggest problems with garlic is that people don't like to take garlic because of the smell because of the odor even if you take it day before you will still sort of feel it tomorrow so a lot of people are avoiding that especially in a customer service or in their meeting with clients it's hard to control that order from from the coming from the mouth and that's that's the one of the number one reasons that people don't take garlic at all I understand that a lot of people don't take garlic because of the smell but there is a great solution by a company that is called Forever Living Products company that created a special supplement that is called forever garlic thyme and it looks like this it comes in a bottle like this supplements or it contains soft gels inside that pretty much look like this and these are the supplements these are the soft gels that contain extracts of garlic and thyme and one of these gels contains one gram of garlic and five of these gels like this are equivalent to one clove of garlic so this supplement is quite powerful and its really great for professionals so far if you know anybody who is working with people and who is not taking garlic and who should take garlic for great health benefits then I highly suggest that you first try it for yourself use it for yourself and suggest that person as well to try it and use it and enjoy all the benefits without the smell without the odor of garlic and final thing that I want to mention is whether you take garlic or you whether we take garlic supplement is pretty much the same thing but in either case garlic contains some medicinal that could interact with some medicine so if you are taking some medication you should double-check and consult with your doctor thank you for watching this short video and if you find it useful please share it or send it to somebody who would benefit from this short clip", "SbVBqpmscvQ": "one of the more important questions that a lot of people ask us then is how you can translate this into something that's useful for most folks how do you increase the garlic content of your diet and and we as well as several people that work on the project have a little dinner club and we've learned all sorts of ways to increase the garlic content in our food we can add it to hummus dip we can add it to a number of different things and really elevate your garlic level which is more common in countries like the Middle East or Latin American countries of the Far East where they consume 510 cloves garlic per day but we have also found that there are other foodstuffs that contain compounds that also produce h2s and Glory you found something with shiitake mushrooms yes we we look in the in the literature and we found that the shiitake mushroom contains some odd whale polysulfides and also well onions onions constant contain the dimethyl trisulfide standard sulphate that I also produce hydrogen sulfide as well a plant in the in South America it called petit area Ally Asia and these plants contains been sealed police'll fights that also will use iron sulfur so it's a long a lot of another compounds that can produce the higher end soy pie so so historically people have used these plants for a very long time for the medicinal purposes in their diet and now we're beginning to find out perhaps one of the major benefits of these is to increase the amount of hydrogen sulfide in our bodies now what we've also and other people have shown this as well is that hydrogen sulfide is naturally produced in the body by metabolizing the amino acid cysteine and the garlic as well as these other compounds may well help to boost the amount of sulfide we have in our body you know by by having these carry item but humans have also known how to boost sulfide in their bodies for a very long time because the warm naturally-occurring sulfur spas that exist around the world often in exotic places people have been soaking in them for a very long time and when you soak in them for various ailment reasons you absorb the h2s right through your skin and that boost the sulphide production your body almost like you were eating but garlic even our president FDR during his latter days when he was suffering from polio would visit Springs to try to use these to cure and some of those were sulfurous as well so people known this for a long time and now science is beginning to show us that in fact it's the h2s that might be the critical component that mediates these bends so what we do is we take a small piece of red blood vessel let's aorta and we put it into a chamber and that chamber then contains a solution like plasma so the vessel is kept happy that way we then can measure the tension of that vessel and we can cause it to constrict or allow it to relax when it's in that chamber we control the oxygen tension so it's very much like it would experience in the body we add our hydrogen sulfide sensor so we can measure sulfide if it's present in the liquid and then we add the red blood cells and/or the garlic juice and that garlic juice where the compounds cause a production of h2s simultaneous with a relaxation of that blood vessel now the amount of compounds that we use would be equivalent to say eating 2 cloves garlic an adult human but we could put enough with that juice in there that we can get 20 to 40 or so percent relaxation of that blood vessel now that doesn't mean that we're going to get that much relaxation in our blood vessels but what it does mean though I've been requested to to detail a particular recipe you take a small tub of hummus and you take an entire bulb of garlic seal it crush it a lot put it in there so now you have about a third of the whole material is garlic two thirds hummus and then use that to spread on bread or put on veg Boulton it's wonderful dip garlic clinical trials have been done many times and for the most part they show a positive effect but there's there are some trials that show contrary to contradictory effects and what we think may be going on is that the supplements or the route by which people are getting the garlic extract may not be standardized so we can standardize them measuring the hydrosulfide production in the supplements", "hLb4SBo6N5E": "How to Prevent Bad Breath.

sometimes it could be a little embarrassing but hey it's a fact of life y'all bad breath like so many other things in life comes down to pesky bacteria I'm pretty sure the bacteria quietly rule the whole world but that's another story the two main forms of stink causing bacteria are plaque the invisible layer bacteria that coats your mouth and also rotting food between your teeth sexy and no bad breath bacteria live mostly on your tongue munching away at the proteins and your mucous membranes and I have two proteins in your spit all that munching and breaking down a proteins produces stinky sulfuric gas as a by-product and fYI the sulfuric gas that's produced by the bacteria in your mouth is the same type that's responsible for that glorious rotten egg smell now throughout the day you're chewing swallowing drinking eating and there's a lot of spit being produced in your mouth which helps wash out the bacteria and keep your breath neutral but at night at night things get freaky your salivary glands shut down causing your mouth to dry out a bit and then the bacteria multiply while you're sleeping soundly and especially if you sleep with your mouth open droves of bacteria fester on your dry tongue and you wake up in the morning armed with fiery dragon breath or asthmatics wafer I'd like to call it heavy breath which sounds so much cuter so how can you keep things so fresh and so clean the real aggravator of bad breath is a dry tongue that's the environment where bacteria flourishes so hydrating with lots of water is really helpful avoiding drinking too much alcohol or caffeine and not overdoing it on the sodium also helpful protein packed foods and dairy products also generate lots of those amino acids for bacteria to eat some contributors to dry mouth aren't necessarily in our control though things like a respiratory tract infection and asthma sleep apnea or the chronic presence of certain types of bacteria that can give you halitosis a medical term for bad breath if you want to know what your breath smells like take a spoon and scrape the back of your tongue good whiff of the gunk that comes out and that's how your breath smells make sure you do that in front of your crush too so they know how sexy your mouth gunk is as a quick fix gum can really help so long as it's sugarless it'll help you produce more saliva and wash it down more water always a good idea some people they swear by parsley which does have antibacterial chlorophyll in it but the research doesn't suggest that this actually works the main solution is of course brushing your friggin teeth twice a day y'all scrape your tongue Blas those food particles out of them so you don't have rotten food chilling in there and see your dentist regularly for cleanings thanks for

the reasons why it's very hard to want to be healthy and not take garlic so this is the best way that I found to actually take it that's relatively painless and easy for somebody who doesn't like garlic to actually take garlic so you'll need garlic some honey something to drink and just because you're going to go to the gym this is going to be my pre-workout meal I've got some whey protein and slice of avocado a bowl of spoon big ol knife and a cutting board you can peel this stuff but the easiest way to get it up smack and then you can separate your clothes on the outer shell Lotus trash

activate the power so what actually make it are like a superfood so to is knowing that smashing it we're cutting it I both smash it and cut it all right so that's a good bit of garlic I won't make you

at a time I'm definitely not chewing this all I'm going to do is put it on the back of my mouth put a little my protein shake in there and swap don't have to taste it not killing it and the reason for the avocado is simply because avocado is a superfood as well and yes one has a lot of fat but they're all good fats and the fats actually help the absorption of the ground good stuff we have",

to my bowl and then I'm gonna add my apple cider vinegar to that just to sterilize it before the call here so the next step is getting the thread through the garlic so we're just gonna go ahead and insert that needle pull it all the way through and I'll be doing that more than one time because I'm gonna need something to hold on to when I remove the guard from my tjj so I'm finished stringing the garlic and I'm just gonna use a scissors to remove the needle so ladies allow you to go ahead and insert the garlic into your vagina making sure the thread is outside like a tampon go to bed and let the garlic work overnight then pull the thread out gently and the garlic will follow this will treat the infection effectively and quickly I hope you guys enjoy this video thank you so much for watching and I'll catch you", "ceBbQcdhvVk": "welcome to a little segment on garlic I'd like to just demonstrate how I consume garlic in its most potent form in its raw state so what we have here is on I just can't you get a bulb of garlic just like this and you take one of the cloves and you cut it in half and you basically chop it up into little pieces like that now what do you do after that well I'm about to show to you see if I can position the camera here so we can know so we can take a look here there you go yeah there we go so watch me as I do this so I just got me some hummus here all right just some garlic hummus here actually it's garlic and chive hummus I got it from Whole Foods they're a good brand so that's what now I can probably just go with this but if you're beginning your culling with two tablespoons and so what I do is I just mix it in there just kind of it's very like it sticks it sit so you look at that you can't even I mean it's just the garlic's in there already so once it's in there and then what I do next is actually I gotta run and get some lemon juice here but anyhow a little olive oil little drizzle okay what that's gonna do is it's going to it's going to soften the the punch of the garlic if you consume garlic raw it's gonna burn your throat and it's very uncomfortable so not advice alright coming back here got me some lemon juice okay that doesn't really matter what order you add these ingredients okay if you're in a hurry or if you really don't care to get that in depth with this see I just put a couple little no that's nothing I need to put a little more than that don't eat too much that should be good yep that's it that's about three little drops there and here we go it's a preservative free lemon juice okay just pure lemon juice get it from whole foods that keep in the fridge so you can just have olive oil and a little lemon juice and that should that should pretty much take care of the the burnin cessation of the garlic okay so anyhow let me just show you the additional I guess the additional spices that I like to incorporate here one of them is uh sumac it's a really good spice I love the way taste actually it's common in Mediterranean restaurants wherever you live you'll see this red little colored spice and that sumac it's a great taste it's a great Mediterranean spice and there's some tumeric I like to do I like to add this about I guess I acquired the taste for it but I really like it it's a potent anti-inflammatory natural anti-inflammatory so you don't have to for me out I don't mind I would say if you're I don't mind like like overdoing it with the turmeric and sumac but if you're just beginning out but she put the Tamera cue power on start easy just spring to sprinkle a little first and then you know and then once you develop that taste or acquire the taste and you just keep going but it's a it's worth it's a worthy acquired it's a worthy taste to acquire because that spice is just phenomenal at helping with recovery and and also immune function and inflammation in the body it reduces inflammation in the body so let's go ahead and finish with our final touch here the healthy fat sesame seeds and I love it added because it adds a little crunch it has a crunch to my hummus so there you go there we have it there's my hummus that has a full raw garlic clove in there and I'm getting ready to eat it just about right now so we'll take a peek at how I respond to this but I would like to do is also I'll mix I'll mix the ingredients a little bit just kind of make sure that olive oil and lemon juice kind of gets coated in there that way once again it's going to kind of neutralize that potent garlic effect it's got a neutralized but it's not going to do great or or or inactivate any of the healthful compounds of garlic mm-hmm-hmm it's good it's a great Mediterranean dish great Mediterranean taste anyhow hopefully this video helps you as far as a way to consume raw garlic this is one of the ways that I'd do it and I think it's a very good way to do it because it's a very healthy dish anyhow thanks for watching I just wanted to also talk about the the breath odor issue with garlic something that I use is Listerine I simply just mouthwash after I consume garlic and never had any kind of mention or complaints of it you can use any kind of other mouthwash you prefer but pick one that's going to really do the job and really cleanse that that that odor in the mouth and whatnot so anyhow once again thanks for watching and hopefully this information helps", "VOEd9tsvdTI": "hi this is chef dangle with Tiger chef today I'm going to show you guys how to get that disgusting sulfuric taste out of your onions so onions have sulfur now that's the odor causing chemical that's in the onion so you know you want to put fresh onions on your sandwiches and things like that you don't want your customers to have bad breath so we're going to teach you how to get rid of that smell immediately you're going to take your onion and you're going to cut it any way you see fit um if you're using a first sandwich - probably going to do slices like these if they're going in a salad you might do little chunks a little block cuts so I'm gonna do both of those for you I'm going to show you exactly how it's going to look also listen one other thing you want to have a very very sharp knife I always have my knife from ethnic is extremely sharp but this helps from not squeezing any of the good juices out of the anja all right just like so we're going to cut this down this way so have both brunoise cuts and 1/2 sliced onions the trick is you're gonna leave it soaking in water for a minimum of four hours and what's going to happen is it's gonna slowly come on out and you're going to want to do this in a room-temperature water leave it at room temperature for four hours and then you can refrigerate it afterwards or if you just press for time just cut it refrigerate it overnight and as long as you have that timeframe you should get all the sulfur out of your onions so we have our onions sitting in here and I want you to notice that most of the onions are on the bottom I have this much room left the more room that you could leave for more water the better that way the water won't be asked concentrated with the onion flavor so I'm just going to pour over my room temperature water and also as you can notice that did put the broom wall cuts and I put the slice onions in the same batch they're going to separate in the water especially over in a couple hours or overnight so feel free to mix them all together and that's that so as you guys can see the water is not cloudy that's because of sulfurs in it you got sulfur water so what you got to do is you got to drain it out and replenish it with fresh water and at that point you could you know let it sit for longer until you need to use it or you just go straight up and put it on your sandwiches or whatever they cause you need these running is for so that's how you eliminate all the sulfur from your onions listen you're probably making delicious sandwiches but you don't want your customers leaving be like oh that was a great sandwich but my breath smells like onions people don't order stuff because of that one reason so this is one way to eliminate that problem so let's have for more fun videos informative videos come scribe to our YouTube channel for all your chef needs come visit us at Tiger chef com see you guys soon", "Yv2sBGIpN8o": "what Casas what causes bad breath after wisdom teeth removal how is this to be treated so think about this you're getting a wisdom teeth removal particularly we do this in our office you know like I said earlier we get out for a week most of my patients get all four wisdom teeth removed at the same time under sedation so when they are going to get all four wisdom teeth removed they're gonna be pretty smaller a significant amount of swelling depending on how deeply those impacted teeth are so they are gonna have some swelling now they're not gonna be able to open their mouth why particularly for the first couple of days so now if you're going to eat anything including any soft food that you may need you're going to get pretty just impacted down here so they are going to get really stuck on to the whole the wisdom tooth is going to come out from so think about this kind of food that's staying in the back getting stuff so they're gonna cause some bad breath eventually and sometimes you may have a healing socket think about if you have a nice piece of big wound on the skin so that skin is not gonna smell pretty you know it is gonna smell back the same way you're going to have all four wisdom teeth are pretty cut open now they are healing they are going to cause bad breath whether they you're gonna have any food getting stuck there or not so it may be because of the the food or it could be because the healing process sometimes you may have some infection that is causing the bad breath so it could be a variety of reasons why you may be getting the bad breath after the wisdom take them all so I wouldn't be too concerned if you are having bad breath for a short period of time as soon as after the removal however if you happen to have bad breath that is continuing after two or three weeks then that's when I would be concerned about because you may not be healing properly", "Xa0gpRapfJ0": "this is Tina yeah hello Tina hi hi Tina and now you said you have a bad breath problem and this has been going on a long time 15 years yeah 15 to 20 years now and you know I just don't know how to go about it you know it's really irritating and embarrassing and I just want to ask the doctors I've also suffered from acid for 15 to 20 years and would that be connected acid ooh tummy reflux yeah it can be absolutely say the most common cause of bad breath is oral hygiene and seeing a dentist and a hight dental hygienist is always a good idea but that you mentioned the acid reflux it certainly could be a cause so often people with acid reflux have problems with the sphincter so the the muscle within the esophagus and it's not tight enough so it's allowing acid up and when it's allowing acid up it can also be allowing food up and it's meaning that the the progress of the food through the stomach and out is not quite as good as it should be so you can develop things like bad breath or halitosis and I know that you're on a medication to help suppress the acid but you're saying it's not working so I would set suggest the next step is popping down to your GP to get maybe a camera test down the throat to see what's going on within your within the gullet and the stomach and seeing if there's anything else have you ever had that tuna doesn't sound very nice but I'm sure if it cures yeah and find out the problem exactly you can be slightly sedated with it so you shouldn't notice too much hopefully and what's going on and it will at least find out the problem and if there's anything underlying it that's causing all that acid thank you thank you - thank you", "6amuTEdtQOw": "what's up you guys gonna be back you know breasts angry now because [Music]", "oZ13QfP2os8": "There is a curse that has plagued humanity\nsince ancient times. The Greeks fought it by chewing\naromatic resins, while the Chinese resorted to egg shells. In the ancient Jewish Talmud, it's even considered \nlegal grounds for divorce. This horrible scourge is halitosis,\notherwise known as bad breath. But what causes it,\nand why is it so universally terrifying? Well, think of some of the worst\nodors you can imagine, like garbage, feces or rotting meat. All of these smells come from the activity\nof microorganisms, particularly bacteria, and, as disgusting as it may sound, similar bacteria live in the moisture-rich\nenvironment of your mouth. Don't panic. The presence of bacteria in your body\nis not only normal, it's actually vital \nfor all sorts of things, like digestion and disease prevention. But like all living things,\nbacteria need to eat. The bacteria in your mouth \nfeed off of mucus, food remnants, and dead tissue cells. In order to absorb nutrients\nthrough their cell membranes, they must break down the organic matter\ninto much smaller molecules. For example, they'll break proteins \ninto their component amino acids and then break those down even further\ninto various compounds. Some of the foul-smelling \nbyproducts of these reactions, such as hydrogen sulfide and cadaverine, escape into the air and waft their way \ntowards unsuspecting noses. Our sensitivity to these odors\nand interpretation of them as bad smells may be an evolutionary mechanism\nwarning us of rotten food and the presence of disease. Smell is one of our most intimate\nand primal senses, playing a huge role \nin our attraction to potential mates. In one poll, 59% of men and 70% of women said they wouldn't go on a date \nwith someone who has bad breath, which may be why Americans alone spend $1 billion a year \non various breath products. Fortunately, most bad breath \nis easily treated. The worst smelling byproducts come from\ngram-negative bacteria that live in the spaces \nbetween gums and teeth and on the back of the tongue. By brushing and flossing our teeth, using antibacterial mouthwash at bedtime, gently cleaning the back of the tongue\nwith a plastic scraper and even just eating a healthy breakfast, we can remove many of these bacteria\nand their food sources. In some cases, \nthese measures may not be enough due to dental problems, \nnasal conditions, or rarer ailments, such as liver disease \nand uncontrolled diabetes. Behaviors like smoking \nand excessive alcohol consumption also have a very recognizable odor. Regardless of cause, the bad smell almost \nalways originates in the mouth and not the stomach \nor elsewhere in the body. But one of the biggest challenges lies in actually determining \nhow our breath smells in the first place, and it's unclear why. It may be that \nwe're too acclimatized to the smell inside \nour own mouths to judge it. And methods like cupping your hands\nover your mouth, or licking and smelling your wrist\ndon't work perfectly either. One study showed \nthat even when people do this, they tend to rate the smell subjectively according to how bad \nthey thought it was going to be. But there's one simple,\nif socially difficult, way of finding out how your breath smells: just take a deep breath and ask a friend.", "HaYsdP4DYhc": "the following program contains graphic images that may be disturbing parents are advised that these images may not be suitable for young children bad breath can be downright nasty boys no matter how much you brush floss use mouthwash you just

can happen with food debris reacts with chemicals in the saliva that crystallizes that truly is a stone that forms in your salivary duct and of course when you're not getting the saliva things get a little smelly that was cool fascinating right so so like you said them this is a calcified stone that forms and blocks the outflow from the duct much more common in people who are dehydrated or taking antihistamines and it does have to be removed otherwise it can get impacted it can be a source of infection or even causing an usually I mean that was an impressive we call it a self extraction he was

at the very least needing a small procedure to make an incision and take it out so it's not what it does it highlight something we often talk about on the show which is if you have chronic bad breath no matter what you do for oral hygiene you usually there's something else going on you know and and it's worth considering certainly if you have swelling in your mouth this could be the culprit the

out and you float your tongue like this and once you float your tongue you inhale through your fruity tongue and you exhale through your nose so I'll just show you how it goes like this the inhalation is long and deep through your mouth and the exhalation is through your nose you can do about 10 to 15 rounds of this and once you're finished you have this cool sensation in your mouth she'd carry

abdomen should expand and as you exhale it should contract because kapal Bhati is forceful contractions forceful accelerations by pulling your abdomen muscles in you are inhaling just 20% but exhalation is up to 80% so I'm just going to show you how it works if you notice you can see me exhaling forcefully but you don't really see me inhaling but I am inhaling but the inhalation is just very passive the focus is more on exhalation and I'm pushing out the impurities from your lungs and back nasal passage through this forceful exhalation apart from these you immediately have to

with the shutdown of dental offices and an increase of mask wearing because of code 19 a new oral hygiene issue is occurring now that patients are heading back for their checkups and they're finding it is called mask mouth and it's causing all kinds of dental disasters for people dr pamela varanes joins us this morning with what we need to know so that we can uh i guess avoid the stinky side effect of wearing a mask and good morning to you and i want to begin with what is mask mouth absolutely good morning mask mouth is the trending term that dentists are now using to describe the effects being seen in the oral cavity as a result of prolonged mask wear these effects are being attributed to xerostomia which is a greek derived word also known as dry mouth as dentists we treat and see zero stomach patients typically they're elderly or more medically compromised patients which drawing attention to mask mouth is we're seeing these dry mouth effects on an uncharacteristic population group and so this is affecting it looks like everything from the teeth to the gums to what comes out of your mouth right absolutely bad breath is a big thing that people are noticing we're seeing an increase in cavity rate more tooth decay vitis inflammation of the gums so it's really affecting the whole or cavity and and around the mouth area as well yeah and so you know popping a breath mint or brushing your teeth that's it's not such an easy fix especially when you're talking about things like the gums and um and the teeth and the cavities and the decay so are there any serious long-term effects of this why do people need to take it seriously we should take it seriously because our teeth we we need to keep our enamel healthy and strong it's making it's putting wear and tear on certain areas of our teeth it's um it's increasing the inflammation of our gums so it's more for the long-term effect and it's important to have forward thinking and think of preventative ways to avoid these things masks aren't going away so um or at least not anytime soon so it is important to maybe start segmenting as dental providers patients are our younger kids who are more prone to mouth breathing should they maybe are they may be more on the critical side of masked mouth maybe patients who suffer from sleep apnea or snoring should they be looked at more closely yeah because i was going to ask what are the top ways to avoid this and you know my son he's seven and i'll get his mask back and it is drenched it's saturated because i i don't know if i was like are you sucking on it or what but i think part of it is because they are breathing out of their mouth and so that's a big thing that you found right because most people they they don't breathe directly out of their nose yeah and that's actually really important if we can consciously think um when we do breathe to close our mouth and inhale and exhale through the nose um changing our mouth our masks frequently or washing our claw masks is also very important to make sure that the moisture doesn't get trapped in the mask and therefore create a feeding ground for more bacteria to grow keeping hydrated drink plenty of water enjoy seasonal fruits avoid alcohol and coffee consumption if possible those are both very acidic and dehydrating if you're one to use mouthwash very frequently maybe opt for an alcohol-free mouthwash instead and and not to neglect professional dental dental care if once you feel comfortable and safe to go to the dentist definitely go to the dentist and and take care of things on a professional level that's right you still got to get those uh yearly checks in you got to get your checkups and your cleanings dr vaness thanks so much for your insight thank you and for more information you can always to follow dr vratis right here on our website pro sdds.com over to you steve all right", "i-I_43cvxmE": "hello everyone welcome to dented digest yesterday a patient has come to me with a complained of severe bad breath she was a 45 year old fair lady she was not a known diabetic it means that she was not diagnosed with diabetes before when we advised blood glucose examination we found her to be uncontrolled diabetic with blood glucose levels reaching 340 milligrams per deciliter many a times people complain about severe bad breath but one main reason of bad breath in people above 40 years could be diabetes I call it as diabetic bad breath uncontrolled diabetes is a dangerous complication to entire body it not only hampers the functioning capacity of various organs but also induces a lot of stress into the lifestyle of patients bad smell malodor foul smell are synonyms for bad breath we often find patients with bad breath to be uncontrolled diabetic in many instances how do I know whether my bad breath is related to diabetes or not bad breath in diabetic patients have few characteristic features extremely sweet fruity smell for mouth relatively clean oral cavity if patient maintains good oral hygiene but still patient has bad breath then it can be due to diabetes this is one classic feature in diabetic bad-breath diabetes in family if patients family has diabetic history that is if patients parents are diabetic then there is a good chance that even the patient can become diabetic hence patients with bad breath along with a family history of diabetes can be potential diabetic severe foul smell in starvation if patient observes increase in bad breath in periods of starvation or in conditions where he or she fails to have food at correct time can also be considered due to diabetes multiple abscess in mouth patients with uncontrolled diabetes may have multiple abscess and pus discharges from tooth this can be another reason for bad breath weak periodontal condition of tooth severe and uncontrolled diabetes is well associated with rapid bone loss and mobile tooth this hampers the hygiene and pockets will be formed between teeth and gums these pockets act as potential spaces for food entrapment which further decompose and results in foul smell why do I get bad breath in diabetes this condition is called diabetic ketoacidosis in type 1 diabetes patients fail to have insulin production in them in type 2 diabetes even though insulin production is normal the cells are not responsive to insulin so in both cases blood glucose fails to enter into cells for energy production as a result two things happen unused glucose piles up in blood increasing blood glucose levels cells fail to produce energy for their metabolism in this situation the body tries to generate energy from fats as a result fats are burnt and energy is produced in this process ketone bodies are produced as byproducts they are produced in high levels in conditions like starvation and stress in diabetics as the concentration of ketone bodies increases they will be excreted through lungs urine and sweat these ketone bodies produce a peculiar fruity smell which when comes out through expired air is called as ketone breath keep on breath is an alarming indicator of diabetic status of the patient what should I do if it is ketone breath if because for bad breath is due to ketone bodies then the treatment is very simple as the glucose levels get into control the severity of bad breath decreases hence maintenance of good control on blood glucose is the primary treatment protocol for bad breath if patient has multiple gum problems and pus discharges from mouth they should be treated respectively good oral hygiene maintenance helps in reducing diabetic Dental complications regular monitoring of your blood glucose levels helps in maintaining control over one's diabetic status thus reducing these oral complications for any further assistance

"You know the drill. You wake up in the morning, you stretch, you yawn, and you realize that it kind of smells like something died in your mouth overnight. But, actually, if it makes you feel any better, it's really the opposite. Your mouth makes that awful smell in the morning because whole colonies of bacteria have been growing in there all night. Bacteria really, really love the inside of the human body and your mouth, with its warmth and constant supply of food particles, is no exception. Your mouth bacteria aren't all bad because, among other things, they help keep more dangerous outside bacteria from invading. But in many ways they are the lesser of two evils, because you can also thank your mouth bacteria for fun things like cavities and gum disease. Most of the time, your saliva helps keep the colonies under control by sweeping them and the food particles they eat down your esophagus. Your saliva also contains some antimicrobial agents like lactoferrin, which works by stopping bacteria from absorbing iron properly. But at night you don't produce as much saliva. Your mouth becomes this warm humid breeding ground with plenty of tiny food particles and dead cells for all the growing colonies to feast on. As they eat, the bacteria produce a bunch of different odor causing compounds as waste products. Including hydrogen sulfide, which is the stuff that makes rotten eggs so stinky, methanethiol, also known as fart smell, isovaleric acid, which is what you're smelling on your feet after wearing boots all day and also happens to be found in beer, and cadaverine, which Is responsible for the scent of rotting flesh. So when someone tells you that your breath smells like a corpse in the morning, that's not really an exaggeration.

glass jars that you might have lying around so that way you can store your medicinal herbs inside of them there are only a few things that you're going to need for this and it will work on any glass jar that you have laying around as you plan on using all you simply need is the glass jars that you want to use some baking soda and then a spoon the baking soda is a really really good thing to use to remove odors from pretty much anything that you have laying around and it works really well on glass jars especially with hot water make sure that you get the water coming from your tap really nice and hot for this the reason for that is the hotter that your water is the more clean that the jar is going to come out now if we look inside there we can see really just how gross this thing is this thing has been sitting for a month and this is actually an old jar from some adult beverage form of eggnog that I had laying around that's probably over a month old like I said so this thing is really gross and it does not smell very pleasant at all but I left it out this way so I could show you guys how to remove the odor from any old jars you have laying around as you can see this jars of a really nice size it's got a nice wide mouth on it so it'll be really easy for me to store my herbs inside of this we just simply want to squirt a little bit of soap inside of the jar and after we've done that put the lid on top all right now the lid is on nice and tight just give it a really good shake here this will help to loosen the things up inside of the jar now the reason I'm doing it this way on this jar obviously I could fit my hand inside here but there may be some jars that you have laying around that you can't actually fit your hand inside of a good example of that would be a jar somewhat like this where it's very narrow at the top so it's very difficult to actually get your hand inside up so you may have to use like a long-handled spoon or a fork just to get any actual cleansing ability inside of this jar [Music] depending on how stinky the jar that you're using is you can use anywhere from one teaspoon all the way up to three tablespoons of baking soda one thing I like to do is just get a pan of hot water going on the stove and I like to use that water to dump into the jars after I've added the baking soda all right now that we've added the baking soda just put on the lid and again give this a really good shake what this is going to do this is going to allow the baking soda to get up into the lid it's going to get into the jar it's going to get through everything that we're wanting it to get through and it's going to clean and remove or deodorize the inside of the jar and the top of this lid now the entire jar isn't sanitary yet but after we're done with this all we simply have to do is just wash it like normal and at this point after we've washed our jars we should notice that there is no more odor so I thank you guys for watching this video I

from Jerry and so I thought I would answer his question with video Jerry said are you listening dear since you know everything in capital letters did you hear that yeah whatever let me repeat that one more time since you know everything I think maybe I should invite you over for a little bit how do I clean up old stinky Tupperware that's sticky and smells I have some old big pieces that I would like to keep thanks in advance so um to clean the stink off of Tupperware um I don't personally have any real Tupperware but I know that it's really good and I see it through stories all the time and I was thinking about actually buying stuff from the strip stores but I'm just using my plastic we're here to demonstrate so this principle is the same field if it's a smaller one like this I just fill it with water and then I pour in some baking soda I don't know I just dump some in quarter cup or so stir it up set it down to wherever I'm going to let it set overnight and then I feel the rest of the way with water and I let it sit overnight and that takes care of the smell if you have the lid also that is smelly take a great big container like this and set the whole thing in there and fill the whole thing with water in baking soda you may need to wait down your container with I don't know a rock or whatever and that will cover it all and get all of it under Neath the water with the baking soda and that will remove the smell if you have a larger container like this you could wad up some newspaper and put it in here or you could get another big bowl like this and submerge the whole thing or even in your kitchen sink overnight just pour a cup of baking soda in your kitchen sink fill all your containers that you're cleaning and D smella fiying is that a word that's not really a word and um let that soak overnight also now you could if you don't have baking soda use borax or if the baking does soda doesn't work which it's worked every time for me use 4x that will definitely get it and you can get it out now as for the sticky the sticky is leftover grease that has just kind of accumulated on your Tupperware and so what I would do is take a paste of baking soda and blue dawn and use that to scrub and I would take your paste and spread it on and then just like whoops just let it sit on there for I don't know an hour or two however long you want and then you can just scrub it and that should get the sticky off so that's how you clean sticky smelly Tupperware please visit us at living on a dime comm for more money-saving tips or recipes", "-Onszqw2E04": "hey everybody Dominique here in today's quick tip comes from the kitchen now I'm a huge fan of those onions and garlic however I'm not so much a fan of the state smelling leave on your hands and bread afterwards however just the other day I ran a constant tip that really does work so I'm excited to share first grant a campus those syncing hands now what I love about this tip is that you had to shoot yourself in your house right now how do I know because a spoon it is so super easy all you need is a stainless steel spoon or anything stand still but today's food is most practical and all you're going to do is take your fingers and rub your fingers up against the stainless steel for whatever reason stainless still reacts to cure the stinky smell so you're just going to rub your palms with the back of the spoon and then rub your fingers against the spoon and voila no more stinky hands now if you do plug you still have a little bit of a pinch left over on your hands the next step is just to take a little bit of salt regular old sea salt or household saw whatever you have lying around and just sprinkle it on your hands you can also do this with baking soda you're going to rub your hands together and wash it off and that should definitely cure this I know so is Ed walking around stinking years just kidding but seriously it's so easy and something I was having a long time ago next up is taking care that stinky breath now of course the obvious choice is just to go brush your teeth however if you're out in the mouth that is not always realistic because maybe omega2 right you keep pace with you or maybe you just don't have a lot of time what may work for you is simply drinking a glass of milk it really does work there's something about milk that really killed that any garlicky smell and it's a delicious treat so drink up now if that is really nip it in the bud like you want there is something else you can do mustard all you have to do is down a little bit of it maybe a teaspoon or so but don't swallow it swish it around your mouth and that's going to kill the breath inside now to get really big on the inside we're going to take about half a teaspoon and swish it around and then swallow it and that should definitely cure that garlicky a named swim so I hope you all liked the quick tips today make sure to subscribe and behind it and until next time see

question is what do you do to get rid of Kido breath now when somebody starts doing the keto diet they're putting themselves into ketosis and they're actually doing intermittent fasting on a regular basis they are going to be creating ketones at the highest levels especially when intermittent fasting is applied so let's really go through what's actually happening in the body to understand how to take care of this so essentially with ketones we have three of them we've talked about in past videos beta-hydroxybutyrate acetoacetate and acetone acetone is the ketone that is being dispelled in the breath so every time you're in taking oh - and then dispelling co2 every time you dispel that co2 from the alveoli in the lungs there's ketones acetone that particular ketone that's leaking out through the lungs now why is this happening the reason why this is happening is because your body is a such a fuel-efficient ketone producing beast of a machine that you're just producing so many ketones that they're actually leaking out through the lungs so kudos to you you're doing everything right and probably - right so what do we do to get rid of this because you know it's really repulsive sometimes when not when other people smell your breath but when you smell your own breath you know it's bad cuz it gets bad there have been times actually when I was really really intermittent fasting and I was taking it to the limits and I was really experimenting with this diet that I swear to you I thought I thought my daughter hadn't made a poop she's too changed diapers well she was like 1 and a half she was like one at the time and I would smell poop I would smell a dirty diaper right I bet she pooped so I'd go to change her diaper there would be nothing in it this happened so often that I started to really realize that it was my own breath that I was mistaking for poop terrible but anyway those days are gone I've adjusted my macronutrients and that's what we're gonna talk about here so essentially acetone is leaking out through the breath at too high of a rates what do we do to adjust this well we can do it through the diet but if you're somebody who is seeing really great results and you really don't want to rock the boat that's completely understandable so you know there's plenty of gums out there that use sugar alcohols that have low amounts of carbohydrates that will help to kind of mask them there are breath mints out there that are key to a friendly as well you could be using these but this isn't a long-term solution this is only gonna mask the issue probably for minutes I wouldn't say minutes maybe like 15 yea minutes I guess it would be under hours there'll be minutes so this is a short-term solution but how do we get rid of the root of the problem how does how do we stop our lungs from leaking out this ketone acetone essentially what you do is you adjust your macronutrients a little bit we reintroduce carbohydrates slightly into the diet so if you're experiencing keto breath all the time you probably are intermittent fasting a lot you're probably seeing some nice results but we are gonna happen to do is is introduce carbohydrates a little bit more not telling you to go eat refined greens and cakes and pies and cookies but incorporate a little bit more dark leafy vegetables nuts with higher amounts of carbohydrates and them Foods in their natural state I'm not telling you to go to Eton I'm not telling you to go and eat a bowl of oatmeal but eat foods that have maybe 10 net carbohydrates at most per serving if you're going to increase them you're dispelling a lot of acetone in the breath they're leaking out through the lungs this essentially means that you're a fat-burning machine and that you're having probably 5% of your diet of carbohydrates what we're gonna want to do is is increase it to 10 if we start to see a little bit of change in the breath and you start to you know feel a little bit better about yourself then you can kind of stop there but if you're still you know feeling that your breath is still terrible and repulsive to people then increase it to 15% but you don't want to increase it more than 15% because this can threaten your ability to get in and out of ketosis as easily as you're doing right now I hope this video has helped to you if you have any questions please post below share subscribe like dislike give me the finger you know how this all goes and if you're somebody who is thinking about doing the keto diet and if you're thinking about it then you're

comfort zone yeah her teeth are very bad her whole one side she can't even chew she can't cuz her teeth are literally they're coming out I'm hoping that in the future my little girl will have her mouth before I lived here I lived for two years in a rooming house at a rooming house so you may well know it's just a small little room with nothing else um and I have a very hard time keeping things tidy because I have a disability well it's called executive functioning if you know what that is so it means that keeping things organized and clean has always been and will always be extremely difficult for me so living in a really tight space it's hard it was really really hard so I did not want to bring her into that environment so I left her with my mom and when I got her back recently it's only been a couple of weeks now that I've had her I've noticed that her teeth have become drastically worse than they were when I used to have her and I'm guessing that's just personally an aging thing perfectly a lack of care thing and her mouth has been very smelly for a very long time when you walk into the room all we could smell was the decay of Mia's breath Elliot's done her homework we're gonna do an exam and see if we can confirm what Elliot thinks is going on for Mia I'm actually hoping it's bad teeth and not a tumor or some other problem that she's dealing with teeth more or less we can deal with tumors in the mouth that's a whole other situation and I'm looking at your nose any discharge from there I think her eyes look better than mind you I got some eye issues right now and hers are looking pretty healthy to me she's got some normal age-related changes there but nothing bad lymph nodes are good I thought all those bumps as I put my head down her yeah I'm gonna take a big guess right now and we're gonna call these spacious I don't know mez am i right I am I might like most people Eliot was concerned about the love she found that her dog those lumps not looking too bad at all so let's move on I couldn't find your heart I couldn't find your heart it's like in the barrel somewhere in this barrel chest Eliot knows she's pleasantly plump she's got some j.lo booty she's working on it reason I use why I put on gloves you look because I don't like her my reason I put on gloves is we never know what we're gonna find inside of a mouth you know Eliot is identified correctly that you've probably got some dental issues going on there we can find pus obvious abscesses those sort of things so these gloves just to make sure we're not transferring anything to her and vice versa watch what her tongue moves even the gentle pressure of her tongue on her teeth is enough to make that tooth move within its socket [Music] Samiha is just living with this widespread decay in her mouth day-in day-out she can't ever escape from it more loose teeth gum recession inflammation public periodontitis don't see any tumors which is a good thing but everything else is pretty messed up see that white line amongst all the brown green calculus and tartar well that could be infection let's take a closer look we bring equipment and special stays to our appointments we pick a spot in someone's house and process the slides we hook up our microscope to our laptop so people can see exactly what we are seeing in real time so we're gonna dip it through these three sets of stains like a pail you are in compared to me hell you are oh my god wait time just a pasty wait yeah okay we're seeing so much rods in here we're actually seeing chains of rods it's in some caca actually it looks like this small amounts of crockery in here as well this is the amount that you would see in an abscess yes right yeah this is the amount you would see in an office except we got it from the mouth right instead of like a cat abscess on the butt because they got upset and they were fighting yeah you could see on the microscope all those bacteria right mu has high potential to have abscesses like all throughout and so dentistry is the number one thing that needs to happen and I would say it's not even just like your dentistry it's like a dental surgery you got it right yeah when we do the dental surgery the first thing the first thing we're gonna do because it's gonna take a little bit of time to set things up what's the first thing we've got to do the first thing is always comfort and relief first and what that means is we've identified lots of bacteria we're very interested in what we're saying over here we're but you're part of the family too you want that's right you got it you're gonna see if you approve of this what we're gonna do is this very first step is I want to give an antibiotic and the type of antibiotic I want to use is something called an t robe it's also called clindamycin I've had that I was gonna say that I was gonna say it too but no I've actually taken that before my rat bit me oh and that's what they put me on dentists trees are expensive hey like they're really they're really costly and and so what we're hoping to do is go like animal welfare first animal welfare it just means like we freedom from like fear pain anxiety or suffering basically and so like we want that to be first and that teeth can cause all of those things and so and so you know as long as you and I are on the same page and what that would be is take out the trash take out the garbage it's like we're overflowing with stuff in there that's poison remove the poison what do you think about that plan if Tara and I find a place we can go that would allow us to use their dental dental ward basically yeah that sounds great and I'm I'm pretty like I'm pretty comfortable and have you at the idea of her being able to maintain some teeth and you know that's such an important function for dogs for just there and like their whole mental well-being and everything chewing is just it's so natural to them when anesthesia is involved people feel anxious when surgery's involved people feel anxious when you're separated from your dog or cat you can feel anxious now imagine all the fat combined together with an executive functioning disorder Elliot showed up at the wrong hospital and then her cell phone died the kind people at curling Animal Hospital directed her back to us and she eventually made her way to West Carlton Animal Hospital who donated their dentistry Bay so Tara and I could do our thing some panting and hypersalivation probably means she's a bit anxious so we start off with a pre medication that's going to help her calm down and make her anaesthetic balanced we place a catheter and IV fluids we then get ketamine and valium which is her induction agent the induction agent is a short-acting anesthesia she gently drifts with no stress in a very calm way and it keeps her under long enough so we can place an endotracheal tube this tube supplies isoflurane a very controllable type of anaesthetic that keeps her under during the dentistry procedure and protects her airway so fluid blood all the stuff doesn't get down into her lungs we begin by taking out the trash we've got to remove all that material to see what we're actually dealing with underneath [Music] tarah skills the teeth to further clean them up when we make note of what's there what's missing and certain measurements that we want to know about some of these teeth are so wrong that they're hanging on by a thread I'm making this look easy but in reality many teeth are much harder than that for most teeth it's a process of patience drill elevate wait be patient don't snap roots [Music] this is before pain infection odor inflammation and this is after a lot of those teeth are gone the ones that are remaining look functional and good dental x-rays are performed so we know that we've gotten out what we needed to take him with the right anaesthetic technique and pain control recovery can be very smooth [Music] as we clean up the dental bay we let her look around have a chance to relax a little bit then we return her a battalion we go over her pain medication her feeding routine and then she's off dentistry's can be a night and day experience you go in with unbelievable infection in pain you come away with absolute relief you can see it after two hours of anesthetic look at the spring in her step if you like what we do subscribe it helps us help other people just like Eliot and Mia [Music]", "TWDG7Egxr9c": "hi and welcome to biteawayTV I'm Nora a swiss dental hygienist since 16 years and the founder of biteaway dot com and in this video I'll show you what causes bad morning breath and how to stop it morning breath can be so unpleasant and embarrassing but what causes it to be so smelly and what can you do about it everyone suffers from morning breath to a degree of course but how bad this is depends on your diet lifestyle and the care you take over cleaning your teeth you know you have that morning breath when you wake up because your mouth is dry and you'll have nasty taste in it but it's worse for the person you wake up with because they experienced a bad smell of your breath more than you that can be pretty embarrassing right so what causes bad morning breath one of the most obvious major cause of morning breath is not cleaning your teeth and tongue well enough or at all no no before you go to bed we've all had late nights where we were too tired to care about cleaning our teeth normally after a few glass of wine I can hear you another fact that contribute to this overly stinky morning breath is an unhealthy diet full of meat and sugar and alcohol consumption if particles of food remain overnight because you haven't cleaned them off or remove them from in between your teeth they will turn into plaque and possibly tartar both of which are major causes of bad breath of course alcohol is also a diuretic which contribute to the dry mouth your experience and also lead to bad breath also known as halitosis so let's check how you can stop bad morning breath always make sure you see your dental hygienist at least once a year she will remove the stinky tartar which you can't clean away with your toothbrush the best way to avoid inflicting your bed partner with pinky morning breath is to have a good daily routine to clean your teeth and to make sure you always do it before you go to bed the two biggest tips i give to my patients are to clean the bacteria of the tongue with a tongue scraper and to use interdental brushes instead or on top of using floss this is because interdental brushes are now known to be far more effective at removing the plaque build up between the peace building these two oral care hacks into your daily dental routine will also help to prevent more serious conditions from developing including whiten gum disease periodontitis cavities and tooth decay at biteaway we advocate the following daily teeth cleaning routine this will keep your mouth and teeth healthy and reduce the severity of that morning breath so let's go biteaway's bad breath busting routine step number one use interdental brushes once a day in the evening instead of loss to clean between your teeth step number to clean the bacteria off of your tongue with a tongue scraper twice a day step number three brush your teeth for two minutes once in the morning and once at night please step number four to complete your routine use mouthwash once a day in the evening for 60 seconds morning breath is a fact of life but you can stop it getting really bad simply by taking a bit more care over your daily teas cleaning routine so resolve to spend a little bit more time cleaning your teeth every day and you'll avoid inflicting your bad partner with morning breath that smells like bad drains in the summer give them a fresh breath confident kiss instead go for it so now i would love to hear from your experience how do you try to avoid bad morning breath any embarrassing

have an odor or even a taste inside of their mouth a lot of different reasons why people might have something like this it can be associated with chronic sinusitis and then in the night the mucus drips down and accumulates in the throat and since we're not coughing and clearing and swallowing when we're asleep that material sits and can accumulate the odors people with acid reflux often wake up with a very bad taste of the mouth or a bad odor many times people eat late at night and go to bed and in the night our stomach is churning and digesting that food if you've got a loose finger between your esophagus and your stomach then food stomach acid can come up and down through the night in particular if you're laying flat because the stomach is a very strong mix of muscles that are churning the food it's all supposed to go down the GI tract but sometimes it reflux is up so if you've reflux a lot through the night you may have sort of rancid partially digested food in your pharynx in your mouth and you wake up with bad breath so one technique to kind of limit that morning breath is don't eat too close to bedtime don't eat you go right to bed don't eat and lay down you want about three hours of time after you've eaten before you lay down and go to bed", "ufI1Q8UHjJk": "cool oh my god Cole your breasts are you in ketosis alright everyone this video is on keto breath and it's important that you understand what's really happening in the world of ketosis and what gives you keto breath in the first place because not necessarily a bad thing it's easy to get rid of if you pay attention to this video all right so to understand keto breath we have to understand ketosis really quick so I'm gonna break it down in like 15 seconds just bear with me alright so ketosis is when you are in the absence of carbohydrates you have no glucose no carbohydrates your body is forced to run on these molecules called ketones these ketones provide energy from fat now let's get down to how this actually pertains when it comes to keto breath so you have three main ketone bodies that your body is utilizing okay you have beta hydroxy butyrate you have acetoacetate and you have acetone yea like nail polish remover acetone but acetone isn't bad okay it's created in the body it's only bad is in crazy high amounts so don't go thinking that ketosis is bad just because acetone is a product acetone is a byproduct of animal fat metabolism in general so any animal is consuming any fat is going to have a level of acetone in their body at some point or another period doesn't matter now these ketones including acetone are removed via two ways they're removed through the breast or they're removed through the urine but let's break down acetone a little bit more so you have a solid understanding of what's happening here so acetone in short is what is giving your breath that fruity smell in ketosis again the byproduct of fat metabolism now acetone again whenever we have any kind of fat metabolism it occurs and we absorb it through the lungs we absorb it through the stomach and sometimes in small amounts we can absorb it through the skin so yeah side note if you're using a lot of nail polish remover and you're getting it on your skin you can't absorb it through your skin but again it's really not dangerous unless it seemed crazy high amounts so then what happens is this acetone flows through the bloodstream it goes to the liver and the liver breaks it down to a series of chemical compounds ultimately creating glue in one way or another so basically that's how ketosis kind of works your body's generating energy in one way or another from this acetone not always be a glucose pathway but generally speaking when you have carbohydrates in the mix that's how that ends up happening so in short keto breath is just the presence of these ketone bodies so it's not really a bad thing when you think about it so if you have ketones because you're in ketosis you have them floating around in your blood stream and the acetone is going to come out through your breath that's plain and simple but I want to give you three solutions for it okay three easy ways to combat the keto breath and I'm going to break them down a little bit more so you have a solid understanding of why they work and what's really happening okay the first one is to drink a lot more water and again it sounds vague but I want to explain why because there's a serious method to it's not just about flushing it out remember how I told you that acetone is going to excreted through the breath or through the urine well here's the thing if you consume enough water it's going to opt to be excreted through the urine therefore you're not going to have as much in the way of keto breath so super super simple nothing to it other than to hydrate up a little bit more you're naturally dehydrated when you're in ketosis anyway because you're not retaining water in many ways so you're naturally going to have bad breath from two reasons one because the ketones are going to be escaping through your breath but also halitosis is going to come in just because your mouth is dry so hydrate up wash them out through the urine okay the next one is going to be a simple one peppermint oil just swish around a little bit of peppermint oil in your mouth it works way better than chlorhexidine mouthwash and at least combat the superficial issue of having the ketosis breath but remember it's not going to solve the problem because we're not dealing with a bad breath issue we're dealing with a chemical reaction in the body of acetone being a byproduct of fat metabolism the next one is patience okay and I've got a bonus one for you after this but patience is critical here's what's happening and why you have keto breath you have keto breath because you're not fully fat adapted yet if you've ever used a ketose strip okay where you urinate on a keto strip to see what level of ketosis you're in well that's measuring your excess levels of ketones excess okay you don't need excess if you have excess levels of ketones they're going to try to escape they're not just going to sit in your body that they're sitting in your body you'd go into ketoacidosis and end up really in the hospital and feeling sick so your body's excreting them it's doing what it's supposed to do but you want to get yourself to a point where your keto adapted and your body is utilizing every component of ketone bodies that it can so you don't have this byproduct of breath and excess ketones in your urine newsflash if you've been in ketosis awhile and if you test it on a urine strip you've probably found that the keto strips don't really register your ketone levels anymore after a while why because your keto adapted so we do want to make sure that you're giving it some time that breath will go away but that leads me to my next solution that kind of encompasses all of it utilize your fats better okay ketones are a byproduct of fat metabolism if you have too much fat coming in you will have excess ketones so therefore you may need to decrease your fat a little bit until your keto adapted if you're really battling with the bad breath issue and this is the simplest way okay so you back off the fats a little bit the other thing you can do is increase your low intensity cardio just a tiny bit you see the low intensity cardio utilizes beta-oxidation beta-oxidation is where you're using fat as a source of fuel like with low intensity cardio therefore you're going to burn up a few more of those ketone bodies so in short don't freak out about it it's not a bad thing it actually means your body's working and it means that ketosis is kicking in so don't be steered away by the fact that you have a fruity nail polish remover smell coming out of your mouth just eat a little less fat do a little more cardio gargle with some peppermint oil and hydrate the heck up I hope that this debunks the common myth that keto breath is bad and means that ketosis isn't working because I'm tired of hearing that it's quite the opposite it means ketosis is working you just need to fine tune it a wee bit I will see you in the next video make sure you comment what videos you want to see especially in the world of ketosis fasting and anything to that Sorge that we can capitalize on feeling our best and optimizing our brains our bodies and always our business - I'll see you in the next video", "BFTal3CgjdI": "[Music] China Hartford Cigna be cool or sexy ho time for my grooming kit me a Chino and

of a young lady you can see there is sinusitis and signs of allergic rhinitis that it's not turbulence what happens is that this mucus produced in the lining of the nose and sinuses has drain in the back that is the post nasal space and this cause this can cause bad breath because these substances have anaerobic bacteria Arabic or anaerobic both so another big bacteria survive for eat and flourish with the mucus protein not cysteine and methionine these are the proteins in the mucus so this manner of bacteria eats the protein and survive and cause bad breath and this also entered the crypts of the tonsils and produce sulfur containing material as well called the tonsil stones crypts containing tonsil stone and that also can cause bad breath the reason we tell patients not to use too much dairy products [Music] because the milk protein is very good for the another anaerobic bacteria to survive so that is solution we erase them not to use so much of milk milk products you know once it Harbor in the grips of the tonsil this poem bacteria and the put material form a lumps of particles called the tonsil stone which contains hydrogen sulfide and methylmercaptan furin compounds and which is the cause of the bad press because the bad breath can be done cos it can be from the from the nose from the sinus is from the tongue it's from the tonsil it's from the grand laryngitis it can be from dental so many patients get a bad from the dental was like a barrier or deities and dental caries these cases we refer them to the general surgeons then reflux disease gastroesophageal reflux disease is another common condition which can cause randomisation bad breath mouth breathing yes of course with the snoring and not everything you can get halitosis so these are the common go so of course some of the that can cause like you know like eating garlic and other things chemicals of course bad breath so liver disease and kidney disease diabetes these are the systemic diseases that gives funny featuring smells any lung infections of this smoking alcohol all these can produce all this can produce red fur it's very disturbing some patients don't get a bad process it is peel or they're afraid of having better that's for that I had it off obeah itself or beyond which it's a psychiatric problem a little phobia that is another condition or the pseudo halitosis some patients exaggerate as they have they have a hairy ptosis that is a machine to measure the additive habit ometer these are not every practice the best thing is to ask one of your close up ladies husband wife mother or father rajesh whether they have a bad smell devil's ever tell you so here we have a young lady who has got a chronic tonsillitis with the tonsil stone post nasal drip and gastroesophageal reflux about to undergo counseling to me she had a lot of pavement without any improvement her sinuses I showed you there is evidence of sinusitis also so we have to clean her sinuses and then maybe that'll be the inferior turbinate what we called the turbinoplasty a an of course tonsil removal and they're amazing and the pairings for reflux this is I think she should take continue taking and the

your blood vessel and also  remove all\nthe plagues in  your arteries to make the blood flow easy to and from\nyour heart what I have here is crushed garlic one clove of garlic\nthe reason why people's mouth smell when they eat garlic is because they chew the\ngarlic and when you chew garlic it gets between your teeth, it doesn't\nmatter how many times you brush your teeth smell will still be on your mouth\nso the best way to eat garlic is to crush the garlic. garlic is already crush\nI soaked it in olive oil . about two tablespoons of olive oil you want to\nsoak it in olive oil so that the natural oil in the garlic will get well\nmixed together with the olive oil for you to get the maximum benefits of\ngarlic is recommended not to cook garlic for you to get maximum benefits so it's\nbetter for you to eat it raw so after soaking it for about an hour\none clove of crushed garlic soaked in 2 tbsp of olive oil for one\nhour and then you are ready to consume you\nour garlic and this is how you consume your garlic you take it with olive oil a\ntablespoon is recommended for you to eat one gram of garlic in 24 hours so I have\nthis 1 tablespoon of garlic mix with olive oil and here is how you eat your\ngarlic so when you put it in your mouth you need to swallow don't chew that so\ntry to swallow the garlic so you don't bite on the garlic try as much as you\ncan to  swallow the garlic and you are going to be rinsing your mouth right away to \nflush out the smell from the garlic you   so flushing out the smell from your\nmouth you need one tablespoon of baking soda in a glass of water and one\ntablespoon of lemon juice together in a bowl and you are going to wiggle your\nmouth with this and then drink it as well this will help to eliminate the\norder from the garlic once you eat the garlic you rinse your mouth with glass\nof water one tablespoon of baking soda one  tablespoon of lemon wiggle your\nmouth clean out your brush your teeth HOW TO EAT GARLIC TO

Bob Payne a veterinarian in South Kendall comm let's talk about how to treat bad breath in cats the normal reason for bad breath and cats is caused by bacteria in the mouth which cause calculus or plaque sometimes the teeth are rotting so we need to have a veterinarian look at the teeth and make sure that there's no bad teeth the thing called feline owdown a classic resorption lesions that cause little caries or little holes in the side of the enamel that we actually have to x-ray and remove surgically so it could be a root abscess it could be a bad cavity it could be a lot of things one thing I want to warn you though I've seen bad breath and cats caused by uremia and uremia is usually caused by kidney failure if kidney failure occurs it's obviously something we need to be really really aggressive in treating find out how serious it is and see if you can circumvent the problem so go to your veterinarian have it there an area to look and make sure there's no dental disease there's no kidney problems and one other thing sometimes cancer I've seen looking back in the mouth and a cat squamous cell carcinomas are the palate and those things are very very bad so we need to find and see but we sometimes you need an auxiliary but in area that he or she can tell you to use topical treatment or if it's kidney failure we need to go in and find out how bad it is and if we can get rid of the real reason why the kidneys have failed and treat that as well so brushing teeth sometimes antibiotics will help orally if it's a bad and no bad abscess or something in the mouth so go to your veterinarian find out and define it", "j7c69XcJggA": "Sophie's eating a tuna sandwich and her meeting just got moved up to now so she tries new Listerine ready tabs she's chewing that tiny tab

fiancee had canceled their wedding and she was beside herself Jennifer had everything going for she was young she was attractive she was a career woman except for her chronic bad breath I desperately wanted to help Jennifer and so I spent every available moment at the Georgetown University Medical Library looking for any animal research papers related to bad breath while there were volumes of them going back over a hundred years no one had written about how to cure bad breath Jennifer was counting on me to find that protocol so with the consent of a number of my current patients I observe I tested and I treated different ways to help Jennifer alleviate her problem and I'm happy to say that it was totally successful [Music] what is the total here the total share is a complete removal of the cause of bad breath which is the bacterial biofilm that attaches itself to the top of the tongue and underneath the gums when that biofilm is removed the result is lasting fresh breath at the National Breast Center the technique we use is called tongue rejuvenation this is a painless technique that is a professional hands-on remedy for chronic bad breath [Music] it's not something you can

you've been chopping it the smell lingers on your hands and fingers probably longer than you'd like but there may be a way you can reduce the stench rubbing your hands with stainless steel is said to reduce the garlic with and there indeed there are plenty of companies that now sell stainless steel soap for that very purpose garlic is part of the Allium family which includes onions and leeks and is packed with smelly sulfur containing chemicals part of the plants natural defense system when fresh garlic is chopped the enzyme Aliyah neighs converts alanine into the pungent Alison which is one of the main chemicals responsible for the smell of fresh garlic but Alison is very unstable and converts into a range of other sulfur-containing compounds dial al disulfide is most likely the culprit responsible for the notorious odor the theory goes the sulfur binds to the chromium oxide on the surface of the stainless steel removing the chemical off your hands and lessening the smell chromium is what makes stainless steel so stain resistant it doesn't corrode rust or stain as much as ordinary steel does so does it work to remove garlic smells so - the experiment take a piece of garlic peel it and then slice out piece of the garlic place it between your hands and rub your hands together until you're sure your hands smell of garlic then we're going to go take a stainless steel and a plastic spoon over to the sink place your hand under running water and rub the stainless steel spoon against the surface of your hands for about ten seconds then take the other spoon the plastic one place that against your other hand and again rub that against your hand under the running water then we're going to have to get a volunteer to smell your hands okay and to make sure that person can't tell which hand is which they're going to have to put a blindfold on right so here's hand two number one and hand number two can you tell the difference between those hands did they smell different one definitely smelt more than the other one so did it work for you we'd like you to tell us you can do so by the simple online survey here it will ask you which hand smelt more the one that was rubbed with the stainless steel spoon the one that was rubbed with the plastic spoon or neither they both smelt exactly the same by taking part your results will help us determine where the stainless steel really does remove garlic smells is it a hit or a myth check the website to see the results in a few weeks and look out for our other hit or myth projects", "vDdH5tAdh8E": "hi I'm dr. Joe Namath I'm a paradox in Southfield Michigan one of the things that we do here is treat bad breath we have something called the Richter Center I think we were the first subsidiary of the Richter Center in the United States and we do a lot of bad breath treatment we have two parts to the bad breath treatment first part is diagnosing it do you really have bad breath or do you not well how do we really tell we do what's called organoleptic testing now that's a pretty fancy word isn't it that only means we actually will take a sample of what's causing the bad breath and sniff it and that will let us know very accurately whether you have bad breath or not so we take a piece of gauze typically we fold it up we take it on saw forceps and typically most bad breath is caused by certain types of bacteria that collect on the back of the tongue so we will sample the back of the tongue very very carefully and typically when there's bad breath this will come up yellow because those bacteria cause a yellow stain on the gauze and that will actually take a whiff of it take a sniff of it and see what we think we rate it from zero to five zero means we don't notice anything five means it's very very severe usually if it's a five we can tell just by walking into the room and there are two of us that sample it so we both have to come close to agreeing so first we check to see if there is bad breath if there is the next step will be the actual treatment of the bad breath and that is done usually at a second appointment so let's talk about that", "rmmg0WwjXO8": "morning chef 9 before the top of the hour we got our Morehouse graduate the one and only Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity incorporated ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the rings amount of money should not M take all yours in the cow goes Wow Rickey smiley good morning Jay how you doing man I'm doing wonderful great you know in addition to the Magic City Classic it is Homecoming weekend for Morehouse College because it's me so the spell house come coming it's gonna be this weekend activity starting today I'm speaking over Morehouse today as a matter of fact and it's going to be absolutely incredible so I'll shout out to all the Morehouse graduate students over there right now and for the homecoming activities it's a spell house homecoming Actives I know you're gonna be at the Magic City Classic so we're not gonna have you but I'm gonna get you over the ball house one year with the brothers just one of the outers homecomings Elbert I don't even know how they packed that meeting when the bagels over there block off all the streets in and everything man that was a that was an absolute pleasure to be able to uh I'm coming next year I think I'm gonna come next year all right we look forward to it okay now we're gonna talk about a couple of things one is the keto diet everybody's having great success with the keto diet and they say exactly how does that work dr. Collier well when you're ingest fat that has two options in your body you can either burn the fat or you can store the fat when you put your body in the condition of ketosis that burns fat and that will burn fat that you're eating in real time but it was also more importantly burn fat that it's being stored and that's how you start to body shape and get that look that you want you don't want to just lose weight but you also want to you know look curvaceous you don't want to look emaciated you want to look thin and fit and you know with those muscles being predominant so it makes you look good right there so we have a new product that we like to talk about this is a keto max this is a capsule that allows you to accomplish that without necessarily alter your diet substantially but it's got you know some magic things in there including the Garcinia cambogia green tea extract but more importantly it's got raspberry ketones and those raspberry ketones put you in that state of ketosis and you I'm saying you get sculpted so this is one of those things in addition to you know I always talk about the lipo drops etc but the the combination of those things will give you that body that you'd like we have been looking for an alternative therapy because everybody is on the keto diet or trying to be katatak but remember we talked about two things keto breath and keto crotch and so you don't want to get those things and with this wonder what I never heard about kyouto crotch Kido Kido breath you know your breath smells very very foul if you get on the keto diet once you ketosis your breath I mean it's as bad as it could possibly be and then keto crotch keto cracking it has nothing to do with your teeth you can brush your teeth and all of that but when you blow you say hello oh my god you're gonna blow sleepy go see some people backing up when you want when you on a keto diet and you have put your body in the state of ketosis that's why taking a tablet or capsule that will do that will accomplish that objective it will burn the fat without giving you the keto breath and the keto Christ your underarms smell as far as they can smell and your your private parts as foul as they can spin that's never good time I'm talking about it's not that's not fire volcano plasma I don't know what it is it's not something you want to be bothered with so like that happens to women too so that you happen to women oh it happens predominately to women but it happens to men as well I don't want me in to think they can't get keto crash because they get so heavy and the boys gonna be honest about rough jockstrap rough gym rough man gotta get some FD in you get this raspberry ketone and it will really really give you that objective to burn that fat so you will lose that weight so go to the website lipo drop that come and read about it and and then you'll see what we're offering here kiddo max what can you do about the breasts in the crotch well if you can't because if you want to lose away they remember the keto diet is very effective it really really makes you lose weight and make sure those the right weight the right way you know you don't and and and have people backing away from you because they be like oh my god with that RIM we'll see but also Riki is flu season I want to tell everybody right now we are really getting into the flu season ow go to your local pharmacy you're a Kroger your Publix your Walker your Walmart get your flu shot right now protect yourself it is the most effective way to prevent and protect yourself from the flu and let me state over and over again you do not get the flu from the flu shot you do not get the flu from the flu shot the very old flu vaccine from years and years ago from two generations ago did give you the flu it was the objective was to give you a mild case of the flu but often times it gave you a bad case of the flu and and I would just take my chances like everybody else I would not take that flu vaccine but now the new flat the new flu vaccine is an attenuated virus it cannot cause disease but it does give you protection so go get your flu shot right now all right now eight six six and every eight six six man Ric K ey biggest Baltimore to show Rickey smiley [Music]", "RTCfx6XidIY": "[Music] hello my beautiful Nicolette's welcome back to my channel or hello if you're new bad breath we have all been there done that and it can be quite embarrassing these tips are going to help avoid that situation and to make sure you never find yourself in that situation especially if you have stinky breath and you're on a date that is just hella and I've done so many videos lately on like things such as hygiene tags how to make sure you smell good all day long so I'll leave all those videos down below for you if you're curious but I thought I would do a whole video solely around that breath and how to avoid it let me know by leaving a comment down below for me letting me know one hygiene problem you may struggle with and then maybe I'll do a whole video on it and low tips and tricks on how to avoid it how to help that situation you guys have any questions or concerns you can always follow me on my social zyv Instagram Twitter snapchat and a Facebook page and you all know I'm very social on my Instagram so if you want to head over and talk to me on there you can always do so but that being said let's jump into the tips this first tip is really common sense but I thought I throw it out at the beginning and I know a lot of us dread it but that is to make sure that you are regularly seen your dentist and doing those checkups because you need to make sure that you're keeping up with your oral hygiene and of course the best way to do that is to make sure that you are staying up to date with your dentist I know a lot of us dread going to the dentist and it's not a fun time but once it's done over with you feel so much better about yourself that you did it of course the dentist is gonna know a lot more than we do and it's going to tell us if there's anything funky going up in there unless your dentists watching this or you're starting to be a dentist then you definitely know a lot more than me but for myself personally I definitely need me to go to it so they can tell me what's up if I have any questions or concerns they can always let you know you'd actually be really surprised that if you have a lot going on with your mouth and you're having problems with your gums and stuff it can actually lead to health problems all over your body so that is why it's really important to keep up as well as if all these tips and tricks don't work you may have chronic bad breath having a chronic bad breath and it not going away can actually be due to a serious problem that you're unaware of so the dentist is really gonna help to make sure that you are all good and that there are no problems another reason that can be due to bad breath I just want to throw this out there is that it can be due to tonsil stones which is actually quite common for a lot of us some of us experienced tonsil stones in our life some of us never do and they're just little pebbles and rocks in the back of our mouths that actually produce an odor which can be why you have bad breath more often and don't be scared or anything like that because you can remove them naturally at home it's not like it's a huge deal where you have to do a surgery or something like that it is super simple to get rid of if you ever do have any tonsil stones but I just want to throw that out there because some of you may be unaware of it the next tip is to make sure that you are brushing and flossing every single day and that means twice a day in the morning and at night I was actually shocked to hear that how many people miss the morning brush only brush at night or something like that which definitely you need a brush in the morning as well because we wake up with stinky breath most of the time morning breath as we like to call it so it's really important to make sure that you are personally keeping up with your own oral hygiene by brushing your teeth and flossing it is really important to brush your teeth because it's going to help get rid of the plaque and bacteria that's building up on your teeth and the boxing of course is going to help get rid of anything else that your toothbrush could not reach my little tape which I think is the most important so if you're gonna do anything and you haven't done this already switch over to an electronic toothbrush as opposed to a manual toothbrush I'll leave down below my favorite you can buy a sign off like Amazon or find them anywhere but my dentist has told me for years to make sure that using an electronic one which I have switched over to an electronic one for years and I love it I will never go back to a manual toothbrush in my life it's just once you get the work done a lot better than you doing it yourself so making sure that you are getting that electronic toothbrush because it's gonna make sure you get off as much plaque as you can yourself and to also make sure you're flossing so if you're someone who doesn't regularly flux because I feel it a lot of us skip flossing and that's something I definitely struggle with but something I found helps me to get into the rhythm of flossing is buying a little stick flosses which I buy a bunch of these off Amazon I'll have it linked down below as well but this is really great to start with if you're not super into flossing but you want to get into the habit because they're super easy they're really convenient you can also bring them in your purses put inside your knapsacks whatever it may be so starting off with those I think is really great but in the end it's really great to transition to the actual bus and my dentist has always told me that the flossing with like the string it's obviously the best it's gonna help get in those in between those places the best and it's just going to really get rid of everything all the bacteria and stuff that you have in your mouth so eventually I'd say trying to switch over to that but if you're gonna start and you don't really floss regularly then try those little stick floss is because doing something is better than doing nothing right if you don't floss regularly the food in between your teeth are going to feed into the bacteria in your mouth and the more nutrients that the bacteria in your mouth get the more the bacteria will give off those stinky acids which is what leads to bad breath it is really important to make sure keeping your gums healthy and not just your actual teeth our guns are what can cause bad breath bacteria gather in the pockets at the base of your teeth which causes an odor brushing those teeth and flossing and the which I feel like a lot of us forget to do and that is cleaning your tongue your tongue is actually a huge reason why you have that breath if you do and I feel like a lot of us forget to clean our tongue bacteria tends to stick on to your taste buds this releases a waste by-product that causes a gross stench so you need to make sure that you're not only cleaning if your teeth and keeping up with your gums but also cleaning your tongue you could do this either with a tongue scraper or you can use your electronic toothbrush that is why it is essential to have your electronic toothbrush and you can even just brush your tongue off if you don't have like a tongue scraper on hand or anything like that and that is gonna help get rid of the bacteria that usually causes your stinky breath and lastly I know a lot of us like to finish off our oral hygiene with a mouthwash a little tip that you should make sure that you're looking into is make sure that you're purchasing mouth washes that have no alcohol in them because a lot of mouth washes have alcohol in them alcohol drives out your mouth and it's always important to keep your mouth moist which we'll get into why later on but that is why you should switch to a non alcohol-based mouthwash like I said alcohol dries your mouth out and you want to make sure that your mouth is moist the saliva in your mouth actually washes out any food and as well as cavity-causing bacteria and I will get into further detail about that now so like I said it is important to keep your mouth moist stinky breath can actually be caused by not having enough saliva if you have things like alcohol or coffee that's gonna dry out your mouth so it's important to make sure you're keeping up with your water because your water is going to help moist in your mouth it's gonna help wash your mouth out and as well as it's gonna it's going to keep that area moist which is what you want because dry mouth compared to a mouth that is moist is more likely to lead to stinky breath saliva helps to clean your mouth up by washing and flowing around food particles and bacteria that is why coffee breath is a thing because coffee dries out your mouth which leads to a stinky breath that leads me into my next tip which is what you put into your body is important what you putting in your body is really gonna make a difference on how your breath smells on the outside the first tip I have for you is to eat more of your veggies this is really important because greens promote a more alkaline environment in a last breath causing acid in your body to balance out so that's why it's really important to add more green veggies into your diet another tip is to switch over to more crunchy healthy foods including things such as apple carrots and celery the reason for that is because those foods are going to remove foods stuck in between your teeth as well as rub away any bacteria that sits on them it kind of acts is a natural toothbrush in this sense another one is if you don't want to just drink water a lever tip I have for you is to drink more green juices as it posted things such as coffee the reason why is green juices contain the low level of acids as opposed to coffee which contains high amounts and another one is to eliminate orderest food as much as possible our body absorbs the food and the odors that we eat so if you're gonna eat a lot of things that are highly cut a lot of garlic in them onions and chives it's gonna show in the outside it's gonna protrude out and you're going to have more of a stinky breath but if you're going on a date or something like that try to avoid those food because it's not the greatest smell that comes out of your mouth when you have foods that are high in these types of things and lastly when it comes to putting things inside your body and that is just to take probiotics you can do that either pill form or you can have that through food such as Greek yogurt which is really full of probiotics probiotics are really great because it provides you with the enzymes that you need to break down the food that you eat it also decreases the chance of food fermenting into your stomach probiotics really help to give you a healthy gut and if you have an unhealthy gut of course you're gonna smell it more on the outside so you want to make sure that you're focusing on your gut and helping that in probiotics are the way to go the next one is just skip after-dinner mints and switch over to after-dinner gum and I do not mean those guns that are full of sugar I mean switching over to natural gum I actually love I think it's called pur pur gum I'll leave it down below it is a great alternative to God it's natural and it's not going to have sugar in it you don't want sugar because bacteria in your mouth loves sugar it uses sugar to make acid this wears down your teeth and in turn leads to bad breath so you really want to look for natural gum gum that doesn't have a bunch of sugar in it and the reason why you want to switch to gum instead of mints is because gum stimulates saliva while mints do not and like we talked about at the beginning you want to make sure that your mouth is constantly producing saliva because that is actually a good sign that you're not gonna have stinky breath the last and final tip which is super random and it's obviously not going to get rid of bad breath but it's really going to help when you're in a pickle or an emergency situation and you don't have that gum and that is you use flavored lip gloss so of course this is not going to get rid of your bad breath but it's going to help mask the odor I love my NYX butter glasses they smell like cupcakes and vanilla so I'll link those down below they're really cheap alternative and they actually are really great lip glosses as well may I add but it's just something that's going to help mask it if you're in a pickle maybe you're on a date you have nothing and you need something to help with your breath it's gonna help just a little bit and when you're in those emergency situations you will try anything those are my tips and tricks so hopefully

america's bad breath doctor dr harold katz to discuss the foods that you want to eat and the food you want to avoid this valentine's day dr katz thanks for joining us what exactly is bad breath and how do foods or treats or drinks cause it well bad breath is caused by bacteria they live the back of your tongue throat and tonsils and under certain conditions such as eating a lot of sugar which feeds the bacteria drinking a lot of alcohol which makes the mouth dry those bacteria produce what are called volatile sulfur compounds one chemical is called cadaverine now there's called putrescine you're the smell of rotting flesh so you just don't want that on valentine's day because no one's gonna kiss you all right so what what should we choose to eat this valentine's day to have better breath well you mentioned berries anything with a lot of liquids in them strawberries blackberries blueberries they have antioxidants and liquid simplest thing drink more water you need to replenish your saliva is nature's gift to us it contains oxygen molecules which are the uh the antithesis of bad breath oxygen actually gobbles up that sulfur compound uh now the problem is on valentine's day you're gonna have a little alcohol that's gonna make your mouth dry and most of the very strong mouth washes have tons of alcohol in it as well so you want to use a mouthwash or toothpaste which has oxygen in it and that's what the therapist formulas do these are available at target and walmart they work by actually releasing oxygen which puts a straight jacket around the bacteria so they cannot produce the sulfur compounds all right what should we avoid what should we avoid eating on sunday so my wife is happy with me well the worst thing is milk chocolate it contains sugar and it contains dairy in it as well but the solution is dark chocolate there's no sugar very very little sugar and no dairy at all so you're much better off the dark chocolate that's the solution that is so interesting all right you and i were talking in the break about masks and how the bad breath business is impacted by by masks and you said something really interesting kind of give us the breakdown so many people wearing masks we think bad breath is better but it's actually worse it's worse because you put the mask on and what happens the bad breath that you're exhaling all the time bounces off the inside of the mask right up into your nostrils so you're smelling whatever what everyone else has smelled over these years they're too afraid to tell you that your breath sucks now you know it yourself but secondly it alters the way you produce saliva again you want to make sure you have plenty of saliva uh you want that oxygen to attack the bacteria and that's what these do in fact what

target those volatile sulfur compounds but the one thing that you can do to tell if you have bad breath that's coming from your mouth it's a super easy lick and sniff test so you're gonna take your tongue and you want to get as much of your tongue on the back of your hand as possible you're gonna lick it you're gonna let that saliva almost dry and then you're gonna give that a sniff super easy to do takes about 20 to 30 seconds your kids can do it you can do it also look at the back of your tongue and see if it looks more coated than the front of your tongue not this area here but way back there and see what's happening so super easy get as much as your tongue on the back of your hand as possible give it a chance to dry give it a smell if that doesn't smell fresh what you want to do is really focus on your gargling and focus on cleaning the back of your tongue now in this house if we haven't gagged about three times we know our mouth isn't clean for us we get gaggy but we also know

soon bye you [Music] you", "mvCTIZJnk1g": "if you are like I was when I was pregnant you have smelly armpits vagina and breath it was not great and there's reasons a few reasons why pregnant women are stickier during during this fabulous time of life the first one with your underarm odor so during pregnancy your blood supply and your body temperature go up which means that your sweat glands are overactive I always always had sweaty pits when I was pregnant even in the winter it was gross okay a shift in your vaginal fragrance so the pH level in your vagina shifts during pregnancy and this usually creates almost like the sweet aroma like like dough or glues it's not really bad but it's an aroma if you have a yeast infection that can also cause a shift in odor but that'll also be combined with redness itchiness trust me you'll know if you have a yeast infection it's not fun and then if you have bacterial vaginosis this is accompanied by like an ammonia fish-like smell you all know if you have vegetable bacterial vaginosis so with either of those a yeast infection or the bacterial vaginosis go ahead and let your care provider know and they'll help you get rid of it the dragon breath oh man I have the worst pregnancy progesterone is to blame for this because it impacts the slant between your esophagus and your stomach and this causes like smelly gastric juices to bubble up um and in addition to that a lot of women develop a chronic stuffy nose during pregnancy and that creates more mouth breathing which dries out the saliva that usually helps to get rid of like pungent bacteria that lives in our mouths so that creates more bad breath um one thing to know is that you are probably the person that notices your stinkiness because pregnant women typically have seriously heightened a seriously heightened sense of smell so again you are probably the only one that notices the difference so don't be self-conscious about it but I don't want you to have to be like gagging over here on set during the day so there are things to do one of the first things is to always have organic like feminine wipes like wet wipes that are safe for your vagina in your bathroom and your purse so whenever you need a little freshening up just wipe out the vagina and you can use another one for your armpits to just like clear out bacteria and any funky smells I'm showering regularly of course helps if you're really sweaty it you can end the warmer shower with kind of like a cold plunge with cold water and that will help the the sweat glands close up to help to prevent that super fun phenomenon of getting out of the shower and starting to sweat again which always happened to me that the cold plunge thing can really help um so antibacterial products so a lot of the the stink that is caused is from yucky bacteria so after you take a shower you can wipe the areas that typically build up that bacteria and not sticking stinkiness with an apple cider vinegar mix so all you need to do is mix one part apple cider vinegar with two parts water you can dip a washcloth or something in that and then just gently wipe the outside of the vagina and then your armpits um honey coconut oil cinnamon cloves they all have antibacterial properties so any kind of you know body oil or lotion that has those ingredients that can help to fight the stink and an addition friction helps to remove bacteria so using like a sugar scrub once a week can help to get rid of any excess bacteria one of my favorite mixtures is melting a half cup of coconut oil mixing it with one cup white sugar you can use brown sugar if you want something that is a little bit prettier and just storing it in a mason jar after you dry off while you're still in the shower do that you can like really get soft skin doing doing this and then just rinse it off after you do the scrub once a week okay so if you're like really sweating and you're really stinky and you notice that your clothes are starting to smell even after you wash them something that you can do is after you do like a regular wash cycle to leave the clothes in the wash and put a half cup of distilled white vinegar in the wash and then just do an extra rinse and spin cycle because the vinegar helps to deodorize your clothes mm-hmm okay with the bad breath so again one of the reasons that we get the bad breath is because we're mouth breathing and we don't have enough saliva to wash out that bacteria so drinking lots of water can help to keep your at your breath fresh and then certain foods actually help to fight bad breath so leafy greens celery cucumbers pears apples pineapple Cherry's melons citrus fruit parsley basil and spirulina which was a surprising one all helped to fight bad breath sticking those in a smoothie or just washing on any of those those foods on their own could be really helpful um and last but not least avoid scented products because of course our natural inclination when we're stinky is to layer on perfumed products right but a lot of times especially when we're pregnant the scented products can can agitate the skin which is you're dating I'm so instead you can create like a natural perfume by using one of your favorite essential oils and mixing it with a carrier oil and just putting it on some of your pulse points I think that's about it that's why we have mega stink during pregnancy again you're mainly the only one that will notice your stink and those are a few things to try if there's anything that I missed that you found really helpful let me know in the comments [Music]", "ttixHEXQZYM": "[Music] hey guys it's Jen from two tips today's tip is going to be on how to get rid of ah back so if you have ever experienced bad breath then you might want to learn how to get rid of it and what might be causing bad breath so before I get into my tips on how to get rid of it I want to talk about what causes bad breath I think a huge contributor is diet so if you're not eating good healthy foods maybe you're not drinking enough water you're not hydrating yourself enough you might be getting bad breath because of that another thing is possibly acid reflux this is something that you might have to go see your doctor for just to make sure that's what it is but it's kind of like this feeling where you're burping and you think it might be just burping or heartburn but it's actually acid reflux and that can really cause your breath to smell another thing is sometimes when you chew food food particles can get stuck in your tonsils and over time they stay there and that can cause your breath to smell another thing is dental hygiene so you might have a cavity or maybe there's some issue with your gums so obviously it's really important to go see your dentist at least twice a year if not once a year to make sure there's nothing under and that you might have so now I'm going to share with you my top 5 tips on how to get rid of bad breath my first tip is getting one of these handy tongue scrapers you know it's so dirty sorry about that guys but um tongue scrapers are super super awesome for scraping off the particles and like food stuff from your tongue so what you do is oh and for people who have gag reflex this might not be the best solution but it really does help if you can't get really back there just try like the front part so what you do is you take this stick it at the back of your tongue like put your tongue out and scrape what you're gonna get is probably some really disgusting stuff at the top of your tongue scraper and that's the stuff that could be causing your bad breath so invest in one of these you're super cheap like two dollars you can get them at the drugstore so yes grab one of these things ten scrapers another thing is to obviously drink lots and lots of water other things that really help our citrus fruits like lemons and oranges these fruits help your mouth salivate so when you're about salivate it's actually flushing on all the toxins flushing on all the bad breath and food inside your mouth so try drinking lots of water and add some lemon juice or add some orange juice in it and that should help with bad breath my number 3 tip is something that you should be already doing and that is flossing and brushing your teeth every day after meals floss your teeth because food can get stuck in there and then rot and make your breath smell really bad you might not even know you have food in your gums until you floss it out and that's really really gross so remember to floss don't get lazy just floss your teeth and brush your teeth at least 3 times a day brush brush brush and that should help with your bad breath number 4 is diet like I said what could be causing you did have bad breath is having a healthy diet it's good for your body and it's good for your mouth as well so make sure you drink lots of water a lots of raw fruits and vegetables have green juice do all those things and you know try and limit sodium limit meats limit things that can cause bad breath and my number 5 tip is one of my favorite tips because I like herbal remedies as you might already know um peppermint tea is something that is so great for bad breath so I like to drink peppermint tea normally anyways so it's also really good for that and it's also really good for a digestion so if sometimes you might feel you know maybe a little bit uneasy peppermint peppermint tea is really really good for that another thing you might want to try is tea tree oil mouthwash instead of your Colgate Crest mouthwash because I've used those before and for the first 15 minutes it does work and it does seem like oh my breath is smelling so good and it's not stinky but after like 15 minutes I feel like it's coming slowly I personally don't think those work very well some of you might think they were great so that's good but I really like tea tree oil mouthwash I think it's great it's natural so what I do is just put it in a little cup and I just gargle gargle for about 30 seconds and spit it out and don't rinse your mouth after you spit it out you just leave it there if you're gargling a mouthwash and then you rinse your mouth full of water all that stuff is gone so there's no point in doing that so if you're doing mouthwash just gargle spit it out and be on with your day so those are my top five tips on how to get rid of bad breath I hope you guys like the video please subscribe to my channel comment below let me know what you think you can also follow me on Twitter

But keep your worries aside because we're here with some amazing lifestyle hacks that will help you prevent body odour! If you want more tips on how to stay odour free, type odour in the comments below and we'll send you a link to our exclusive guide with some more information. The mixture of sweat, bacteria and dirt from the environment that get accumulated on your skin results in body odour. It gets stronger with the dirt buildup and an irregular hygiene routine. Here are some tips you can follow to keep your underarms odour free. Mix together a tbsp of bentonite clay with a tbsp of rosewater. Add 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar to it and spread a thin layer of this detox mask on your armpits. Let it dry and wash off after 15 minutes. The properties of these ingredients will balance the skin\u2019s pH levels, draw out impurities and odour causing toxins from your skin. Deodorants are the perfect additions to your morning routine. Try out an alcohol free, mild and gentle deodorant that not only keeps body odour at bay but also cares for your sensitive underarm skin. A few drops of rosemary oil, peppermint oil or tea tree oil on your armpits will also keep your underarms smelling fragrant and keep you from sweating profusely. Try using a hand sanitizer or wet wipes to freshen up your underarms as they remove bacteria. If you\u2019re very conscious about bad breath, here\u2019s how you can reset some of your basic hygiene practices. Drink plenty of water as this keeps your mouth moist at all times. Swish cool water in your mouth whenever you feel like you\u2019re developing bad breath. Swish with an antibacterial mouthwash as it kills bacteria and any buildup which are responsible for halitosis. Scrape your tongue with a tongue cleaner or the back of your brush every morning to decrease the odour causing fungi and bacteria. Snack on parsley, cloves, raw carrots or apples as they are nature\u2019s toothbrushes & help clear your mouth of debris. Green tea & black tea prevent bad breath. One of the most common feminine concerns that we face on a daily basis is vaginal odour. To combat it you should mix \u00bd tsp of alum in a glass of water and drink up. Alum stops fungal growth by preventing the bacteria from gripping the vaginal wall. Clean pubic hair with coconut oil as it has natural antibacterial properties that help control odour. Wear cotton and soft fabric panties as they wick away all the sweat and keep the area clean and odour free. Do you turn up your nose when you slip off your flip flops or shoes? Here are some foot-friendly tips to control odour: Spray a little bit of dry shampoo in your shoes before wearing. This keeps your feet dry and powder fresh. Wear breathable socks that do not trap sweat and moisture in your feet and shoes. At-home treatments generally help reduce unpleasant body odour very easily. We hope you found this video helpful.

aka hwacha oma I'd say by out one night Journal ethnic barriers won a journal ethnic nor religious barriers so I think last week or some days ago I said you guys should vote I said my friend just got married and she said that her husband's nipples taste like onions but then like I I have like a hundred and one hundred and how many views I can't remember right now but then only I think ten or eleven people voted when i say press the like button there's one button like this and there's one button like this I think so yes so you press this button like which means yes let's talk about it and if you don't want to talk about it I said just write know in the comments section mine on roots no and I got more people saying we should talk about it so I decided I should tell you guys what happened what she said and we should address other issues too regarding the body um other issues like bad breath body or dough and you know taking care of yourself because this is this is very important as a necessity so for the first topic the onion the onion the onion so of course they're they're newlyweds they got married and you know in the process of foul play and things like that in the bedroom um she she did what she did and then she said it tasted like nipple um it tastes like onions and then this is where the story takes a turn when he played with her he said baby yeah energy nickel zinc and I Jason come on over sir you see where women are better than men she did not want to tell him because she don't want to bruise his ego you know his self-esteem and to be honest yes it's a turn-off you know if you have bad breath or you have body or dough or you have some kind of an abnormality on your body it's it's a turn-off it makes it to turn your partner off and then you yourself it makes you you lose confidence you're not confident about you know you know you're not confident about yourself anymore die or it's it's it to bruise your ego so he didn't mind you know ah he was kicked out baby Yeti like um nipples and chitosan abasa and it really bruised her if what this is the reason why she went told me but if I had told you this guys before then the story wouldn't be the story the story is meant to be like oh yeah this is on point so this is where now she got worried about her condition and her situation and everything and she said that it has affected their bedroom life I don't want to use the S word cuz a lot of nieces and nephews watching me you know I don't want them picking up proper for me so she said that it has affected their bedroom life because um ego intense who she she's not really you know confident about that and if he wants to go there she tells him no don't bite a Sakuma so let me tell you guys the cause and the solution um we all have on our bodies sweat glands right so um when you like when you want to be with someone your partner your husband and you do not brush your teeth properly when the bacteria there's a hormone there when the bacteria from your mouth mixes with the bacteria there it gives that when the bacteria from your mouth mixes with the hormones there it gives um that onion taste so it's more in some people unless in some which means you might taste it more and others unless in others then the other reason it's not it's not what I did to blow Valerie was wait and maja wha maybe so much onions now organic or something no no no it has nothing to do with that at all so now the the solution I have two solutions we went to my dermatologist and you know we talked about it and um she said this is a nipple cover it it's can you see it it has like a classic you can pull off and this is very sticky this part is very very sticky so you put it on your you know on the spot and you do something vigorous something to make you sweat a lot like going to the market if you know you're going to Micah for the whole day or ah going to the gym yes right when you're going to the gym so that when you sweat a lot well it's sticky normally but when you sweat a lot it becomes um slippery because you know the sweat so it doesn't stick that's the essence to make you sweat a lot no it's not much made for that is made to actually cover you up when you don't feel like wearing a bra but then we discovered that it helps to take care of that problem so when you take it off you wash yourself clean yourself and you're good to go then this is another solution Crusader you guys are seen upside down right well Crusader soap you can find it original there's a lot of thick but you can find the original at a big coarse doors in area two you just rub it on the spot for like um 30 minutes to one hour depending depending on how hard you continue because it's very strong then you wash it off this will help if you have this problem this is also good for body order if you have body order some people use lemon but some lemon doesn't work for them so if you have body order you take your Crusader soap soak it in water and rub it and you stay for like an hour and wash try as much as you can to do morning night afternoon - two hours three three hours you know dependent on because if you have body order is really serious because even if you were seeking for a job and you come out there smelling bad the thing they're going to think of is although talk about oh my god he has such a body order oh he's so intelligent but he has but it oh she's so intelligent but she has body order so body order especially us women it's very important for us to take care of these things you know sometimes men do get away with these things but if you're one it's a necessity absolute necessity for you take care of your body every single / every single inch every single knuckle of your body has to be taken care of do not take chances then bad breath the big problem I swear to God when a person approaches approaches me the first a guy of course the first thing I look at is your teeth if you're teeth is not looking good or

Dr. Axe here, Doctor of Functional Medicine\nand founder of DrAxe.com. In today's video I'm going to share with you\nthe six steps you need to follow in order to cure bad breath. Obviously, nobody likes bad breath, but the\nbigger thing is it's typically an underlying sign that there's something not going right\nin your body, and that tends to be a bacterial imbalance or lack of detoxification. So if things tend to sit in your system or\nif there's an imbalance of good probiotics and bacteria and microbes in your body to\nbad, those are typically what are actually causing some of your issues. So to start I'm going to go over the six things\nthat you need to do. The number one thing you need to do in order\nto overcome bad breath is get more probiotics in your diet. Consume more probiotic rich foods, especially\nthings like grass-fed yogurt and kefir, and take a quality probiotic supplement. For many of you guys you want to double-down\nand take a double dose of probiotics a day. But probiotics, without a doubt, can help\nkill off yeast and bad bacteria and those sort of microbes that can be causing bad breath. So again, probiotics are crucial. The next thing you want to do, number two,\nis use peppermint essential oil. Peppermint oil gives that lasting fresh breath\ntaste, has a pleasant odor, and also has certain types of compounds in it that actually can\nhelp kill off bad bacteria in your body. So again, peppermint oil. What I like to do is actually I make a homemade\ntoothpaste, mixing probiotics, coconut oil, peppermint oil, and a little bit of baking\nsoda. You can make a homemade toothpaste that way\nthat actually gives you some great tasting breath. You can even add just a drop of peppermint\noil to your water a few times a day, and it can be used in that way. The third thing you want to do to eliminate\nbad breath is use some baking soda. In fact, after a meal you can just put in\na pinch of baking soda. Now you typically want to do this between\nmeals, not during meals, but a little bit of baking soda as well can help eliminate\nbad breath. The reason is baking soda is very alkaline,\nand other ways to alkalize your body and help improve your breath is by drinking more green\njuices. Now you don't want to do juices that have\nfruit because those will actually make your breath worse. But doing green juices, especially wheat grass\njuice, things that are high in chlorophyll, like kale and parsley and cilantro, a lot\nof those leafy greens, cucumber and celery, those can help eliminate bad breath, which\nbrings me to my next one. Parsley. In fact, parsley is known for helping eliminate\nthe odor from garlic. So if you have too much garlic or something\nor too much vinegar and your breath smells like that, parsley has been shown to help\nneutralize odor. Part of the reasons is it is one of the highest\nherbs and vegetables in chlorophyll, if not the highest. So again, using parsley. You can just chew on some parsley after a\nmeal or add it to a salad or juice it. Those are great ways to add parsley into your\ndiet. And then last, but not least, drink more water\nwith lemon or lemon essential oil. You know water really helps keep things moving\nin your systems, helps flushing things out. So again I recommend take your body weight\nin water, ounces of water. So if you weigh 150 pounds, you want to be\ndrinking 75 ounces of water a day. Make sure you're getting plenty of water. Again, I add either a little bit of lemon\njuice or a drop or two of lemon essential oil, which can help continue to clear out\ncandida and some of those things out of your system that can be causing bad breath. So those are the six things you do want to\ndo. I want to mention this finally. The things that can really cause bad breath\nis consuming too much sugar. That plain and simple is one of the biggest\nthings that will cause bad breath. So again, reducing your sugar intake, loading\nup more on healing foods like vegetables will also help. If you do that, you're going to see great\nresults. Hey, if you want to find some natural, do-it-yourself\nrecipes using things like peppermint oil, I have a couple of recipes for homemade toothpaste\nand homemade mouthwash if you search on DrAxe.com. Just go to DrAxe.com and search toothpaste\nor homemade toothpaste and search mouthwash, and you'll find it in our DIY recipe section. I know that if you use those products and\nfollow these six steps, you're going to see great improvements in your breath.

It\u2019s awkward and distracting, and nothing\nruins a social situation faster than realizing that everyone is trying to guess what you\nhad for lunch that day. Bad breath can be stem from a number of causes,\nbut one of the biggest factors is what you eat: according to dental professionals such\nas Dr. Steven Lin, foods like garlic, onions, fish and dairy products can all contribute\nto bad or odorous breath, especially when eaten in large quantities. While a lot of these problems can be fixed\nby brushing your teeth, you might not always have the opportunity, especially if you\u2019re\non a date or in the middle of an office party. Never fear, Bestie\u2019s got your back to help\nyou with all of your bad-breath-related needs: All you need to do is subscribe and click\non the notification bell for our channel. That way, you can stay up to date on all of\nour daily videos and content. The good news is, even if you\u2019re not the\ntype of person to carry a toothbrush with them at all times, there are a variety of\nways to combat bad breath in a pinch. In addition to maintaining proper dental hygiene,\none of the more effective ways you can fight against consistent bad breath is by paying\nattention to your diet: While many foods are known to cause bad breath odours, there are\njust as many that you can consume to eliminate those odours as well. Here are seven foods that can help eliminate\nbad breath. Who knows, maybe this list will come in handy\none day. After all, life is unpredictable, and you\nnever know when you might need to make a fresh first impression! #1: Sugar-Free Gum You probably already knew that chewing gum\nhelps to freshen your breath, but you might be interested in how it does this: According\nto professionals such as the ones at the Smile Direct Club, sugarless gum contains xylitol,\nan alternative sweetener with the added benefit of inhibiting bacteria commonly found in the\nmouth. The act of chewing gum also engages your salivary\nglands and increases saliva production, which also assists in flushing out the bacteria\nresponsible for breath odours. In addition to getting rid of bad breath,\nxylitol also helps to reduce plaque and prevents the onset of tooth decay. Talk about a win-win situation! #2: Parsley While many people see parsley as little more\nthan a decorative garnish, the plant actually comes packed with a variety of health benefits,\nincluding the prevention of bad breath odours. To cite Dr. Lin again, parsley is rich in\nchlorophyll, as evidenced by its bright green colour, which serves as a natural cleanser\nand deodorizer against the bacteria responsible for bad breath. Additionally, parsley is also known to have\na number of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and can even help to bolster your\nimmune system against certain diseases. Of course, it should be noted that the breath-freshening\nqualities that parsley has to offer are mostly temporary. Nevertheless, sprinkling some parsley flakes\non a garlicky pasta dish might be just the thing you need in order to prevent an awkward\nfirst date. #3: Green Tea A cup of tea can be a great way to relax after\na long day, but did you also know that green tea can help prevent bad breath? Specifically, green tea contains a powerful\nantioxidant known as catechin, which is effective at - you guessed it - eliminating the bacteria\nthat causes bad breath. And that\u2019s just scratching the surface;\ngreen tea is fully loaded with health benefits as well, ranging from assisting with weight\nloss to reducing the risk of cancer. Move over, coffee! #3: Green Tea#4: Cinnamon #5: Yogurt #6: Almonds\n#7: Cherries With its unique taste, cinnamon is a fan favourite\nfor dessert lovers everywhere. Now, I know what you\u2019re thinking: does being\non this list mean that cinnamon buns are healthy now? That sounds too good to be true! Well...not exactly. While a cinnamon bun is still only about as\nnutritious as any other dessert, chewing on a stick of cinnamon might help to keep your\nbreath nice and fresh. This is because cinnamon contains an essential\noil that not only eliminates bad breath but also keeps your breath smelling fresher for\nlonger. You can even try mixing cinnamon with honey\nand lemon juice to create your own homemade mouthwash! #5: Yogurt With its abundance of protein, vitamin D,\nand calcium, yogurt is a healthy addition to any diet. But as it turns out, yogurt can also be very\nuseful when it comes to preventing bad breath. According to a study conducted by Japanese\nresearchers, unsweetened yogurt can be highly effective when it comes to reducing hydrogen\nsulfide, a compound commonly responsible for causing breath odour. Just something to keep in mind the next time\nyou\u2019re in the dairy aisle of your grocery store. #6: Almonds If you\u2019ve ever been on a hike through the\nwoods and needed to pack some trail mix to snack on along the way, then chances are you\u2019re\nalready familiar with our friend , the almond. Almonds are high in fiber, protein, and a\nvariety of helpful vitamins such as vitamin E and B2, making them a convenient and nutritious\nsnack to take on the go. If that wasn\u2019t enough, almonds can also\nbe incredibly useful for reducing bad breath in the long term. The nutrients found in almonds, such as calcium,\nhave been found to help reduce tooth decay as well as strengthen the enamel of your teeth\nand prevent gum disease. Not only do these benefits reduce the chances\nof chronic bad breath, the prevention of tooth decay and cavities means that these nuts could\nalso potentially save you a few unwanted trips to the dentist as well. Thanks, almonds! #7: Cherries And now, let\u2019s round out our list of foods\nthat reduce bad breath with a cherry on top. With an abundance in antioxidants, cherries\nare certainly useful for more than just topping off a sundae. Eating cherries also has the benefit of eliminating\nodours created from methyl mercaptan, a gas released by bacteria as it breaks down food\nin your mouth. Consider these tasty fruits as a sweet dessert\nalternative to not only stay healthy, but also to keep your breath smelling great! So there you have it: seven foods that can\nhelp fight against the effects of bad breath. If you ever catch yourself in a situation\nwhere fresh breath is essential, be on the lookout for one or more of these foods to\nhelp make sure that your breath is ready Of course, it\u2019s worth remembering that none\nof the examples we\u2019ve listed here are a substitute for regular oral hygiene, so if\nyou really want to keep your breath fresh in the long term, remember to brush, floss,\nand use mouthwash!

that lasts more than 24 hours could also be a sign of gingivitis intestinal problems or even more serious conditions if you brush your teeth and floss but you still can't get rid of the smell go to the doctor or dentist you should also go to the doctor if your breath smells sweet as this may be a sign that you have diabetes suppose you take a breath test on the way to an important meeting and the result is not good don't worry the following quick fixes can minimize the halitosis if your gums tongue and teeth harbor bad smelling bacteria you need to adopt some rigorous hygiene habits that inhibit their development this is where special mouthwash comes into play the attention paid to toothpaste and regular brushing and cleaning of teeth one a dry mouth is an ideal place for bacteria that cause bad breath so you always need to have a bottle of water on hand walk a little water through your mouth the water will temporarily remove the bacteria and reduce the unpleasant odor two at the end of the business lunch or romantic dinner chew the remaining parsley threads on your plate parsley is rich in chlorophyll a reputable deodorant that also has antibacterial properties three if you can find an orange peel it and eat it the citric acid it contains will stimulate the salivary glands to produce more saliva four if you do not have an orange at hand eat whatever is available except mouth pollutants such as garlic onion or fragrant cheese consumption of food encourages saliva secretion which helps remove the material that produces the odor from the tongue's surface five vigorously brush your tongue with your teeth it can be coated with bacteria that ferment proteins producing gases that smell bad rubbing your tongue dislocates these bacteria so you can remove them if you have a metal or plastic spoon on hand you can use it to scrape your tongue to avoid injury place the spoon as far back as possible on the tongue and pull it forward repeat four or five times scrape the side of your tongue with the same motion six cloves are rich in eugenol a powerful antibacterial break one in your mouth and bend it with your teeth aromatic oil may burn a little so stir it constantly continue to bite until the essence has penetrated well into the mouth then spit it out do not use clove oil or powder they are too strong and can cause burns seven chew fennel dill nutmeg or anise seeds anise which tastes like licorice can kill bacteria that grow on the tongue the others will help you mask the bad smell eight suck a cinnamon stick like cloves cinnamon is an effective oral antiseptic 9. the vast majority of popular products listed as oral air fresheners are rarely if ever effective in the long run but it seems that rinses that contain chlorine dioxide can fight the compounds responsible for halitosis 10. use a toothpaste that contains tea tree oil a natural disinfectant if you can't find it in pharmacies look in health food stores 11. use an oral irrigator a device that uses a fast jet of water to wash away bacteria from your mouth you can go deeper with it then with a toothbrush or floss 12. bring a toothbrush with you and wash it after every meal toothbrushing prevents the development of tartar the film that covers the teeth and gums a piece of good advice is to wash immediately after a meal if you have eaten foods with corrosive properties such as cola or citrus they can affect your teeth even more in this case it is better to wait an hour after the meal to brush your teeth to keep your toothbrush free of bacteria store it upside down in a plastic cup with hydrogen peroxide in it rinse the toothbrush thoroughly before using it 13. if you wear a prosthesis it may absorb an unpleasant odor always soak it overnight in an antiseptic solution unless your dentist has advised otherwise 14. don't skip meals when you do not eat for long periods your mouth will dry out a lot becoming an excellent place for bacteria to grow 15. some things can increase your bad breathing even when there are no bacteria these are cigarettes alcohol onions garlic and moldy cheeses such as camembert roquefort and other blue cheeses in situations where pleasant breathing is needed use the common sense approach say no to these foods six ask your doctor if the medicines may be the cause of the breath any medicine that dries your mouth leaving you without saliva is a potential suspect these may include antihistamines decongestants weight loss pills and over-the-counter medications for depression rheumatoid arthritis and high blood pressure but how bad does your mouth smell to find out do a smell test on the floss after using it to clean your teeth but only if you have a wax-free unscented assortment another alternative is to

I am Erum & welcome to my channel. Today's video is all about \"BAD BREATH\". Many people suffer from this issue but unfortunately very few are aware of their bad breathing. And if our society, we make fun of others for no reason but we feel shy to let others know about their shortcomings. I have noticed, many people having bad breath issues are not aware of it and no one around them either their family members or friends do not bother to tell them about this problem. So, this video is all about Bad breathing issues in which I'll share with u all the reasons behind bad breath, then I'll talk about treatments of bad breath & lastly I'll share with u all a home made \"Mouth refresher\". I'll mention the timings beside these topics so that u can jump straight into the topic u like most. So, lets get started but before that do not forget to subscribe to my channel & hit on the bell icon to get notification of all new videos. Some of the reasons of bad breath which scientifically is known as \"Halitosis\" are: You bad Oral Hygiene. Those who do not take care of their oral hygiene, suffer bad breathing issues \"most\" Next reason of Bad Breathing is SMOKING, so those who smoke regularly also suffer from halitosis. Thirdly, there are some food items which cause bad breath and make ur teeth pale. Some food items are garlic, onion, tea, and coffee. Another reason of bad breath is any digestion issues or stomach bloating issues. Gum diseases is another reasons of Halitosis. Those who suffer from extreme gum issues, which go untreated for long, also suffer from bad breathing issues. Another reasons is when you don;t take care of ur oral hygiene, a whitish/yellowish layer is formed on or at the base of ur teeth which is called Tartar. This tartar also causes bad breath. Lastly, sugar patients could also have an issue of halitosis. Now let's talk about treatment of Halitosis. I know internet is full of DIYs and tips and tricks to get rid of your bad breath But TRUST ME, TRUST ME, TRUST ME, if u have bad breath issues and u don;t treat it clinically, YOU ARE RUINING UR TEETH. I agree if one has temporary bad breath coz of eating certain food like garlic, onion etc you can remove it by simply brushing or using mouth wash. But if u are a smoker, or on any medication, or have any gum issues, have bad oral hygiene etc. You SHOULD see a dentist to get yourself treated medically. I understand many people get afraid of the word \"DENTIST\" :D :D but there is nothing to be afraid of. Simply visit ur dentist, he/she'll check ur teeth conditions & would diagnose the treatment for ur bad breathing issues. Many even do not know they are suffering from Gums issues or have tartar on their teeth, or have some oral issues which cause bad breath. Now u may ask \"How to know if I've bad breath or not \"? Simple answer is, ask ur dear ones like ur spouse, children, parents siblings or friends around you to confirm if u have any bad breath or not. And if u are one of those who feel shy to ask about \"MOUTH SMELL\" issues then what you can do is simply lick your wrist or thumb a bit and let it dry. When the area dries up, simply sniff it. If that area is unpleasantly smelly it means you have bad breathing issue. And if that are doesn't smell or have very mild smell, it means u dont have any bad breathing problem. And in case of bad breathing, see a dentist immediately. Second treatment is Brushing your teeth whenever u eat meal. Because Halitosis is caused by remaining food particles in ur mouth which r then broken into sulphur compounds by the bacteria already present in everyone's mouth. So, brushing allows u to remove all food particles out of your teeth hence eliminating bad breathing problem. Another thing which is of huge importance but usually people ignore it is \"FLOSSING\". You can easily find flossing threads in superstores or pharmacies. Simply buy any dental floss and after brushing ur teeth, Work the floss from top to bottom, making several passes. Rub the floss against the side of your tooth to clean it In short flossing removes food particles, plaque, and debris that brushing can\u2019t reach You can search for flossing tutorials on youtube as well. One more thing which I have noticed is Some people have clean teeth, take proper oral hygiene still they have bad breath. Reason behind that is not cleaning ur tongue. Just stand in front of a mirror with ur tongue out of ur mouth.If you tongue is pink or slightly white, it is normal. But if the tongue has thick white or yellowish layer because of bacteria and debris, it could also cause bad breath. So, after brushing and flossing, always scrap your tongue with brush or tongue scrapper. Dehydration and Dry mouth also cause bad breathing so, keep urself hydrated  by drinking atleast 8-10 glasses of water per day. Another treatment is, daily go for Mouth wash. Usually we ignore this step and think only brushing is enough to take care of our oral hygiene. But mouth wash plays huge role in keep your breath fresh and clean. Your oral hygiene should be of 3 steps - Brushing, flossing and Mouth wash. Last treatment is MISWAK (Arabic name of teeth cleaning twig) Muslims must have known how important is miswaak for  teeth health. So, you may use miswaak as well for your oral hygiene. And again, am saying Do visit a dentist whenever u have any oral issues instead of going for tips and tricks and DIYs. I agree if you have some minor dental issue, for the first u may try some DIY but if the issue is constant, if ur gums bleed while brushing or eating anything, please visit a dentist as these issues are a sign that u may be suffering from oral issue which need to be treated professionally on time. Now I'll share with u all \"Home made Mouth Refresher\". You'll make it at home with extremely inexpensive ingredients. For mouth refresher , you need: Ground Cardamom = 1 Tablespoon Ground fennel seeds= 1 Tablespoon Desiccated Coconut = 1 Tablespoon Rock sugar = 1 Tablespoon Just remember do not grind these ingredients finely. Now mix all these ingredients in some air tight jar and your mouth refresher is ready to eat. Keep 1/2 tsp of it in your mouth and you'll see all your bad breath will be gone in no time In case of any emergency like attending some meeting, seeing some friends or family the easiest solution to get rid of bad breath is chew some mint flavoured gum n u r good to go. Hope u find the video useful and if u have any friend or family suffering from bad breath, Do let them know about it as u telling them the truth about their breath will save them from embarrassment in front of others. See u soon, till then take care.

channel if you're a subscriber you already know that i'm all about beauty health hygiene lifestyle and a little bit of everything if this is your first time here or you've watched my video but you haven't subscribed please go ahead and do so this morning i woke up and i washed my face i wanted to clean my mouth but i thought maybe i should you know show you guys how i do that every day because i feel like it will help someone who is battling with mouth order most times it's really not a health condition it's just using the right tool and knowing how to use them believe me mouth order is the worst like is the worst thing that can happen to anybody and you can imagine the situation where you're out with friends you can talk you can socialize you know like you want to or when you're talking you notice that people is either they're touching their nose or they're cleaning their face even when they're not sweating so today i decided to tell you what you need to use how to use them so you can be able to get rid of mouth order for good so if you're interested to know please keep watching welcome back my name is vera and i'm just going to go ahead and explain to you everything that we need and step by step how to use them so that when i head over to brush i'll no need to talk okay so cleaning your mouth every day isn't just a way to keep your mouth feeling clean it's a way to keep your whole body healthy too it is recommended to brush twice per day two minutes each time when you brush correctly you eliminate the plaque buildup and bacteria that can otherwise build between your teeth and on your tongue this can prevent gum disease and tooth decay as well as promote a stronger immune system and a healthier lifestyle so what do we need we need a toothbrush okay and i have to here so you can see the difference in the this one both of them are good actually but this is like the best to me this is the standard toothbrush you can see that the tip of the bristle is a little longer than the other part so it's good because it can go in and clean every area that this kind of toothbrush can't so this is perfect then your toothbrush should be replaced every three to four months if your toothbrush has been overused the bristol can become frayed and brushing loses some of its efficacy okay then the next one is our fluoride toothpaste fluoride toothpaste is approved because it fortifies your teeth against decay then the next one is our floss this is what we'll use today and then the next is tongue scraper obviously there's so many options for this okay there's a traditional tongue scraper you can use a spoon but i'm about to introduce to you the best that i use which is this dinner knife yeah i'll explain it later okay then the next one is our mouthwash okay make sure to get a mouthwash is very important to use a mouthwash after brushing how to clean your mouth properly step by step i would like to introduce to you baking soda yeah i use that sometimes not every day i like to use baking soda before flossing i brush with baking soda then i go in with my flaws so i can take out any tiny particles of it between the teeth it's like doing a deep cleaning let me tell you most commercial toothpaste add baking soda to their formula to give it extra whitening power because baking soda does a good job at helping it to lift stains off your teeth you can do that too but not every day all right then the next step will be flossing flossing provides special benefit to your order helped dental floss cleans deeper than a toothbrush and it releases food particles from hard to rich places in your mouth flossing lifts and removes plaque from your gum line and from between teeth it does not matter if you brush your teeth three times a day and rinse with mouthwash following every meal the gems and sticky bacterias will still gradually build up if you do not floss your teeth okay you can floss once a day yeah you can do that maybe at night it's very important next step will be brushing yeah the simplest way to brush your teeth involves your standard plastic handled nylon braided toothbrush the entire process should take about two minutes yeah two minutes you can even use a timer to make sure it's two minutes now to the main thing like this tongue scraper i would like to emphasize more on this tongue scraping is the fastest way to remove extra particles including the ones that cause bad breath from the surface of your tongue it's mostly done with a small slightly rounded tool made from plastic or metal but like i said my favorite tool that i want to introduce to you i feel that this does the job well dinner knife please do not use a knife don't wound yourself although no amount of scraping can replace a good tooth brushing its benefits have made it important to add this extra step to your morning and evening routine tongue scraping is beneficial because um bacteria debris and dead cells can build up on your tongue over time which can lead to bad breath and have a negative impact on your overall oral health so using a tongue scraper can help remove the build up as well as improve your sense of taste tone scraping can improve the appearance of your tongue yeah daily scraping can help remove white coating on your tongue and prevent it from returning for sure it's reduced bad breath i can tell you it's more effective than brushing than brushing at removing the other causing bacteria one more thing that you need to know although scraping can help banish bad breath consistency is the key using a tongue scraper in the morning won't prevent bad breath from developing or maybe later in the day so bacteria will build up as you eat and drink all you need to do if you're concerned about your bad breath is to scrape every after every meal or at minimum morning and nights when you're brushing your teeth okay then um what again another misconception is that using a toothbrush on your tongue is just as effective as using a tongue scraper but that's not true even if you decide to use hard brush it's still not enough you will need to scrape your tongue use this you will like it you will really like it like i've used it for a long time and it does the job well to perform tongue scraping follow these steps stand in front of a mirror open your mouth and stick out your tongue gently go in with this dinner knife make sure the tip of the dinner knife touches the back of your tongue yeah but if you're worried about gagging you may find it helpful to start at the middle of your tongue maybe you can gradually start from you know at from the back as you get used to scraping gently touch the scraper to your tongue slowly pull it forward towards the tip of your tongue you should never push the scraper from the tip to the back no always go from the back down to the tip it's possible to accidentally cut the surface of your tongue with the scraper too but to prevent this from occurring make sure your thumb scraper doesn't have any uneven or rough edges you should inspect your scraper before every use to ensure that it's still safe to use and also you should be mindful of how much pressure you are applying be gentle enough to avoid harming your taste spot or breaking the skin then the last step will be our mouth wash just pour your oral rings of choice into the cup provided with the product or a plastic measuring cup empty the cup into your mouth and swish spit the mouthwash out into this the sink don't drink water the fluoride in it will help prevent to decay so yeah so let's head over and brush my teeth [Music] do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] so now that we are done other ways to improve your oral health is by drinking plenty of water throughout the day to reduce dry mouth which is a common cause of bad breath okay avoid using tobacco products which can contribute to build up on the tongue and then you should also see a dentist for regular checkups and cleanings okay most dentists recommend cleaning twice a year but you may need to go more frequently depending on your overall dental health so that's it thank you so much for watching hope you learned something from this video

lemon and lemon has anti bacterial properties it's a very microbial properties as well as antioxidant properties that helps to fight bad breath this is very very good because it has been used in ancient times for a long time now to fight bad breath and also to fight although this also works great when it comes to fighting body order these are lemon I'm not making use of a line it is what our Nigerian land one looks like and this is exactly what I'll be using for this next ingredient I'll be making use of is baking soda and baking so that is another popular ingredient dyes good when it comes to getting rid of bad breath baking soda here helps to fight odor because of the properties in it the cells fight although not only does it help fight mouth odor it also helps to fight body odor and helps to make the mouth to be fresh you can get your baking so that in any packing shop close to you or just check out supermarkets you will find a baking soda or you check the link in my description box it will take you to where you can buy baking soda on Amazon to prepare this I'll be getting a small ball like this you can make use of its smaller container with a lid if you have one and I'll just be needing one teaspoon full of baking soda pour that into my bowl then the next thing I'll do is to get my lemon and I'll just cut it into two I'm just removing the lemon seeds here because I don't want to have to lemon sit in that in my treatments [Applause] and then I'll go ahead and squeeze this into the baking soda [Music] then I'll go in with the second half of the lemon for this as well when I'm squeezing in one whole lemon into these treatment is because I'm not making it for one use we are going to have to preserve this in the refrigerator for for repeated use now this is what it looks like the bubble is everywhere and I will just go ahead and stage now if we are looking for a treatment that you can use for bad breath these won't treatments that has been proven to work very well so you see what it looks like now the bubbles from the reaction between the lemon and the baking soda is everywhere and I'll just keep stirring it like this till everything is well mixed so for those of you that may ask if what if you don't have the kings of that so there's you can't really replace baking soda in this treatment because baking soda here is going to help it walk really really fast but if you want to replace it if you really really don't have baking soda you can't get your hands on baking soda then you can go ahead and make use of salt make use of your sea salt for this or make use of Epsom salt for this but using baking so that is the best bet when it comes to getting rid of malt or the very fast the next thing I'll be needing for this is water so I'm just going to add in water into this that's because if I don't add water this is going to be really really concentrated and it's made hot your enamel if you go ahead and use the baking soda a lemon like this so I'll be adding in some water then I'm just going to stay talk like this so I'm going to stay up like this and also making sure that everything is well mixed so after preparing this treatment if you find out that after using it it bonds then you can go ahead and dilute it a little bit add a little more water state really well so before I show you how to make use of this let me tell you how you are going to preserve this so if we are using an open bowl like what I'm using now just go ahead and make use of the plastic wrap provides very well and stow it in your refrigerator well if you have the container you can stow it in a container with a lid just go ahead and pour it into the container and store it in your refrigerator and bring it out whenever you want to use it you can store this in your refrigerator for up to you can store it for up to seven days but don't store more than seven days and then what I'm preparing here is definitely not going to last for seven days but then you can prepare something that'll last you for maybe three days and after three days you prepare another one it's always better if you have it freshly made okay so make something that will last for about three days or four days and after we should make another one so this treatment you are going to use it for one week straight we are using it every day for one week morning and evening for one week before you stop so use it one week straight before you stop before you stop and then maybe you can be using it twice in a week or once in a week but for the first time treatments you are going to make use of this for one week straight so here is the treatments that I just finished preparing to get rid of mouth odor like I said earlier before using it you have to say it's really well if you look you can see that the back in so that is settled at the bottom of this plate so I'm going to use my spoon and stage up really well so that everything will be incorporated in the mixture before using it so now that I've finished stirring and everything is mixed I'll just go ahead and use it immediately without wasting any time so I'm going to put this in my mouth and I will just swish it around so when this is in my motor we'll be able to talk so that way I'm telling you what I'm going to do we're going to swish it around from one end to the order making sure it's circulates really well and I'll keep doing that for about two minutes before pouring it out [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] if just poured it out and then what you saw me did was I was also gargling it's because you need the mixture to get to this place which is mostly where the order is being trapped so you need to gargle it as well and then spit it out after spitting it out I did not rinse my mouth with water and you are not going to have to rinse your mouth with water just leave it like that for it to stay and sit for some time before you eat so after doing this you can leave it on for 30 minutes to 1 hour before you put anything in your mouth just allow it to keep doing its job so you won't have to rinse this off at all no need to rinse it off just do what I showed you to do and then you are going to notice that your breath is even getting fresher please voice remaining and I'll just go ahead and store this remaining one in my refrigerator remember I told you you can repeat this twice in a day so you can use this morning and evening or you can choose to use it once in a day so but make sure you are using this for seven days straight seven days straight in order for you to permanently eliminate any mouth order that you have okay so that was a simple way to prepare the simple three ingredient recipe for getting rid of mouth although you see how simple that was no need to

baking powder has the part the the particles in it are very very very very active or let me say the ingredients are very very active in such a way that it will get rid of your bad breath immediately like instantly you are gonna see you are going to see an instant result so guys i know you guys want to try this out i have been trying this once in a while for my own self as well because the way it's it's it's clear the bad breath it's always very effective for me it's very very effective that normal close-up so you wouldn't want to do it every day but at least once in a week it's very okay and i do that as well so i know you guys who want to try it because like i said this is what i do and i just want to share with you guys because sometimes we have bad breath but we don't know but if

subscribe my channel click down here to sign up for notifications and then when you click the link further in the box below I can send you my free book on my free videos on how to heal your pets at home with my top natural remedies so somebody in this picture the video you're watching has some pretty bad breath and it's not me you name I've talked about halitosis in the past but this is slightly new to list breath it's really changed for the worse or here in a pile of complaints any time we go on a car trip I'm like a hot get her off of me so I want to just go over in detail again you know what's causing it and then try some sort of five new remedies and see if they're gonna work for her maybe they're gonna help you and your dog so here is to list little mouths and I'm gonna show you where the source of all the smell is coming from if you can look she's got moderate tartar now you'd see this you know this tartar buildup here this big up her car Neil tooth yeah her gums are you they're a little bit red show me this is my summer ginger but if it a Tartar not canine tooth digit gingivitis above it so clearly the cause of this halitosis this bad breath is a type of bacteria that's grown in her mouth and some of the end byproducts or that smell or that odor totally eats food say this yummy piece of cheese arugula there girl mmm some of those food particles are gonna rain but remain behind in your mouth bacteria can build on that turn into plaque turn into tartar but it was a big part of that smelly breath so what can you do obviously the biggest and most obvious thing is you know limiting them out of plaque amount of tartar the secondary gingivitis by a combination of if you can be brushing your dog's teeth when it gets really severe you're gonna have to look at taking your dog into the veterinary and have a dental scale and polish your doing whatever you can to minimize you know that that food turning to plaque the tartar it's but it's just more than that it's at some dogs just have naturally worse breath and others regardless of you know they can have a mild bit of tortora name horrible breath I'm going to see other dogs with horrible gum disease and other breath doesn't smell too bad so there's more or more going on here so it's a matter of you know if you've got a dog in particular and they really have this bad bad breath they've got moderate moderate you know their gums are actually prepared a healthy looking your vendor and you said yeah it's okay then really consider some of these remedies so the first big thing is more water the big primary thing that's causing the bacteria to grow is food you know such as the protein in this cheese and as soon as your dog is eaten the more fluid they can consume they can wash off that high protein which is a bacteria the bad breath bacteria love to thrive on their breath is going to smell better so do whatever you can they increase water consumption so one of the things you can consider is adding some type of stalk you know a little bit of minerals so for instance within like a veggie stock I have this chicken stock here we are going to to this water bowl and I want to see if we add this stuff well she actually drink it let's add like I'm gonna add a half a teaspoon good girl look at that too is not a big drinker I really would love to see her drink more and I sure know what she got when we go on car trips she's extra stressed she pants a lot to get herself dehydrated she doesn't drink there's way more bacteria worse worse breath okay here it is Tula moment of truth go girl look at that young stalk mm-hmm [Music] next you could try brushing but in particular I don't want to have you try something different so what I've got is this baking soda so one of the thoughts of that in the bacteria that are produced in the mouth that produces really bad breath with people they're wondering about it being produced in a more acidic environment which it seems pretty common so often when people drink orange juice my breath is so bad and then there's other foods that were produced when they're broken down they produce certain products that produce a bit bad breath so in terms of dealing with that sort of acidic environment one thing is considered something like sodium bicarbonate or here baking soda I don't know if it's gonna work for your dog or not I do want to test it out in tool do a little breath test after so here it is beforehand yeah her breath really is not really good so cup mmm okay a teaspoon or so of baking soda in a bit of water is to make it into a pace which is what I've got you guys may be able to see that there or not okay so there you got I mean that's for your left right it looks kind of like a toothpaste this is an old truth brush I no longer use using this on Tula or sick of a video okay let's try it out brush idea oh girl if you are to brush your dog's teeth you want to focus right where the teeth up here are the teeth meet the gum line so what we're trying to do is deal with that gingivitis what is the breath smell now definitely a bit better the third thing is considering a flush that you can make at home that's gonna just flush naturally flush out that bacteria ideally gonna be doing it right after they eat so ideally it's gonna be that twice a day you're either gonna finish eating flush out as much of that protein it's sort of left in there and the teeth to turn into plaque in the first place and hopefully it's also something it's potentially good for your dog if they ingest it so what am I thinking of mmm green tea so I've got here a cup of green tea I'll keep brewed a fresh pot all right and my handy dandy syringe somewhere here my sort of willing dog and so just assume cool it just had a bit of Fuji actually just ate some of that cheese for instance what am I got this yeah that's about a tablespoon or so of green tea I like a syringe cuz you can flush it right in just start at the top of your dog's mouth but especially in those working your way into those back molars ones that often seem difficult to clean properly and they build up most the tartar so look you're just putting a few drops in each tooth flushing it right on the gum line and to look and drink that doesn't mind it so it's another good source of fluid war so green tea is not just a are we only flushing with the fluid it's also antibacterial I was helping you know decrease the growth of that bacteria that's causing the bad breath in the first place good girl too okay there's your green tea flush now let's do the breath taste Oh much better you smell like green tea Oh the fourth one is gonna be a little bit more difficult to give but the reason I'm considering it is it's also very effective as being antibacterial has other potential medicinal benefits for their dog your dog if they're to ingest it along with you know brewing to be helpful for a whole array of different veterinary health problems what is it apple cider vinegar here just a little more difficult to get into your dog this is a remedy used in people some people swear by it when it makes a huge difference for helping with gingivitis which it would you know its antibacterial it's gonna help to decrease with gingival inflammation then it should help with bad breath but we can tolerate that kind of ye vinegary taste our dogs not so much so what I'm wondering is could we actually I'm gonna try adding it to some green tea don't use about you know here what if I got I'm using what half of this oh so we've got a boat a little over a teaspoon or so devote this about a half a cup of green tea mix in this concoction okay I'm gonna taste it first mmm it's definitely been agree but the grantee cuts down there yeah the kick once again we're doing this as a flush I'm not meaning her to have to ingest it so let's try the green tea episode of vinegar okay to Allah if he couldn't be the reason why she's not so crazy about all these videos good girl okay that's trying mmm this one oh you do it okay so my fingers get back there okay so what do you think of that go girl there let me smell your breath now like it's even better Wow oh girl oh you did it oh now the last thing I want to try er this the actual your carrots fruit and vegetables that you can give to your dog after they've you the one do a couple things one potential you know decrease up chunks of food and maybe left in between the teeth so it doesn't turn into as much plaque and tartar and secondarily to using something like these as a treat will cause the actor more saliva to form the more time the more saliva that's in your dog's mouth the more likely it's gonna wash away some of that food secondary it's gonna alter the alter the environment within the mouth itself and you're gonna get a get less order growing bacteria this thing the more fluid the better the more oxygen in the mouth the better so live is a great source for that these carrots are really good idea as far as you know something is gonna help get rid of that chunks of food that might be like too long I don't know apples be another option trying to think of things that are a little bit abrasive they're gonna rub rub away chunks of food in the teeth but are fairly low in protein and that kind of harmful odor causing bacteria so what do you think of this Tula mmm good girl I'll eat it if you eat it good colonel look hmm brahmam Jules not great about carrots right here dog is feed more of them right things of the snack thank you guys so much for watching decision of entering secrets

Gary Richter and today we're gonna talk about bad breath and your pet if you know specifically I think the big question that everybody has or everybody should have is what does it mean if your dog or your cat has bad breath and honestly it could mean a number of things clearly it could mean that there's things going on within their mouth so for example do they have gingivitis or inflammation of their gums do they have do they have a tooth infection these things can cause you know bad breath or foul odors but in addition to that dogs and cats can also sometimes get growths that develop within their mouth and that can also be problematic both from the standpoint of odor but also as a larger medical issue if those growths turn out to be something serious so you know if if you see anything unusual in your pets mouth redness a growth or there's any off odors it's always a good idea to have your veterinarian have a look and make sure that there's not something serious going on there what a lot of people don't realize however is there are reasons why your pet might have bad breath that are not directly related to their mouth you know so for example if your dog of your cat has a has a digestion problem they're not digesting their food very well sometimes they can be producing gas that is going to have a pretty foul odor and that may be what you're smelling in addition additionally sometimes metabolic diseases can cause changes in in their body chemistry that can make them have bad breath or foul odor so you know for example if if your dog or cat is developing kidney disease sometimes the toxins that build up in their bloodstream actually come off in their breath and you can smell that so so again as is the case with with oral health if there's any sudden change or even a gradual change in your pet's breath have your veterinarian have a look at it so at least we can drill down and figure out what the underlying cause is is because once you know what the cause is then you can really start to address what the treatment or what the resolution would be so once you've ruled out any kind of significant medical issue and really it turns out the bad breath is is related to dental related problems you know there are certainly things that you can do at home to both improve that situation and also to prevent further dental problems from occurring so really the the gold standard when it comes to oral care and dental care with dogs and cats is exactly the same as it is for us and it's tooth brushing so brushing your pets teeth on a regular basis ideally speaking daily will go a long long way towards keeping their breath fresh you know there are in addition to that there certainly are other things there are dental choose that that you can give to dogs or even cats and let them chew on those and it will help scrape their teeth clean and get some of the plaque and the tartar off you know there's also from an herbal standpoint you know things like cilantro and parsley can really be helpful to freshen a dog or cat's breath however depending on your dog or cat they may or may not want anything to do with something that tastes like cilantro or parsley but you can certainly give it a try you know going beyond that a lot of people will use bones you know give their dog or their cat bones to chew on to help clean their teeth and and you know really the the issue with giving these guys bones is you have to give them the right thing that's safe for them to eat so as a general rule you can give a dog or a cat an appropriate sized raw bone to chew on and that will really help clean their teeth off as they're chewing through it but I stress it needs to be raw so in otherwise something that you would buy either refrigerated or frozen at the pet store or potentially you know at the butcher counter we're not talking about the the bones that you say buy in the pet store that are just sitting there in the bin cooked bones or antlers or any of those other products they're so hard that your dog or your cat could literally break teeth on them so you know the the raw bones are softer and they can chew through them so it needs to be an appropriate size you know so check with your veterinarian about what would be a good size for them to chew on but sometimes that can be a really great way to keep their teeth clean as well so hopefully that that clears up a pretty stinky situation I'm dr.

after a meal it is not a good long-term solution for people with chronic bad breath bad breath also known as halitosis can have several causes the treatment for this condition will depend on the cause for each particular individual here are the following causes of chronic bad breath and how you can treat or cure this very unpleasant condition the most common cause of bad breath is poor oral hygiene oral bacteria is responsible for bad breath and most people and proper oral hygiene is key to fixing this problem there are two parts to this proper and consistent daily home care this includes brushing teeth twice a day morning and night for 2 minutes per session using a high quality electric toothbrush has been shown to be more effective at cleaning plaque off of your teeth than a manual toothbrush flossing at least once per day using a Waterpik can be just as effective if not more tongue scraping and brushing a lot of bacteria resides on your tongue so don't forget about it using a tongue scraper is usually more effective than a toothbrush and removing this bacteria antimicrobial oral rinses although not a necessity many people have had a lot of success using certain kinds of mouth washes I personally recommend Listerine and it is also a product that carries the American Dental Association's seal of acceptance [Music] there are also prescription strength or a mouth washes you can talk to your dentist about like chlorhexidine regular annual dental checkups and dental hygiene visits at least every six months tartar also known as calculus must be scaled off by a professional dental hygienist it cannot be removed by simply brushing dental decay gum disease like gingivitis and periodontal disease are known to cause halitosis so visit your dentist regularly another common cause of bad breath is dry mouth dry mouth means there's low salivary flow in your mouth which allows oral bacteria numbers to build up faster than normal which can lead to halitosis people can get dry mouth from certain types and medications they are taking so consult your physician if this is the case dry mouth can also be from mouth breathing mouth breathing almost always happens when nasal breathing is limited for one reason or another some people cannot breathe through the nose due to an anatomical obstruction like a deviated septum while others have allergies which prevent proper nasal breathing discuss these issues with your family doctor and possibly an ear nose and throat specialist a third and common cause of bad breath is diet certain foods like onions and garlic will cause temporary bad breath however some people may not be able to digest certain foods properly which can also be an underlying reason for halitosis smoking is a known cause of halitosis as well the solution of this is just to stop smoking allergies and post nasal drip nasal rinse it's like neti pot neti rinse or kneel med can help however consulting your family doctor may be necessary if the problem persists finally more serious medical conditions have been known to result in halitosis examples of these are sinus or nasal infections throat infections lung disease or lung

channel Today we will discuss how to get rid of alcohol\nBreath Alcohol breath refers to the bad breath, or\nhalitosis, caused by prior consumption of alcohol. Your body treats alcohol as a toxin and refuses\nto absorb it. Instead, it is slowly metabolized by the liver. In the meantime, it stays in your bloodstream\nand therefore the lungs, lending a distinct smell to your breath and in some cases even\nyour sweat. While drinking is a great way to unwind after\na hard day at work or an extremely tiring week, the strong smell of alcohol breath can\nbe extremely off-putting and rather inconvenient if you have a meeting with someone you are\nhoping to impress. Plus, here are 10 simple and natural home\nremedies that can effectively get rid of alcohol breath fast, either by eliminating or by camouflaging\nthe smell of alcohol on breath.

Use strong-smelling toothpaste, preferably\ncontaining peppermint or any other strong herbs, to thoroughly clean and brush your\nteeth for at least 2 minutes. Gargle and spit out the toothpaste. Home Remedy # 2: Gum Chewing gum is not just used by your average\ntruant to look cool. Pick a sour-flavored chewing gum, not a sweet\none. The tartness of the sour gum will cause your\nsalivary glands to produce more saliva, which will help eliminate the alcohol smell from\nyour breath.

Home Remedy # 4: Onion Onion is also very helpful for eliminating\nalcohol breath. Eat red onions when out drinking or the next\nday.

Drink a cup of strong black coffee with your\nbreakfast in the morning.

Slather peanut butter on your breakfast toast\nthe morning after an evening of drinking to get rid of alcohol breath. Home Remedy # 7: Lemon The acid in lemon juice prevents the growth\nof oral bacteria, and its pleasant citrus smell helps mask unpleasant odors like bad\nbreath or alcohol breath. Add 1 teaspoon of freshly squeezed lemon juice\nto a glass of warm water. Add \ufffd teaspoon of salt. Mix all the ingredients together. Rinse your mouth with the lemon and salt water. Home Remedy # 8: Parsley Aromatic herbs like parsley can be used to\nget rid of alcohol breath.

Put a spoonful of yellow mustard in your mouth,\nthen rinse it out with water. Do multiple rinses until your breath clears\nup.

And even worse when you don't realize it, you're talking to somebody and you\nhave them cringing at you from how bad your breath stink. Well in order to save\nyou from the embarrassment I'm going to show you how you can naturally fight bad\nbreath instantly and just a couple steps. First of all to fight the enemy, we need\nto understand what it is and what causes bad breath. And just like every other bad\nodor that comes from your body, bacteria is to blame. So the order is mainly\ncomposed from waste from bacteria, the decay of food particles, and other debris\nleft in your mouth just from poor oral hygiene. The decay in that debris\nproduces sulfur compound that is responsible for the bad odor that's\ncoming from your mouth. So to fight it, number one, you need to\nfloss. There is no way around it you can't mouthwash your way around it. You\nmay not be able to get into every cavity and remove any plaque buildup or food\nthat's left in between your teeth. Your toothbrush bristles and your mouthwash\nwill never reach some of these areas. Number two, brush your teeth well ,for at\nleast two minutes. Most dentists recommend that you use some sort of\nelectric toothbrush, these are way more efficient at removing plaque and food\nbuildup from your teeth. Mainly because the oscillations or the vibrations are\nworking more efficiently than what you would manually. To give you an example of this, the personal toothbrush that I use from Dazzle Pro, our sponsor, called The\nElements is a powerhouse that produces over 40,000 strokes per minute as\nopposed to the average 300 strokes that you would do manually. In other words, per minute this electric toothbrush is a hundred times more powerful and more\nefficient at cleaning your teeth than what a manual toothbrush would do. The\ntoothbrush also comes with a lot of other cool features like four different\ncleaning modes, so you can properly gauge it to your personal cleaning method or\nhow strong or sensitive you want your cleaning to be. The cleaning modes do\nadapt to different cleaning area say if you want to clean your gums, your\ntongues, or your teeth. On top of that it has a rechargeable docking station so\nyou don't have to be worrying about batteries or replacing them all the time.\nAnd the toothbrush has a built-in vibration timer that lets you know every\n30 second intervals that you're brushing your teeth so you can hit your\nrecommended ADA 2 minute time frame that you should be\nbrushing your teeth. As for the coolest part, something that most toothbrushes\nthat I've at least seen don't have, this thing has an anti bacterial UV\nSanitation base built into the docking system. Basically once you're done\nbrushing your teeth you just take the head off, place it into that docking\nsystem close the door and the UV light will kill 99.9% of all bacteria buildup,\nthat usually builds up on your manual toothbrushes that you leave in your\nbathroom. And your fear of the guy that's trying to fight bad breath or have a\nclean white smile you want to make sure your tooth heads are always clean, you\ndon't want to be reinfecting your mouth with more bacteria. This is exactly what\nyou need. Now the toothbrush is a little bit expensive but I wasn't gonna let you\npay full price for that. I got you guys a 40 percent discount code on this tooth\nset. So if you guys want to fight bad breath, have a beautiful white smile, this\nis the toothbrush set that you need. It's powerful, it comes with multiple heads, multiple cleaning modes, and it has a bacteria\nkilling blue light. So if you guys want to check out This Elements toothbrush\nfrom Dazzle Pro, I'm going to have it linked below with that special limited\ntime discount code. Like I said, this is for a limited time, so if you want to\npick one up at this huge discounted price, I'm gonna have it linked below\nwith that code just for you guys. So third step to fully eliminating bad\nodors is to make sure you clean your tongue. The tongue probably has to be the\nbiggest culprit for harboring bacteria and food particles under a thin layer of\nmucus. Removing that bacteria from the back of your tongue will go a long way\nfrom killing and eliminating bad odors, from your mouth. Sadly not only is this\nthe biggest culprit, this is the one that's mostly overlooked. A lot of people\nonly give them their tongues five seconds or skip it overall, so to remove\nthis order causing buildup you want to brush your tongue with the soft bristles\nof your toothbrush to break that mucus layer and loosen up those particles. Then\nyou can buy a tongue scraper at your local pharmacy for like one or two\ndollars. You use a tongue scraper to fully clean your tongue and remove all\nthat mucus, all that white junk. Your tongue should not have any white stuff\non it whatsoever, it should be pure pink and clean. And finally the fourth thing\nyou want to combat is dry mouth, this is the last culprit to bad breath. Since\nyour mouth is dry and it's not producing the saliva required to flush away the\nbacteria from your gums, teeth, and your tongue, a foul stench will start for me\nbecause that bacteria is remaining in your mouth. Dry mouth is usually caused\nby not drinking enough water, being on an empty stomach, or skipping meals, or\noverusing mouth washes or using harsh mouth washes with with a lot of alcohol\nthat dries out your mouth. The best way to fight all this is to not skip meals,\nmake sure the mouth washes you use are alcohol-free. And if you want to\nstimulate that saliva production, you can always be chewing\nsugar-free gum. This is gonna stimulate that saliva and clean out your mouth\nconstantly. That's basically it, you follow those four steps you'll make sure\nyou never have bad breath or fall into any embarrassment.

a suggest a MB third semester finance and marketing my question is that my friend he's having a batsman that means foul smelling is in his breath and he's like feeling awkward in front of the society so how can he overcome it that's nicosia bad odor from the mode can be offer many reasons one first and foremost all of them is oral hygiene that is the first thing second thing is metabolic turdus in your certain disease conditions you broad ID upon so many thing you move on you know these are the three that come up mostly mum the first thing oral hygiene it is very important that we follow a particular regimen or after diet only after food that we have you wash your mouth properly and use of certain sweetening agents or intake of certain foodstuffs also can cause bad odor like the most common can be onions or garlic they tend to have now give you a bad breath third things certain chronic infectious conditions chronic in the same the long-lasting infection foundation is just seen with adenoids or in view of smoking or chronic tonsillitis or sinusitis even so these can be the few of the common causes that are obviously seen in metabolic conditions that can be seen the bad breath are most common is ketoacidosis that is diabetic ketoacidosis but in metabolic syndrome that is not seen in the youth assets so just they ton listen and threats are very rare possibility another one common condition that are seen is most often that is observed it halitosis smoking it is there in the you that is what I would like to highlight on the common conditions again coming up with a little bad bad breath is the people tend to eat sweeteners more or chocolates more or that after that you don't wash among they can be a most probable causes one more condition that can occur is which I think can be seen as a kidney complains or real complains associated but it's not very common or I don't think so we need to go into that that that's what I feel the symptoms can be it is something like we said or just talking person is passing a bad spot foul smell or anything of that sort out the person might know know himself it could be known only to the person who's around him this is what is observed that's what I seen commonly the management is as I said oral hygiene is about push importance so usually brush your pee twice daily follow-up meal afterwards you need to one use a good mouthwash also if required as Aspen and one more thing with the conditions that we use there are very many for how thick treatment I mean or we can give them medicines but a treating the underlying cause becomes the most common necessity here this what I understand then in home of the TV again I had already mentioned that Sandra visualization but there are places where we give mouth washes or we need to SOS give more tours or suggest and the modern medicine point of view refer to them for certain conditions we I ten people that usually so that's what I personally prefer to tell it because some conditions where and dentures are involved and the food gets to ten toes get stuck in between them so that might cause problems for the treating condition in homeopathy also we find it we can't be able to manually track them that is one thing another one common habit that I see which I would like to tell the youth or advice from refraining from doing them is taking and putting anything to clean up their teeth or you observe that nail biting also they continue along with that so that these all things there are causes obvious but they are all related in one way or the other to be underlying costs so because of that also habits tend to die God so we just need to talk so that and then see it and agree speaking yes in visualization is part and parcel but still we need to go in particular mono means or particular remedy is also of valuable help so doctor it was really informative thank you so much so guys write your search into us our email id is you tear the rose bowl at

with celebrity dentist bill Dorfman who has worked on red carpet smiles in Hollywood and you know first of all you just told me you have horse breath yeah so just give a little we need Jim oh my gosh you know what causes this bad breath and you know what it all the time it's all bacteria and what happens is bacteria produced this gas it's called volatile sulfur compounds and that's that kind of rotten egg you smell that you smell so to get rid of bad breath you need to kill the bacteria and then neutralize the gas why didn't these other methods that Ryan tried work at all well the biggest problem with mouthwash is that almost all of them contain alcohol and even though the alcohol will kill the bacteria right away it drives your mouth out and then the bacteria will proliferate so most of these mouth washes don't work well the parsley in these things they just don't really do it you really need to kill the bacteria so the best solution is to use something that kills the bacteria get rid of the gas and then you'll have fresh breath but is it okay I so i use the antiseptic mouthwash in the morning and at night is that okay yeah but you know what there's one other thing that's really important most people don't know this but 90% of oral malodor is on your tongue so if you don't take care of your tongue and I don't mean just brushing your tongue that's what everyone's always told me I brush my tongue every day it doesn't work cuz what happens when you brush it and I'll show you in a second here you're just spreading the bacteria around you really need to scrape your tongue you need to get a tongue scraper scrape your tongue and just get all that bacteria out of there so that's how you you can help cure this that's so shows how this is done okay so we're gonna use a product called breath rx and breath rx has a mouth wash that tongue spray tongue scrapers in fact you guys all get some to take home and what this will do first you pick the spray-on okay this is a really really concentrated mixture that not only will kill the bacteria but it will neutralize all those volatile sulfur compounds now what you don't want to do is you don't want to brush it because when you brush it you just kind of spread it around and it's still on your tongue what you really need to do is take a tongue scraper and you just take this and you scrape the bacteria off of your tongue we'll do this a few times and each scrape makes it better and better and by doing this you're going to eliminate the bacteria you're going to kill the thing that's causing the bad breath Ryan you want to try this sure let's uh let's give Ryan one of these alright but give you the little sprays - Tom yeah don't miss there we go good job so way back use these hands he's actually got to go into something so I'm gonna hold it but please don't there you go ah nice you didn't make that face with the P so so you thought that was just saliva there we go so we're gonna pass this around to the audience and everyone gets to smell it you know so this can't cure bad breath if you do this how many times a day well basically what I recommend is in the morning when you wake up get a tongue scraper scrape your tongue use this breath or X spray first you can use we have a breath or X mouthwash you can use that periodically during the day I'll tell you what the real key is for some people is gum we have a really great gum because even during the day when your mouth gets dry you start to get bad breath just pop gum in orem it sugar free of course and and your sister is here summer you're saying he needs to do this otherwise he's not gonna ever get married he's never gonna have a girlfriend get married nothing alright so you guys stick to it I'll try alright", "bTigBoqsXMA":

founder of DrAxe.com. Today I'm going to share with you my top tips\nfor getting rid of bad breath fast, including the diet and supplements you can do, along\nwith using certain essential oils. Bad breath is something that absolutely nobody\nwants and can sometimes be a sensitive topic. But if you want to take care of bad breath,\nfirst we need to get to what is the actual cause of bad breath. Typically, it's caused from the bad bacteria\nbuildup within your body. Now, sometimes certain foods like garlic can\ngive you temporary bad breath, but chronic bad breath on a regular basis is caused from\nyeast and candida overgrowth in your body. So the first thing we've got to address is\ngetting rid of yeast and candida. You're going to do that by following a diet\nthat is lower in sugar and higher in probiotic rich foods. And so, again, if you're consuming too many,\nnot just processed sugar, but grains and white bread and white rice and even wheat products,\nbut grains that over time, starches that break down into sugar, that's the biggest culprit\nand problem. Really yeast and candida feed off of sugar\nand grains. So I would recommend for a temporary time\ngoing completely grain free and eliminating sugar from your diet and replacing those foods\nwith lots of protein, fiber, healthy fats, and probiotic rich foods, and, last but not\nleast, alkalizing foods. Some of the best probiotic rich foods you\ncan add in are things like 24 to 29 hour fermented homemade yogurt, buying goat's milk kefir,\nsauerkraut, kimchi, kombucha, coconut kefir, but really loading up on the probiotic rich\nfoods. That good bacteria is going to help overcome\nthe yeast and candida in your body and help balance out those microbes in your body. That's going to help breath very, very quickly. Also, again, consuming more healthy fat. Healthy fat, especially coconut oil. Coconut oil contains specific types of fatty\nacids called medium chain fatty acids, like lauric acid, capric acid, and caprylic acid,\nwhich are antimicrobial in nature. So doing a tablespoon or two of coconut oil\na day or eating a lot of coconut products can help bad breath as well. And then, the next thing you want to do is\nthere are certain foods and supplements you can take to help out with bad breath. Again, the first is a probiotic supplement. The second thing you can do is use peppermint\nessential oil. In fact, I make my own at-home toothpaste\nwith a mixture of baking soda, coconut oil, and peppermint oil. Just a single drop of peppermint oil on your\ntongue or in your water can help freshen up your breath. Then a food that can really, really help in\nimproving your breath is parsley. Part of the reason is parsley is so alkaline\nin nature. So if you are making vegetable juice at home,\nconsuming vegetable juice can actually help give you fresh breath, especially if you're\nusing things like parsley and green leafy vegetables like kale, spinach. and chard,\nalso doing things like cucumber and celery juice. But if you start doing a green juice daily\nand also consuming parsley, those are specific foods that will have a profound effect on\nimproving your overall breath. So again, if you follow those tips, I guarantee\nyou're going to have fresher breath.

Why do they smell the way \nthey do, and how can you recreate the smell of \nkisses without leaving your apartment. I'll explain all of that, \nand more in today's How to Make it. [music] So we've all smelled a kiss \nbefore, or at least wondered about it and one \nthing's for sure, the smell is\n distinctive. Webster's defines kissing \nas pressing one's lips against another person\n or object, and that's all well and \ngood when you are kissing your grandma. But when you're really \nkissing like you would on a date, it's more than just \npressing. It gets pretty involved... shall I say, and \na new ingredient joins the kiss. And that's where \nthe smell begins. What's the ingredient\n you ask? Well, I won't beat around \nthe bush. It's spit. Now... anyone who's smelled \nspit before knows it's not a very strong scent on \nit's own, but this is where things get \ninteresting. Odor causing compounds such \nas bacteria, and amylase are ever present in our \nsaliva. They just don't smell when they are \ndissolved in spit. Only when the spit dries do \nthese compounds come out in full force. And if your \nkiss is any good, it'll last long enough for at \nleast some of the spit to dry on your partner's \nface. And voil\u00e0, that's where the kiss smell comes \nfrom. Holy pizza. I just got chills. [bell rings] Now this wouldn't be a how \nto make it video without a how to, and I'm happy to \nsay that recreating a smell of a kiss couldn't be \nsimpler. You don't even need a \ngirlfriend. You can produce the exact \nsame conditions of a kiss using your hand, and spit. First, lick the back \nof your hand. Next, give the spit \n15 seconds to dry. [music] Now, all you have left \nto do is smell. [magic like sound] Bada-bing-bada-boom. Smells like a kiss. I myself have never kissed \nbefore, but I know it does, because of \nthe science. And if you don't believe \nme, you can just ask your dad, because he's kissed\n your mom. Thanks for watching, and be \nsure to subscribe.

mouth then number one start sipping water or sugarless drinks right because you don't want to take a lot of sugars and get you know fat so sipping a lot of water sugarless drinks and then during meals also you should sip water instead of drinking it sip it slowly and this can also improve the taste of your food as well as help you in swallowing then avoid drinking a lot of caffeine coffee tea or soda because caffeine can also make your mouth dry obviously that also adds up into the reasons then chewing sugarless gum can actually stimulate your saliva production right citrus cinnamon or mint flavored candies are also good choice right and you need to avoid salty food spicy food which can cause pain or in a dry mouth if you are putting them inside obviously you need to avoid tobacco and alcohol they can rile mouth and you need to use a humidifier at night in your room because if you actually sleep with a open mouth it can lead to dryness so all these things are steps which you can take to prevent and treat dry mouth obviously diagnosis the mean so main core problem is very important whether it's a disease with some medicine or a nerve damage or vitamin deficiency right so that's like b12 b12 deficiency can lead to dry mouth and even vitamin C deficiency can lead to gum problems so that's why you need to find out what is lacking in your diet and fulfillment so this is

eager to make a good first impression you head out the door and start driving but then you take your breath oh no now you start to panic because you can still smell the garlic and onions from your lunch you you don't want to head back because you're already running late what do you do if something like this has happened to you we're gonna give you some tips to help get rid of bad breath at the last minute so let's get started our first tip is to keep gum in your car chewing gum is a great way to fix your last minute breath problems and it doesn't just freshen your breath it's also good for your oral health that's right studies show that if you chew gum for 20 minutes after eating it can help prevent tooth decay so why should I keep it in my car well if you keep it in your car you don't have to worry about forgetting it at the last minute and you can freshen your breath as you drive our second tip is sugar-free candy have you ever woken up from a long nap and notice that your mouth feels dry it probably doesn't smell that good either this can especially happen if you keep your mouth open when you sleep sometimes you can get bad breath simply because your mouth doesn't have enough saliva that's because saliva naturally washes away plaque and leftover food in your mouth which can really start to smell if they build up so popping a sugar-free candy in your mouth can be a great way to increase your saliva and make your breath smell better but make sure it's sugar-free because if it isn't you'll actually be feeding the bacteria in your mouth which can make your breath smell worse our last tip is to keep it on the go toothbrush hold on I already brushed ice a day why would I need to carry another toothbrush with me well that's great that you're brushing every day but sometimes you need to do a little extra especially would you want to quickly freshen your breath so try carrying a small toothbrush in a small tube of toothpaste with you because a lot of times you won't be at home when your breath problems kick in just excuse yourself for a couple minutes to use a restroom and start brushing oh and don't forget to clean your tongue because this is where most breath problems start from this is probably the most effective way to get rid of your breath problem because you're actually cleaning away the plaque and leftover food particle in your mouth now keep in mind these methods are worth great if you want to freshen your breath in a short period of time but if you feel like you have breath problems more frequently than normal you should visit your dentist about your concerns thank you for watching if you liked the video please hit the thumbs up button and subscribe to our channel so you don't miss our new dental secrets every week", "Z8sgGF57nGM": "[Music] the smell of garlic and ways to get rid of it note that while you may be able to neutralize compounds that cause bad breath in your mouth the odor of these sulfur compounds will still be inhaled through your lungs and exhaled but the effectiveness of these treatments is debatable because they will significantly reduce the smell of garlic the most effective way to do this is to mechanically remove the garlic particles and sulfur volatile compounds from the mouth doing this by brushing your teeth flossing using mouthwash and cleaning your tongue with a toothbrush or similar means is somewhat effective tongue cleansing is also a very effective way to get rid of sulfur compounds from the mouth there are other cases that will affect the removal of the smell of garlic from your mouth before or after the mentioned cases some of which we will discuss eat parsley in most cases many recipes that use garlic also use parsley because the use of parsley is effective

also consider using garlic free odorless supplements you", "g8CKZNbKBqo": "Oh hello everybody welcome back to my channel today I'm gonna give you guys a few bad breath life hacks bad breath is just something that happens to everyone it's embarrassing whether you want to admit it or not it has happened to you at one point in your life and you probably have bad breath right now who knows so about two months ago I started experiencing bad breath which is something I don't normally get so for any of you out there who are suddenly experiencing bad breath or you have been experiencing bad breath do not feel bad because bad breath is just one of those things that comes and goes and sometimes it stays sometimes it goes just to put a disclaimer out there I am obviously not a dentist I am a sistah yes I am and I'm just here to share with you guys my tips and tricks on how I got rid of my bad breath and just keep in mind these are hacks for people who have normal bad breath there is normal bad breath where it's just everyday hygiene and there's also chronic bad breath which is something that is way deeper down than just brushing your teeth and your tongue so let's jump right in girl first and foremost you have to get regular dental check-ups I know the dentist ain't fun and I don't care how fine your dentist is okay that is still not a motivation to go I get dental cleanings every 6 months you want to go and get dental check-ups because one if you have something rotting in your mouth your dentist will catch that and you need to get that removed so going to the dentist is not just like Oh get your teeth cleaned is also to make sure that everything in your mouth is healthy and good you just might have tonsil stones if you do not know what tonsil stones are then girl thank the Lord because maybe you don't have it tonsil stones are just one of those things that some people never experience in their life and there are some people like mom that gets them so basically what is a tonsil stone girl I don't even know I'm not gonna try to get technical but basically if you look in your tonsils if you stick your tongue out and you look back into your tonsils look like a small mirror or something if you see these little rocks like these yellow little like pebbles and it lets this Amell that is a tonsil stone homegirl but there is really nothing you can do to get rid of them I heard that some people got rid of their tonsils and that removed the problem book alone that is kind of extreme so with tonsil stones you can actually safely remove them at home yourself what you can do is take one of these thingies I don't know what these things are called you can pick it up at your local drugstore it's basically something to floss your teeth with so what you want to do with this thing is you bend it at the tip on the spoolie end and what you can do is just gently extend that to the back of your throat and you can try to pick the tonsil stones out like that usually the tonsil stone will just stick to the spoolie because it's the material the spoolie is made out of but sometimes you might just have to try to like slowly like push it out you want to be really careful with this because you can accidentally poke your tonsils which I have done before and it was just uncomfortable but you won't die but I still highly recommend and advise any of you who are gonna try this method to get your tonsil stone out to be very very careful and gentle another thing you can do is gargle mouthwash or water and try to flush it out that way but I have found that if your tonsil stone is lying deep up in there nothing will take it out unless you physically go and pick it out obviously whatever you put into your body is whatever it's going to show on the outside so like you know I'd be eating a lot just food so it shows a muskie in but we're not gonna talk about that today whether or not you're experiencing bad breath drinking lots of water eating lots of fruits and vegetables is always a must in your life I find that whenever I'm extremely dehydrated I tend to get dry mouth and when I get dry mouth I give fabric for one of our drink lots of water to stay hydrated and eat lots of fruits and veggies I do see a huge difference in my breath you know I was so surprised when people told me that they don't brush their tongue or I feel like brushing your tongue is almost more important than brushing your teeth because a lot of bacteria gets stuck on your tongue I have been brushing my tongue ever since I was in middle and I have tried lots of different methods I've tried the tongue scraper I've tried different brushes I have tried using regular toothpaste to brush my tongue but for some reason it just doesn't do the trick because I don't think it's meant for your tongue so instead I just go on Amazon and look up tongue pay so this is the one that I use and I love it then using it since I was a little kid so every morning and nights for my oral routine I would use some of this tongue paste onto a towel toothbrush or tongue brush whatever you want to call it and I would brush my tongue and I will see all the bacteria just slipping off like slime just make sure you're being very gentle and don't be too like aggressive with it this one is like a obvious no-brainer but that is to brush your teeth twice a day and be really good about that you want to make sure that you get to every crack and crevice and like your dentist would say you got a brush for three minutes another thing that's really important is that you get the back of your tooth so it's not just cleaning what's on the front you also have to clean what's on the inside I personally find that an electronic toothbrush works a lot better than a man know one I would say it is totally worth it because the vibration really helps remove the plaque off of my teeth also I really like to use mouthwash and with mouthwash make sure you don't use one with alcohol that would dry out in your mouth because when you get dry mouth you tend to get bad breath because your mouth is bland and it is dry so whenever you look for mouthwash make sure you get one that is alcohol-free and is gentle the next thing is this pro dental probiotic that I found on Amazon when I was getting bad bad breath while actually told me that my breath didn't seem like it was coming from my teeth but basically why was telling me that my bad breath was kind of coming from within like he felt like he was smelling my insides oh that is so nested like I'm legit did not kiss him for a while after that because I did not feel cute after so anyway I was on Amazon and I was looking up like you know mouth washers and things like that and you know when you're just scrolling through Amazon and they start recommending new product so this one popped up so it's basically a chewable probiotic that helps neutralize bad breath odors if you are someone that gets tonsil stones on the regular and you're too afraid to go pick them out hi okay I highly highly suggest this stuff I will leave the amazon link down below I know whenever it comes to like something that's a pill people are a little worried about it I haven't had any bad reactions to it so far and I don't use it every single day I just use this whenever I feel like I need it on those days where I wake up and I feel like there's this like smell on the inside that's coming up I will brush my teeth and after I brush my teeth before eating I will just chew one of these and I am good for like the next few days this stuff I feel like it really varies from person to person but for me I definitely prefer gum over mints although a lot of people say that gum is actually worse for your breath because you're constantly chewing this piece of gum and bacteria is getting accumulated on this piece of gum but personally for me I do not find that mints work for me because a lot of times mints they leave this film over my tongue and because it leaves that film anything that I eat or drink just sticks onto my tongue it feels really nasty and it gives me dry mouth and it gives me bad breath so I'm not a fan of mints my thing with gum is that not every single gum is gonna work for you every person is different and I found that dentine works the best for me any denting gum I'm like pretty down for you're someone that's been chewing mints and you find that it's not really working for you then I would say try gum and try different types of guns to see which flavor and which one works best for you you're going somewhere special and you're about to see someone special just pop this piece of gum in your mouth don't chew it for over like thirty minutes and if you have to pop in a new piece of gum how many of you find that you get bad breath when you haven't eaten or drank anything in hours after all you should be drinking and having small snacks throughout the day to keep your body nourish you try not to go too long without eating something or drinking something lastly I think this is another no-brainer but drinking and smoking really does affect the health of your mouth so I guess I don't have to talk too much about this one but if you can minimize alcohol and smoke and that is all I have for you guys today I hope this video was helpful if you follow all these tips and you feel like you have good oral hygiene and you're still experiencing bad breath you definitely have to go check that out because it could be something else but for those of you who are experiencing just normal typical bad breath I hope this video helped you out if it did please give this video a thumbs up and remember to subscribe to my channel to support a sista and I will see you guys in a later video bye if you guys keep up with our vlogs one I have talked about moving apart and we actually will officially be living apart I think a lot of people think that living apart is a bad thing but", "a5i3JrMMn_4": "Are you someone who experiences morning breath? What about afternoon breath or evening breath\nor what if you live with somebody and you need to make sure that they learn some secrets\nto clearing up their bad breath or halitosis issues? Well, I've got a great program in store for\nyou. Welcome to Ancient Medicine Today. I'm your host, Jordin Rubin. And we're brought to you by draxe.com, your\nsource for innovative health information to teach you how to use food as medicine. You know, bad breath may seem like a cosmetic\nissue. We see commercials for various mouthwashes\nand gums. But the bottom line is bad breath or halitosis\nmay be a sign of internal health issues. Today on Ancient Medicine, we're going to\ntalk to you about nine secret bad breath fighters and an amazing homemade toothpaste recipe\nwhich can do much more for you than just freshen your breath. Bottom line, folks, if you have bad breath\nor if you have a family member, a child, a husband, a wife that does, there's much more\ngoing on. We want to help you not only clear that up,\nbut transform your entire oral health with these secret ingredients that will help fight\nbad breath. Let's get started. Number one, cardamom. We say all the time that spices are amazing\nand we don't use enough of them. Cardamom is a powerful, potent antiseptic\nand it even helps destroy oral pathogenic bacteria. That's bad bacteria. If you want a quick and easy way to fight\nthe bacteria that causes bad breath, those germs in your mouth, chew cardamom seeds. It is absolutely amazing. Again, folks, I believe in America we don't\nget enough spice in our diet. So, spice things up to transform your health. Cardamom is not only great for your oral health,\nbut when you use food as medicine, there are amazing side benefits. Number two, and this is one of my favorite\nsecrets to oral health, not just bad breath but whitening your teeth, etc., is oil pulling. So, what you do is you take approximately\na teaspoon or even a tablespoon of coconut oil. Now, I know we all love virgin or extra virgin\ncoconut oil, but you can even use refined coconut oil. The Ayurvedic practice of oil pulling started\nwith sesame oil. You put oil in your mouth and you wish it,\nmake sure it gets between your teeth, your gums. It does powerful things for your body. It fights tooth decay and it helps freshen\nyour breath, even whiten your teeth. And a healthy mouth equals a healthy body. It pulls toxins out of the body. I recommend you do oil pulling. Start with five minutes a day and eventually\nget to 15 or 20. What you want to make sure you do is if you\ndo start with a tablespoon of coconut oil, it will expand as your saliva is added to\nit. So, that will determine how long you can pull\nfor because you might be like this after five minutes. Anyway, oil pulling is something that I do\nat least once a day. You can do it while reading. For me, it's right after flossing. I brush--by the way, we're going to give you\na great homemade toothpaste recipe--I brush, I floss, then I oil pull. Sometimes I add essentially oils to it as\nwell. The Ayurvedic medicinal way to get toxins\nout of your mouth, fight tooth decay is oil pulling with coconut oil. Peppermint oil is one of the best fighters\nof bad breath and bacteria in the mouth. You can take peppermint oil and just drop\nit under your tongue. Now, it is very strong, so one or two drops\nis a lot. Swish it around or you can add it to another\noil, use it as a mouthwash, perhaps in oil pulling. I like to add peppermint oil to store bought\ntoothpaste, or as you'll learn, it can be a great ingredient. It's a potent antimicrobial. One drop does a tremendous amount for your\nmouth and it's also great for the gut. So, if you swallow the peppermint oil, you're\ngoing to get benefits for digestion as peppermint can relieve gas, bloating and cramps. Peppermint oil is so great, really cooling\nto the body. It's also great for tooth pain. So, that's the third bad breath fighter and\nit's great for overall health. Folks, I'm Jordan Rubin here for Ancient Medicine\nToday, brought to you by draxe.com, your leading source for health and wellness information\nteaching you that food is medicine. We're here each and every weekday Monday through\nThursday 10:30 a.m. Central time plus make sure to subscribe to\nthis channel for pop-ins that we do anytime, anyplace. And folks, remember, if you love this information,\npunch that love button and make sure to click that share button because these bad breath\nfighters not only are proven and effective for your mouth, but the entire body. Folks, this is a big one, water. A lot of times your bad breath is simply caused\nby dehydration. When you hydrate, you help your body dilute\nthe toxins and even the microbes that cause bad breath. Dehydration equals bad breath. Make sure to consume purified or filtered\nwater. This is a great one, parsley. Have you ever wondered why when you eat a\nrestaurant they'll garnish the meal with parsley? They often are using sort of an ancient trick\nto help people freshen their breath. Parsley was a poor man's breath mint. Well, I would say for a rich man's health. You can chew on parsley and the chlorophyll\nwill actually destroy bad bacteria and freshen your breath. So, parsley when you chew it or even consume\nsome juice, you can spit it out but also you can eat it. The chlorophyll in parsley helps kill the\nbacteria responsible for bad breath. And parsley is also good to detoxify the body\nand strengthen the liver. Probiotic rich foods. Picture there is natto, which is an Asian\nfermented soy that uses the probiotic Bacillus subtilis. Bad breath starts in the gut. Natto, which can be used as a condiment, helps\nto destroy fungal overgrowth, bacterial overgrowth and it is powerful for digestion and the side\nbenefit, it freshens your breath. This doesn't happen overnight. It's not going to be the same as putting peppermint\noil in your mouth, but it will build your gut flora, which will helps fight bad breath. So, consume probiotic-rich foods--sauerkraut,\nmiso, natto, cultured dairy products if you consume dairy, kombucha, kvass, apple cider\nvinegar all good to fight the germs that cause bad breath. Now, here are three quick supplements that\nI recommend to purify the body and fight bad breath. Number one, probiotics. Look for probiotics that contain soil-based\norganizations. I like a broad spectrum probiotic that contains\nBacillus subtilis, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus clausii, Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacillus\nplantarum in a base of fermented foods. Probiotics boost your gut. Bad breath starts in the gut. Probiotic consumption over time can help reduce\nthe toxins that are in your mouth that can be detected, believe it or not, in a breath\ntest. So, consume probiotics. I recommend first thing in the morning on\nan empty stomach consuming a balanced probiotic. Milk thistle purifies the liver. It is by far the number one liver supporting\nherb. Milk thistle seed is amazing for the liver. It has a compound known as silymarin, which\nhelps to strengthen and purify the liver. It's got a slightly bitter nature to it, which\nmeans that it's really good for the liver. Consuming milk thistle, making it in an herbal\ninfusion like a tea or in supplement form is really, really great for your liver and\nit's great for bad breath. Also, we talked about chlorophyll earlier\nwith parsley, consuming a green superfood powder or a green juice powder every day in\nyour smoothie, in carrot juice or other juices or just in water is a great way to get chlorophyll\ninto your system and chlorophyll is a potent fighter of bad bacteria, purifier of the body\nand helps to freshen your breath. Folks, I've got to tell you that these nine\nsecret bad breath fighters can do so much more than just freshen your breath and make\nyour mouth healthy. It can transform the health of your entire\nbody, your gut, your liver, your skin. You're going to get so many side benefits\nbecause that's what happens when you use food as medicine. Now, for those of you who are interested,\nhere is a DIY toothpaste. You do not have to buy toothpaste at the store. Frankly, most of them are not super-healthy. You start with coconut oil. Coconut oil is great to purify the mouth. Baking soda helps create the right environment\nin the mouth to destroy some of the acid loving bacteria that can cause tooth decay. Xylitol makes your toothpaste a little bit\nsweet, but it also fights cavities. Xylitol is a sugar alcohol. It's often used as a sweetener and I'm not\na huge fan of that, but in oral health it is great to prevent the adherence of certain\nbacteria.

of mine is a detailed video about halitosis okay let's start this video bad breath also called halitosis can be embarrassing and in some cases may even cause anxiety it is no wonder that stored shells are overflowing with gum mints mouthwashes and other products designed to fight bad breath but many of these products are only temporary measure because they do not address the cause of the problems certain foods health conditions and habits are among the causes of bad breath in many cases you can improve bad breath with consistent proper dental hygiene if simple self-care techniques do not solve the problem see your dentist or physician to be sure a more serious condition is not causing your bad breath now let me tell you the symptoms bad breath or does vary depending on the source or the underlying cause some people worry too much about their breath even though they have little or no mouth or door while others have bad breath and they even don't know it because it is difficult to assess how your own breath smells ask a close friend or relative to confirm your bad breath questions if you have bad breath or review your oral hygiene habits try making lifestyle changes such as brushing your teeth and tongue after eating using dental floss and drinking plenty of water if your bad breath persists after making such changes see your dentist if your dentist suspects a more serious condition is causing your bad breath he or she may refer you to a physician to find the cause of the order now let me tell you the causes most bad breath starts in your mouth and there are many possible causes which include food the breakdown of food particles in and around your teeth can increase bacteria and cause a foul odor eating certain foods such as onions garlic and spices also can cause bad breath after you digest these food they enter your bloodstream and are carried to your lungs and affect your breath tobacco products smoking causes its own unpleasant mouth water smokers and oral tobacco users are also more likely to have gum disease which is another source of bad breath poor dental hygiene if you do not brush and floss daily food particles remain in your mouth causing bad breath a colorless sticky film of bacteria which is known as plaque forms on your teeth if not brushed away plaque can irritate your gums and eventually form plaque filled pockets between your teeth and gums which is known as periodontitis your tongue also can trap bacteria that produce odors dentures that are not cleaned regularly or do not fit properly can harbor order causing bacteria and food particles dry mouth saliva helps to cleanse your mouth removing particles and that cause bad odors a condition called dry mouth or zero stomia can contribute to bad breath because production of saliva is decreased dry mouth naturally occurs during sleep yielding to morning breath and it worsens if you sleep with your mouth open chronic dry mouth can be caused by a problem with your slavery glands and some diseases medications some medications can indirectly produce bad breath by contributing to dry mouth others can be broken down in the body to release chemicals that can be carried on your breath infections in your mouth bad breath can be caused by surgical wounds after oral surgery such as tooth removal or as a result of tooth decay gum disease or mouth source other mouth nose and throat condition bad breath can occasionally stem from small stones that form in the tonsil and are covered with bacteria that produce odor well on my channel uh hope with bb i have also uploaded a video uh about tonsillitis which is very helpful please see that video okay infections are chronic inflammation in the nose sinuses are throat which can contribute to post nasal drip can also cause bad breath there are some other causes and diseases such as some cancers and conditions such as metabolic disorders can cause a distinct distinctive breath out or as a result of chemicals they produce chronic reflux of stomach acid which is known as gastroesophageal reflux disease or curd can be associated with bad breath bad breath in young children can be caused by foreign bodies such as a piece of food lodged in a nostril now i'll tell you about the diagnosis your dentist will likely smell both the breath from your mouth and the breath from your nose and reach the outdoor on a scale because the back of the tongue is most often the source of the smell your dentist may also scrape it and read its order there are sophisticated detectors that can identify the chemicals responsible for bad breath though these are not always available now let me tell you the treatment to reduce bad breath help avoid cavities and lower your risk of gum disease consistently practice good oral hygiene further treatment for breath can vary depending on the cause if your bad breath is thought to be caused by an underlying health condition your dentist will likely refer you to your primary care provider for causes related to oral as your dentist will work with you to help you better control that condition dental measures may include mouth rinses and toothpaste if if your bad breath is due to a build up of bacteria that is blocked on your tooth you your dentist may recommend a mouth rinse that kills the bacteria your dentist may also recommend a toothpaste that contains an antibacterial agent to kill the bacteria that cause blood up treatment of dental disease if you have gum disease you may be referred to a gum specialist periodontist gum disease can cause gums to pull away from your teeth leaving deep pockets that fill with order causing bacteria sometimes only professional cleaning removes these bacteria your dentist might also recommend replacing faulty tooth restorations which is a breeding ground for bacteria now let me tell you some lifestyle and home remedies which are very important so please listen to this very very carefully to reduce or prevent bad breath you should brush your teeth after you eat keep a toothbrush at work to use after eating brush using a fluoride containing toothpaste at least twice a day especially after meals toothpaste with antibacterial properties has been shown to reduce bad breath odors you should floss at least once a day proper flossing removes food particles and floss from between your teeth helping to control bad breath brush your tongue your tongue harvests bacteria so carefully brushing it may reduce odors people who have a coated tongue from a significant over growth of bacteria from smoking a dry mouth for example may benefit from using a tongue scraper or use a toothbrush that has a built-in tongue cleaner clean dentures are dental applications if you wear a bridge or dent or a denture clean it thoroughly at least once a day or as directed by your dentist if you have a dental retainer or mouth guard clean it each time before you put it in your mouth your dentist can recommend the best cleaning product you should avoid dry mouth to keep your mouth moist avoid tobacco and drink plenty of water not coffee soft drinks alco alcohol which can lead to a dryer most i mean some people think that there's a water and this alcohol and soft drinks and they keep on taking these things and coffee also but these are not helpful because coffee soft drinks and alcohol actually cause dry mouth okay chewing gum or suck you gum or suck and candy preferably sugarless to stimulate saliva for chronic dry mouth your dentist or physician may prescribe an artificial liver preparation are an oral medication that stimulates the flow of saliva you should adjust your diet avoid foods such as onions and garlic that can cause bad breath eating a lot of sugary foods is also linked with bad breath regularly get a new toothbrush change your toothbrush when it becomes frayed about every three to four months and choose a soft bristle toothbrush also you should schedule regular dental checkups see your dentist on a regular basis generally twice a year to have your teeth or dentures examined and cleaned well this was my video about breath bad breath or halitosis i hope you find it

much first things first please subscribe hit that red button here yeah it's free of charge so please hit it subscribe so today I'm going to talk about how to get rid of bad mouthed order stroke hairy ptosis bad math order is also called hurry ptosis that bad math that someone emanates from their mouth yes I think we've all come across people and you're talking to them and the smell that is they are emanating from their mouth is like it makes you want to puke it makes you like it makes you want in the conversation there and then I need you cut and eat sometimes so I came up with eight different ways of how to overcome this bad mouth order or halitosis number one is brush and floss your teeth often some people do not want to brush their teeth and you wonder like why wouldn't anyone want to brush their teeth like why wouldn't you brush your teeth and why wouldn't you brush your teeth daily so in order to overcome that bad mouth order or halitosis you have to brush as often as possible and make sure that you do brush every after a meal in case you're not able to brush rinse your mouth with water so that that food that remains in your mouth comes out and when it does bacteria will not settle in your mouth that causes this smell yes you can as well floss I'm going to show us water floss is yes you're going to see it here I'm going to show us the floss you can trust your teeth as well you can get a flow sir that is used for flossing from any farmers you can go and buy it from any farmers and any farm as you obviously get it or you can walk to a dental clinic and you lately get it point number two is clean your tongue often you can clean it with the tongue scraper or as you're brushing make sure that you clean your tongue bacteria loves settling or the tongue I remember we eat and food goes through that tongue we we take things and everything has to pass on our tongue so that means that a lot of food remains on our tongue and because it does and a lot of bacteria as well lodges on that tongue and when it does it causes but order so clean your tongue as much as you can or you can as well use a scraper to clean your tongue after brushing you can get a scraper and use it to clean your tongue because it is used specifically for cleaning that tank scrape your tongue after brushing in case you you're not sure whether you've brushed it properly you you brushed your tongue properly then use a tongue scraper it helps a lot with making sure your tank is clean and making sure that you do not release that bad order point number three is use natural remedies like eating a handful of clothes you can eat oranges or lemon you can eat an seeds produce and septic qualities that help in fighting the bacteria that causes hairy ptosis so I highly recommend that you eat them and they help you with that smell four is moist in your mouth and how do you moist in your mouth by taking water on a daily basis not only after a meal but make sure you take water as much water as you can because water helps in cleaning the mouth and it helps in fighting this but order of the mouth and both is used mouth washes there there are so many on the market but make sure you get the ones that are alcohol free because when you get the ones that have alcohol there just instead increase the problem and yet you are looking for ways how to get rid of that problem so get ones that are totally alcohol free you can walk to any pharmacy you can walk to any dental clinic and you'll be able to access them this keep the mouth fresh and they keep the mouth free from that or now number six is a cue gum gum helps to increase the flow of saliva in a mouth which in turn helps to fight the bacteria that causes hurry ptosis yes some people did not have enough saliva and that affects their order so in order to overcome this order make sure that you chew gum but you have to chew sugar-free gum yes there is sugar-free gum that is sold in pharmacies that is sold in supermarkets you just have to go and drink which type of gum you buy it has to be sugar-free why because when you take the one that has sugar in it sugar increases bacteria in our mouth and by so doing its causes that disorder it it adds more to that disorder so that's why you have to chew sugar-free gum and that reduce or do our with sugary foods yes if you if it's a cake make sure each cake that is sugar-free make sure that you take drinks that are sugar-free and you are good to go number seven is avoid eating foods that sour your mouth like for example garlic onions this one's to smell like imagine us who do not actually have that disorder when you eat the onions or when you eat garlic you smell garlic so imagine a person was this order and add garlic to it it will be a total mess so do our with garlic to our with onions do our with all those foods that increase this but odor and it fresh foods like vegetables it's fresh fruits like apples like mangoes this helped to clean the mouth his point number eight is seek medical attention and on top of that make sure that you also visit that dentist at least thrice ayuh at least let the minimum be three times ayat check out what is happening to your teeth so in case all these all these remedies fail seek medical attention go and get treatment go and be treated and let this order go away thank you very much those are the eight ways of how to get rid of hairy ptosis or bad mouth order see you in another video remember to subscribe", "Dc7w_PGSt9Y": "hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with the ultimate garlic peeling trick that's right i've learned a lot of things from martha stewart how to fold napkins how to cover turnip into the shape of rose how to make a shake out of a broken prison toothbrush but if all the things i've learned from her this garlic peeling trick might be the most useful so check this out we're gonna peel an entire head of garlic in like 20 seconds so what you're gonna need for this great technique is a head of garlic and then two metal bowls and it's easier if they're the same size but they really don't have to be as long as you can hold them together like this it's gonna work so step one here we're gonna take our head of garlic we're gonna give it a whack on the cutting board to loosen those clothes which we're gonna toss into one of our bowls and by the way you could just toss everything in including that papery skin i picked a bunch out just for the sake of filming but when you're doing this there's no need to do that just toss everything in and once we have our cloves in the bowl we are ready to commence peeling except we're not peeling or shaking simply cover the bowl of garlic with the second bowl hold them together and shake and after 20 seconds of vigorous shaking you're done that's it I'm not kidding the garlic's peeled check it out and even the ones that don't look peeled and didn't pop right out of the skin those are totally loose the skins loose just grab them with your fingers pull that skin off and remove those from the bowl and you will have like I said about 20 cloves of garlic in 20 seconds and I should add this is a fantastic way to win a bet with your foodie friends bet them like $1,000 or you're gonna peel a head of garlic and when you're done you will average less than 2 seconds per clove oh they will take that bet every time and they'll owe you $1,000 and you'll be so excited you'll find my paypal and send me like 200 of it I'm just kidding unless you're gonna do it so anyway I'm always getting a ton of emails for

Carly it's a day for everything today we are gonna work with garlic but in a different way we are not gonna cook but I'm gonna show you how to get rid of the garlic smell from your hands let's go what we are doing today I have five guinea pigs I'm gonna smear all these beautiful garlic into their hands and I have five different options here that is being sad you take the smell out of the their hands I will smell every single hand and I will let you know what is the winner here I have my first guinea pig and look this beautiful smelly garlic and we are gonna chose Robert see need and we are gonna try our first option which is hand sanitizer I don't think will work but let's see what happened well the smell is very strong of the actual hand sanitizer I think it's blocking the smell of the actual garlic without taking it away but wow what is this brand it's pretty good I cannot smell garlic no hand sanitizer whatever brand this is is very good next turn our second guinea pig and it is not guinea pig yeah it is gonna be so because I really don't like her very much so I'm gonna really squeeze these garlic into these hands and right now what we are going to use is coconut oil so there is Mellie and this has no more smell so let's try this you're gonna have very soft hands there you go no it does I can't believe it now there is a smell of garbage yes coconut oil does not work and here we have this option will be potato there you go yes smelly let's have some potato no we actually can use these potato with garlic and roasted and eat it is not working we have our four guinea pig and these option will be we're going to use dish soap yeah just garlicky ready babe that's plenty for my pants so he wash his hands with dish soap let's see mm-hmm it actually brought down the smell about 50% where I can still sense it so it's like ah no work okay well he's smelly and we are gonna use this option which 100% works it's going to go into the sink and use the stainless steel as a soap and the chemical reaction between the stainless steel water and your hands will get the smell away so she washed her hands with the stainless steel now you smell and no smell of garlic after trying five options of how to get rid of garlic smell what I decided was the best is the stainless steel which literally and your your hands will not smell then the second option was this lemon sanitizers but personally I think it was so strong the lemon scent that actually over powder the garlic so if you want to see it that way yes actually it will get the garlic smell out of your hands for how long I don't know the dish soap is the one that as well the smell of the dish soap is so strong that actually will over powder the garlic smell but I don't think really will get rid of the garlic smell coconut oil it's better to use it as a cream but the smell will be there and potato it's better you chop them put garlic a little bit of olive oil roasted in the oven and have an amazing roasted garlic potatoes because definitely doesn't work to get rid of the garlic smell I hope you have enjoyed you have had fun as much as we had until next time [Music]", "hMhewt-N3Fg": "eleven ways

Allah it's like smell of musk algae yes baby you reckon strong Musk oh yeah but is it smell like it smells like bad breath can be a big problem but hamdullah Lewontin has encouraged us to fast and since we fast only for him he has told us that this smell to him is like smell of musk but not to other human beings now before we get into how we can get rid of this bad breath or at least cut it down we need to know how a bad breath happens there's two main reasons one in your mouth and one in your stomach now let's talk about number one in your mouth when you are not fasting there's a lot of saliva in your mouth which washes away all the bacteria that is being built up in your mouth so it cleans it up but now since you're fasting you are dehydrated and there's not much saliva that is being produced and because of that is not washing away this list bacteria so what happens in turn in return you're gonna get bad breath from your mouth number two is bad breath from stomach which is not that easy to get rid of in fact it's impossible to get rid of what is that you have digestive fluids inside your stomach that break down our food but if there's no food then these acids or this digestive fluid end up breaking down and in return we get bad breath from our stomach now let's talk about the stomach part because there's something you can do in order to avoid this bad breath is by drinking lots of lots of water at the time one it will keep you hydrated and it will also avoid bad breath that comes out of your stomach the other is what are some of the foods that you can avoid so this bad breath from your stomach can at least be cut down number one factor its the onion and garlic that we have in our day seafood or other food around us or garlic sauce that herbs II cut that down in fact get rid of it don't even eat it during the month of ramadhan or at least at the time because it will cause you to have bad breath throughout the day so drink lots of water cut down on the garlic cut down on the onions and also coffee as well and you should be good we talked about your stomach let's talk about the mouth now we talked about that this live--i that breaks down all the bacteria that gets built up in your mouth is not being washed but why do you have this bacteria in the first place because it's food stuck in your teeth and you're not brushing properly now brushing can do much even miswak will do a very good job and get rid of this bacteria but there's also bacteria inside your teeth what do you do you floss your teeth now I know it could be a little bit hard if you're using those big rock long strings to are trying to get rid of this bacteria that is being built up in your in your in your teeth all the food that is stuck being inside your teeth it's gonna be very hard to get rid of so what do you do use something like this even a kid can use this and philosophy the first few times when you're going to do and if you're not used to flossing your gums are gonna be bleeding but that's okay over time they're gonna get strong and you're not gonna get any food stuck in your mouth you will cut down the smell that comes out of your mouth while you're fasting so this is it drink lots of water don't eat onions don't eat garlic or drink coffee at sentry time or support time and make sure you clean your mouth brush it use miswak and at the same time floss it to make sure that there's no food left in between your teeth after you had your support so throughout the day inshallah you're gonna have fresh breath if not at least you can cut down on the bad

useful chlorophyll is the chemo protein that gives plants their green color humans get it from leafy green vegetables such as broccoli lettuce cabbage and spinach there are claims that chlorophyll gets rid of acne helps liver function and even prevents cancer what does the research say another claim is that the chlorophyll in a shot of wheatgrass can stave off bad breath and body odor is there any scientific evidence to back this up are you really getting what you're paying for when you buy a chlorophyll supplement or a shot of wheatgrass at the health food store there was a study conducted back in the 1950s by dr f howard westcott which showed that chlorophyll can help combat bad breath and body odor but the results of that research have basically been debunked says dr david drogue a colorado physician there hasn't been any research since to support that chlorophyll has any effect on body odor though some people continue to use it the national council against health fraud says that since chlorophyll cannot be absorbed by the human body it can therefore have no beneficial effects on folks with halitosis or body odor dragoo explains does it help with other ailments other widely circulating claims are that chlorophyll kidneys symptoms related to arthritis cystic fibrosis and herpes but again dragoo doesn't buy it as far as factually verifiable research there is no truth to the fact that chlorophyll can be effectively used to treat those illnesses he says vegetables rich in chlorophyll such as leafy greens have plenty of health benefits on their own elizabeth summer m.a rhode and the author of eat your way to sexy says that the lutein found in leafy greens for example is great for the eyes even without scientific evidence summer says it's fine for people to think chlorophyll is good if it causes them to eat more vegetables summer also affirms that no scientific evidence exists to support chlorophylls deodorizing properties the suggestion that it reduces breath body and wound odor is unsupported it's obviously still a widely held belief she notes given the post meal parsley that restaurants used to garnish plates a good breath mint for fido

seaside town of corona del mar california she says that chlorophyll does offer health benefits especially to dogs there are many health benefits of chlorophyll it helps cleanse all the cells of the body fights infection heals wounds helps to build the immune system and replenish red blood cells and detoxifies the liver and digestive system she says hansen said that chlorophyll also definitely helps with bad breath in dogs which don't tend to eat vegetables one of the most important ways that our pets benefit from chlorophyll is that it both treats and prevents bad breath from the inside out she says it also improves digestion which is the most likely cause of bad breath even in dogs with healthy teeth and gums 8 tips to get rid of garlic and onion breath why do garlic and onions

from this is a wise signing off with another video [Music]", "uANY0j-UzVs": "hey guys I wanted to do a quick video on the strong odor on Keita whether it's your urine or your breath what you can do and what it is alright so let me just talk about all the reasons that you can have a strong odor mainly in your urine sometimes through the breath okay so the first one is liver damage that can create a strong odor in your urine and definitely in your breath okay an infection can cause a strong odor in your urine all right dehydration that could do it because your urine is so concentrated asparagus will make your urine smell pretty funky and if you consume too much protein so if you're consuming more than 3 to 6 ounces of actual protein per meal okay not per day per meal that could be an issue especially if you don't have enough stomach acid now as you get on keto and your carbs are actually lower than 20 grams or your fasting or you're doing intense exercise what's gonna happen is that your ketones are going to go up the one that actually creates the most technical odor on breath and in urine is acetone this is a type of ketone there's three types of ketones this is one of them okay so then there's actually a meter that you can get a breath meter that you can detect this as well but if your urine is darker and cloudy and you have this odor the strong odor chances are it's going to be acetone now acetone is also used as a nail-polish remover you don't have to be concerned about that because that's something completely separate your body actually makes acetone naturally as a natural consequence of consuming more fat and less carbs it's a normal thing so it's not harmful at all so this is what I'm going to recommend number one increase chlorophyll and your diet that is a deodorizer where'd you get chlorophyll leafy greens lots of salad a lot of leafy green vegetables number two add a bit more fluids that would be not just water but electrolytes with it to be more hydrated number three consume apple cider with each meal that will help you for moderate protein make sure you're not going crazy with the protein and one last thing I noticed when people get on keto but they're not consistent so they go off it and they go on it so the body is constantly dumping out excessive acetone and because it's never developed an efficient machine at the cell level to fully burn up 100% of the ketones so you actually end up with a bit more acetone because these are just basically unused ketones so you're peeing out your fat and you're breathing at your fat in a certain quantity but if you were to do this more consistently and not go off but be very strict your system is going to become way more efficient and you're going to burn these up to the point where you're going to see less ketones in the urine and the breath and you'll have less odor all right thanks for watching if you're liking this content please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on

I'm asked so often by pow1 are as they say their dog has stinky breath and they want to get rid of it so there's a few different things that you need to think about I have six different tips that I'm going to share with you today the first one is regular cleanings from your vibe you should be doing cleanings about once a year the other one is to take care of your dog's teeth at home and brush them daily you can give a dog tooth brush like this there's a larger end for the teeth in the front a little small skinny end that can go in the back of the mouth and of course you can get toothpaste for dogs you want to get the pace for dogs not humans don't toothpaste has ingredients like without at all that can make your dog extremely ill but there are many different flavors and types brands of dog toothpaste so be sure you get one of those and then all you're gonna do is just hang on to your dog and brush away obviously it's gonna take your dog some time to get used to it the best thing to start with is a finger brush like this one then you just get your dog used to having your finger in his mouth and kind of massaging his guns and his teeth and that works out really well so that's what i always recommend Pat parents start with so number one regular cleanings with about number two brush teeth daily number three would be a dental treats formulated specifically for bad breath there's some other water additives and things like that out there different supplements and treats things like that that your dog can ingest to help with bad breath natural remedies adding coconut oil to your dog's diet parsley also has been proven to fight bad breath so those are natural ways that you can do it very inexpensive you can also use probiotics a lot of people don't realize these are just probiotic treats that help with digestion in order to get your dog's breath smelling better you need to get his gut health and Chuck you can tell us if you love these probiotic treats they're soft too you can get a probiotic powder that you sprinkle on the food anything that but as long as the gut is in check and doing what it's supposed to it's gonna help limit that bad breath a lot of bad breath is caused from and kind of healthy gut and the last thing my sixth tip is dental treats sorry dental shoes you can buy specifically for dogs raw bones are great there are chews like these bully sticks you can tell that say you love these I use these ones from bully bundles because they are 100% natural beef is the only ingredient there's no preservatives no artificial flavorings colors anything like that on these so that's why I use bully bundles and those basically anything hard that your dog chews on whether it's a bully stick like this a wrap own a rawhide anything like that it's scraping the plaque off of the teeth there are also some chew some nylon shoes and things if you don't want your dog eating the extra calories that are specifically designed with certain ridges and bumps and grooves that peel the plaque and tartar off the teeth so there's lots of things out there but it definitely starts with a regular yearly cleanings and just taking care of your dog's teeth brushing the gods teeth can seem really intimidating but it's a very easy your dog will get used to what I promise you that unless your dog is aggressive he's going to get used to it over time so think about that and these products are very inexpensive easy to do a lot of them you probably already have around your house anyway as far as like the coconut oil and the dog chews and things like that so if you have any other questions on how to make your dog's breath smell better feel free to email me Samantha hot dog tips.com thanks for watching us how to garden my hero you", "EBWzw56zmzY": "turns out everything we thought we knew about dating etiquette was wrong hey guys I'm Sloane glass with bust six feet would you be grossed out if you're on a date with a guy in the wreath of garlic some new research from Prague says probably not get this eating a lot of garlic can actually make men's body odors more attractive to women significantly more attractive huh that makes no sense so they had these guys eat a grilled cheese with six cloves of garlic first of all that's almost a handful a handful of garlic then researchers collected the body odor from the met the next week the same guys ate a plain grilled cheese hold the garlic after the odor was collected on two paths both sets were presented to a group of women who had to score the attractiveness of the scent that actually sounds like the worst job in the world the women rated the odor of the men who ate the large amounts of garlic as attractive pleasant and masculine they say the positive results have to do with garlic's

great day in today's video I wanted to go over a DIY minty mouth spray I came upon this idea because I had to give up gum and mints a while back because of the dental work that I have going on in my mouth and also just for the empty calories that it kind of brings and the great thing about this mouth spray is you can put it in two different sizes you can carry it around with you you can leave it in your car you could put it in your house you could leave it at your desk at work and it really kind of gives you just that fresh I don't know minty mouth feeling and I know this is kind of a weird video it's kind of like my DIY poopourri or poo spray video but you know I think a lot of people don't like to talk about these things but if you're kind of a gum chewer or a mint you know you like to have mints all the time this might be a really nice natural option for you to consider so let me just go through what I use what I use here is basically a glass spray bottle and you can use any size so here I have like a six ounce bottle and here I have like a two and a half ounce bottle so you could use any size bottle you can recycle a bottle if you have one that's great basically I'm just going to give you the measurements so you'll also need liquid stevia and peppermint essential oil you want to use an essential peppermint oil that you can consume and this one that I use by Young Living is perfect for consumption and it's really really good for your body and it's really really good for your health so this peppermint oil is the same peppermint oil that I use for my oil pulling at night with coconut oil I use about a teaspoon of coconut oil with about two to three drops of peppermint oil and I swish it around for anywhere from twenty to thirty minutes in the evenings and I love doing that probably almost every night I'm kind of addicted to it it really helps with my oral hygiene so this is the same peppermint oil so basically the recipe is this easy for every three ounces of water you're going to use three drops of liquid stevia and three drops of peppermint oil and that's it three ounces of water three drops of stevia and three drops of peppermint oil and spray spray away I hope this video helped let me know if you liked it let me know if you're going to try it let me know if you've tried into the other DIYs that I have and leave a comment I'll talk to you

KATZ, THANK YOU HTTPS:// WWW.THERABREATH.CO M/ (*JACLY*)) IT'S NATIONAL", "gWhF0WYG7P4": "If you occasionally have bad breath,\nsometimes called halitosis, you're not alone. Some studies show that\nfifty percent of adults have had bad breath at some point in their lives.\nThere are a number of possible causes ranging from the harmless to the serious. And\nwhat would you guess is a major cause of bad breath? No it's not garlic, although that\ndefinitely doesn't help. It's actually oral Microflora. While\nflora might sound rosy, it's actually hundreds of types of bacteria that are\nnaturally found in your mouth. And it definitely doesn't smell rosey. Your \n warm moist mouth works as a perfect hothouse for bacteria to grow. After you\neat, that bacteria goes to work consuming food particles left in your mouth and\nsecreting waste known as volatile sulfur compounds. It's these compounds which\nsmells like rotten eggs that cause bad breath. Over-the-counter mouthwashes can\nhelp kill bacteria or neutralize and temporarily mask bad smelly compounds.\nThe longer you wait to remove those food particles by brushing and flossing, the\nmore likely your breath will offend. Most of the bacteria that cause bad breath\nare found on the back of your tongue. Stick out your tongue and look way in\nthe back you'll probably see a white or brownish coating -- that's where most of\nthe bad breath bacteria hangout. So when you brush twice a day remember to brush your tongue to get rid\nof it. You can also use a tongue scraper like\nthis one. Studies have shown that tongue brushing reduces bad breath measurements\nby seventy percent. If you wear removable dentures take them out at night and be\nsure to clean them thoroughly before using them again the next morning.\nAnother cause of bad breath is dry mouth. Your saliva works around the clock to\nwash out your mouth, so if you don't have enough saliva, your mouth isn't getting\ncleaned enough. This can be caused by various\nmedications, salivary gland problems or simply by breathing through your mouth. You might try sugar-free gum or sucking\non sugar-free candies to help generate more saliva or your dentist may\nrecommend artificial saliva. Persistent bad breath or a bad taste in your mouth\ncan also be a warning sign of advanced gum disease which is caused by plaque.\nYour dentist can help bring your gums back to a healthy state. Now, if your\ndentist rules out the causes mentioned here and you brush and floss your teeth\neveryday, bad breath may be the result of another health problem such as a sinus\ncondition, diabetes,  liver or kidney disease, in which case you would want to see your\nfamily doctor. If you have any questions be sure to ask your dentist.

and anti-cholesterol and a number of other things you can look up now what is considered to be the the key ingredient is a thing called Alison and Alison is only produced it's not there is no Alison right here right now it only occurs when the garlic is damaged and then two other components mixed together to produce the Alison and it's can be a bit tricky to consume that because it breaks down pretty easily and your saliva will kill it and also your stomach acid will kill it and cooking it will kill it and you know you buy garlic powders they don't really have any in there because it's decomposes pretty quickly though I believe a lot of the components that it breaks down into have other health benefits there's a number of healthy components to garlic anyways I'm going to show you the best way to consume the Alison without it breaking down all we have here is a glass of water okay it's about one glass yes that is a pickle jar but I like to recycle so there you go so anyways what you want to do is you want to break down the garlic really good and then you want to put it in the water and let it soak for about thirty minutes to an hour or 15 minutes to an hour I've heard I generally wait about 45 minutes and that will give a time to all the the two ingredients to mix together with Alison and produces the most Alison pasta and then you drink that water and it will bypass your saliva which won't kill it and also it will it you'll have a lot of water in your stomach so the stomach acid won't really break it down and Alison will be all in the water and your stomach absorbs water directly it doesn't really absorb food directly your intestines do that but it can absorb some things like water and other small components so what will happen is the water will have Alison in it and it will get absorbed directly through your stomach before the acid breaks it down and the Alison will actually get absorbed with the water in your stomach that's the this is the most efficient way to get the Alison into your blood and so I'm just going to illustrate this for you now also I would suggest that you drink this after you don't drink it on an empty stomach garlic is quite powerful and can be even dangerous in large amounts and also on an empty stomach it can possibly hurt your stomach it can possibly even damage it and can also possibly damage your intestines so you want to be careful with it and this is a kind of a medium sized clove and that's when we use and so let's get started here I'll show you how I like to cut it up this knife here is pretty dull I like to use a dull knife to cut a lot of things because I can cut stuff in my hand without really hurting myself okay a lot of times I say use sharp knives and that can be good too for different reasons but I find using a dull knife can be quite handy actually because I can cut a lot of stuff in my hand this is how I often uh cut this garlic up some of its fallen anyways however you want to do it the point is to you just want to get it smashed up as possible you don't want to really be taking any big chunks because that's a that one we have much Allyson in it you just want to smash it up and get them juices out and if you can see it's getting all juicy and we're getting some on the blade there now this there's a lot of healthy components in the garlic and I suggest you click on the internet you can even use this topically for bike if you have athlete's foot or some some fungus or an infection I believe also this can kill some of the bacteria in your gut which can actually be kind of productive but that gets replaced yogurt can help replace that though I don't really eat dairy very really avoid it anyways you can see we're getting all pumped up here so for the that's pretty good right there probably do a little more but for the sake of the video I think you get the idea it's pretty smashed up pretty good minced up you just want to take this and put it in the water II all right there you go just want to let that hang out there for about half an hour or half an hour to an hour and it'll taste pretty strong it almost tastes like an orange but see the key here is all that water it's going to prevent your stomach acid from destroying it for breaking it down and then your stomach's guns or bit so there you go thought I'd share that tip for you see I'll bust it up oh it's into a bunch of pieces really it could even be broken down even more than that you know the more smashed the better it's what and so once again I suggest you take this after about a meal after about a half hour after a meal 15 minutes to a half hour because it can be rough on the stomach if you do it on an empty stomach also this is organic which is more powerful it's more potent so I would definitely suggest you eat organic everything basically and believe that's all that I had to say wish you luck on that and leave some comments about how you like to use garlic and all of that personally I find it quite tasty even raw I'll just eat a clover all sometimes it's pretty good it's kind of spicy but so subscribe and I'll be coming out with more videos and see you later",

Boz and I'm back again for the fourth in four-part series on what can go wrong when you take on a ketogenic diet you've seen through the first three posts of this message that there are some pretty gnarly things that happen when you take on a ketogenic diet but if you're prepared you can navigate your way through them and get to the other side where those side-effects go away today's post we're gonna talk about bad breath the bad breath associated with ketosis is very real and patients do bring it up all the time let's unpack why this happens when your body produces ketones at first you produce way more ketones than your mitochondria or your furnaces inside the cells know how to use this mismatch between produced ketones and those resources that can burn them turn into an overflow spigot within the body you will pee out extra ketones into your urine and you'll breathe out extra ketones into your breath to keep the number of ketones in your blood at a safe and low enough level when that happens that chemical called breathe out is called acetone and it smells weird some call it a fruity smell or a metallic smell but either way it's a dead giveaway that you're totally burning ketones one of the monitors to look for ketone production is to measure the byproduct of acetone coming out your breath strangely not everybody suffers from this in the first few weeks some people just don't notice the breath that smells weird others it happens for the first few weeks maybe up to six weeks and then it fades away and still others continue to come to my clinic many months down the road saying I just can't stand the breath they're usually missing up on something that I'm gonna point out so stay tuned so when you first turn that body into a ketone producing machine and you have the extra tea ketones coming out your breath you're going to have the most significant smell in your breath at that point I find it helpful to tell patients that this isn't a new concept to produce ketones and that our ancestors hundreds of thousands of years ago spent most of their time in ketosis and their teeth lasted for a lifetime because that constant bathing of this anti-inflammatory molecule they didn't do what we do today which is bathe our teeth in sugar and starchy foods from nearly the time we can eat until the grave when you do that you provide a bath for tiny bacteria throughout the body to grow and set up homes in all kinds of areas in your in your mouth these plaques when you go to the dentist and they scrape off plaques those are micro little organism colonies of bacteria this needs to be removed you need to see a dentist and get those plaques taken care of if you do have a cavity somewhere that the bacteria have NAR lead a hole into your tooth that also is a really good source for a terrible smelling breath so number one get your teeth checked number two stay hydrated when you get dehydrated that concentrates the bacteria in your mouth not only does the hydration wash out your mouth and flush away those ketones a little better as well as flush away those bacteria a little better but when you're hydrated you actually pee more the urine that you make also flushes out extra ketones keeping the balance between the ketones you've produced and the ones going out in the urine a better match this leaves less ketones for you to breathe out and therefore your breath is less stinky finally I tell patients to stay the course in fact if you want to make stinky breath you should go in and out of ketosis several times a week that stimulation of what kind of bacteria grow in a sugar Fred state and the other kind of bacteria that like the ketone fed state the most amount of bacteria can grow when you keep feeding both colonies if you transition to a ketogenic state many of those sugar fed bacteria will disappear but you have to stay the course into ketosis the other part of that equation by staying the course I do mean the ketosis production the ketone production in your body will be matched by the cells whose mitochondria are burning ketones and the only way you're gonna reach that match is to stay in ketosis by going in and out of ketosis you turn on the mitochondria and then you turn them off and then you turn on the mitochondria and you turn them off never really getting the body fully adapted to a ketogenic state this takes those levels of ketones up and down and up and down and that mismatches the production for how well you can use the ketones and you'll end up with the acetone in your breath again so again the three big rules for how to help with that bad breath that comes with ketosis is get teeth checked stay hydrated and stay the course stay in ketosis until your body's fully adapted thanks for checking in if you want to learn more about it this ketogenic diet check out the book I wrote any way you can it's on Amazon or on Kindle or on audible I'm signing out for now I'm dr.

very very very valuable and powerful for our subscribers and people our lifetime members who have the four-face formula so anyway so jumping into this video I get the question a lot from people that ask or say hey how come my breath smells like feces or I have feces breath or how come how come or why do when I laugh or talk you know people around me say hey who pass gas or did you pass gas they'll ask that questions so it smells like a feces smell or it smells like a gas like someone passed gas which smells pretty much like feces right so what what what I want to direct your attention to is this right here one you want to make sure you check you oral hygiene that's number one your old your teeth your gums you want to make sure that your dental visits are good coming back right you want to make sure that they're good to go okay so that's number that's number one all right so that you want to rule out anything with cavities Jenna fighters you know just cold sores anything that could be possible alright as a relates to your he and the oral part okay but let's say you've done that you've got good dental check-ups good dental visits and now you are trying to figure out what's going on you're trying to figure out why do you still have this fee see smell or this odor all right so this is what I want to talk to you guys about right here you want a number to dig deeper all right and you want to start focusing in on all right you want to focus in on your digestive tract that is really where you want to focus okay and I believe that's what's causing a lot of you also problems a lot of y'all issues as it relates to halitosis bad breath I speak to about 90 to 95 percent of people via email or you know phone and everybody says hey I have good oral hygiene meaning that they went to the dentist they went to the doctor they can't find anything everything is good so now you have to move to the next phase of it which is you want to focus on you know your digestive tract so what tends to happen if you're getting a feces odor or feces smell what tends to happen is the foods that you're eating you definitely need to be aware of what you're eating and what happens what the process looks like okay so I'll give you an example there's been times where I've bought potatoes right so Idaho potatoes or whatever the brown ones or the red ones I bought many of the potatoes over my lifespan and there's been so many times where I've had those potatoes all bunched up right and they've been placed away and put away in my cupboard or cabinet all right and Orey the refrigerator for a certain period of time and over time what happens is those potatoes start to ferment okay those potatoes start to really really break down and it causes an odor it causes a gas so when something firm its all right fermentation it's it's it's the breakdown process it starts the breakdown process okay and so you guys need to be aware of that you need to be aware of certain foods high carbohydrate foods they start the breakdown process in your digestive tract and what happens is a lot of times a lot of residue is left behind in your intestines which leaves off bad bacteria which then leaves off some bad critters all right so that's what typically tends to happen so so when that process happens ladies and gentlemen now you've got a gas that is going on there's a gas there's a fermentation gas and I'll get a little bit more in deep in-depth with this information in the four-face formula I'm actually finishing up on the video it'll be in the bonus section so for those of you that are already a lifetime members all you would need to do is log in and pick up this information which I'm gonna go more in depth with it all right and what to do and how to do it and everything like that but yeah so that's typical typically what's happening you know your your body your digestive tract is experiencing the fermentation process of you know those particular foods that you're eating so it's not always necessarily meat okay but it's the high sugary foods and bacterias love to feed off of high sugary foods so that's when the fermentation begins alright so that's just an example I just want to share this video with you guys so if you're looking for solutions for this definitely if you've already gathered the four phase formula you definitely you definitely want to you definitely want to go ahead and look at that information it'll be in the back office by this weekend I have some information on what you can do things things to do starting now starting the day to

change in your mouth and\nyour daily routine. Although bad breath can affect everyone, people\nwith braces are often more susceptible to developing it.\nFortunately, bad breath is preventable and treatable! What Causes Bad Breath with Braces? The main culprit of bad breath is bacteria\nin the mouth. Braces make it easier for food to get stuck\nin the small spaces around the teeth. If food isn\u2019t removed, bacteria will feed on it\nand produce an unpleasant odor. Poor oral hygiene,\u00a0gum disease, smoking,\nand drinking can cause bad breath. How Can I Prevent Bad Breath? Number 1. Brush and Floss Regularly.\nOral hygiene is important when you have dental braces. You need to brush in the morning,\nnight, and after a meal. If the bad breath persists after brushing twice a day, you may\nwant to increase the frequency of brushing and flossing. Use a threader to floss your teeth to remove\nfood particles from small spaces where the toothbrush cannot reach. Number 2. Use Antibacterial Mouthwash.\nAfter you brush and floss, use an antibacterial mouthwash to avoid bad breath with braces.\nIt will get into the space between the teeth and kills germs and bacteria. If you have\na sensitive mouth, use a mouthwash that doesn\u2019t burn. If you want to go natural, add a few drops\nof tea tree oil and peppermint oil in water along with baking soda. This concoction doesn\u2019t\nburn at all and is antibacterial. It will kill the bacteria and disinfect the mouth. Number 3. Stay Hydrated.\nA dry mouth reduces the production of saliva, which further harbors an ideal environment\nfor bacteria to thrive. Dehydration will increase the chances of bad breath. Drink lots of water throughout the day to\nprevent dehydration. It will keep your mouth clean and prevent the growth of bacteria. Number 4. Eat the Right Foods.\nAnother bad breath remedy is to avoid foods with strong-smelling ingredients like garlic.\nChoose the right foods to eat with braces. Avoid sugary and sticky foods as they will\nlead to bad oral health. It may further lead to tooth decay and bad breath. Number 5. Use Breath Mints.\nIf you have bad breath after following all the oral hygiene habits, you can use breath\nmints temporarily. Avoid breath-freshening gum as it may stick to the braces. You can\nuse the mints till your mouth gets adjusted to the new oral hygiene habits. It is a common\nbad breath cure but doesn\u2019t rely on it completely to get rid of the bad breath. Number 6. Use a Water Pick.\nA water pick is excellent for cleaning between the gums and teeth braces, and teeth and gums.\nThey can even reach the hard to reach places where bacteria can grow. They use powerful\njets of water to clean the teeth, and they are more effective than a toothbrush. Lastly. Schedule Regular Orthodontic Visits.\nIt is important to schedule regular dental appointments when you have teeth straightening\nbraces to get your teeth cleaned. It will also help the dentist identify any issue that\nmay lead to bad breath. You can ensure that your teeth and gums stay healthy during and\nafter the orthodontic treatment.

"and hey what's going on ladies and gentlemen what's up with you mark McNeely here also known as breath solution with McNeely on YouTube I'm also the founder of the breath killer secrets product which is located below in the description box of this video and in that product ladies and gentlemen I've helped hundreds of students get a breakthrough in their life with just learning different techniques and remedies and just learning about overall health in general to find out what the root cause is as to why they have an issue with halitosis bad breath so there's information below in the description box where you can check that out I also put together some diet guides and diet plans to help with curing and healing the gut so that people can really really live a life of fulfillment and purpose and so in this video though today I wanted to talk to you all about how to get rid of bad breath or how to get rid of BB or halitosis from the nose and in the throat and so I did a video a while back a little bit of goal giving you guys many techniques and you guys seem to have liked that information but in this video I want to switch it up and I want to share with you how you can use a nasal rinse right and no user rinse bottle and some nasal solution and I'm going to show it to you I'm going to demonstrate for you guys how to actually do it here in this video so that you can actually go ahead and try this at home okay everything in this video is going to be completely safe this is something that I've used and it's just an extra little technique to kind of help you guys create some momentum create some I will call it force and really create leverage in terms of rinsing out the sinus cavity and the nasal cavity alright the proper way you know many of you probably have went to your ear nose and throat physician or your allergy specialist and they tell you to rinse out your sinus cavity and many of you might do it some of you do it wrong some of you don't know if you're doing it right some of you oh and your hand back some of you complain about getting water in your nose it can be very difficult at first it can be kind of Cayden but what you want to do is guys you know just really try to continue to stay consistent and really just kind of practice at home and and then things will get better eventually it'll get easier and easier so a lot of times what causes halitosis bad breath and why you may be smelling it in your nose it can be a combination of two things are number one it could be acid buildup that has stemmed from the stomach from the gut that has went all the way into your esophagus into the back of the throat and a lot of times when that happens you may not even have heartburn right so some of you may have may have may experience you know a lot of just it feels like mucus all right but really what it is is acid and also bow you know that's just basically sitting in the back of the throat all right so that has to be removed if that's not removed you will leave a stench or an odor or a gas okay because remember the foods that we eat you know they become acidic as the acid starts to break it down and so a lot of times with that your pH is off the pH is definitely gonna be much lower and so if bowel is getting up mucus bile or you know a stomach acid is getting up and it's stemming from the back of the throat you're gonna run into some issues with that all right so that's the first way another way it can be if you have food allergies food triggers seasonal allergies all right you can get the post nasal drip - so now you've got a combination of both and a lot of times it's difficult to tell which is which so for the sake of this video I'm going to be showing you through demonstration how you can use a French borrow and also you can get a bowl you can make a pre pre-mixed bottle if you want I make my whole solutions but this is one way that you can do it to actually flush out your sinuses now I'm going to explain to you real quick how to do this because I know once I start the process I'm not going to be able to talk at all it's very difficult to talk so what I'll be doing is you can complete this process however many times you want I don't do it often because I've learned how to now eat and how to really heal the gut once you learn that which again there'll be links below in the description box so you can learn how to actually heal your gut through dieting and nutrition and also through the four phase formula I'll leave links below for you guys to check out but once you learn the route calls you won't have to do this that often all right I know we're running into allergy season here so for a lot of people you're gonna have a lot of pollen and things like that that likes to get caught up into the nasal cavity and so it's good to just kind of keep things clean and clear all right definitely as you're moving about your days and weeks now you just fill up however many of saline package you want I like to use sea salt none iodine and you want to use distilled water you don't want to use faucet water ever just because it's not safe it's not purified water it's you know got all kind of acids and just corrosion all right and you don't want to shoot that up your nose right which could cause some other issues you know but definitely you can create your own solution you can make it really hypertonic meaning very strong you know it's up to you the stronger the stronger your solution is it will burn so what I'd only use is about one to one and a half tablespoon I'll fill it up with the steel water I make sure that the waters warm alright for both this size you probably only need really about one you know one teaspoon or two teaspoons or one and a half teaspoon all right and now what you're gonna do is simply you know you're gonna pour the solution in right so I'm going to show you pour it in there and guys I'm in the bathroom so bear with me all right so now I got my solution in here and so you want to just do a two part alright you want to do a two part of rents so the first part is you want to you want to take the water in your mouth all right and you want to hold your head back and kind of gargle get it you know in the back of your throat gargle with it but when you and then and then what you're going to do is you're going to come with your nasal rinse bottom not with your head back but with with it four and you're going to squeeze it you know basically just flush it out flush everything out why are your gardener so you've got a garble going on and you're creating pressure so all of that will come out all right and you just want to repeat this process several times so I'm going to try to show you guys hopefully I can adjust my camera here because I'm in my bathroom and we'll see how things work all right so hopefully you guys can see that right there you won't see me but I'm going to go ahead and take some solution and I'm going to start the process so just bear with me just watching you guys and you guys can implement this at home and you just want to repeat that process right so the first step is a lot of times what happens is when they hold my phone back up for you a lot of times is the the mucus all right of the post nasal drip or the acid gets stuck in the back of the voice box right so a lot of times if you're just shooting it out with the nasal rinse it comes out it just takes a lot of time it takes a longer time to get it all now right because so much can be in the back of your voice box all right in the back of the sinus cavity so that's why I use the gargling method okay you know the whole you hold your head back and gargle and leaning for you know gargle and then come with the nasal rinse on each nostril and let the water flow out sometimes you can put your hand in in a way all right as the water is flowing out and seeing to see if there's anything sticky or slimy in the way all right if there's anything sticky and slimy when you open your fingers like that that means that you have some acid or mucus in the back of your throat all right one more time so you guys can see all right so take a little bit if you can try to gargle why you're doing it and you're gonna really hit it on the nail right it's just like you're hammering a nail right on them right on the money so that's pretty much a technique that you guys can use you can repeat this technique as much as you need to but this is a really good technique that can help with really getting the back of the throat cleansed out as well as irrigating the sinus cavity to make sure that it's free for mucus and by doing this guys at least two times per day once in the morning then definitely before you go to bed you'll notice a major major difference in terms of your breath overall and you shouldn't have that odor that smell all right that feces smell because you've washed away and wrenched the way it's all of the book and things like that so I hope you guys like this video and definitely definitely check out my products below guys I believe that it's going to be a blessing to you if you have any questions feel free to email me I'll leave my

But if your breath has that kind of odor, you may not\nhave anyone to talk to anyway. Find out more on today's episode of\nThis Old Tooth. Hello everyone! You are listening to This Old Tooth! A podcast devoted to providing you\nwith honest agenda, free information about how you can get and keep a beautiful,\nhealthy smile for life. I am your host, Dr. Lisa Germain. Today, I will be taking my eighth small bite in my series about bad breath, its causes and what you can do about it. My topic today is one that is not easily discussed. But I will put on my big girl pants and discuss the potential things\nthat make your breath smell like feces. First of all,\nlet's remember that the mouth is the entry to the GI tract and what\ngoes in must come out. Have you ever wondered why food\nthat tastes and smells so good going in comes out the other end smelling not so good? Unless you are one of those\npeople who swear yours doesn't stink. We are frequently all a little touchy and certainly very private about the odors\nwe might be leaving in the bathroom. Stool is made up of undigested food,\nbacteria, mucous and dead cells. It usually smells bad because of the bacteria and believe\nit or not, parasites. It is the job of our GI tract to filter\nout the disease causing culprits and eliminate them from our body instead\nof absorbing them into our bloodstream. But it also can have compounds that\nproduce an especially unpleasant smell. Stool that contains a lot of fat and or\nalcohol can smell particularly bad. If you find that you were leaving an especially\nfoul odor after a visit to the bathroom, chances are your breath smells similar. Adjusting your diet and drinking a lot of water is usually the simple\nsolution to this problem. But if it persists, you want to check with your physician\nto rule out the possibility that you might have a more serious\nunderlying medical problem. Crohn's disease,\nulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome are all things that can\ncause this problem to persist. Now, a lot has been written recently about gut health, and this has made\nthe term microbiome a household word. The GI tract contains more bacterial cells than there are in the entire body,\nand they need to be in balance. This is home base for the bacteria\nin your digestive tract. Now, here they help you breakdown food and turn nutrients into things\nyour body can use. They stop growing when they run out of\nfood, so you'll only have what you need. Studies have found that if you have too\nmuch of a certain kind of bad bacteria in your gut microbiome,\nyou're more likely to have bad breath. And if this is what you suspect,\na nutritionist might be able to help you get balanced and in addition, might\nrecommend taking a probiotic supplement. Because the digestive tract contains more bacterial cells than the rest of the body,\nit is extremely important that your bowels are completely functional and excretion\nof waste products occurs regularly. A blockage in your intestinal tract can cause breath that smells like feces do not\nonly to the fact that it is trapped inside your intestines,\nbut also due to food you've eaten that can't move down your\nintestinal tract to be eliminated. Anything you eat while unable to pass\na bowel movement remains inside your digestive tract and ferments,\ncausing bad breath. Intestinal obstructions are dangerous\nmedical emergencies that occur when a blockage forms in either your\nlarge or your small intestine. Any number of things associated with intestinal obstruction can cause this\nunpleasant breath odor, including decreased appetite, bloating,\nabdominal swelling, constipation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or cramps,\nan inability to pass gas. If you suspect that you might have\nan abdominal obstruction however, bad breath is the least of your\nworries, see your physician immediately. It is important that your bowels work well\nto absorb nutrients that are necessary to keep your body\ngoing, but also to keep out any foods, chemicals and germs\nthat could do you harm. And the good news is that once you get things moving again, your breath will\nno longer have that horrible odor. In addition to GI problems,\nsinus infections and other respiratory problems can cause your breath\nto smell like feces as well. These can be caused by bronchitis,\nviral colds, strep throat and more. It is the mucus associated with a sinus\ninfection that may have a bad odor, which can cause the smelly breath as\nwell as a bad taste in your mouth. Intense sinus pressure can also cause pain\nin your gums, which can lead to toothaches, gum,\npain or general pain in your mouth. Some sinus infections can become chronic, and if this happens,\nno amount of brushing, flossing, mouthwash or mints will remedy the poopy\nsmell that your breath will emit. Getting treatment for the chronic sinus\nproblem is crucial for many reasons. Your breath just being one of them. Now children are more likely to develop sinus infections after\na viral cold than adults. So if your child has gotten over a cold\nbut you notice that their breath is particularly bad,\nyou might want to take them back to the doctor and make sure that they\ndon't have a sinus infection. The cause of the problem may start out viral, which would not require an antibiotic. But if it persists, it can turn into a bacterial problem\nbecause the warm, wet nature of the sinus is a perfect environment\nfor bacteria to grow. This can create a secondary\nproblem or a secondary infection. Only your doctor can tell you whether or not an antibiotic would be necessary\nto get rid of this problem. And it is important not to just\nself medicate in these instances. You don't want to make your body used\nto an antibiotic if you don't need it, because when you do need it,\nit might not work. Strep throat is another kind of bacterial\ninfection, usually characterized by red raw throat, difficulty swallowing,\nsometimes little pus pockets in the back of your throat and it can\ncause horrible breath. I have a vivid memory of the few times\nthat my kids had strep throat because it gave them this very distinct\nkind of bad breath. It smelled different and much\nworse than when they had a cold. Again, if you get rid of the source of the problem, the bad breath\nwill take care of itself. But it still needs to be diagnosed\nby a doctor who will swab the throat and send it to a lab for a culture to make\nsure that antibiotics are necessary. And that's the scoop on breath that smells like poop. AND NOW FOR A FUN FACT! Levi Spear Parmley, a dentist from New Orleans,\nwhich is my hometown, is credited with inventing the first form\nof dental floss. In 1819,  he recommended running a wax\nand silk thread between your teeth to dislodge\nthat irritating matter which no brush can remove and which is\nthe real source of disease. He considered this the most\nimportant part of oral care.

"7uVd96wPngo": "a science get rid of garlic breath fast lingering bad breath is the price many food lovers are willing to pay for treats like pesto shrimp scampi and ramen but for those who want a quick and easy solution to rid themselves of that garlicky taste and smell which can last for as long as 24 hours after eating certain foods there's a quick and easy garlic-breath remedy munching on apples lettuce and mint leaves can help significantly decrease the levels of odiferous compounds in your breath according to a tiny but compelling experiment by researchers at Ohio State University specifically certain compounds and enzymes in raw apple raw lettuce and mint leaves react with the chemicals that create garlic breath neutralizing the odor it's better than mouthwash garlic breath can come from multiple places in the body not just food particles in your mouth partially digested food in your stomach also emits this smell so brushing your teeth or gargling with mouthwash won't always do the trick by contrast the neutralizing foods identified by the study interact with the garlic in the stomach to deodorize the vapors preventing the garlicky compounds from making it to your bloodstream and being expressed from your lungs into the air you exhale brushing teeth has no effect on what you have already swallowed or digested explained lead researcher Cheryl barrier a professor and chair of OSU's Department of Food Science and Technology and Apple reacts with the garlic in your mouth or stomach to deodorize the volatile zin your stomach before they are digested into your bloodstream so yes eating the Apple is more effective than just brushing your teeth to test the effects of certain foods on garlic breath study co-author Rita Morano first chewed one clove of raw garlic for 25 seconds and then chased it with cooler water that served as the control treatment moranto then repeated the garlic chewing over the course of several days each day testing the effect of just one food or drink on her garlic breath she tried raw & microwaved apples raw and microwaved lettuce mint leaves mint juice and hot green tea the researchers then measured the level of garlic compounds in nerado's breath for 60 minutes after each bad breath treatment and then rank the foods and juices according to how quickly they help decrease the garlic vapors they found that raw apple raw lettuce and mint leaves were the most effective at significantly decreasing the levels of most vapors that cause garlic breath white garlicky foods need a specific chaser Apple's lettuce and mint leaves are all high in phenolic compounds aromatic chemicals found in plants that react directly with the compounds that create garlic breath the foods are also high in the enzyme polyphenol oxidase which causes browning in fruits and vegetables and reductase which helps catalyze the breakdown of organic compounds both enzymes are thought to speed up the reaction between the phenolic compounds and the garlic vapors apple juice mint juice heated apple and heated lettuce also significantly decreased the levels of garlic vapors in the breath though they weren't as effective as the raw versions the cooked and the raw were similar but it's just that the raw foods have more enzymes which help speed up the process said barring earth but certainly eating an apple or drinking mint tea at the end of the meal would be a good deodorizer of course because this experiment was so small the results would have to be replicated across many more garlic-breath victims but because mint in particular was

to talk about it [Music] hey beauties welcome back to my channel bad breath is something that can be very embarrassing and that is why i am here to talk about it it's not something that is peculiar to some people even the best people that practice like very good oral hygiene it can happen to almost anybody it depends on like at what stage or what is happening like at one point or the other sometimes when you fast of course if you're not eating in a while you will have bad breath but you tend to have bad breath bad breath can be as the result of many things can be as a result of medication hormones things that you can't even control even when you've done almost everything you might need to do sometimes you still have bad breath once in a while sometimes food can be stuck in

oneself or a particular kind of person that is why i am here to talk about it because it can happen to almost anybody so i'm going to be talking about natural remedies in which we can use the word of bad breath so whether it's for you or any other person you know these are things that we should take note of and there are many things you can use to get rid of bad breath the first thing you should do is to chew on fresh herbs fresh herbs in this case parsley basil mint mint is very very good even if you can't grab any other thing even if you don't have a mouth spray if you have any of those fresh herbs at home it's really going to help you especially mint leaves like instead of having that bad bread skin imagine having like very good breaths like this that is minty there's a reason why they put a lot of mint in our paste that we use our teeth so of course the means will really work so even if you have any other thing just chew on some fresh herbs and bad breath began you can also use rosemary cilantro it is believed that the chlorophyll in this herbs is going to help to water the bad breath apart from the nice smells they have so it's not just about the fragrance it's also in the content it has so the chlorophyll will help to like water bad breath the second thing you can use to erase bad breath is the same creams there are like kind of mouthwashes that have zinc if you start like zinc in particular is going to really help for bad breath or what if you don't have a mouthwash that contains zinc you can also use like zinc tablets or zinc supplements just like grind them into powder mix with a bit of water and use it to gargle like a mouth rinse and of course bad breath is a thing of the past you can supplement with probiotics anytime you feel that you're having bad breath it might be something that is happening from your guts like from your belly or your stomach what you can do in this case is to take a lot of probiotics you can take yogurt or you can even take probiotic supplements by the time you combat the bad bacteria with probiotics of course bad breath will be gone number four is to take a lot of apple cider vinegar apart from apple cider vinegar helping with so many things it's it's digestion it helps to keep your cravings at bay and all those other things it can also help with bad breath so take some apple cider vinegar you can take it and ingest it with your water or you can even use it as a mouthwash if you don't have mouthwash you can use some apple cider vinegar as mouthwash just take a bit mix it with water and use it to rinse your mouth thoroughly before you spit it out on the other hand you can actually like drink apple cider vinegar it's also going to help you like tremendously it's going to help with digestion and many other things number five stay hydrated sometimes bad breath is not something that is an overkill it might just be for the fact that you are dehydrated i don't have a lot of water going on in your system drinking water does a lot of things for you is flush yourself toxins from your body it's a body detox like people are asking that what's the best way to detox the best way to detox is to take a lot of water it's as simple as that adding some other things to it it's just like added benefits adding like cucumbers mains it's just one of the other benefits but the first thing you need to do is to drink a lot of water water is key water is the best thing you can do so stay hydrated as much as possible another thing that you can do if you want to get rid of bad breath is not to skip your meals of course when you fast you have bad breath but if you can't help it if most times fasting is for a good thing it's good to engage in fasting to reset your hormones to boost your immunity and for those that want to even like shed some weight so you just have to balance it all out just now anytime you fast most times you might have bad breath but like i mentioned earlier on there are many things you can do as is to get rid of the bad breath so you can also like engage in using nature's own toothbrushes there are many toothbrushes and these things are not like perfect apples celery carrots they have fibrous in nature and they can help to keep your mouth very healthy these foods scrub plaque from your teeth they stimulate your gums and refreshing your breath snacking on these foods are also going to like help you to increase saliva production if there's an increase in saliva in your mouth it will not give you bad breath so nature's toothbrushes celeries apples carrots which have a lot of high fiber in them are very good for you if you want to like get rid of broad bread like almost totally in addition to like taking water consuming a lot of green tea too it's going to help you a great deal it's been studied and it's been found that if you take at least one to two cups of green tea in a day can help to like stop halitosis which is also like bad breath so consuming green seed is just very beneficial it has a lot of immense benefits for weight loss for healthy weight for like getting rid of belly fat it also helps with bad breath this is because of the antibacterial properties found in the polyphenols in green tea so drink your water and drink your green tea you can also use baking soda as a mouth rinse just like i said earlier on for the apple cider vinegar take at least one teaspoon of baking soda and dilute it in like a glass of water use this as a monitorings like morning and evening and you see that bad breath will totally go away you should also engage in using a tongue scraper sometimes the residues of what is in our mouth is the thing that gives rise to bad breath the plaque and all that invest in a tongue scraper to remember all dead skin cells bacteria and all those nasty things that might have been left from the residue of food so apart from brushing your teeth even if you don't have a tongue scraper you can try using your toothbrush at first this will not help in total but it's better than using nothing even if you can just grab a toothbrush for the main purpose of like using to scrape your tongue it's very very good for you when you finish brushing your teeth ensure that you also scrape your tongue after you finish brushing not just your teeth your tongue too needs to be cleaned thoroughly on the top of your tongue underneath your tongue needs to be cleaned thoroughly so that you don't have bad breath and of course the last but not the least is for you to brush regularly how often do you brush and how often do you change your toothbrush as well these things are things that we've learned all the year like what we know from being little but you need to like imbibe it as a culture brush at least twice a day if you can especially at night because sometimes you go to bed with a lot of food in your mouth and those things just stay there they hang there till the next morning by the next morning you might have had a lot of cued up and that's when the bad breath even comes like strongly so if you can brush lasting at night i like doing this because it just like tells you mentally that after i have brushed nothing else should go into my mouth so it's actually like helps with all those like late night or midnight snacking but this is like something that i just do as a habit it doesn't mean that this is what you should do or this work for everybody sometimes some people go to brush their teeth and after some time you still feel the punch of hunger so but the major thing is you need to brush as much as you can brush floss point your tongue clean your teeth properly and try to visit your dentist as well i know there are many many of us are guilty of not visiting the dentist to check on our things and all that but you should you need to like keep a routine check on your teeth so guys these are some of the ways in which you can carry the bad breath do you know any other one let me know in the comments

you cough up this will help dislodge them if you can't seem to get them out of your tonsils next up brush your teeth after every meal or at least twice a day like go-to toothpaste is the Jason's seek fresh strengthening toothpaste it's rich in blue algae and spearmint it has no fluoride SLS or parabens so I feel good about using this every night my go-to toothbrush is the oral-b Pro 1000 a power

tongue this helps get rid of bad breath almost instantly next tip of gargle with salt in hot water this is a well known remedy to help with sore throats if you're sick but it's also great to do once a week if you have tonsillitis the warm water will have a soothing effect and the salt will help reduce inflammation and helps keep the mouth clean when I was younger a mom and she would always give me

essential for a healthy human body through sweat the body gets rid of certain toxic or waste material sweat is always accompanied with the slight - strong smell depending on the body type and other physiological factors a stronger smell like vinegar or onion can be quite embarrassing however sweat is free of odor by nature it is the bacteria that cover the surface of the skin to break the sweat once the bacteria breaks down the sweat it produces different compounds and odor the two common acid compounds related with odor include the propionic acid vinegar like smell and ice over lirik acid smell of cheese there are also two types of sweat glands in the human body which further generates two different kinds of sweat hi eccrine and apocrine eccrine is commonly found in most of the parts of the body and is also responsible for cooling down the body compared to the apocrine they are much smaller the gland is mainly made up of water and secretes the sweat directly onto the skin a Pokhran on the other hand is found mainly under body parts such as the groin area and armpits it's also found near the eyelids and the sweat it produces is thicker with a lot of bacteria that feeds on it a Pokhran is prominent till puberty one of the most common reasons for the vinegar like smell of sweat is lack of proper personal hygiene people who don't take regular baths smell more than other the odor producing bacteria increases if the waste isn't regularly cleaned from the external skin as the body odor is a direct response of the odor compounds generated by sweat and the external skin another factor that affects the kind of smell one sweat produces is the kind of food the person consumes some people smell bad even after taking regular body washes people who consume a protein-rich diet may have more offensive sweat odour sulfur rich foods and some organic compounds have a very strong odor and that gets released from the body after the breakdown of food some foods associated with vinegar like body odor are dairy and poultry items red meat seafood excessive use of garlic and onions cabbage cauliflower and some spices like mustard seed and coriander apart from personal

finally get rid of it in this video I'm going to share with you the two things that cause halitosis or chronic bad breath and then three things that you can do to finally get rid of your bad breath and to cure it long-term and naturally if you're new to this channel welcome my name is Peggy Schumer from Peggy Schumer calm welcome to god feelings the channel to help you to take your health back into your own hands and to really become your own health expert now the cause that everybody's talking about when it comes to bad breath is obviously your teeth and your gums now you are maybe already flossing your teeth three times per day and you're brushing like crazy and you use the tongue scraper and the mouthwash and all of that and it's still the same now if that's the cause for your bad breath just go to the dentist get a teeth cleaning get a check-up and then you can rule out this cause however guys it's much more likely then the problem is not here because we already checked this right the cause is here in your digestion digestive problems are one of the number one reason why we have bad breath and we don't get rid of it chronic bad breath halitosis for example maybe your stomach acid is low and then you have pathogenic bacteria over growing in your stomach and they produce gas and this is coming up and it doesn't smell good or you have a weakened digestive system and the foods that you eat are actually not broken properly down and they start purifying in your gut this produces a gas called ammonia when you come into a pigsty this is what you smell ammonia very stinging gas and that can also cause halitosis or maybe you're eating too many acidifying foods and you have an off balance from alkaline and acidic in most cases all of those causes are actually coming together now let's dive into the three things that you can do on a daily basis to get rid of your halitosis of your bad breath long term number one it's really important what you you before you go to bed so you want to make sure you eat a dinner and you have your dinner finished three or four hours before you go to bed and that dinner is low in fat and low in protein why is that important because that puts the least amount of stress on your digestive system and we have the best chance to not have malabsorption and food putrefying in your gut and feeling pathogenic bacteria and then having more bad breath when you wake up next to your loved one in the morning and you feel like you know what I mean by the way if you want to improve your gut health long term I created the gut healing challenge which is a one-week meal plan and recipe guide with a lot of background information about healing foods take your gut health to the next level and improve chronic digestive issues the second thing that you wanted you to improve halitosis your bad breath is you want to amp up your good stomach acid because this good stomach acid is gonna take care of the bad bacteria which produce the acidity and the gas coming up and the smell how to do that I've got a separate video which are linked down below in description and also up here about how to rebuild your HCL levels make sure you dive straight into that after watching this video and the third hack to stop the embarrassment move the bad breath is to drink healing cleansing juices which are very alkalizing for your body good tip is before bed and after waking up to either drink straight cucumber juice or straight celery juice both of them will take care of first improving your digestion overall taking care of pathogenic bacteria alkalizing your body and hydrating your gut which all comes together and helps improving your breath quick summary three things that you can do to improve your health ptosis to get rid of this bad breath forever and naturally and long-term number one improve your stomach acid take care of that got a video on that make sure you check that out second have a light dinner so no chicken eggs theory or any of that low fat low protein lots of nutrients and three to four hours finish before you go to bed and third have a cleansing healing juice eight to 16 ounces is a good amount before bed and after waking up my favourites are cucumber juice and celery juice now God feeling I want to know from you which of the three things that I mentioned are you willing to put into action for at least seven days from now let me know in the comments below which one of those you choose and when are you going to start", "A40NG8USE9g": "Your Health Is First", "QS8MQc5NBZ8": "what's

alcohol breath come Monday going to class or the office with alcohol breath is not a good choice certain volatile molecules in the mouth lead to halitosis or bad breath alcohol is one such volatile molecule that it can make your breath stink real bad alcohol is not easily digested as the body sees it as a toxin it's metabolized by the liver but the liver works at a rate that processes only one drink per hour due to this slow process alcohol accumulates in your bloodstream and body tissues including your lungs while waiting to be metabolized this causes the alcohol breath this problem is common in all people who drink in excess aside from the bad smell people around you will consider you as still drunk since the alcohol is clearly still in your system to make sure that people do not know that you've been drinking of too much you can use simple and easy tricks to get rid of the lingering smell here are some of the ways to get rid of alcohol breath 1 eat something with your drink to reduce the severity of alcohol breath you must eat something before or while you are drinking chewing food stimulates the production of saliva and food in your stomach helps absorb some of the alcohol you drink snacks like peanuts cashews popcorn potato chips and other munchies as well as finger foods are some good options you can try simply keep on snacking periodically while you are enjoying your beer or cocktails to drink more water just like it is recommended to eat something while you drink it is also important to drink more water alcohol makes your mouth dry due to its diuretic effect a dry mouth is a better environment or causing bacteria so if you sip plain water when you are enjoying an alcoholic beverage it will help you stay hydrated and avoid a dry mouth even after finishing your drinks do not forget to drink a little water from time to time in addition to reducing the alcohol breath it will also reduce the severity of a hangover along with plain water lemon water is also beneficial 3 drink black coffee another simple trick to mask alcohol breath is to drink a few cups of strong coffee it benefits you in two ways first of all coffee will make you alert and help fight the drowsiness which is important if you are going to the office or need to attend an important meeting secondly the compounds in coffee will lend a nice aroma to your mouth that is far better than the smell of alcohol 3 to 4 cups of black coffee at regular intervals is all that you need be sure to drink black coffee with nothing added to it when cream or sugar is added coffee will not effectively mask your alcohol breath 4 brush your teeth good oral care and hygiene are essential for keeping your breath smelling fresh and for fighting alcohol breath it will help destroy the odor causing bacteria inside your mouth however be aware that it will not eliminate the alcohol smell coming from your stomach throat and skin brush your teeth as well as tongue with mint flavored toothpaste to make the smell less prominent once you are done brushing do not forget to floss food particles which are diluted with alcohol often get stuck between your teeth this can make alcohol breath even worse if not removed through flossing finally gargle and rinse with a good alcohol-free mouthwash 5 - strong smelling herbs like rosemary parsley spearmint or tarragon can also help mask your alcohol breath these herbs are known for their deodorizing properties that will help eliminate the embarrassing smell coming from your mouth and stomach simply - some fresh rosemary parsley spearmint or tarragon leaves every few hours you can include these herbs in your salad to nourish your body as well as mask the smell-- six chew gum one of the simplest ways to eliminate alcohol breath is chewing sugar-free gum mint or sour flavored gum will be most effective first of all the strong smell of the gum will help cover up the smell of booze also it stimulates the production of saliva which helps rinse away acids bacteria and any odor causing particles after finishing your drinks chew a piece of gum for as long as you can then rinse your mouth thoroughly if needed repeat again 7 eat peanut butter if you love the taste of creamy and sweet peanut butter then you have one more reason to enjoy it peanut butter can help mask your alcohol breath the oils in peanut butter provide a much stronger and more pleasant smell than alcohol breath it will easily cover up the odor of strong spirits on your breath and nobody will guess that you were drinking a lot last night make one or two pieces of toast and spread a generous amount of peanut butter on them enjoy them with a strong cup of black coffee eight eat onions the strong smell of onions can easily mask alcohol breath always choose red onions over white ones as their smell is stronger prepare a salad burger or a sandwich with raw onions as one of the main ingredients as the smell of onions can be quite strong you can brush your teeth thoroughly and drink a good amount of water after using this method 9 lemon lemon is another useful remedy to help mask stinky alcohol breath due to the presence of citrus compounds in it in addition lemon helps remove the accumulated toxins from the body thus reducing the alcohol smell one or two teaspoons of fresh lemon juice - 1 cup of warm water add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and mix well use this solution as a mouth rinse thoroughly swishing it around in your mouth for up to one minute then spit it out repeat every four hours also you can drink lemon water to help reduce the alcohol smell and also detoxify the alcohol from your body simply mix the juice of half lemon into one cup of lukewarm water and drink it you can also add a little honey for taste if you are fond of green tea or black tea then you can squeeze a little lemon juice in it and then drink it to help get rid of the alcohol smell from your mouth note don't overdo the lemon mouth rinse being ascetic in nature too much lemon can damage your tooth enamel [Music]", "yocpPq9DKYI": "alright so if you're here you're here because you want to find out how to get rid of bad breath this disease is

This is also known as halitosis and can be\ncaused by many different issues such as dry mouth, gum disease, bacterial infections,\nsinus issues or poor oral hygiene. \u00a0\n3. The good news is that there are many natural\nmethods to get rid of bad breath. In today's video we will share with you natural\nremedies using baking soda. \u00a0\nYou Will Need: \u00a0\n1/2 Teaspoon Baking Soda 1/2 Cup Water\n\u00a0 Method:\n\u00a0 Add the baking soda the water and stir well\nuntil completely dissolved. Use this mixture as a mouthwash by swishing\naround the mouth and gargling in the throat. \u00a0\nSpit out the mixture to get rid of the bad breathe. Follow this same procedure morning and night\nfor the best effects. \u00a0\nThe baking soda destroys bacteria in the mouth which was causing the foul smell. \u00a0\nBe sure to use baking soda and not baking powder, as these contain different ingredients. \u00a0\n4. Baking Soda helps to maintain excellent oral\nhealth as it balances the Ph level within the mouth. \u00a0\nThis prevents odour causing bacteria from spreading. It also neutralises acids which are stuck\nto the tongue, gums and teeth. \u00a0\n5. You can also make a baking soda toothpaste\nby simply adding a few drops of water to 1tsp of baking soda. Brush your teeth with this to get rid of plaque. This effectively whitens the teeth naturally,\nremoves stains and gets rid of bad breath. \u00a0\n6. Alternatively, sprinkle some baking soda on\nyour toothbrush before using your regular toothpaste. Always rinse the mouth with plain water afterwards. \u00a0\n7. Sometimes we do not notice that our breath\nsmells bad. To test for this, simply wipe your tongue\nwith a piece of gauze. If it appears yellow then this indicates that\na high amount of sulfides are in the mouth, and likely a foul smell. \u00a0\n8. Sugar is one of the main causes of bad breath\nas it feeds bacteria in the mouth, causing it to multiply. Try using alternative sweeteners such as xylitol\nto prevent this from happening. \u00a0\n9. Baking Soda and Lemon juice can also be mixed\ntogether to create a mouth freshening tonic. Use the juice of 2 lemons, 250ml water and\n1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to make a citrus mouthwash. Compounds in the lemon help to freshen the\nbreath and clear up throat infections. \u00a0\n10. You can also try a mixture of 1 tablespoon\napple cider vinegar with 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda in a glass of water. Apple cider vinegar also reduces microbes\nin the mouth and is extremely healthy for the human body. \u00a0\n11. Please see our baking soda playlist at the\nend of this video to learn more about this natural cure. \u00a0\nThank you very much for listening, a like is always appreciated and remember to subscribe\nfor more healthy videos.

little video tip I wanted to share with you guys some summary tips and these tips are going to be on how to get rid of body odor now if you want to know what they are please keep watching tip number one try using baking soda as a natural remedy to help get rid of body odor it really helps absorb perspiration so try that when you're in a pinch tip number two try using apple cider vinegar apple cider vinegar is a natural antiseptic so I need to do is just spritz it in the areas and then just wipe it off and you're ready to go tip number three wash it yourself and now that's a pretty obvious tip that you should be doing every day anyways but in the summer especially a lot of areas can be damp in the summer so make sure you're washing your body daily to make sure that you're fresh and no bacteria is growing tip number four and change your diet if your diet consists a lot of onions curry guy likes spicy foods and caffeinated drinks try decreasing those foods in your diet because those foods can actually make your body order stronger to try to decreasing it to get a better result tip number five now this is a really simple one as well in the summer when you sweat or when you're doing a lot of stuff outside you can increase your body odor you want to make sure what you're wearing is breathable so make sure you're running lots of cotton to make sure that your skin is able to breathe and let out the sweat tip number six make sure you always clean your bath towels and what I mean by that is after you've used it two to three times to make sure in the wash so they're fresh now the reason why I say this is because a lot of towels don't actually dry very well which can lead to bacterial growth so after two to three times if you two towel put it in the wash so it's fresh when you take it out the next tip is lemons lemons are a great antiseptic and they smell amazing too so all you need to do is cut half a lemon and then juice half the lemon into a cotton ball and swipe wherever you need to get rid of body odor tip number eight try drinking wheatgrass juice we press has something in it called chlorophyll which is a great remedy to help get rid of body odor now what you want to do is maybe take one ounce every few days to see how you feel about it because wheatgrass can be quite strong and can make some people a little bit nauseated so try a little bit at first tip number nine try including herbs like parsley oregano and mint into your diet to help get rid of body odor now I'm gonna save the best for last a lot of you guys out there probably use antiperspirants and deodorants to have to get rid of sweating and a body odor but I wanna share with you guys my favorite one and I'm totally loving this line by Schmidt's it's the Brigid mint and lime and the lavender and safe deodorant they are amazing they smell amazing they're all-natural and they're aluminum free which is a huge plus for me because if you guys don't know this already a lot of antiperspirant in stores have aluminum in them and aluminum can be quite toxic to the body so if you're using deodorant every single day you want to try a new something that's more natural and safe and healthy for your body and that's why I love Schmitz and you might notice that they're in these cute little jars and not in your regular stick form but they do have this spatula here where you just dip it into the deodorant and you just run pea-sized amount into your fingers and just apply wherever it is that you I've been using this stuff every day before I go for a run or even before I go for

I'm Katrina Szish for Howdini. Today, we're going to talk about\nhow to deal with bad breath. To do that, I'm joined by cosmetic\ndentist, Doctor Brian Kantor. Nice to see you. Nice to see you. Now, it's not a pretty topic. But it's something that we\nall have to deal with. Are we stuck with our bad breath,\nor is there a cure? Unfortunately, there's not a so-called\ncure for bad breath. But with good oral hygiene and some of\nthese great over the counter products that are out there, we can limit\nthe effects of bad breath. We know we have it in the morning\nor when we eat garlic. But what actually causes bad breath? Well, there are a lot of culprits\nfor bad breath. Morning breath is when you\nhave bacteria that accumulates through the night. That bacteria gives off a bad odor,\nand that's morning breath. And it's very different\nfrom garlic breath. What garlic breath is is when you\neat garlic, there is a chemical composition within the garlic. As your body metabolizes the garlic, it\nactually goes into the bloodstream, gets into your lungs. And as you breath out, you're\nbreathing out that composition of garlic. So you can use over the counter\nproducts, such as mouthwash, which will mask its effect. But until you totally release that\ngarlic from your body, you will have that bad breath. Wow. Vampire killer breath, right? There's other types of\nbad breath as well. If you have any dental infections, or\nif you have cavities, or root canals that have gone bad, that will\nalso give your bad breath. Inflammation of the gums,\nperiodontitis. Any time you accumulate bacteria in the\nmouth, that can be a culprit for bad breath. So you always want to see your dentist\nif you're getting chronic bad breath. A lot of us know that we should use\nmouthwash, that that can help. But what else can we do? Good oral hygiene is the way\nyou can kill bad breath. That is brushing twice a day, flossing,\nand using a mouth rinse. Now, you mentioned flossing. How does that help? Flossing, it does a few things. It's very tough to get all the food\nparticles out of your mouth from brushing alone. And the food that's left in between\nteeth, bacteria's going to accumulate around the food, and that\ncauses bad breath. So, flossing actually gets\nhard to reach places. Now, it seems like when we're sick-- maybe when we have the flu or are not\nfeeling well-- our breath is worse. Why is that? Yes. Having an infection in the\nmouth causes bad breath. So you should see your dentist, and if\na dentist rules out all oral cavity, and there's no infection\nin the mouth-- being that the gums are healthy, the\nteeth are healthy, there's no cavities, there's no root\ncanal failing-- that could be a sign that there's\nsomething else in your body that's going on. So bad breath can be caused by\na systemic infection in the rest of your body. Having an infection of the tonsils,\nhaving throat cancer, having respiratory tract infections, having\nkidney or lung problems. Those can also cause bad breath. So if you have chronic bad breath,\nreally see your dentist. Have a check up. And if he doesn't see anything wrong in\nyour mouth, you should see a doctor for a further evaluation. Now, are there any foods that we should\navoid to get rid of bad breath, or at least abate it a little bit? Yes. Garlic, we talked about. Raw onions. Alcohol can also cause bad breath. What alcohol does is it dries out the\nmouth and decreases your saliva. And saliva is a friend to us in that\nit washes away food particles. And it also neutralizes the acids\nproduced by the plaque. So you don't want to\ndry out your mouth. You want to actually keep your mouth\nmoist and drink a lot of. Water another thing you can do is\neat a lot of crunchy fruits and vegetables. Crunchy fruits and vegetables,\nwill actually-- the mechanical wear and tear to actually\nbreak up the crunchy fruits and vegetables actually stimulates\nsaliva and can moisten the mouth as well. What if there's someone out there who\nfeels like they've tried everything and they just can't kick\nthe bad breath? You want to increase your\nsaliva, as I just said. Keep your mouth moist. Drink a lot of\nwater, crunchy fruits and vegetables, sugarless gum. Anything to keep your mouth chewing will\nincrease the saliva flow, which will help eliminate food particles and\nneutralize the acids caused by plaque, and help decrease bad breath. But most important thing is good oral\nhygiene and seeing your dentist twice a year regularly for check ups. OK. Well, there you have it. The best ways to banish bad breath. Now, let's recap. Bacteria is the real culprit\nof bad breath. We need to do what we can to keep\nour mouths free from it. This includes a regular thorough oral\ncare routine of brushing, flossing, and rinsing at least twice today. Stop smoking if you do and avoid foods\nand alcohol intake when you're in a situation that you need your breath\nto be fresh and clean. On behalf of Scope, I'm Katrina\nSzish for Howdini.

subscribe to my channel if you guys haven't already I do appreciate the support it helps my channel grow also if you're interested in online personal training for me simply comment below in the comment section I will get back to you guys with more details so tip number one is start chewing gum chewing gum will instantly get rid of the garlic breath and replace it with a minty fresh breath I have used this for years and it definitely does work so garlic breath if you wake up in the morning and your breath is just naturally bad you still brush your teeth and it's just still bad chew gum chewing gum has so many good properties I cannot list all of them you guys there's so many good properties just for chewing gum not only will it help give you a stronger sharp and more chiseled jawline you also get a lot of other properties such as good breath and I know a lot of people struggle with their breath and it will constantly go to the doctor they want the magic secret simply chew gum you guys it will help get rid of that bad breath tip number two is drink milk the fat content of milk helps reduce the garlic breath milk also helps with acid reflux and heartburn as well you guys so drinking milk that's a very good tip I have used that before and it really does help tip number three is drink green tea green tea contains polyphenols that help reduce the concentration of hydrogen sulfide that is what is inside garlic you guys so I've tried this myself and it does work so drink green tea you guys now here's the thing I would get decaffeinated green tea or you can even get tea that has a you can even get green tea that has caffeine in it because the caffeine content usually isn't very high it might be five to twenty milligrams which is nothing the caffeine content in a cup of coffee medium coffee is around 200 milligrams so I mean the caffeine content really doesn't make a difference I myself I drink decaffeinated green tea that's just me though tip number four is drink lemon juice that acid in lemon juice neutralizes the garlic-breath you guys so that's another great tip what I like to do is I'll just put get a water bottle get some lemon just chop it up and then squeeze the lemon juice inside of the water and it just gives your water a little bit of a little bit of a taste I don't mind doing that myself you guys so tip number five is eat apples the pectin which is the outside layer of the apple helps to reduce the garlic breath you guys so that's another great tip I highly recommend trying that it will work so again to summarize all that start chewing gum drink milk drink green tea drink lemon juice and eat apples try all of those tips you guys what you could do is try two at a time so maybe start chewing gum and then drinking milk see if that works do that for about a week after that don't do those try drinking the lemon juice and then eating the apples do that for a week then try the green tea by itself or with the lemon juice try it out don't try all five at the same time because then you don't know which ones really work try a couple at a time and then just mix them up you guys so end the video thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe to my child if you guys haven't already please like the video end shirt thanks again everyone", "LLaYXAon8OE": "if you're desperate to cure your bad breath but are sick and tired of spending your hard-earned money on expensive mouthwashes breath mints and other dental products that just don't work then listen up what I'm going to show you is exactly what you need to eliminate your bad breath problem once and for all for about $2 seriously this short presentation will outline for you a simple step-by-step protocol developed by US government scientists at the National Institute of Health more than 40 years ago to make a long story short about 90% of all bad breath cases have a single cause and for people in this group those scientists practically fell over a specific combination of common household ingredients that eliminate the bad breath problem 96 times out of 100 in other words they developed at 96% effective cure for bad breath pretty amazing eh so why haven't you heard about this before well unfortunately this kind of bad breath work wasn't the main focus of the research it was pretty much an accidental discovery that they stumbled across while looking for something else so after publishing their findings in a few scientific journals they moved on to other things and their work was almost forgotten until now we have used their research to devise an updated technique which takes account of more recent developments in the field and it works almost immediately it gives incredibly rapid relief from bad breath and instead of merely masking the symptoms like most other bad breath treatments do this simple procedure actually eliminates the root cause of bad breath and provides specific recommendations to prevent the problem from ever coming back and best of all it uses an easy safe $2 mixture of ingredients that are so common you probably already have them in your house but if you don't you can get them at your local supermarket or drug store anyway so let's begin the single cause of virtue we all cases of bad breath are the smelly byproducts of anaerobic bacteria found on the surface of your tongue not your teeth or your gums but your tongue in case you were wondering the word anaerobic literally means without oxygen these anaerobic bacteria love to live in places with little or no oxygen if you stick out your tongue and you look very closely you'll see many tiny fibers all over its surface since the bacteria involved are anaerobic they can't survive on the surface of your tongue where there's oxygen in your mouth instead they actually thrive down between these fibers where there is little or no oxygen and at least 80% of them live in a specific triangle-shape area near the back of your tongue that's because the front part of your tongue brushes against the hard palate which is the roof of your mouth when you're talking making it kind of self-cleaning the back part of your tongue doesn't though it only brushes against the soft palate at the back of your mouth which doesn't cause enough friction to produce any similar cleaning action they're leaving the bad breath bacteria to run riot and when they do they break down various proteins in the food you eat in mucus and slim produced by your body and in diseases or damaged tissue in your mouth the byproducts are very smelly chemical compounds collectively known as volatile sulfur compounds or more simply vs CS and when I say these smell bad I really mean it the same compounds you find in bad breath are also found in stuff like rotten eggs decayed meat sweaty feet feces and even dead bodies imagine all those odors rolled into one that's bad breath everyone has some level of these bacteria in their mouth if you don't have obvious bad breath it just means you have a very low level that don't make enough PSCs to be detected by the human nose however the numbers of these bacteria can sometimes increase dramatically by a factor of millions causing the level of these smelly house to increase in the same way it's only then that the level of vsc is being produced start to become detectable to the human nose and it becomes bad breath so what do you do about it well before we get into the technique developed by the NIH scientists I mentioned earlier let's just briefly cover a few things that can diminish your bad breath problem right away I'm talking at least 50% by themselves don't skip any of the recommendations you're about to hear when you combine them with the information that will be revealed later in this presentation you can cut the time needed to cure your bad breath to a matter of days sometimes even hours the reason for that is simple these recommendations counteract the main reasons why the level of VSE producing bacteria in your mouth can increase to a level that causes bad breath in the first place the first of them is simply having a dry mouth which contributes to the problem for two reasons the first being that saliva washes away both particles of food and vsc producing bacteria if there isn't enough of it food particles stay in your mouth until they begin to rot which means the bacteria feed on them and multiply and of course make your breath even worse the other reason is that saliva contains a relatively high amount of oxygen which being an aerobic your bad breath bacteria don't like if there isn't enough saliva the amount of oxygen in your mouth is that much less allowing those bacteria to thrive and once again make your breath even worse sometimes dry mouth is caused by medical problems like radiation poisoning often it's caused by smoking and drinking alcohol both of which can have an extreme drying effect on your mouth more often than not though it's caused by something much more mundane you're simply not drinking enough water everyone knows you need water your entire body is mostly just a big bag of water with a few chemicals thrown in its involved in every process your body needs to do to keep you alive most people wouldn't live a week without it and yet chronic dehydration is one the most common physiological problems in the entire world and I don't just mean that third-world most North Americans and Europeans are as chronically dehydrated as the rest of humanity so obviously rehydration should be the first order of business if you're serious about getting rid of bad breath up your daily water intake begin by replacing every can of soda you currently drink with water that's a good start do the same with alcohol too and with coffee in fact coffee deserves a special mention have you ever heard of the term pH it stands for potential hydrogen which is a term used to describe how acid or how alkaline something is a pH of 7.0 is neutral if anything has a lower pH it is acidic if it has a higher pH it is alkaline your mouth has a normal pH of about 6.5 which means it's normally only mildly acidic the bacteria that cause bad breath however prefer things to be more acidic as far as they're concerned the more acidic your mouth is the better and the problem with coffee whether it contains caffeine or not is that it is very acidic if you've ever noticed an unpleasant bitter taste during and immediately after drinking a cup of coffee it's because of that acidity the solution is of course simple stop drinking coffee altogether if you're a caffeine addict that's probably easier said than done you have to begin somewhere though and reducing your intake by at least one cup a day and replacing it with water is as good a place to start as any now going back to alcohol for a minute it's worth mentioning another potential problem that you may not even think of alcohol based mouthwash some of these can have as much as 30% alcohol in them which is far more than many alcoholic drinks do some companies that make them say they add so much alcohol because it supposedly kills the germs that cause bad breath that's the marketing speak the real reason is that it stops the mouthwash looking cloudy keeping it nice and clear so that it appeals to their target market they don't tell you that and they also don't tell you that any beneficial effect is almost immediately canceled out by the severe drying effect of so much alcohol even an antiseptic mouthwash which kills off the bacteria wears off within about two or three hours and the bacteria start to grow back with a vengeance and if you need yet another reason to avoid them altogether alcohol also seems to lift vs CS in the same way that it lifts the top notes and perfume meaning that when it does wear off and your bad breath comes back it smells even worse than before you might have noticed everything I've mentioned so far involves stuff you put in your mouth so I do have to mention the biggie food if you're eating lots and lots of high protein or highly processed foods you're bound to have an issue with your breath anyway since these are exactly the kinds of foods that bacteria causing your bad breath thrive on the kind of stuff I'm talking about includes eggs milk cheese candy chocolate nuts chicken beef pork bread and most canned and frozen foods I won't advocate avoiding these foods all together though as they only become a problem when you eat them to excess so just cut down on them I know it sounds terribly cliched but having a so-called balanced diet which really just means eating lots of different things but nothing to access really is the way to stay in good overall health not to mention stop bad breath in its tracks to summarize you need lots more water and much less alcohol coffee and crap food those are the basics that I'm certain most people watching this will probably ignore but since the only way to cure bad breath is to change the environment in your mouth from one that supports the growth of the VSC producing bacteria to one that will not those few simple recommendations will cut your bad breath problem in half before you do any else and when you do that you'll be ready to move on to the next stage cleaning your tongue most people never clean their tongue even though as you know that's the source of most bad breath a study at the University of Toronto in Canada has proven that tongue cleaning will reduce sulfur gases and offensive odor by 75% think about it if you follow the recommendations I mentioned earlier you may have already have your bad breath problem and now just by properly cleaning your tongue you could reduce it by a further 75% and we haven't even got to the core treatment yet here's how you do it you could simply brush your tongue with your toothbrush while doing your teeth and gums if you do it this way make sure you only brush in one direction from back to front and use plenty of warm water to make sure the mucus and debris you remove is washed away however a much better way is to use something specifically designed for the job a tongue scraper these are small plastic implements that you use to literally scrape the surface of your tongue they're very cheap you'll find them for about three to four dollars in most supermarkets and drugstores if you can't find one locally look them up online lots of companies sell them by mail order the best one available by a mile is called the Orabrush it has long stiff bristles in front of the scraper itself these were designed after a surgeon's scrub brush which they use to remove bacteria from their hands before they operate on the Orabrush they reached down to clean between the fibers on your tongue instead of just scraping over the top of them like most other scrapers do if all else fails you can even use an upturned spoon as a makeshift tongue scraper it won't be as good but it seems to do a reasonably good job though I only recommend this as a short-term stopgap solution whatever kind of tongue scraper you use wet it with warm water and then gently but firmly scrape tongue in a back-to-front motion about a dozen scrapes should be enough but rinse it off every two to three scrapes scraping your tongue is not a cure in itself even though a number of companies that make tongue scrapers claim it is what it actually does apart from scraping away any larger debris is remove a lot of the mucus layers that insulate the oxygen hating bacteria on your tongue from the oxygen present in your mouth this by itself is incredibly beneficial but it's still not enough by the way if you have a white coating on your tongue then what you're seeing is the whole bad breath process in action the bacteria and the mucus and the proteins and the VSC s the white coating is all of them combined in most cases this white coating will disappear gradually if you follow all the recommendations in this presentation however if your problem has been long-standing for many years there might be some white staining on the tongue itself which is caused by the long-term presence of sulfuric material in a small number of cases the tongue may even be permanently stained though this is very rare anyway once you're done scraping you're ready to really get down to business to get your bad breath problem down as close to zero percent as possible you can use a key fact about the bacteria involved against them that they are anaerobic meaning they thrive in a low oxygen environment earlier I said that the only way to cure bad breath is to change the environment in your mouth from one that supports the growth of the VSC producing bacteria to one that will not by changing your mouth from a low oxygen environment to a high oxygen environment you will create the exact conditions that will not support the growth of these bacteria so after scraping away any protective layers of mucus and debris from the tongue you can now help create an even higher oxygen level environment using something you probably already have in some cupboard hydrogen peroxide the hydrogen peroxide molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms it looks like regular water but it is one of the most powerful known oxidizing agents when it comes into contact with harmful microorganisms they're goners in seconds that's why your own white blood cells make hydrogen peroxide in abundance they use it to kill germs it is the first and by far the best line of defense that your body has against any infection it also has a very long history of medical use doctors used it to successfully treat a deadly pneumoniae epidemic in India in the 1920s in the 1960s researchers at Baylor University in Texas proved it to be safe and effective against a whole range of diseases it has also been extensively tested at other u.s. medical schools and Institute's such as Yale Harvard and UCLA and in fact has been used in mainstream medicine for many years in other countries including the UK France Germany China Japan Russia and even Cuba it comes in many different concentrations ranging from 3% right up to 99 point six percent most drug stores sell it in solutions of three or six percent for topical or oral use and it's extremely cheap you can pick up a small bottle for about 65 cents in some stores here's how to use it to help eliminate bad breath mix the solution of 50% hydrogen peroxide and 50% water and then after scraping your tongue just swish it around in your mouth and gargle it a bit for one full minute then spit it out and rinse with plain water it's that simple you should only use a 3% solution if you can't get a 3% solution you can use a 6% solution by increasing the level of dilution for one part water one part hydrogen peroxide to at least two parts water one part hydrogen peroxide however you should never use anything higher than 6% in some countries hydrogen peroxide is sold vol which is a measurement of the quantity of oxygen produced when it is decomposed instead of by percentage of the total solution for reference 3% hydrogen peroxide is roughly equivalent to a 10 volume concentration in 6% to a 20 volume concentration the effect of tonne cleaning and this hydrogen peroxide mouthwash is to introduce a higher level of oxygen into the living environment of the VSC producing bacteria however you now need to combine this oxygenation with the further reduction in the acidity of your mouth cutting out coffee will have already helped out a lot but you still need to go of that bit further you can do that by making your own acidity reducing mouth paste which is a mixture of baking soda which is also known as bicarbonate of soda common table salt and hydrogen peroxide the reason for using hydrogen peroxide are the same as before but why baking soda well when you were a school kid did you ever experiment with mixing baking soda with vinegar if so do you remember what happened the mixture bubbled and popped and frost some kind of reaction was taking place because vinegar and baking soda don't mix very well together that's because vinegar has a low pH meaning it's acidic and baking soda has a higher pH meaning it's more alkaline the reaction you saw was both substances in effect balancing each other out in other words the baking soda acted to increase the vinegar pH towards neutral while the vinegar acted to decrease the baking soda pH towards neutral using baking soda in this mouth paste creates the same reaction though on a much smaller scale that is invisible to the naked eye it's alkalinity will balance out the acidic environment in your mouth towards a pH of 6.5 which while being slightly acidic is near to neutral 7.0 and is the normal pH for a healthy mouth the use of table salt is for a different reason it's a good gentle abrasive in fact it has been used to clean teeth for that very reason as far back as the days of the Roman Empire but since it acts very gently it's also a good abrasive for cleaning your tongue too also when in a solution where it can be tasted like when mixed with your saliva it becomes hypertonic which means it will draw water from the cells that are bathed in it in your mouth this pushes your saliva glands into overdrive which will help to combat any problems with dry mouth - you won't be swallowing any of this by the way so it should be okay to use if you're on a salt restricted diet however please consult with your doctor first to make sure here's how the mouth paste is made mix three teaspoons of baking soda with one teaspoon of table salt add enough hydrogen peroxide to the mixture to form a thick paste if the undiluted hydrogen peroxide feels too strong you can add water like you did with the mouthwash that's all you do as a time-saving measure you can mix up as much baking soda and salt as you wish at any one time keeping it in an airtight container don't add the hydrogen peroxide yet though it starts to degrade the moment it's open which is why you should always buy the smallest bottles you can find it's better to get a number of small bottles rather than a big one instead only make as much pace as you need for each individual brushing do this by pouring a small amount of baking soda salt mixture into the palm of your hand and add just enough hydrogen peroxide and water if you want to dilute it to make just that amount into a thick paste the exact amount of baking soda salt mixture you use is something you'll have to learn by trial and error some people's mouths are larger than others some people just like to use less or more with each brushing after using it two or three times you should develop a pretty good idea of how much is enough for you use this mouth paste in the same way you use normal toothpaste but make sure to gently brush all parts of your of your teeth your gums your tongue and even the inside of your cheeks that's why I call this a mouth pace instead of just a toothpaste you can even floss while the paste is still in your mouth to help get it between your teeth for that I recommend using dental tape instead of dental floss since it's much thicker it cleans a wider area and it won't cut your gums as easily also don't use cold water when brushing use the hottest water you can bare without burning yourself obviously cleaning anything with hot water works much better than cold your mouth is no different some people using both the hydrogen peroxide mouthwash and the mouth pastes complain that it hurts their gums that they feel like they are being burned and that they even turn white for a few minutes if something like that happens it usually indicates a very poor state of gum health the turning white part is your reaction between the hydrogen peroxide and an enzyme in your blood called catalase that is turning it into water and oxygen gas indicating your gums are very bloody this whiteness fades after a few minutes many people use hydrogen peroxide to clean small cuts and the same white foaming can be seen in those situations too when gums are in a good state of health they have little or no bleeding so there is little or nothing for the hydrogen peroxide to react with in that way in most cases it's possible to deal with a problem by simply diluting everything further and gradually working back from there for example instead of the previously recommended mixture ratios start off with say four parts of water for every one part hydrogen peroxide instead in other words just add four times more water than hydrogen peroxide see how that goes if it still feels painful dilute it more if it seems to be doing nothing at all decrease the level of dilution to three parts water and so on also it's okay to leave the salt out of the mouth paste mixture until your gums are in a better state so just use baking soda hydrogen peroxide and salt is a good abrasive but until your gums are much less bloody you are literally rubbing salt into a wound in situations like this it takes a bit of trial and error to get the starting mixture right you shouldn't really feel anything more than a slight tingling sensation once you get that you're on the right track however within a very short space of time you should find that your gums will begin to harden up meaning you can reduce the level of dilution further if you still experience problems try using the paste only every second day and just brush with plenty of plain warm water the other day this should help in a very severe case of sensitivity and as things improve you can gradually push the water only day to every third day then every fourth day and so on so there you go that's the exact method that has completely eliminated bad breath for thousands of people there's no reason why it won't do the same for you if you use it that is however if you do try it but don't notice significant results within the first week of daily usage you can try creating a mouthwash using tea tree oil instead you'll find it at virtually any health store it's more expensive than hydrogen peroxide but often works better for some people you can also try it if you simply don't like the taste of hydrogen peroxide either the tea tree is native to Australia and tea tree oil has been recognized by the Australian dental profession as a potent remedy for all kinds of oral health problems since 1930 before using it to treat bad breath make sure to test a couple of drops on your skin overnight to make sure you're not allergic to it if you're not then just mix one or two drops and no more in plain water and gargle with it just like you would using the hydrogen peroxide mouthwash as a final note it's worth mentioning that both the hydrogen peroxide and tea tree treatment protocols described in this presentation are designed to effectively treat the 90% of bad breath cases that are caused by VSC producing bacteria however of the remaining 10% about 7% feature an odor that seems to come mainly from the nasal cavity and not the mouth at all this odor has a different quality to bad breath caused by V SCS the hydrogen peroxide and tea tree treatment may have some positive effect usually more specialized treatment is required if you have this type of bad breath a trip to the dentist may be in order it's likely something else is going on in your mouth as is the case with the hundreds of other diseases and conditions that together cause the remaining 3% of cases most of which usually require specialized medical treatments", "rcvhBKRH3jU": "hello welcome to my youtube channel if you're new to my channel hello thank you for clicking on this video but if you've been to my channel before or seen any of my features before thank you for coming again so guys in today's video i'll be showing you the natural remedy for bad breath for mouth order bad breath originates from the mouth that is some of the food we eat tend to you know they get caught in our teeth and this results to the fat smell the bad breath we perceive most times that is if you don't brush regularly if you don't brush and floss regularly so without taking much of your time i'm gonna show you the two ingredients that you can use naturally to get rid of this bad breath [Music] so welcome back the first ingredient to be using to take care of bad breath or mouth odor is by carbonates of soda that is baking soda baking soda can be found in any baking store or any super market baking soda is considered to be alkaline in nature and it helps neutralizes the high acidic levels in your mouth which is the major cause of bad breath due to its antimicrobial properties it kills the bacterias in the mouth and since it is not acidic it causes no harm to the gum teeth or bones so this is what we're going to do first this is a glass cup this is a cup of warm water you will need warm water okay so this quantity is okay for one goal and then we have to measure one teaspoon or one tablespoon of the baking soda and just do this here and the next ingredient should be using for to take care of mouth order or bad breath is salt salt helps neutralize the ph in the stomach and it also possess antimicrobial property salt is beneficial in our mixture because it helps get too far at to reach places or region in our seeds that is when you brush there are some places your toothbrush cannot get to so salt in this mixture helps get to those places and takes down all bacterias that causes the mouth order so measure just half a teaspoon of salt and add into the mixture so you have to steer this properly okay so this is all we need to take care of our mouth although you have to continue watching this video as i show you how you use this okay so guys this is a solution we just made what i'm gonna do now is i'm gonna have to glue this i'll show you i have i have a bow here where i can

Carl akshay Carl good morning to you Carl Melton he's the chef scientist here at the Imagination Station and he's cutting up something that has an odor you can't smell it cut smellivision but I can what's going on here with all the garlic right so working with garlic Valentine's Day is coming up you might be tempted to cook a nice meal or someone on Valentine's we're not a vampire right and and the thing is I've got gloves on if I didn't have gloves on the sulfur compounds from this garlic would be on my fingers yet and it's the question we're going to try to answer today is how to remove that smell okay okay and so I've actually what I've done is I've chopped up some garlic I got three bowls here so let's acknowledge oh oh you we're gonna use your nose I got three volunteers come on in guys three volunteers are gonna help them stand behind us and what they're going to do let me tell you what the procedure they are going to take their fingertips press it into the garlic okay don't grind your hand into it just touch your fingertip then they're going to attempt to remove that smell a couple different ways one person will be our control you're not going to be okay they're just going to actually not touch the garlic they're going to take you out a placebo and they're going to wash your hand okay second person is going to touch the garlic wash the hands with detergent soap third person will touch the garlic and use this stainless steel bar and then attempt to remove the garlic huh we'll talk about in a second all right okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to pass up the garlic leaves edge right here so there's your garlic remember one of these not going to touch and then you look away I will pass the bar to somebody okay all right you can guys go ahead and do your stuff come come on up here do your stuff what you would be pretty it's to cleanse your palate come let me chop up a lot of garlic if you held it's not so or it had a cleanse out you know the thing we're trying to test here is there's this idea that if you touch a piece of stainless steel like this knife with the garlic encrusted fingers underwater a chromium oxide in the stainless steel the stuff that makes the stainless will react with that compound and we move it from your skin that's one idea and you know the other thing I should point out is garlic doesn't really have a lot of smell until you break open the cell that is true there are enzymes and amino acids in separate cells you crush this thing when you chop it those two compounds can combine together to create how Alex

i'm mark mcneilly hey if you're brand new to the channel hit that subscribe button hit the notification bell and i don't forget to uh leave me a comment if you enjoy this video so welcome i'm just here kind of cooling it in my son's room i thought i'd shoot this quick video real quick before they start ramping fire at me and uh stealing my attention so in this video we're going to be talking to you all about how to get rid of that stinky smell that stinky older from the stomach and the throat all right the stomach and the throat is definitely connected and um you know you know the stomach is really the root cause of all disease all right and so disease if you break disease down it's really pronounced dis ease so you know your body is really um just in a bad state and um there's going to be some things that i'm going to be suggesting in this video it's going to be informative i'll have some products with me that i'm going to be sharing with you all and um there are a couple products that i don't have on me or two um that i've ran out of but um they're pretty easy to find also you can find links below in the description box of this video or in the comment section of this video if you guys want to learn how you can actually maximize a awesome diet plan a diet guy while you're you know utilizing these supplements to get you the maximum results all right for your gut so anyway um let's jump right in to this so we're going to talk about the gut and why um you're seeing the you know so much discomfort and why you're noticing the changes maybe it's the smells the odors the taste um most times you know these are all of these are all warning signs like bad breath uh smells um a lot of mucus or phlegm um you know from the back of the throat just sitting there um bloating this gassiness um a lot of sugar cravings and things like that where you just have to have certain sweets um these are all warning signs that hey there's an issue going on and that hey you definitely don't need to sleep on these uh warning signs and it's time to take action so in this video we're going to take action my very first recommendation is that you start to revitalize your body by going on a detox okay you can check out some of my other videos all right here um you know on this channel where i actually did a 12 day detox okay now um this is what i recommend this is one of the products you can find this in your local grocery store so you can buy it online this is yogi detox tea and the reason why i like this is because it has so many different herbal properties over 1 800 milligrams of herbal blends and uh cinnamon bark ginger root licorice root burdock all of these things are really highly alkaline herbs and just they have so many different anti-fungal antibacterial um inflammation reducing properties all right so you definitely want to get your hands on this start drinking this at least twice per day you can double up on the tea bags and make sure you drink it with spring water or alkaline water that's the first step now to get rid of stinky breath from the stomach and the throat you got to understand that the digestive system is off whack it's off balance you've got yeast you've got candida you've got all of this stuff you know going on as you're trying to digest your food so what tends to happen a lot of times is you know uh the foods that you're eating is trying to be uh digested and processed and really the stomach acid is really designed to break all of that down and help you pull the nutrients from out of the body that you need and then the nutrients that you don't need eliminated through waste all right well what happens is a lot of times when your body is off whack it means that your immune system is weakened um your immune system is uh low your autoimmune system is is working against you and now your body lead properties your cells and your different um organisms within your body is not working the way it should be because the brain has sent messages to the body to shut down and to try to fight off whatever the uh infections or bacteria or viruses whatever you're dealing with all right so number one the very first thing like i said is to detox you want to definitely do that you want to eliminate sodas sugar you want to eliminate um a lot of pretty much processed food fried foods you want to eliminate dairies from milks cheeses sweets you want to eliminate all of the junk all right processed foods fatty foods you know you want to eliminate high carbohydrates those types of foods oily foods greasy foods you want to eliminate all of that all right now again i'll leave some links below in the description box or in the comments section this video where you guys can get a better clear uh layout of foods to eat and foods not to eat um on a guy on this particular diet guide to help you with really cleaning up your gut and so you can really feel better and have better smells you know smell better um so that's number one number two you want to focus on adding some fish oil okay fish oil is really good um it's definitely good it's good for the eyes the brain and cardiovascular health but one of the most important things that i like is fatty acid and it also reduces inflammation some of you may ask hey well can i eat fish yeah you can eat fish you know but it's just easier to uh take a omega-3 um and you'll have that in your system every single day all right the next thing is you want to start consuming vitamin d all right vitamin d3 it's good for increasing your energy levels it it will boost your immune system all right and it's going to balance out your hormones and so what you want to do is when you're trying to restore your gut you want to boost your immune system because your gut again is the center place of all disease all right so cancer uh bowel movements constipation diarrhea um age pylori all of that is still within the gut okay the next thing you want to definitely get is some probiotics okay this is one of the brands that i use uh make sure make sure to make sure that you get a brand it doesn't matter it doesn't have to be this brand but this is a good brand um bio pro bio care for men's is 50 billion but what's most important is you want to make sure that the cfus in the back of it is at least see this one here is about 30 cfus you're not going to be able to see it the sea of fuse is about 30. you want to make sure that at least has about 10 cfus meaning that no matter what happens even though this is 50 billion we know that 30 cfus are going to go into the digestive system it's going to be able to go into the stomach and it won't be burnt up through acid and things like that now this is a good brand it's uh again 50 billion probiotics is delayed released and it's designed to uh work even through acid so our bodies our stomachs produce acid and so a lot of times certain probiotics if it's not a good quality it'll just burn up you know it won't even be useful it's almost it'll just eliminate through waste so you want to make sure that it at least has 10 cfus all right and these are all of the different uh lacto bacolus blends so um you know 30 billion is a lot it's a great quality you know that you're getting a good amount in and um you'll notice you should be able to notice some good results in terms of eliminating odors or stitches when you're consistently taking your probiotics i like to take mine at night uh before i go to bed maybe two hours before i go to bed and allow it to work in my system so when i get up all right the next thing you want to focus on is prebiotics prebiotics it helps with aiding um the bacteria in your gut um you can pretty much um get that through in the form of a powder i don't have any more with me i've got to uh you know revamp back up on that but you definitely want to make sure that you have some prebiotics and drink that to help with promoting a good healthy uh system digestive system and colon all right so the next um item that you want to focus on eventually is digestive enzymes and again we all have digestive enzymes in the gut but what happens is they tend to be faulty or they tend to not work as well as other people's at times um it's just because again the when the immune system starts to break down when there's inflammation in the gut things start to not work properly right so digestive enzymes is good for helping the body digest fats carbs and proteins so whenever you do transition back to eating meat if you would like to eat meat um i do encourage you to eat organic grass-fed you know meats or beef all right um to reduce the um the pesticides and the different um bacterias and things that on the hormones that are normally within regular meat all right you may have to spend a little bit more money but it's definitely helpful to make sure that you um you know go that route if you need be but again digestive enzyme will help will help break down the actual meats and the carbs all right um so you can take a peel version i'm out of that i don't have any of that at this moment the next thing is a hydrochloric acid i don't have any of that at this moment either but that's also good it's called hcl you can find that in your local stores it's good too it's designed to increase stomach acid um so what you can do is test to see if your stomach acid is high or low and based on that i'll leave a video below in the description box to show you or i may leave one up here to show you a little bit more about how to test stomach acid whether you have enough or or you need more but anyway if you're eating you know again a lot of proteins carbs and things like that then you'll need to have some hydrochloric acid on hand all right our bodies automatically make hydrochloric acid but there are times where you may need a little bit more support all right the next one is l-glutamine this is 500 milligrams this is a really good supplement all right it's an amino acid and it's uh definitely for intestinal cells it's to help with rebuilding intestinal cells so a lot of people that have bad have bad breath or have gerd or have ulcers or have um a combination of digestive issues whereas bloatingness and just constipation all of that there's a great chance that you may have leaky gut so l-glutamine helps with repairing and restoring the intestinal walls all right so a lot of times we have gap junctions meaning that our intestinal walls are separated and so food and particles and bacteria gets into i go through the intestinal wall but it falls and it now moves into the bloodstream all right so what happens is when you take l-glutamine it helps with restoring those cell walls to make them strong and to rebuild them back together where they're actually working properly and functioning so your body you know can function all right so again so this is good for helping to restore the gut lining the stomach lining very very important i do highly recommend that you guys have this in your home the next thing is uh magnesium magnesium you can you know get magnesium in your foods your fruits vegetables more so kale spinach celery and things like that um this is a very very important mineral it's responsible for over 300 different bodily functions you know your teeth your bones um it has so many different properties and a lot of times when people have gut health they lack magnesium you may eat kale or a nice salad or vegetables that have magnesium in it but because your body is not working properly or functioning properly then it's not able to absorb those nutrients so again it's not about what you eat it's about what your body can absorb okay so if your body can absorb the right nutrients then you can be healthy and i think that's the difference between you and maybe someone else that eats whatever they want and they still don't smell or stink or whatever their body is able to absorb you know the good out of whatever it is that they are eating good at times and so that's the key so magnesium is responsible again for easing muscle cramps lowering your blood pressure improving your cardiovascular improving digestive health reduces diabetes and eliminating uh anxiety and depression and most importantly reducing inflammation okay you want to reduce inflammation because inflammation also is responsible for hosting disease all right so these are the ones that you definitely want to have in your home um you know some of these other ones you can play about here um apple cider vinegar is also good it also can be a substitute just kind of starting off for a uh probiotic um it has really good bacteria strands if you can see that it's kind of got like a little little crud around the rings of this bottle um this is all this is with the mother so this is really good um apple cider vinegar um has a lot of health properties a lot of health benefits with reducing inflammation reducing and cutting back on mucus i actually have me some right here in a cup i just use about two teaspoons with some water uh normally warm water drink this twice a day it's very very good you can also use this one um you know garlic with a listen garlic is extremely powerful um it can it can leave a odor but it's very very powerful and so you know but this is really good for killing bacteria bad bacteria microbes and different um yeast and candida so that being said guys i hope you guys enjoyed this video i know there's a lot of information if you want to learn how to tie all of this together i have left a link below in the description box for you guys you can get your hands on this candida uh cleanser it's a guide it shows you what foods to eat what foods not eat for how long and then how to add food back into your life into your world make sure you get your hands on these supplements and i thank you guys for watching this video i'll see you on the next one god bless", "pNdkFHcrBFY": "[Music] do you suffer from bad

recommend garlic at all and they had very good reasons because it was known to be one of the most toxic herbs or plants and not fit for human consumption that were known to have destructive effects so that's why garlic works on bacteria killing germs it's you know 90 bacterial your food that can completely eradicate bacteria not many people think that that's a good thing we want something that kills of germs but it can you know have negative side effects that may be even worse than having a bacterial infection I personally you know you don't recommend it for a number of reasons there are some studies that show that garlic can actually cause damage to brain cells and it has that a very powerful effect because garlic does end up in the bloodstream if eaten raw in cooked food in the raw form if it's eaten in cooked form the negative or toxic effect is you're greatly diminished so if a person does feel like they want the garlic then they can yeah yeah take it in cooked form and it'll be less you know negative in the sense that it can cause a harm in the body garlic burns it literally can burn little holes through the lining of the intestines it can certainly penetrate the mucous lining and make its way through into the intestinal wall there it can little holes that eventually if you eat it too often can lead to perforations and that's the part where they already have been weakened or damaged so particularly people who have leaky gut we're already toxins escaped the intestines and move into the bloodstream they should be extra careful because garlic should not really be in the blood remember perhaps you some people know who have been going through world war two or past World War two near the humidity of five or ten years where for example the Italians who were very knowledgeable about the toxic effects of garlic they took garlic cloves with them to the frontiers and they squashed near they basically yes yeah you use the garlic I choose to pour it over the bullets and then I put the bullets that had the garlic on them into their guns and they were never known to be good shooters the Italians they were famous for not being able to aim at the soldiers properly and so they often missed probably they missed more often than they they succeeded so they they thought that by putting the garlic on the bullet and then somehow hit the enemy and the foot or somewhere not in the heart or in the head they just injured them somehow and when the the garlic entered their blood the enemy's bloodstream they knew that the enemy would die because here once it's in the blood if you did that and he injected you our raw garlic chews into the blood you can certainly die from that so it's it's not something to be taken lightly there is a whole new trend in Italy now that is shying away from putting garlic and food and they they know that it's not the new one of the best things to ingest because it can cause upset stomach I can upset the intestines and it can cause inflammation now so you know the there is a even a new trend it's called garlic free restaurants so all the great chefs they are learning how to cook without garlic because garlic became only popular in that part of the world when yeah there was a shortage of food and there wasn't there were no spices or herbs available on particular during the war times and the poor people and they were taking recourse to garlic as a way to make their food more flavorable and that's where you know the trend started expanding because there were a lot of people poor people after World War Two so in a way that's when the garlic became very popular and it spread throughout the world so there's a new trend that is written sort of going backwards in time and facing God Oh God it also overrides the flavor of other tastes in food so once you put God again you hardly taste anything else but garlic and then that sense yeah it's not the best for the tastebuds because it's very important that the tongue which has take tastebuds cells to detect all the six tastes sweet sour salty bitter and astringent something you're punching them bitter and astringent it's important that we have exposure to all those six tastes in order to for the cells in the body to function well and for food to be digested properly and if you miss out on some of these tastes or you overwrite them by having a particularly pungent taste that dominates all the other tastes then this can lead to digestive trouble the digestive system no longer recognizes these other tastes and is not secreting the correct enzymes and digestive secretions in order to digest all the foods that you have ingested not just the pungent or spicy food which garlic is can you also give a little brief on are they any medicinal values of garlic which I evade recommend well you don't find many references in Ayurvedic medicine for medicinal properties of Ayurveda except that it does have a you're an antibiotic bacterial effect it is more recommended to put up garlic in in the fields or to prevent mosquitoes and and the other insects from flying in there and eating up the crops so in that sense your garlic has definitely a major use but it should in my opinion not be used for food that's why every body type can react to it so it's it's not really good for any of the body types the only body type that can cope with it more than others are the kuffar body types they have a thick skin I think intestinal lining so for them to get serious damage is less likely then in a lotta time type who has very thin that your intestinal lining for them you know they're more likely to get injured by it and e4 Pitta types they can get inflammation in the intestines if eat too much garlic specially the wrong [Music]", "UuedEodOUFw": "hello namaste welcome back to my youtube channel ayur yoga mudra now today i'm going to introduce one mudra for the bad smell from mouth or the bad order from the mouth as we all know

beautiful people welcome you here with breath solution with Nick nilly and today I'm going to be talking and teaching you guys what you can do to stop bad breath from the throat alright it's very common so you're not alone I've experienced this a couple years ago and I didn't know really what to do went to my dentist I did all of the right things and I was still experiencing well by the end of this video you're going to know exactly what you need to check you're going to learn a routine that you can start using to get rid of bad breath from the throat mouth tongue wherever all right so definitely like comment and subscribe on this video share it with someone that you may know alright so anyway on basically if you're experiencing bad breath from the throat or you think you're experiencing in from the throat you need to check several things all right it's not all these you need to one check your diet okay normally bad breath from the throat is stems from a lot of mucus or a lot of phlegm not necessarily a cold but more so the mucus and the phlegm and that comes from one or two things one either your diet maybe you're getting too much fats too much proteins in your diet and example maybe you drink a lot of milk you give a lot of cereal maybe the milk from the cereal you eat a lot of cheese a lot of sandwiches sandwich me macaroni cheese you know a lot of breads you gotta figure out if you're allergic to gluten alright and you may have to go on a gluten-free diet okay so you got to figure out and determine your body whatever it is that you're putting in your body is it considered generating a lot of mucus a lot of phlegm on a daily consistent basis if the answer is yes you need to reduce that reduce what you eat alright as far as a lot of dairy a lot of arm proteins a lot of oils a lot of fatty foods can produce a lot of phlegm and mucus um which carries bad bacteria bad proteins that drips from the back of the throat onto the tone okay so a lot of people don't know this so you need to check diet start eating more fruits and vegetables start you know trying to eliminate you know a lot of the dairy stuff as you know if you can alright that's number one number two you need to check to see if you have tungsten stomachs tonsil stones are like these little balls are basically it's from food food particles that have built up in the back of the throat okay to turn into little balls those little balls are a combination of bad bacteria and let's call something that's called ball tight sulfur compounds so if you were to cough up one of those little tonsil stones and you smell it it will be funky it will smell because it's bad bacteria is old food decay particles just sitting back there behind the toasters all right do I recommend you get your tonsils taken out you have to go to your doctor to see you know if that is if that's necessary okay I'm not a doctor but I'm just telling you guys of some of the things that you can use and start implementing to reduce and get rid of that all right so to get rid of tonsil stones guys you want to one you definitely want to gargle with warm salt water okay can be sea salt I use sea salt you can gargle at least twice per day get all the way to the back gargle really good and that just kind of cleanses the throat cleanses the food particles from the throat and the tonsil area or two you can drink what's called a club soda club soda is nothing but carbonated water okay you can find it at your local store it doesn't matter what brand but club soda when you drink it it's Kyle it's like looks like a soda it's it's a city and it kills it eats away at food particles that are between the teeth the gums and the throat so definitely you want to implement that more on to get rid of those food particles so if you try both of those things then the third thing you need to check and see is if you have a post nasal drip post nasal drip can come from having oh you've got a sinus infection

Although there are many dental products in\nthe market today for treating bad breath, most of them are only effective in the short\nterm. Here are some natural remedies that can bring\na long-lasting solution to bad breath. 1. Drink water. We already mentioned that dehydration can\nbe the cause of halitosis. Therefore, drinking lots of water to keep\nthe body (and mouth) hydrated is a simple way of preventing bad breath. When the mouth is properly hydrated, bacterial\nactivity in the mouth is reduced. 2. Limit coffee and alcohol intake. Both coffee and alcohol are considered as\ndiuretics. They promote the increased flow of urine,\nwhich can lead to hydration. So, cutting back on the consumption of these\ntwo beverages is another natural remedy for, and preventative measure against bad breath. 3. Observe proper oral hygiene. Poor oral hygiene such as improper teeth brushing\ncan lead to halitosis. This is because pathogenic bacteria in the\nmouth are dangerous when proper oral care is not observed. Regular brushing, flossing, and gargling are\nimportant for oral health. 4. Milk. Halitosis caused by eating pungent foods like\ngarlic and onion can be cured by drinking milk. Various research results attest to the fact\nthat milk helps in treating bad breath. 5. Orange. Orange is packed with vitamin C, which has\nbeen linked with saliva production in the mouth. Most times, bad breath is caused by dry mouth\nor an insufficient production of saliva. Eating oranges or drinking fresh orange juice\nis a natural way of treating halitosis. 6. Apples. According to a study, eating raw apples can\nhelp in treating bad breath caused by eating garlic. The reason for the action of apples on bad\nbreath is attributed to the various compounds present in the fruit which help to neutralize\nthe odor-causing compounds in garlic. This method can be particularly helpful to\npersons whose bad breath is caused by consuming garlic. 7. Aloe vera. The antimicrobial properties of aloe vera\ncome into play here. You can make a mouthwash from aloe vera by\nadding aloe gel with boiled water. This solution is quite as effective as some\ncommercial mouthwash, according to research. In addition, aloe vera gel has wound-healing\ncapabilities that should help in closing any wounds in the mouth. 8. Exercise. Exercising every day can help to improve blood\ncirculation and ventilation, which is helpful in maintaining general body health. In addition, exercising helps to counter the\nmicrobial activity in the mouth that leads to halitosis. 9. Green tea. Green tea is loaded with antioxidants such\nas EGCG, which is a polyphenol that helps in combating disease-causing bacteria. Drinking 3 to 5 cups of green tea daily until\nthe bad breath subsides is an effective natural remedy. 10. Apple cider vinegar. Apple cider vinegar contains acetic acid,\nwhich is dangerous to bacteria. The antibacterial effect of vinegar is beneficial\nto oral health as it helps to maintain pH balance in the mouth. Simply add about 2 tablespoons of apple cider\nvinegar to a glass of cold water and gargle for about 5 minutes before rinsing. 11. Parsley. The chlorophyll content of parsley leaves\nis what helps in curing bad breath. Adding parsley leaves to your meals or chewing\nthem directly is a good way of treating halitosis. 12. Get enough sleep. Insufficient sleep has far-reaching effects\non the entire body, including the mouth. Research results show that some types of bad\nbreath may be related to a person\ufffds sleeping pattern. This is probably because gut microbiome affects\ndiurnal rhythm. Moreover, adequate sleep helps to boost the\nimmune system. 13. Gum. Chewing sugar-less gum helps in curing bad\nbreath by stimulating saliva production in the mouth, which in turn neutralizes bacterial\nactivity in the mouth. It has already been stated that keeping the\nmouth hydrated is a natural way of combating disease-causing bacteria. Furthermore, most of the sugar-free gums have\nfragrant flavors that keep the bad breath at bay. This is only a temporary cure for bad breath. 14. Epsom salt. Epsom salt has detoxifying and antibacterial\nproperties that are helpful in treating bad breath. Gargle with a solution of Epsom salt in water. This should be done every day during the initial\nstages, but should be done once in two days after some time. 15. Lemon juice and yogurt. Lemon juice contains citric acid, which helps\nin combating odor-causing bacteria in the mouth. On the other hand, yogurt contains probiotics\n\ufffd beneficial bacterial \ufffd that help in maintaining oral flora. When you combine these two, then what you\nhave is a natural formula for combating bad breath. For this method, you will need to mix two\ntablespoons of unflavored yogurt with a teaspoon of lemon juice to form a paste, then, apply\nthe mixture on the teeth. After leaving the paste about 7 minutes, rinse\noff with warm water. 16. Guava. Guava is rich in vitamins like vitamin C and\nminerals like malic acid.

I'm going to be pointing out [eleven] mistakes that you are probably making when you're brushing your teeth [yes], I know many of you guys have been brushing your teeth for [thirty] years [fifty] years in some cases maybe more and you're seeing antonio. I've never had a cavity or antonio I've been doing this for long enough. I don't think I'm making any mistakes I bet there's not a single person watching this who has not made one of these [eleven] mistakes And I bet most of you guys are Consistently making many of these mistakes so stick around some of these you've heard before other ones [I] don't think you've heard and you're going to find this pretty [intrigued] I went off spoke to my dentist [I] did the research and I found some very interesting things so bringing this in Let's dive right into what are the eleven mistakes that most people the vast majority of the world is Making when it comes to taking care [of] their teeth Number one is that they are using their toothbrush way too long the life of a toothbrush Consistent use twice a day seven days a week [30] some 30 or 31 days a month is Three months so after about [200] uses you need to start looking for a new toothbrush brushed Why the Bristles so toothbrush that's been used too much you can kind of look at it Bristles are going to start to go all over the place this affects other items We're going to get into but it does not allow [you] to brush your teeth properly So you need to look to get rid of this toothbrush every three months okay? So point number two? You're not brushing your teeth long enough so recently started using a electronic Toothbrush [to] clean [their] oh or or a clean system really cool toothbrush the cool part about this is that it has a timer and I'm not used To using a timer on my toothbrush started using it two minutes Okay You know going through that was a lot longer than what I [expected] and what that told me is it I have consistently Been not brushing my teeth long enough two minutes is what we're supposed to use why? Gives time for the fluoride to start to you know react to the teeth to go in there And it is the recommended amount so two minutes. I think most of us are brushing our teeth less than minute We just get into routine we were going through thing, okay? I hit every I'm done two minutes is what you want to shoot for and that's one of the right reasons I recommend some of these electronic toothbrushes is and there are other reasons as well But the timer in of itself is worth it now You don't have a time to just simply use a stopwatch use your phone use a what you use something But brush your teeth for two minutes mistake number three is that you're rinsing with water Yes after you brush that even for two minutes, and you spit it out there They new throw water And I know I do this all the time and guess what you're taking half of that Most of that floor it right out of your mouth You're spitting out You want to leave that in there now a way around this and still being able to rinse out your mouth is to actually use Mouthwash that has fluoride in it And then you can quickly rinse gargle spit that out and the fluoride actually still going to stick to your teeth But [mo] don't want to use water after you brush your teeth Just spit it out and get used to that feeling I know for me. It's been very hard, so I actually use a rinse Mistake number four is you're storing your toothbrush in the bathroom this one I think almost all of us are doing it and we do it because of convenience the problem and just [run] a study and they talk about more than half of the Toothbrushes that they you know tested had a bit of feces on them Yes guys There is actually crap on your toothbrush in more than half more than half you guys have this there And that's because you're storing it in your bathroom. I don't know how it's getting there All I know is that this stuff is for real it blew me away when I saw this data in addition When you're storing it in the bathroom guess what higher it's more humid in there a higher percentage. It's going to get wet It's not going to the time to dry out even if you put it in a cover so again You know this this toothbrush? I was using here this towel clean what I really liked about it They have a cleaning system. So the best way you don't want to go buy an electric toothbrush Is that you can actually just simply take this put it next to your nightstand Take it out of the bathroom this may be that's a huge habit change for some of us And it may just [be] better to actually get something that has a cleaning system with it Number five you've heard this before floss. How do you start to floss? I know the hardest part is actually creating a habit to start flossing the best tip I've heard is actually just to floss One tooth why because when you start to floss one tooth [you] actually floss the rest of your teeth. You're like Hey, I've already started, and that's the hard part is getting started [I] floss at the end of the day don't always do it But when I do it I try to reward myself, you know just it's a good feeling I Also try to use and I set up the system so [that] I've got those individual flashers I find, they're better for me than actually taking out some and wrapping it around my fingers by having that individual floss system It's going to be a little bit more expensive, but having that small little floss pick all of a sudden I'm able to get the job done. [I] feel good about it. Throw it away boom [I] floss my teeth actually Point number six or mistake number six is you're not cleaning your tongue invest in a tongue cleaner You don't want to do that get a toothbrush then on the opposite side It's actually got a little bit of a tongue scraper, not as good But it'll get the job done worst case use your toothbrush and actually brush off the tongue after [you've] been brushing your teeth for two minutes And it's important to do every time [you] brush your teeth mistake number seven is You are using too hard a toothbrush Why is this an issue because don't even use the medium go [with] soft or extra soft. It doesn't really make a difference You're not looking to get in there And I mean you're just looking to get rid of some of that the meat or some of the other food That's gotten stuck in and around your teeth you're not looking to you're not going to shine those things up that's not the aim of the toothbrush and So the what the problem is is a lot of you guys are using medium or harder brushes you're actually going to damage your gums and that takes us [to] point number eight how to brush your teeth [and] that's actually to go in circles don't go back and forth [and] that takes us to mistake number nine you also want to go at A 45 degree Angle, and that's one of the reason that you see a lot of brushes They've got the bristles that go at an angle Because most of us we go straight on and we go back and forth [so] if you've got a [toothbrush], and this isn't my simple, Toothbrush see it goes straight You want to go at a 45 degree angle [makes] sense, okay? So let's go into mistake number 10 And that's men and women do not change up their routine they get used to going in the same Order the problem with that is we get lazy. We get sloppy You need to change up your routine and that's something you have to consciously think about we don't like to consciously think about things, and that's the advantage of you know an electric toothbrush is literally you can just guide it and It usually does a better job of actually reaching it because it requires less effort The problem is is it can train you not to brush your teeth? Well if you're having to use a manual toothbrush and the Final Point is No need to brush your teeth More than two times a day a lot of people out there were thinking okay? If I brush three times a day four times [a] day, [I] even talked to my dentist. She brushed I think more than three times a day she said I shouldn't be doing this but I'm really you know It's just I'm almost kind of crazy about it, but uses an extra soft Bristle But brushing more than two times a day can actually lead the damage, and that's not something [that] you want to do to your teeth Bonus mistaked a lot of people do is they actually what don't wait 30 minutes after they've eaten to brush their teeth And this bonus one why is it mistake because actually the ph levels have dropped basically your mouth is more acidic [30] you know after you've eaten and So you need time to be able to get rid of that saliva that hat which has a lot of acid otherwise? You can damage the teeth a bit when if you brush too soon after you eat So that's it guys let me know in the comments. What you think? I think that almost all [of] you guys have made at least one of those mistakes the big one for me is actually feces on the Toothbrush and You know when I got this toothbrush. I you know this thing right here I wasn't you know I'm thinking who the world needs this cleaning system I got it sent to me about two months [ago], and then I find that research on yeah, what's on your toothbrush? I'm like I'm going to start using this cleaning system, and this is really a big issue If you've got a communal bathroom, [so] I've got four kids in it use my bathroom I've got a you know my wife uses the bathroom So if you know if you're in with other people the chances of that just went up so guys take care Let me know what you think in the comments, and if you want more information about grooming about style Go over to real men real style tons of great information got that free ebook for you.

See you video you", "1ooTKcboj1Q": "top five best presents how to brush your teeth right life hacks most people know the basics of tooth brushing for example how many times a day to brush their teeth or how long's brush for but do you know how long to wait before you brush your teeth after a meal or which foods helps keep your teeth clean and how to brush your teeth right check out these 10 tips to make sure you're keeping your teeth in great condition number 10 don't always start brushing in the same place Dennis say most people always start brushing their teeth in the same place but by the time you reach the last part you may be bored and end up paying less attention to these areas the consumer advisor for the American Dental Association recommends starting in a different place each day so all of your teeth receive the same amount of attention number 9 wait at least 30 minutes after a meal to brush your teeth brushing your teeth immediately after eating foods can be very damaging to your teeth during this time the pH level in your mouth is much lower than normal and more acidic and the brushing can be abrasive and harmful number 8 make sure you are using the right kind of toothbrush often people use toothbrushes that are too big or small for the size of their mouth which can stop them from reaching all the areas in their mouth another problem is using a toothbrush with bristles that are too stiff as this can damage your gums the American Dental Association recommends a soft brush so make sure your brush is not too stiff for your gums number 7 replace your toothbrush every three to four months although many people struggle to brush their teeth for long enough most hold on to their toothbrushes for far too long the American experts recommend changing your brush every three to four months as the bristles become frayed and less effective and the brush can gather bacteria on the bristles and handle number six eat fruits and vegetables to naturally clean teeth a useful tip to keep your teeth clean when you're out of the house and don't have the opportunity to brush is to eat more fruits and vegetables such as celery and apples raw fruits and vegetables are filled with fiber a natural abrasive that gently removes plaque we rinse with slaughter to help remove any stray bacteria and brush and floss your teeth once you get home number five keep your toothbrush clean although your toothbrush looks clean after you finish brushing bacteria that can cause bad breath and cavities can grow on the bristles rinse the brush when you've finished to help remove the harmful bacteria it's also useful to buy a cup to keep your toothbrush in and leaving the toothbrush touching the sink or counter makes it more likely to pick up other bacteria from your bathroom number four floss your teeth daily although tooth brushing is a very effective way to keep your teeth clean bristles often cannot reach in between your teeth where food and bacteria can build up and develop into tartar well it doesn't matter if you floss before or after brushing your teeth it is an important part of keeping your whole mouth clean and healthy number three be very gentle while brushing your teeth most people have totally different techniques to brush their teeth but some are more harmful than others teeth need to be brushed lightly as harsher brushing can damage teeth instead of brushing in long strokes brush your teeth in a very gentle circular motion periodontists dr. david g recommends brushing your teeth as gently as you would clean priceless furniture and precious dishes a telltale way to check your brushing too hard is to see if the bristles Bend on your teeth if they do you could be brushing too hard number two pay attention to your molars in the inner side of your teeth well this might sound logical many people brush their front teeth more than the rest while these are the teeth people see all of your teeth need equal attention pay more attention to your molars and the inner side of your teeth as these are the parts your tongue is most often pressed against number one brush your teeth for at least two minutes now most people already know that the recommended amount of time to brush your teeth is two minutes but despite that most people still don't brush long enough a good way to make sure you brush for two minutes is to turn the

talk about it body odor in 2018 the summer of 2018 I was your girl was funky and I could not understand for the life of me what was going on and I'm the type of person like I'm girl like I have no issues like being honest and truthful with people so I talked to my friend we were at like carnival and I was just like girl I'm funky help me and she was just like try this so I'm gonna tell you what that try this was and all of the other things that you should try and yeah I hope this helps you because I am fresh fresh and so clean [Music] okay so the first thing I want to talk about is vitamins I am a child on SciTech gummy vitamins this is by diffusion women search Irish multi and it talks about having vitamins for energy metabolism bone and the immune support but I take this because I don't want to think um so what this vitamin has is it's a regular vitamin it's not specialized for it but it has vitamin B zinc and vitamin C which is all supposed to be things that help for our body odor I haven't taken my vitamin today so I'm gonna go do that right now these things are good they're so good I'm not gonna explain the why for each one of these things but I will put a link down below to articles that do explain the why because I wanted to try and keep things short and whatnot so the second thing that was a game changer and that was the disc that my friend was telling me about is probiotics oh my god this this right here is this is the goal like this long it's not all you need but you need this like you mean this anyway so I didn't really know what probiotics was and I still to this day don't really know what they do but I did some research and whatnot and basically it said like when the floor and your intestinal tract is out of balance that that can lead to body odor and basically what probiotics does is that it crawls out the bacteria and restores balance so is restoring balance and whatnot you hey my favorite keywords so again I haven't taken this today so I'm about to take it as little and all of the links to everything that I'm talking about will be in the description box below but yeah the third to last thing in a definite must is chlorophyll cars chlorophyll is like frigo is not go but it can't be almost there and I think combining these three have been like an army for me when it came to body odor okay so chlorophyll is supposed to be like your internal deodorant there's a lot of great benefits to chlorophyll I'm trying to see if I can pull something up really quickly give me a second I pulled up real quickly the proven benefits of chlorophyll and I'm just gonna read it to you again like links down below to more descriptive why this works um but yeah we're just gonna do it overview so it has anti-aging remedy it has acne treatment abilities blood building properties deodorant properties what we need it's supposed to again be that internal deodorant wound healing properties a cancer treatment and yeah those are some of the few benefits of chlorophyll which is like like five for one special so I am gonna drink this again now because I forgot to do it when you do do this mix is recommended two teaspoons and yeah oh okay so they said these are the directions I my mom will put me onto this and I didn't follow these things so it says take two tables daily two tablespoons daily or as directed by a healthcare professional we recommend you mix it with your favorite juice so I typically mix this with water so that's what I'm about to do and I typically eyeball it and it says do not take on an empty stomach but I typically always take on the empty stomach because I typically do oh my gosh I said typically so many times in the last like three seconds it was let's say it again but I usually you intermittent fasting so I don't eat until 12:00 but I am still a lot so I don't think that's like a necessary but follow the rules if you're just trying this cuz I don't want no problems okay blasts I am going to eyeball this poor okay and then I typically put I typically put about eight ounces of water it taste is not bad at all and again like if you want to stop smelling like this is this is what you got to do and this actually have a spearmint smell I don't to care for it but whatever again all of the links that everything that I'm using will be in the description box okay Cheers I try and do those three things at the same time every single day you don't want to skip a day just keep it consistent and it does take a little bit of time for it to really start working so if it didn't work in like three days don't come from me but I promise you within a week you're going to start seeing a difference just giving myself a Smith test it's also good good okay and then my last bonus tip honestly I don't even know if you can find this in the States so my grandma st. croix told me about this and she gave this to me um it's comfy it is a Puerto Rican I guess distributor and this is excuse me this is dope for an antiperspirant so if I find the link on Amazon I'm definitely going to put that in because I don't know what I'm gonna do when my orders or not my orders but when my supply run little but yeah this this is by far my favorite dealer right like I I have to find it so I'm gonna make sure that I find it for you because I I need it too but yeah that is it for how to smell good I hope these tips help if it did help you please put a comment down I want to know like I also want to know if there's anything else that you're trying to like smell good but you know it's

you today about my daily garlic eating habits I personally consume two raw cloves of garlic a day I have a particular way I go about it and so I want to share that with you and maybe you'll consider doing it yourself it's not as gross as if I come across so here's what I do I start out with cloves of organic garlic that I buy at the health food store the local vitamin cottage down the road and they store for for quite a long period of time but I try to buy them now by a couple even though I'm eating two cloves of raw garlic a day I buy a couple cloves a week just so I never run out I take this clove of garlic and I I kind of mush it and separate it and I like to pull as much of the paper off as I can off of the individual cloves that way on a daily basis when it's time for me to chop these up they're there as prepared as possible before I actually do the chopping so I separate them into little cloves from the big bulb here they are like so and then I like to store them in a bag like this off to the side on the countertop in another bowl that's what I do and that way when it's time for me to chop up my garlic I can just grab two cloves like this I describe to clothes they're ready to go I have my little garlic cutting board and I have my knife and I just trim off the tops a little bit of hard edges at the top and then they're easy to peel all right just peel them get all the paper off till they're soft and kind of waxy without their paper it's already cut there we go two of them dump that aside and here here's the crucial part is I'm not going to pop them in my mouth that eat them like this it's not going to happen gotta make it so that I can tolerate it and it's in the healthiest form available so here's what I do I rush them with my knife you see that crush them oh ha ha and then I chop them alright little bite-sized little pieces make sure I get every little bit alright and then and then I let this sit for about 15 minutes I let it oxidize and I guess this is important as it helps with our immune system and build up our immunity it helps us decrease inflammation in our bodies and the oxidation part of this is 15 minutes of sitting helps with that so after about 15 minutes of sitting I can pop them in my mouth drink of water and and it works just like taking a pill and I don't get the upset stomach I don't get the the nasty breath and I don't have to chew it I've tried chewing it and it makes my eyes water maybe I'll work up to that someday but for now this is working for me and it enables me to take my two raw cloves a day without serious side effects the biggest question I get asked is do you stink like garlic or does your breath smell like garlic and I have to say that over it takes a couple of weeks but my body has adapted and now I've asked people around me do I smell like garlic do I stink like garlic and and nobody will admit that I do so give it time maybe start at one small clove a day or half a clove a day and work up to two rock loaves a day and and you won't regret it it will really strengthen your immune system and help you feel like you're doing something to make yourself stronger if you have any questions comment
