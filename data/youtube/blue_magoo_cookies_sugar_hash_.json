Negro and welcome to another episode of good eats in today's episode I'm gonna show you how to make canna sugar cookies let's go ahead and get into it here we go guys alright so if you're wanting the exact measurements of this recipe all you have to do is click the link that's in the description it'll take you to my food blog good eats for 20 Calm it'll take you through the recipe and I'll give you the exact measurements of everything what you're gonna do right here is we're going to start by putting our flour our baking soda and our baking powder into a small bowl use the whisk mix it up a little bit and we're going to set that aside we'll go back today in just a second oh I forgot to tell you that you want to pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees in another Bowl what you want to do is you want to take your butter now this is softened butter it is very important that it's all the way soften make sure that it's all the way softened now if you want to really medicate this up you can use Canon butter but we're using brick lip butter right here take your butter take your sugar I'm using can of sugar and regular white sugar as well going to put that in and we're gonna cream that together until it's smooth and together once that happens we're going to beat in egg one egg and we're gonna beat in our vanilla so put your egg in put your vanilla in and go ahead and beat that up now we're gonna gradually blend in our dry ingredients remember we put there flour baking soda and baking powder to the side grab that and gradually start beating in your dry ingredients until you have them all in and it's about this consistency right here once you have that done you're going to take your cooking sheets do not grease them understand do not grease them there's no need to grease them at all and what you're gonna do is you're gonna use a teaspoon and you're gonna use the teaspoon in order to measure it out roll it up or roll it around in your hands and then place it on your cooking sheet you want to give it a little space because you already know that it is gonna expand now depending on your oven you're gonna bake this eight to ten minutes for me I had to bake it around twelve about twelve minutes twelve and a half minutes to get it where it needs to be it's gonna be eight to ten minutes for twelve minutes or until golden you know when they're done whenever they're golden you're gonna let them stand on the cookie sheet for about you know two-three minutes let them cool down and then you're gonna move them over to the wire rack and let them cool for you know three or four minutes just let them cool down and then once they cool down you can move them to a plate or what-have-you and you know get ready to serve them up so that's it this is a pretty straightforward recipe homemade can of sugar cookies now let me just say this just like with all of my recipes if you don't want to medicate this if you want to make some great cookies with your kids use regular butter like you see me using use all the regular sugar don't use any kind of sugar and you will make some great very easy sugar cookies these are great they taste amazing they're soft on the inside and like crunchy on the outside I really love them this is probably one of the best ones that I that I've done I really enjoyed these a whole lot so I hope that this video helped you but thank you guys once again I really appreciate each and every one of you until next time guys peace and good eats [Music]", "gfmuTpXJx-I": "[Music] hey everyone I'm really excited about this video I've been getting a lot of questions on how to write on cookies so here's the tutorial I put together for you guys [Music] so the first cookie I've got my icing here you can see me playing around with it and I want a thick consistency but still kind of smooth if it's too thick it won't grasp the cookie well and it'll break off pretty easily because this is a really thin fund so you can see it's a pretty soft peak I've got and that's exactly what I'm looking for so the first things first is I'm using my projector and I want to size the font to make sure that it's correct for my cookie and one thing that I do before I write on any cookies is I always practice on a piece of parchment paper so once I have the right size I'm going to go ahead and cut my bag so I want to put the bag with the seam facing up in the middle of the bag and I'm going to sort of flatten my tip and I'm gonna cut a really really small hole as straight as I can I'm gonna test it out to see if it's okay and if it's not thick enough if it's too small my icing will curl out of the bag or it'll clog I can go back and just recut it always stop start small and you can make it bigger as you go as you need so here I've got my parchment paper I've got the right size of the font I need for my cookie and I always want to practice a little bit just to make sure that everything's okay so here you can see I'm just piping a few lines here playing with the icing to make sure that it's what exactly what I need also you can see there's different ways you can pipe there's pulling the icing which is normally how we outline and we do things but there's also pushing the icing out of the bag so that's when I lift it up and I sort of squeeze extra hard the icing sort of goes away from the bag instead of me pulling it all the time I'm sort of pushing it out and that gives me those curves sometimes so I'm going to start piping we just touched down on the cookie and I keep the tip as close as I can to the cookie it gives me full control like this if I lift it too high when I have small turns it's really hard to get those turns so you can see I'm not exactly on the line but just keep going with it this is a practice and this is why I do it so I get a feel for the way I need to move my bag you can also see I'm piping with my right hand and I keep my left finger on my piping bag or on my hand it just steadies my hand a little bit because it's really hard for me to Pipe with one hand so I'm gonna give this another go just to get the feel for the see again and again I'm keeping it really close to the parchment paper right now just so I have more control if it's a longer line I can lift it up a little bit higher every time I start a new letter I'm gonna touch down if I'm able to so when you have things like O's or G's or Y's I always have an issue because when you curve around it's hard to pull that icing around so what I do when I go on the bottom curve that's when I sort of squeeze a little bit harder and I push the icing forward so I can see where it's gonna fall another thing with the projector is it's hard to be piping perpendicular over on your cookie because you're gonna be blocking the projector and you won't see what you're writing on your cookie so I try to keep my bag at an angle that way I can see what I'm writing sometimes you can't help it and you are piping a little bit blind so again practice always helps so when I'm pretty happy with my practice run I can go ahead and put it on my actual cookie there's a few errors here and there but I can fix that either with my scribe or I can give the few more practices and give it a try so I'm gonna cut my piping bag a little bit bigger because I had a little squiggly lines that I wasn't happy with so I think this will be a lot better and a lot easier to do this it's still really small hole but it'll be easier to control so now we're gonna put my cookie back under my projector so you can see I'm keeping my piping tip as close as I can I'm pulling it when I need to go left to right and when I'm going right to left when I'm looking at the G of the congratz I'm pushing my icing when I have to go to the left so that it comes out so I'm not dragging it because that sort of makes it an awkward you loop [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] my next cookie but the icing here ready I'm looking for about the same consistency I had for the first cookies thick but still sort of has soft peaks we don't it too thick but we don't want it thin either I'm gonna use be using pressure piping for this one so I'll show you guys how that works so you can use pressure piping when you have thick and thin lines basically what it is is using the bag that you cut the same bag for all the thick lines and all the thin lines so here again I'm gonna be cutting my bag I'm gonna be cutting the hole with the seam facing up cutting starting off with a small hole that I will match to the smaller areas of my point so I've sized my font now to the cookie and once I know it's good I'm going to bring out my parchment paper again and just do a couple test runs if you don't have parchment paper you can use paper towel I do it a lot as well either one is works fine just to give yourself a little bit of practice so here I'm just testing out my tip making sure that I like how big the hole is icing is not curling it's not too small of a hole or anything and here you can see me squeezing a little bit harder and building up the icing and that's basically the pressure piping part where I'm putting more pressure on the bag to make a thicker line so here I'm going to start with my oh and I'm going to put a lot of pressure on the downstrokes and sort of build up the icing and slowly move my bag down as I'm building up the icing once I get to the bottom of the OH I'm gonna lift my piping bag up slightly so keeping it close to the cookie or to the parchment paper and make that thin line and let the icing just drop again on the end here and building up the icing when I'm going down slowly moving the bag down and then I'm gonna touch down lift it up for the small part and then touch it down again and build up the icing I'm not touching the tip to the cookie or to the parchment paper I'm just hovering above it just to build up that icing there clean the tip off if you need to adjust the bag if you need to cut it again like I am here just to make it work right sometimes if it's the thick part is too thick you might need a bigger hole so I've done my practice now I'm ready to do it on my cookie so I did have to cut a little bit of a bigger hole just a little icing comes out a little bit smoother and here you can see again the thick parts I'm just building up the icing putting more pressure my bag so more icing comes out at the same time and when I go slow I'm just building it up and then I slowly lift up my bag the always big so I can lift up my bed quite a bit but with the other ones I won't be lifting my bag up too much because they are smaller lines you can do one letter at a time and you can see I'm going in with my scribe to sort of wiggle the pressured parts so it just smooths out a little bit so you don't see all the lines of the icing building up if your consistency is too thick you won't really be able to smooth it out too much so that's why you're kind of looking for a soft peak consistency where you wiggle it a little bit and it does smooth out a touch [Music] okay so for my next cookie I'm actually gonna have two different fonts but I'm going to be using the same consistency and again this is about the same consistency as the first two cookies thick soft peaks is what we're really going for here I'll be doing a simple font and then a smaller pressure piping where I won't be quite smoothing out the font because it's a really small font so it's sort of not too noticeable when you're building up the icing so here you can see I'm starting with the happy and it's just simple lines I'm keeping the tip as close to the cookie as possible but I'm still lifting it up so I touched down at one point lift it up just to touch and touch it down the fonts not too big so you don't have a lot of space to basically lift up your bag really high if you're lifting up your bag high your lines gonna get too long them and you go back down to touch it you'll be way over the line of the word and also you can see with a projector I tried to keep my bag sort of at an angle so I can see what I'm typing here for the a and the P and even the Y there's sort of curves so again I'm looking for that push of the icing out of the bag when I'm going from right to left whenever I'm going left to right for me I'm right-handed it's natural for me to touch the icing down pick it up and and basically pull the icing towards the right but when I have to go from right to left as in like the circle of the a or let's say on the bottom of the P I like to push the icing out so the icing is almost ahead because if I drag my eye my bag to the left I'm blocking the projector and I can't really see what I'm doing so this is a relatively simple font and then the next one we're gonna go to is back to pressure piping and this is really small so I did have to cut a smaller hole if I go too big then I lose control and it gets too thick and the letters sort of run together so same principle as before I put a little bit extra pressure sort of hover the tip or just slightly touch the tip so I have control and I squeeze the bag for the thicker parts on the down strokes and on the up strokes I'm just lifting up the bag just a touch and very little pressure and pulling it to the next letter you can always stop at the letters anytime that there's a break sort of an it allows you to stop this calligraphy isn't meant to be all done in one stroke so you can see like with the D as well that I've stopped and then I've started to get at the top of the deep [Music] okay so for this font we're actually going to use two different consistencies so my first consistency is gonna be my outline which is basically the same consistence we've seen soft peek thick sort of icing and then I'm gonna bag half of my icing and then I'm gonna add a little bit of water to it and make it a little bit thinner I'm not looking for flood here I'm just looking for a smoother thick icing that I could wiggle very easily and have it settle the reason being we're gonna be outlining the letters and filling in with a smoother icing when I have bigger fonts some of these cutters that you cut come with funds it you don't really want to do pressure piping because it's very obvious the lines that you have so I prefer this method there's no wrong way if you prefer doing pressure piping with a bigger hole in the bag you can totally do that but this is the way I prefer so I get a smoother looking letter so once you have everything ready I've done my practice already but we're gonna skip that for this cookie so here I'm just outlining my cookie and then once I outline the first letter I'm gonna stop and actually fill it in with my sort of thicker flood sometimes I fill it in right away sometimes I do the L one it depends really how large the font is and how big the bigger the space is sometimes I let it dry that a line for a minute or two and go back and do it but because these are smaller I want to do it at the same time just because then it kind of I can sort of jiggle it into the outline so it smoothes into one sort of looking puff instead of having like an outline and then the flood in the middle so here again I just outline all the thick parts I put two lines there and then any really big parts like you can see the end I put my thicker icing in the middle and I'll flood on top just to prevent cratering and then any really really tiny parts I can even use my outline just to fill it in if it's really really small if I'm scared my flood will maybe go over and just one letter at a time you just keep going until you're happy and you can jiggle it with your scribe just to smooth it out a bit you can I have to work fast if it's thicker icing because the thicker it is the easier and faster it dries so you just give it a little jiggle right away once you've flooded it [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so for my last cookie here we're gonna be doing sort of the similar type of font but it's smaller so what I like to use again is somewhat the same consistency looking for soft peaks here a little bit softer than the previous just because I'm gonna be using the same icing for basically outlining and flooding right away the reason I'm using the same icing is because it's such a small area that I need to flood that I don't need a separate icing I don't need a thinner icing it's just probably gonna create a mess for me so you can see here I have I believe they're called serifs the little lines on the end so that's why I want the thin a small hole in my bag to match that area of the letter and then for the thicker parts I'm just sort of outlining and then just flooding with the same icing I have it's a thick icing it's a very small area so I don't need much the smaller the area is easier to sort of smooth out if it's thick flood if it's a big area it's really hard to smooth out the flood because it dries really quickly but if it's such a small area like this I just do one letter and sort of squeeze the thicker icing in there as my flood and it's totally fine I could smooth it out with my scribe no problem again this is all just one consistency I'm using because it's such as these are small letters and small areas that make it thick there's no need to really flood because chances are your flood will maybe crater or it might just go over the outlines and with all the cookies take your time people see these videos on Instagram or on Facebook and everything sped up because especially with Instagram you basically have a one minute time limit so whenever I'm posting videos I have to speed it up from you know 5 or 10 minutes of me piping on to under 1 minute so it looks like it's really easy and it goes really fast but you can see here that I am actually taking my time with each letter I'm going really slow sometimes it's hard to see with the projector so you know you don't really have to speed and rush through it take your time go slow stop at the letters fix anything that you need to you know practice a few times don't think that even if we done it a thousand times you know we I still practice every single word that I write every time I do it because it just gives you the feel a little bit of what you need to do and if you're icing is the right consistency maybe it's not you might have to remix it put a little bit of powdered sugar to make it thicker add water to make it thinner if it's not going right when you're practicing then just fix your icing it'll be much much better if you do it then try to figure it out on the cookie when you're when you don't have any extras to play around with so as always thank you so much for watching and if you have any questions about this any of the styles that I've show them here you can let me know below see you guys in the next tutorial [Music]", "vbJ-WMzQPt4": "smoke haze to the cheese smoke cheese to the cooks smoke cushion to the sour desert [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes

right hold on got my other part i need my bones here took a little piece of cardboard made more filter roll it on you can well first off it's a great medicinal strain that's what i got uh treats arthritis back and other chronic pains stress depression gastric intestinal disorders now for my time my favorite about how to grow it hold on give me one moment i was gonna do a show without the three bow the jade the blunt and the bow oh yeah so um let me start here oregon girl groves 420 on canon sos was quoted as saying this is a hard strain to grow very nutrient sensitive that's how i'm going to start it off so it has medium to large size flowers and sativa type buzz with a long almost cone shape [Music] buds are a muted green with a yellowish tank and are threaded with rust colored hairs the trichomes give the buds a sticky texture so indoor i had a 62 inches so what's that five feet two inches and it would yield 1.75 ounces of square foot what the hell is this we got 49 to 56 inches and 13 ounces of square meat so outdoor takes about seven to eight weeks to uh flower it should be done in early october uh it's about 17 ounces per plant and a moderate growth difficulty is what it's quoted as but i would believe the nutrients sensitive [Music] sounds like it's something i want to grow though i definitely like the flavor there's the flutiness pretty nice", "Eo1uYFdbzic":

from my little wardrobe here so oh my gosh no I ain't here no what you see this is the raddest umbrella ever so every single one of those is basically a pop nug um I mean good size here they're they're good juicy buds every single so many of em on here YouTube I'm so excited all of them are just delicious um gotta hang in this way my last harvest I had two plants one of them was or both of them were original cheese both of them were from the same plant same cuttings identical feeding schedules identical environment side-by-side anyways when I cut them down I took one of them and I trimmed all of this flank any of these things that I could see stem on it I cut it all out of there and from there I just hung it for a couple of days the other one I took right away in a dystonic trimming trim trim trim and the comparison of the two together after done curing in a few weeks honestly was amazing the the one that I had hung up took almost a week longer to dried to cure um but it came out way more crystalline so my thought is nutrients and the stem transferring down magic I don't know but I think I'm gonna do the same here so I'm gonna go through I'm going to trim everything on a can while it's still on the plant drop that here on the floor and let her hang dry this way for a couple of weeks maybe a week or so and then take her out and be I'll trim so she doesn't look like much right now YouTube but my god her off can't turn her over and they just but she stands out to so many many buds I'm so excited YouTube bargain recreational marijuana measure 91 says for plants on property no matter what stage they're in it doesn't matter if you've got just your clones that's not two separate plant four clones or four plants in full flower but you cannot go over eight ounces of usable product on your property at any given time so I think that I might be really close to that but I'm pretty certain I haven't gone over it my first time growing on a scrog my first time growing blue Mugu i short gassed her longevity in flower and I robbed her of at least a week maybe two weeks of nutrients that I should have given her but plus side is she is really well fleshed out I mean she is going to taste delicious and I got this right here to try to a little bit more view there but as you can see you know she's she's running on fumes I'm really excited YouTube 71 days of

everybody so we are days away from harvest in here it's Wednesday the 10th we're gonna harvest on the 13th a little over 50 day window everything's milky I've seen some amber come through and definitely wishing I had the chalices up so I don't know where I felt like I liked having some freedom to reach into my garden it's it's been you know I don't necessarily like the flop so like I suspected and like many of you said you know the trellises are definitely worth it because we're getting you know like if these if this wasn't a 50-day flower and I still had ten days or two weeks or more this would become pretty frustrating so I think the trellis is gonna go back on for the next cycle and yeah but anyway as always I'm very happy with the results this round I don't know how this phone is if it's doing better the camera on this or what but my old phone broke and insurance replaced it with this one and this is the first video with the new phone and as many of you know I don't hit it I just kind of shoot record to shoot so I don't know it to me it look looks like it might be a little better picture so really hoping it translates to a better video for you guys i dim the lights from 1,000 to 600 today just um just more so for my own benefit when I'm in here it's a lot less a lot less bright I'm gonna be doing some just some basic cleaning work pre-harvest cleaning work getting ready this is the weird random girl you weren't sure what she was I'm gonna [ __ ] trip over [ __ ] here anyway I've also ordered a trifecta of new worms for both my inside and outside I mean the beds are doing good in here I just want to reintroduce introduce some different variety of worms I ordered some African night crawlers which are they tolerate high heat they will hang out towards the top anyway I went to just I found a place that was selling worms in like a gardeners blend which has had three different species of worms that existed in the three in three different areas of your soil low deep in middle and I thought that was a pretty cool concept so I bought about three pounds of worms from them it should be about three to five thousand worms and so I've got a huge outdoor bed that we're gonna put most of them in I'm gonna introduce probably a thousand amongst the three beds in here take you down and look so here's where what we're looking like down here everything see the wood louse and Roly Polys are going to town lots of stuff happening down there but anyway I think this next round after I do the chop I'm gonna apply a very heavy green cover crop blend and try to get a really a really a lot of green material up before I plant the next cycle we've got a heavy Rollie pollie or wood louse population in here and I want to make sure that there's plenty of green material for them to consume it'll just help build the human air and help keep the soil alive and vibrant and so I definitely this is one of those things you want to be aware of what's happening and then make and then don't take drastic measures just make adjustments to accommodate like I've got a huge explosion of wood louse in here and were I not to accommodate they would make their way up the plant and chew on leaf material and and when they chew on the edges of the leaves you're leaving room for pathogens and whatnot to get in you know it's breaking that lipid barrier so like I said I'm noticing a large influx of the wood louse and I'm gonna accommodate them but by planting more green material for them to consume it's just kind of a logical logical step as opposed to trying to figure out a way to get on getting rid of them that's just that would be that's a terrible it's terrible thinking because they're actually doing good things for the soil so yeah that's kind of what's going on here I'll probably do a little like a crazy little time-lapse e-type video because I've got that a cool new feature on this camera that will allow me to do a sped-up video so I'll do some show you how I just how I take down one bed in here or something this weekend and you guys can see the process or some like that anyway I feel like I'm just rambling but I really wanted to just give you guys an update show you where we were if you hit up my IG if I got a new macro lens and took some cool pictures of the leaf surfaces and and got some good pics of the trikes you can see they're definitely milky you can see these are milky with the naked eye but anyhow overall I'm happy you know I really don't like running on this reduced plant count [ __ ] [ __ ] can't stand it 15 plants [ __ ] is that but anyway so I don't know I'm really really really happy with the quality of the product would like to have a more full canopy I know the trellis would have kept things up and tight and what gave the appearance of fullness but really what we needed in here was just more plants form up to make you know to give it the density that I wanted and for this particular strain but anyway I wanted to shout out to 7 finger ox he brought me a lavender plant the thing is beautiful a lavender it's a cannabis strain lavender smells incredibly like similar to lavender the finished flower really just beautiful nugs and I'm anxious to get that going in one of these beds here in the next couple cycles to come so dude thanks Brandon really appreciate that and anyway that's it later", "hvFNVAOvOXk": "- Hey, bakers, John Kanell here and today on Preppy Kitchen, we're making the perfect sugar cookie. These are so easy, and with the addition of one ingredient, they\nbecome a magical treat. Do you see this edge? It is just vertical, it\ndidn't become a glob, it wasn't frustrating to work with. It only needed a like few\nminutes in the fridge to chill and that was just so I wouldn't get my fingerprints on it to be honest. All right, let's get started. First off, I'm adding four cups or 480 grams of all purpose flour into my bowl and there's\na sifter here too, so it makes everything really easy. Half a teaspoon of salt, 1/3 of a cup of cornstarch. This is the stuff that's\ngonna make it not spread and it also makes your\ncookie kind of like, tender and crisp at the\nsame time, not chewy though. So, if you like chewy sugar cookie, this is not for you. But if you want your\ncookie to not spread out, and become a glob, this is for you. So, sift this all out. Bop. Okay, whisk it all up, set it aside, and now it's time for\nthe butter and sugar. Into the bowl of my stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, I'm adding 226 grams or one cup of unsalted room temperature butter. Let's give it a quick cream... (mixer whirring) and then add in one cup or\n200 grams of granulated sugar. (mixer whirs faster) Mix it up until it's nice and light and fluffy and just right. (mixer whirs faster) You can give the bowl a quick scrape down, not...not necessary but it helps. (mixer whirring) All right, let me show you\nwhat light and fluffy means because I always read that in recipes but some people are like, \"What does that even mean?\" This, now the butter has\nbecome a lighter color, so much closer to white and\nit's really fluffed up a lot. It's got air pumped into there and sugar is totally mixed in. It's not dissolved, but it's mixed in. Now we're gonna add in\ntwo room temperature eggs one at a time. Room temperature eggs\nincorporate way more easily and they're always what\nyou want in baking, except, except for certain pastry things. But that's a whole other story. (mixer whirring) Let that first egg incorporate and then add the second one in. (mixer whirring) All right, definitely\nscrape that bowl down one more time and mix it up. (mixer whirring) Now I'm gonna add a couple teaspoons of vanilla in just...eye\nball that out and mix it up. (mixer whirring loudly) You could've also used almond extract, lemon zest, the world is your oyster here. So many different flavorings to use. Add the flour in one big batch, making sure not to spill too much. (bowls clanking) I call that a success. Let's use this. (towel flaps) Now, let's mix it up. On low, to start off with. (mixer whirring) Okay, now I think it's ready. (mixer whirring loudly) Yup. (mixer whirring) But, take a moment, move all that flour into there and scrape the\nbowl down one more time. Yes, you could use a\nscraping paddle attachment. I actually have one. I got so many recommendations to buy one, but I will tell you they\nreally make everything fly up into the air while also mostly scraping the bottom. You can tell me in the comments if you have a similar experience. Or there's a magical thing I'm missing. But the tea towel works great. Almost done. (mixer whirring loudly) There we go. So here, I want you to see this\ncornstarch works some magic. This dough is like playdough almost. It's not sticking to\nmy fingers even though it's room temperature. And really if you wanted\nto, you just like... (taps dough) toss it into the oven right\nnow and it would be fine. However, this no-chill\ndough will get chilled just so I can have nice,\nclean shapes cut out. You know, like right now, like yes, that cuts out nicely, but it'll cut out nicely and handle nicely so you can transfer them\naround once it's chilled. Okay, thank you magical cornstarch. Right now, we're gonna\nroll this out and chill it. Dump that dough onto a\nsheet of plastic wrap. I don't know if you can see it, but it's here. Let's push it together. Now, I'm just going to roll it out between two layers of plastic. This only needs like 20\nminutes in the fridge. The only thing is that you\ndon't want any of this dough to dry out in the fridge. So, it needs to be all covered by plastic. Into the fridge, just lay it flat and we'll be right back with the swap out. My swap out was on the\ncounter for like 5 minutes, so it could warm up just a bit. I actually made it last night, so that's why it had to\nbe there for a bit longer. Dust that surface really well. I'm using a pastry mat, by the way, so it doesn't need direct\nwork on the counter. Now let's place this out. You can see it cracked a lot because I placed it one some bottles. There was no room in the fridge. So, it was all wavy when it came out. And then it cracked flat. Let's flour the rolling\npin and get to work. (upbeat music) Can you hear that they are\ntrimming trees next door? And by trimming trees, I\nmean completely cutting down a 50-year-old pine tree. And on a similar note, George doesn't feel like taking a nap. On my last Q&A which you\ncan click up here for, I learned that some people\ndidn't that this is my house. They thought it was set, but it's actually where I\nlive and the babies are... And the tree trimmers work around so... Errant noises here and there. So, I'll be cutting out\na few different shapes: circles, my favorite and pigs. I was looking for a\nnon-holiday cookie cutter and this is what I had. So, we're going to give it a try. These are probably going to be a little bit sticking to the pastry mat. If you want to do the best job ever, divide the dough into two batches and it'll be much more easy\nto handle and move around. But, I wasn't feeling that. So, we're just gonna cut the circles out and then remove them altogether. Okay, that's a lot of circles. So, remove that excess and\nyou can re-roll the excess into another batch of cookies. And transfer these over\nonto my baking sheet. You want to see some of\nthe things you can do with circle cookies? You can check out my \"How to\nMake Orchid Cookies\" video and my how to make...I think there's like a rose or flower one. I'll put links to the\nblog posts or videos. Any one that I can find. Have my circles, and now\nit's time for a couple pigs. Why not? Batch one into the oven,\n375 for about 12 minutes. You want to watch a keep an eye out. I like my sugar cookies\nalmost brown but not browned. Totally up to you, though. Brown is tasty too. Let's give it a try and see if it tastes as good as it looks. (dreamy music) That's nice. I think a sugar cookie should\nbe crispy on the outside and kind of soft and chewy on the inside. That's what this is. If you like this video, check out my \"Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookie.\" They are amazing. Thanks so much for watching.

costs medical cannabis is a financial burden for people with serious conditions as well as a safe effective medicine that works all patients who need medical cannabis should have affordable access to it today i'm discussing three hybrid strains that all have the word blue in their names and are all hybrid strains blue dream a sativa dominant hybrid blue moonshine and indica dominant hybrid and blue magoo a 50 50 sativa indica hybrid i'll discuss their effects along with the effects of typical hybrid strains as well as some conditions that these strains commonly treat so let's get started before beginning it is important to note that these thc and cbd levels are approximate as any one batch of a plant may vary slightly due to the uniqueness of nature and environmental factors always read medical marijuana labeling carefully medical marijuana patients should be knowledgeable about the cannabinoids and terpenes in cannabis and their medical uses to choose the best medical strain to meet their needs you can download a complete chart of all cannabinoids and terpenes and their medical uses using the link in the description medical marijuana patients should also be aware of the different effects of strain types and thc and cbd ratios this will allow you to choose the best medical strain with or without intoxicating effects and with the other effects that you need you can find all of this information linked in the description to use as resources for choosing your most effective medical strain the strains i discussed today can treat a wide range of symptoms not only the ones described the conditions are what patients most often use these strains for also medical marijuana can affect people in different ways due to their medical needs and unique endocannabinoid systems these are the effects most people feel from these strains the first blue strain today is bluedream which is pictured here bluedream is a sativa dominant hybrid that produces effects similar to many sativa dominant hybrid strains all of the strains i will talk about today are hybrid strains created from cross breeding two strains to combine the best qualities of each strain the relaxing qualities of indicas with the energizing qualities of sativa strains blue dream is a 60 40 sativa dominant hybrid so it is fairly balanced leaning slightly more towards the energizing sativa side blue dream is related to blueberry and haze two other well-known strains blue dream has about 21 thc and one percent cbd with this high thc 21 to 1 thc to cbd ratio it will produce euphoric effects in the form of a high blue dream combines the cerebral mind high of sativas with the body relaxation of an indica it is known to promote energy and activity with focusing and relaxing effects this combination of effects made blue dream the most popular strain sold in 2015. blue dream originated in california and is very popular on the west coast it smells like berries grapes and sweet skunk and has a spicy blueberry taste blue dream is good for being social creative and focused with body relaxation patients report it is effective in treating decreased appetite nausea anorexia depression migraines and headaches pain sleep disorders and stress however blue dream could treat other conditions and symptoms as well the next strain blue moonshine is an indica dominant hybrid that is relaxing but not sedative similar to many indica dominant hybrid strains blue moonshine has 13 percent thc and less than 1 percent cbd with a 13 to 1 thc to cbd ratio this strain would still produce euphoric effects however they may be less intense than other high thc strains with greater percentages of thc as in strains with 20 percent or more thc the fairly low percentage of thc compared to other strains makes this less potent and good for those starting out with thc or beginner patients it is ironic that the name is blue moonshine since this is associated with potent alcohol and this strain is not very potent however blue moonshine would still produce euphoric effects and is not for patients looking for non-intoxicating ways to use medical marijuana such as high cbd strains blue moonshine tastes like blueberries with hints of citrus it produces more relaxing feelings that aren't sedative and promote happiness and being social patients report that blue moonshine has effectively treated anxiety panic attacks stress muscle spasms insomnia pain and inflammation these symptoms are what it is most commonly used for but it could treat other symptoms and conditions as well the final strain is blue magoo which is a 50 50 sativa indica hybrid where sativa dominant hybrids are usually more energizing and indica dominant hybrids are usually more relaxing 50 50 hybrids can provide a complete balance of effects which is seen with blue magoo blue magoo has 16 thc and one percent cbd this is a 16 to 1 thc to cbd ratio that would produce euphoric high effects however these may be less intense than strains with 20 percent or higher thc blue magoo is very balanced in its relaxing and energizing effects it promotes being social and active with body relaxation blue magoo is truly a combination of the focusing effects of sativas and the body relaxation of indicas making it very popular among patients blue magoo is a favorite among cancer patients patients report blue magoo is effective in treating nausea decreased appetite pain stress depression anxiety asthma and cancer or hiv aids treatment side effects these are the conditions patients have said they use it to treat but like all other strains it could treat other symptoms as well blue magoo has a fruity blueberry taste and is related to dj short blueberry and williams wonder these strains can give you a general idea of the effects that most hybrids produce and the effects that strains with similar makeups will produce however it is always important to look at the individuality of a strain and all of its cannabinoids and terpenes to choose a strain that best meets your needs it may take some trial and error to find your best medical strain medical marijuana patient logs can help you record the strains that you've tried and how they affected your symptoms they provide a measurable way to show how medical marijuana is working for you download these for free using the link in the description

picked this up free hawkman masses wonderful stuff blue Magoo is a 50-50 hybrid and from what I found out THC levels can get the 16% so she's kind of mediocre and I was from what I found that genetics on this is this is a DJ Schwartz blueberry cross with William wonderful really wonderful strange man I love Williams wonder and DJ Screw Berry is a really good strain my Groody destroys blueberry back in Oregon I didn't put a whole bunch of weight wise not a lot but it was really good tasting but it's a really nice train and these two together should be really good anyhow this is going straight for stuff like anxiety stress depression you know all those kinds of things also also really is like hyperactivity and inattentiveness so I'm thinking it's gotta be like hdh ADHD a TD type stuff that's what it sounded like to me when they say that yeah inattentiveness and hyperactivity also good for a depression anxiety it's super mellow and it's not locking at all so it's that's one of the things I like about it really great for doing things like going out shopping run around from waiting in line with paces whether it's the DMV or at the grocery store it makes that kind of stuff you know I wouldn't say that yeah it's fun to go wait in line man but it's definitely like you know it does it doesn't seem like it's boring it doesn't seem like it's uh TVs or something I don't want to be here it makes whatever you're doing really really kind of you know enjoyable it's nice it's very fun and I enjoyed medicating with this training especially during the daytime even in the nighttime it didn't keep me awake at night I was able to fall asleep I had fun watching movies watching TV hanging out with my family talking story so it's a really good stray for all around you know and the only things you might really want to watch out for is cottonmouth some dry eyes and the munchies are there man I hope group of cookies at my mom's house anything almost ate the whole entire cookie jar well yeah the munchies are there so is the the dry eyes and kontin mom for the joys and even that bad it's just kind of like you know you can notice it but it's not too bad but anyhow um really wonderful

Gophers for coming out here and joining us today in the Emerald triangle we're out here in Mendocino County and we are working with soil today we're getting dirty on the farm and what we're going to do this year is teach you nerds about no-till soil and reusing your soil bioremediation the grow site the property that the soil is on to work in your benefit and we're going to harness the power of the soil food web and we're going to use microbiology to boost our soil life and provide our plants with all the nutrients that they need to grow big fat dense frosty buds I just want to thank every one of you for joining me out here alright dopers so part of reusing your soil is going to be able to add micro life back to it and if you really want to get the full benefit of everything that was added to a quality soil then what we need to do is go ahead and boost the soil life on the surface of the soil we're going to create a lasagna inside of our soil in this lasagna is going to be multi layers of decomposition and life and death and it's going to create a human Slayer that's going to be able to provide our plants with everything that they need it's going to aid in the breakdown of nutrients and minerals that we decide to add to our soil so if you follow me over here you have these thousand gallon smart pots inside of them we have last year's blue into soil Kings big root soil and I must say it's the first time I've worked with this and it's fantastic I really like it it's very it's very Loeb it's nice and fluffy it has a great texture to it I studied the recipe and everything that went into it is well-designed it has a fast source of nutrients that's available to your plants right away and then there's some nutrients and trace minerals in there that are going to be good for the for the longevity of the soil it's going to be able to continuously provide nourishment to the plant and feed the micro life that's going to break everything down for us so what we did this year is we grew a cover crop so this cover crop here is hairy vetch and then we also did some clover down in here and what this is going to do is it's going to break down some of the nutrients and minerals that we added throughout last year's growing season and it's going to store them inside these plant leaves right here and then we're going to turn this back over onto the surface of the soil and we're going to bury it in and all those minerals and nutrients and all the nitrogen that's in the screen material it's going to be right on our soil surface we just created our own nitrogen now our goal here is to make a lasagna so what we're going to do is take this cover crop after we chopped it down and we're going to smother it in a good compost and I say a quality compost because if it's anaerobic and it's stinking like [ __ ] it's doing horrible things already it's not going to provide your plants with the nourishment they need so we're going to choose a good compost or to cover everything and we're going to be able to begin to build our humans later and today I'm going to walk you guys through that process and I'm really happy that you joined me here this is absolutely the most amazing thing that I believe a lot of organic farmers are overlooking and we're not using the power of the soil food web we're missing micro life we're missing microbiology we're getting too scientific with it we want to put the biology back into the soil and let it do its work for us that's our angle we're going to create a nutrient dense medicinal cannabis that's going to be full of my vitamins trace minerals nutrients it's going to be in somatic aliyah live and it's going to be healthy that's our end goal because we want to create that product that's going to be the best for you alright dopers so we spent the winter growing our cover crop out and there's some good sources of cover crop that you can use to your advantage you can use hairy vetch purple vetch fenugreek clovers if your soil is becoming too compact and you're not getting the oxygen levels you need you can sell field radish or daikon radish in there and it will actually rot in place and it'll be a nutrient timebomb it's going to bioremediation nutrients make them available to the plants right away and what we're going to do is we're going to turn over our cover crops as you disagree this year we're not going to disturb the soil surface we're really just going to go in here with this little hand tool here and you can use anything that you have a hole a weed eater would be fantastic but we like this guy it makes us more in touch with the soil we'll just go through and start hacking it out we're just going to cut it down a little bit and shop it up so this is creating your own nitrogen and then another thing that we're going to talk about is the ability of legumes to add nitrogen to the soil surface or to the soil legumes can work together with Rhizobium bacteria which is a purple bacteria this photosynthetic and it has the ability to pull nitrogen from the air release it through extra dates and make it bioavailable to the cannabis plant and in order for that process to take place the nitrogen first or the clover first has to accept the nitrogen from the environment so you have to sell a first crop and then you have to kill that crop in and bury it over and then the next set of clover that you plan on there this scene will be inoculated with the bacteria right away and then any future crop of clover after that we'll have that bacteria and that ability to bring the nitrogen to the soil from the air a lot of nitrogen is a source called a monocle nitrogen that's when it's released into a gaseous form and we're going to harness that I'm going to grab it we're going to use it right that's pretty good we don't need to be too rough we just want to chop it up a little bit now we're going to bury it with some compost and this year's compost that we chose is soil Kings special blend here it's a blend of different barks peat moss cow manure has some rock dusts in it I don't believe you use any liming agents in it which is extremely beneficial to what we're doing here our soil life is going to diversify our pH force it's going to provide us with the optimal ranges that we need anyone who is worried about pH and stuff like that probably just doesn't have the soil balanced out properly they're using inputs that throw it off a little bit we're going to create a very heavy fungal presence in the soil as well as a bacterial presence in the soil and the to work at opposite ends of the pH scale fungal is going to be on the low end and that's going to that's going to provide you know a range of your micro macro nutrients at the low end of the pH scale and the bacteria is going to work at the upper end and it's going to pull you know the nitrogen and everything it's going to make it available to the plants in the upper pH range so let's get dirty with this and let's dump this right on there [Music] ah [Music] what up everyone we're back how much we got about a half a half a yard of compost yard yeah of the soil King blend love this stuff and I don't know is the camera picking it up is a steaming real nice yeah Amy it was semen to Jose good compote you could stay warm overnight I could probably take a nap in this being the soil nerd that I am so yeah bluesy be you guys you're going to hit it out of the park this year we're going to bury this pepper crop in the soil King soil all the micro life that's in here is going to start going to work on this cover crop this is our first layer in our lasagna I'm going to bury this out and we're going to start diversifying the soil when this is all said and done we're going to go ahead and add our dry amendments it's important that with no-till that or any organic gardening at that that you're continuously adding your inputs throughout the season you don't need to do anything in excess or in concentration minimal amounts and you can always add a little bit more but it always sucks going to add too much you know we've all been there and we know what happens whenever you burn a plant it really frickin sucks so let's get to work here blue see we're going to go ahead and spread this around like I said before we want about an inch or two across the soil surface that we took out enough on the top layer earlier oh yeah perhaps malawach yeah this is this is going to be great stuff feels nice I've ever seen some worms in it already worms are our friend right there's more worms than ever after that 100% organic last year so what we're doing here Blasi is we're eatin what's called a humic leg and our humans layer is going to break down and it's going to facilitate its own acids and those acids are going to work for us in breaking down the dry amendments that we add to the soil they're going to make them water-soluble they're going to be to make make them available to take up by the plant micro life is going to be able to consume them deposit them into the roots and everything is going to work together one neat thing to talk about actually as plant exudates and how they work and how micro life works for the soil all day long the micro life is going in there it's putting in work it's eating its pooping getting fat it's living it's dying it's breeding and it's working hard and it is this whole goal and it knows this is to build a big plant above it it builds a plan above it and it knows that as that plant photosynthesizes create sugars at the end of the day when that plant metabolizes and it begins to rest it's going to send excess sugars down its roots into the soil and the micro life is after that it's not there it really doesn't want to break down your nutrients for you but it does it for those sugars plant exudates are the paychecks for the micro life that's what makes full system work and if we think that we can put the god molecule into farming we've got it all wrong you cannot recreate that process I don't care what you try the only way to harness it is to work with it and that's exactly what we're doing here today we're out here trying to teach everybody how to properly garden using organics not a Frankenstein hybrid of three or four systems that we put together that you know some inputs are semi organic or sort of organic you know or even a full chemical system whether they're using trichomes shiners and big fat but hardeners and everything like that well I promise you that in its natural form with the right genetics in your in your garden that it will perform at peak optimal health if you harness the soil food web and the only way to do that is to create our humans layer we want to make those acids that are going to facilitate the breakdown of the macro and micro nutrients and let our plants eat so they can send those sugars down and feed that micro life and repeat that process we're back we're in the [ __ ] camp in upper tremendo dope no tilling right now a Minnesota nice got Mr Bond in the house liver I usually don't do this but I'll make an exception we're growing for resin this year so so when we go back all right what's this next step so what we're going to do now is we're going to add our dry amendments to the compost that we just put down and the reason we choose dry amendments oldie is because they're in their raw form they're minimally processed we kind of know where they stand right now they haven't been through a whole bunch of [ __ ] loads of you know chelation and other processes that break it down that we just don't know what happened behind closed doors we're controlling the whole system right now so you know it's in our hands we've always been into the dry members city this is just right up III where we're just dealing what we do and absolutely doing stuff in the mix if you're not farming with dry amendments is you're missing the point here oh this big old bag so we all right yeah so oldie you just held up the crab meal there we're going to use crab meal it's going to be our source of phosphorus and calcium and a cool thing about crab meal does it have something in it called Titan and chitin is also found in insects grass it's the exits in the exoskeleton and what it does is it kind of sends a hormone or triggers our hormone on the plant to believe that it's under attack by insects and it's yeah it's really neat the plant just kind of thinks that insects are all around it or on it and and are about to devour and it's going to start building its own resistance to the pest but you know it can start building its own immune system up it's going to work biologically with the soil we talked about those exudate if it thins down to the soil one cool thing is that through the extra dates the plant can actually communicate with the soil yeah it can drop different you know terpenes and stuff like that in there and the micro life is going to kind of know what's going on you know with with the certain enzymes and proteins that are going to be in the exude a sure you know and they're going to know like hey we need to get our asses in gear and start working too you know or everything's chill and this plan is loving us and we're doing really good you know and that's just kind of in layman's terms you know just to break it down so it's easy for everybody to understand I can dig it we can dig and you dig it I'm not not not trying to you know to say that anybody is not up to speed here or there any systems better than the other but when we're working with true organics we're going to harness the full power of the of the soil food web for sure or the food soil web is some people call it oh yeah we're just going to use our micro life this is their food source the reason we choose these inputs is they're safe for our soil they're not going to harm our micro life if we chose a bunch of blood meals and bone meals and put them on the Big Mac diet well they're probably going to get cancerous they're going to get fat they're not going to work for us they're going to underperform they're going to be couch potatoes alright dopers next on the list please e be sprinkling down the kelp meal oh can you smell it smells like the ocean so some kelp meals got a lot of natural growth hormones in it that the plants going to recognize it's a great source of our trace minerals and one thing to note with something like kelp meal is its plant-based it's already bioavailable to the plant soon as water hits it it kind of soluble the plant could recognize some of the nutritional value that it drops out right away it's also a great food source for our fungal life they're going to kind of live on it it's not going to totally go away it's going to stay in our soil our soil life is going to continuously consume it and work with it all right so kelp meal help you what we got next what else we got the neem meal and as you know well yeah what's up with an email we're trying to we're trying to channel these bugs as everybody knows so this is bug control right here yeah so what we have is new meal and new meal that's a pretty decent NPK I couldn't tell you what the hell it is I don't follow the MPAA chart I grow biological okay I'm not using scientific methods I'm using scientific guidelines but really what we're going to get out of our knee meal is it's going to be a good source of our nitrogen it has some phosphorous in it it has potassium in it but most of all it is going to be it arts anti septic properties this stuff right here is going to repel bugs it's going to keep fungus gnats out of the soil it's going to keep the soil health up stinks like [ __ ] but man it works amazing actually like you really like that smell weird I almost like it you know you want to know what's up they make toothpaste out of me meal he likes a lot they make toothpaste out of it new meal is actually a health product overseas it's beneficial to our bodies as well as our soil that's trippy all right that's the Nemean email don't skip out on the knee meal especially if you're having problems with russet mites thrips whiteflies a fits and the fungus net all-around bug promise all those rows we don't want fungus nuts so last on our list here and the all-important glacial rock dust and we're going to use we're going to use the glacial rock dust this is going to be our source of trace minerals right here it's going to be very soft to the plants there's a lot of rock dust naturally in soil and we're going to add that the ratios for everything here is going to be neem kelp and crab at the same application rate and we're just kind of covering the soil surface as you can see here it just up we just tagged it up we just covered it up we didn't go too heavy with it we felt comfortable we put some in all parts of the soil but we didn't take it on it so neem kelp crabs equal amounts and we're going to use twice as much rock dust twice as much twice as much rock dust do you think all blue yeah now you jiggle that process wrinkly there you go I take rocks in the breaker well we don't have oh yeah that one bag okay if we only get that one oh yeah the crab it's fine use me just thirty days ago having sex for a little bagging who's menglu tangles this is the most important part right here is the rock like this rock is a channel or tracing in or thing that manages okay like all your inert ones we stuff all right opers it's time to go ahead and work this into our compost fingertip Minh yeah we're just fingertip and we don't want to necessarily till the soil at all this is called no-till but we're building a human right now so we're not killing the layers underneath this we're just working with the ones that are here and we're going to help them along and we're going to start creating our own humic acids right in our container here one thing to note okay one thing to note is that everything needs to be added in moderation when doing this when reinventing your soil added at a concrete add your amendments at a comfortable level if you have a gut instinct that tells you oh I might be adding too much here you know if you're not feeling comfortable with how much you're spreading on your soil then back off it's that simple we're going to continuously repeat this process throughout the season and as we do it's going to build this houmous layer up and the thing about mixing these amendments into this compost layer it's now all that natural breakdown is going to occur right there with it and then it's going to pull it down into the roots through a fungal presence pinch it is the little pimp camping in Big Pimpin been pimping in company that look beautiful barley straw it's time for the next step barley straw Oh barley and wheat straw that's discussion we don't need a lot either it's just like strands just a little layer get the scissors let's cut this much when you you just I think that we do do yeah he is one bale for the whole garden we thought we're gonna need way more yeah going I bond so what you're going to do now is sprinkle on this oak barley and wheat wheat hay and straw combination that we got some people don't like hay a lot of it's been sprayed and it has seed that's not a factor for us here we're going to use that seed we're going to we're going to grow our own from this point forward we're not going to have to use hay or straw that we purchased at our nursery anymore that much huh Gallo bark see what word that you want it yeah like that right there okay alright dopers now what we're doing is covering our our compost that's been amended we're going to use this to help lock in moisture on our soil surface we're also going to plant a cover crop right through this it's going to sprout up through this dead decaying material it's going to kind of pull it down to the soil surface make it nice and tight that's going to decompose in with our human Slayer it's going to be a great carbon source for everything to kind of live on and it's going to work arm honestly so next step after this is going to be cover cropping and what we chose this time is clover like clover a lot because again it's nitrogen fixing we went over that earlier how it pulls the nitrogen from the air number two is it stays short we're about to grow some trees in here they're going to hang out a little ways we don't want anything that's really going to necessarily interfere with that or make direct contact with the plant it's going to make a highway for bug free way yeah sending a bug free way and we can avoid that so we're going to plant low growing cover crops that are going to be beneficial turning cover crops into cash crops that's how this process works rinse lather repeat boom so what we're going to do here we're going to continuously repeat this yeah boom look at that we did it alright everyone we've got our soil fully external sucking pimped-out okay I know what's on your checklist on your technique this is a new venture for us the no-till nation this is a movement and you know we don't stand up for [ __ ] synthetic fertilizers chemicals none of that bad medicine and then that's it that's not what we're about we're not about the GMOs any of that stuff in our lives promote a positive message show the world that were responsible that we're respectable and then we know what the hell we're doing here always experiment always trying the most next level organics methods try and keep it clean for everyone you know we got to bring this old-school technique back and everyone should start expanding and getting into this because I encourage each one of you to find what's right for you and it's way cheaper gosh yeah yeah and the day I'll tell you want to taste at the end every time we smoked Minnesota nicest flowers I'll tell you what they're on point very very flavor on you you'll eat you'll you'll taste and see the difference doing it like this yes sir it relies on a genetic potential to cannabis if your genetics are lacking this system is probably not going to push your plants like you need to because there is no cushion plants here this is going to make your genetics run like a hot rod you want to soup that yeah you want to soup that charger up let's do a Cudi's let's get it done yeah so once again a shout out and thanks to the soil King that's what we started with you know we're still rocking it we're building it up shout out to smart pots of course oh yeah the whole crew out there the weed nerd nation of course sub cool with TGA fees to get into some good genetics and we're going to rock it we're going to grow some trees and I want to shout out the weed nerd live show make sure you tune in to the weed nerd live show on Saturday nights I try as much as possible to be there we answer no till questions we talk organics we have buku information that we want to share with you guys havin fun and yeah we have fun with it and we're not there to intimidate anybody we want everybody to be a part of our culture come out and join us make sure you check that out at 7 o'clock on Saturday nights on sub cool 420s channel yeah rebel 10 i got out man no dope given all the information and putting it out there to everyone one more month everything will be in the ground blah Blau see y'all soon dartz no thank you she Golden's oh that old better they call me the hashing assassin take one davon my hash it'll leave you [ __ ] gasping - or laughi or lapis lashing back smashing these ducts man collapsing ah manhole cover a use rubber a manhole cover alright so behind the scenes this is behind scenes behind the pink you know I gotta get I gotta get no film on do you film on a little drip rain drop drip drop so this is how we get these badass videos you guys attacking the people in the tree grew my taint the world with the things that we do they true when I never pretend I've got a better from a fan say it takes to the motivation got me back up on my feet so I could stand I just want to take you in and let you know it's all worth it in the women it's all worth it in the years", "OZLETQrHiFk": "hey how's it going I've had some requests as of late to explain my watering system and and how I set it up so I'm gonna attempt to do that for you guys I use the Trump bloom at a drip system these are ceramic probes that you soak in water and they get hydrated and waterlogged and there's a valve inside mechanism of sorts that when this this gets put in the medium and when this the medium gets dry and this probe starts to dry out it'll kind of suck pull open a manifold or a valve that will allow water to flow this will be attached to a line of a water line and then water will drip out the end based on your your desired flow rate so you've got a little potentiometer of sorts here and you can tighten or loosen the flow and that's based on how dry your soil is so this is really handy in the no-till world because we want our beds evenly moist we don't like like a dry out and then a drench which is kind of the conventional thought process when when watering cannabis is allowing a dry out and we really kind of break that thinking in no-till because we've got micro life and worms and a rich micro life happening that really requires constant moisture so these really aid in that and they've been just tremendous and I'll explain my setup here and how I got it going so basically up here on top of my other water collection reservoir this basically collects my mini split a condensation and feeds it to my humidifier and so it kind of the mini split catches it feeds it to the humidifier puts it back in the room many split catches it I've got a little bit of a closed loop in that regard so that's why I have a hundred and sixty-five tank this doesn't even feed the plants at all this is just to manage the moisture inside the room might be a little overkill but it's working working good for us here so the blue mats are going to be fed by this 13 gallon cheapo Lowe's kind of reservoir I've got it connected with RO an RO filter on a float so it's always full and then out one end of it here's an outlet it goes down and I like to put these little stop stop valves in place so if I have to do work on the line or whatever I don't have to deal with high-pressure water now I put this about five foot up because I've got a ways to go around and I want a lot of water pressure they really only require three feet so you don't need any pumps that gravity is enough pressure to get it through your system it's really really nice so anyway the line comes down right and it's my beneficial bottle line comes down and I've just basically feed it into the bed and it goes all along the outside edge of the beds on the inside so that the whole diameter of the beds I've got three four by eight beds is completely encircled by this line and here's the return coming around right so I'll go and show you in about the midway point bear with me so on the Midway plate on the back I like to put this little kind of like a bleed valve in case you get air in the line or for the reservoir runs dry for whatever reason you'll get air in the line and this this you can you can turn on and take care of that so anyway so now you know that this line goes all the way around the bed's and I'll take you back to the reservoir so here here's the line that's made it all the way around traverse all the way around the bed's and now it's on its way back right and so this is a line that comes out the other end they're both essentially outlet lines and the reason for that is if we get a clog in the line anywhere along the line here on one of the drippers water will still come the back way and supply the other drippers that we have that way we're not losing like a Christmas tree light that goes out and then you lose all the rest this is going to supply power like the water power you know for lack of a better term to the back end so hopefully that makes sense I didn't really ramble so the long and short of it is I connected to that tube that goes all the way around the bed's I've got those dripper probes and they basically just fit in here like a tee and then here's the probe in the soil and then connected to this probe I've got this drip line like this so here's the drip line it's basically teed into a little micro tube flexible micro tube and this runs bare with me this runs basically the length of the bed and goes all the way to the middle and so all along the short side of this setup on the 4-foot side of my four by eight beds I've got four probes per 4 by 8 bed so all down this well foot line of beds I've got 12 probes one a foot and on though each one of those probes is four feet of drip line with five drippers attached so that's basically how it works the drippers or all the probes are all along the short edge of the beds with drip lines running to the middle on both sides so on my three four by eight beds i have twenty-four drippers twenty-four probes rather with five drippers attached to each so there's about it there's roughly a hundred drippers going on in here at any time keeping my soil evenly moist here's another dripper once again this isn't garbage this is my beneficial mite container that I'm leaving to let the last of them kind of escape so anyway I hope this kind of explained it and gives you some guidance if you're setting up your own if you have any specific questions in regards to the blue mats and the end the dialing ax man hit me up with a direct message on Instagram or something alright guys hope it helped like", "wpmnMVJEsUk": "well hey guys welcome back to the Washington State cannabis review I'm gypsy [ __ ] and today we're gonna be talking about Canavan farms now kahneman farms is a farm located out in Clark County in Vancouver Washington now these guys are an indoor grow facility the Institute in organic and natural pest management system so in other words they're using organic pesticides and predatorial insects to protect the crops now there but is pot soil grown and they hand trim all their but now the strain that we're gonna be reviewing from this farm is the bloom of goo now the blue Mugu is an indica dominant hybrid it is a cross between your Williams wonder and your DJ short blue berry now your blue Lagoo has drawn its inspiration from the lovable blind mr. Magoo and it has also made a name for itself for relief in the painful intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma and it's also highly sought after in the medical community for anxiety PTSD stress and pain so with all that being said I can't wait to see what this strain has to offer and I know you can either [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hey guys welcome back to the review portion of our segment oh yes well we're gonna crash through the four basic food groups of our review the smell look taste and overall high now for starters with your smell I gave it 5 stars your smell profile was sweet berry and earthy now for your look I gave it four and a half stars it had a little purple to it it had some trichomes inside and out and it was very dense now for your taste I gave it four stars your flavor profile was a dominant sweetness and then a subtle earthiness now for your overall high I gave it four stars it was very emotionally uplifting very social it was physically relaxing there was some subtle mental daydreaming effect to it and my recommendation would be anything with some low activity like movies camping or you know any social event I'm gypsy [ __ ] and I'm signing out", "Nts9hwd43zo": "yo what's good youtube it's cosmos and today i'm coming at you guys with another terp review we've got some altered alchemy live resins right here that i just picked up for saturday got five g's five different flavors these are new ones by altered each of them um cost me 17 a g normally 15 a g on saturday sale so i'm gonna go ahead and show you guys these and then we're gonna try them out um one by one and i'll tell you guys how they each are and how they rank and whatnot which ones are worth it or not so uh let's start it off with this blueberry cheesecake we got total cannabinoids at 70 if you guys don't know um altered alchemy altered alchemy is a brand of budget line in oregon there's some crc product which is color remediation it's not like the best product in the world but honestly a good crc for right around 15 a gram is a great deal in my mind and i'll dab these all day so yeah we got some raspberry shortcake here so we got the blueberry cheesecake and this raspberry shortcake now let me give you guys a smell of them too so normally i like to mix them around before i get a good good smell but i'll just do um a smell before mixing them around just to tell you guys how they smell yeah i'm not gonna lie um this uh this raspberry shortcake it just smells like crc you know just that bland crc smell that kind of it kind of has like slightly like lemon cleaner smell to it but it really is just kind of a little bit a little bit bland i think would be the best way to explain it this blueberry cheesecake has a little bit different consistency than the rest of them it's a little bit more battery almost and the smell um it has like an interesting smell kind of like a i want to say stale but it's not like as much crc smell as that raspberry shortcake but it still has just kind of like a almost like an older smell not like in a really bad way but not in a great way either we're gonna move on to this blue magoo right here the ground that i wanted yeah zena really wanted this blue magoo which i've had blue magoon before that was awesome so it doesn't really want to focus but here we go okay let me smell this yeah this one just smells just straight like crc man just give that a whiff doesn't smell bad to me though it's not it's not a terrible smell but it is quite uh just straight crc it doesn't have doesn't have much of like an authentic terpene smell behind it now we're moving on to this lemon cush right here my shorts are running short so they're not very yeah so this one even though it does have like a main general smell of crc it has really nice undertones that are citrusy that are beyond the crc um just beyond the general crc it just has a lemon a lemon smell that bites your nose that's not that crc lemon smell yep and last but not least the trunk funk which uh the homie at the dyspo said that this one was their best seller so far when i smelled it the first time i instantly knew why if this one just has the most authentic terpene smell from all of them you can tell that the terps are intact from the original plant here at least some of them it's too bad it's not a little easier to smell things because if you would have been able to smell things a little better um you would have done that yeah i keep my mask on at the dispose so i don't smell anything i just look at them um so i don't know it's cool though it's five different strains it'll be it'll be cool to get five different uh five different little flavor tests so let's start it off with a dab here of i'll just do them in order we'll start with the blueberry cheesecake and uh in the water oh in the order that i showed them oh okay gotcha so yeah gonna heat it up then we'll come at you with the dab so about to go in on this blueberry cheesecake and i wanted to mix it around shit's crazy actually smells like blueberries now so maybe it was just because i didn't mix it before smells pretty good it should be a good time excuse everyone okay my throat ready for this dab the the pre dab cough you know if you cough before you take a dab then you'll be less likely to take a cough after you take the dab that's not true it's not super harsh no i just accidentally cut my tongue on my retainer oh ow okay so yeah i like the flavor on that one was pretty good it was maybe definitely better than it smelled yeah better than it smelled at first um the flavor once you mixed it it definitely had more of a flavor than it's not like blueberries i thought it smelled good yeah yeah yeah definitely satisfied with that for 15 g for 15 a g it's a good deal um i'm curious to see if these other ones are going to be smoother than that one because that one was it's a little harsh yeah i was gonna say it wasn't like crazy harsh but um it wasn't these are less harsh than like the mango grasses though than the other ones okay so zenith when she says mango grass or whatever seriously referring to these emeralds here we recently scooped up some sour tangy and some mango grass for 13. um for 13 injury which is a great deal they're not crc they're non-crc and for the deal they're a great deal they are they're honestly not that bad for what they are for what they are they're really good i feel like foreign yeah and these ones definitely i'd say a little bit smoother for sure i think a little bit tastier too to be honest with you maybe yeah yeah that the um i feel like the sour tangy that we had out last night that we took a couple of dabs of was really flavorful i like the sour tangy a little better than mango i thought at first but i'm not exactly i'm not 100 sure yeah i'm with you i am with you babe so you ready for another dab i'm gonna try out this uh strawberry shortcake oh [ __ ] we're gonna take this down right now yeah why not right okay let's do it i gotta drink some water give me yeah yeah you're good you're good i gotta i gotta heat it up anywho and i'm just finishing keep dipping you're good you're good now this one the raspberry uh shortcake right here oh hello there we go it's quite bunched up let's give it a let's break it up and see if we can get a better smell out of this i don't know it doesn't seem like there's like tertina there's not really like terps hidden in this one it's just kind of bricked up here it's going to slush out but let's see we'll give it a mix-a-roundy see if we get more terps out of this it's very um it's kind of like a wet sugar just a lightly wet sugar interesting interesting it definitely smells differently still smells like crc um yeah okay nice okay i do i think i like that a little bit better so we're gonna heat this up now um then we're gonna come back once we're heated up take this of uh strawberry shortcake yeah see you in a sec all right so we gave it the mix around i already smelted it does that smell it okay which one is this one uh the strawberry shortcake oh i think it smells better i'd say it smells slightly better but it still smells like seriously but we'll see how it tastes it's it's still the overwhelmingly crc smell for me yeah like yeah i understand like it doesn't have its own distinct smell compared to just crc and like being like dabs um but yeah okay yeah it has a little bit more of a flavor than it does a smell that one's smooth smooth like it's like almost creamy do you know what i'm saying like it like coats your throat almost like not really but it does like it's creamy almost interesting like yeah i'm not sure if creamy's the way yo zen and i just took a dab and my phone storage was full so none of it just got recorded i thought it was really good like i felt like it was a really good critique too it was a really good uh we gave good feedback lots of amazing jokes i feel like my face was way too close to the camera so that was the blueberry uh shortcake and because of this um now snuggles i think that i'll have to heat up another dab right now we're gonna space out this review space we're gonna space out this review um throughout the day for dabs we're just gonna take two right now but i guess i'm gonna take a third dab because i didn't get the review on the second one so i'm gonna heat it up and then we'll go in or maybe just me all right so i gave this strawberry shortcake a little mix-a-roni here and it actually has a little bit more of a smell but it's not really distinctive from the crc smell so i'd say overall it has that crc smell to it for sure but it smells a little bit better than it did before i mixed it up so yeah send it on this damn cheers so yeah i'm gonna have to uphold my uh my review from the first app that i took of this one the number one thing that i would say if i had to just say one word that came to my mind from this one smooth is incredibly smooth smooth on the palate pretty damn smooth on the throat it tastes nice very very very mellow mellow flavor zena said it was almost creamy to her it's a light fruity flavor maybe strawberry 100 sure you really don't get too much of the fruity terps but it's just so so light you really just get mostly just smoothness with just a tiny hint of some fruit flavor overall for 15 a g would buy it again probably would buy a gram or two more um i wouldn't dab it like every day all day because it's really not it's not crazy crazy flavorful or anything but um it's smooth it's smooth as [ __ ] that's uh that was a nice dab [ __ ] it we'll catch you guys on the next step yo what's good it's sunday morning now and uh we're gonna finish this turkey view with the last three strains i was gonna record it throughout the day but we're streaming on twitch and it just that it didn't feel like the right time yeah we were i was gonna bring it up but we were chilling yeah we were chilling it worked out going down for the first one did we already heat it up no we didn't eat it yeah okay i'm about to heat it up just want to show the show straight and get a little smell it has like a a slight undertone of some uh of someone how do you say authentic terps and then it just smells mostly a seriously so we'll see how it tastes i'm gonna heat it up catch you in a sec all right so i mixed the bloom with goo around and you get the slight the slight smell of the blue magoo underneath the crc but it doesn't look like seriously cheers everyone it's definitely not bad though we just spent like all last week smoking 13 edgy non-crc stuff and i think i prefer this that blue magoo is nice um it's nothing to write home about it does taste mostly like crc there's that tiny undertone of the blue magoo taste that you get for 15 a g it's not a bad deal but um i wouldn't recommend it out of these five grams i wouldn't recommend this one necessarily or that that blueberry um cheesecake i think was the other one uh those two so far not as much not as much let's try these last two here we got trunk funk and lemon kush coming up um let's see we'll go with the lemon kush for this next one which definitely has a little bit more of a smell especially than the last couple that we've tried distinctive from the crc smell that is i'm gonna q-tip it and heat it up and we'll catch you guys on the next step we got some lemon kush right here going down for this one cheers everyone should we go on the temp oh [ __ ] we are definitely good on the top i just went and uh checked on our cats so we uh both ran on back for this dab yeah that lemon has a way better flavor has a distinct sweet lemon terp that's different from the crc turkey that tastes like lemon i was gonna say the same thing that tastes a little bit more like lemon to me it's a little harsher though i feel like the blooming was a little smoother interesting okay the blue magoo was pretty damn smooth i think the two that we tried yesterday might have been even smoother than the blue magoo i agree that's why they're called cheesecakes yeah yeah yeah but the maybe not the blueberry cheesecake the blue or cheesecake i remember being pretty raw yeah you're right compared to the raspberry the raspberry was way better the raspberry shortcake yeah yeah take a second off anyways all right y'all so my uh phone ran out of storage again i need to just clear out my whole phones in here we got the trunk funk going down i'm saying this one has a really nice smell definitely like nicely funky um as you'd expect from trunk funk cheers sorry i kind of stole the phone light to take silly cuz i was like oh that's not that bad right now [Music] yeah i don't think i plan on taking part of the third bath well you did really completely spaced so trunk funk i would say um out of all of them that was kind of a smaller dab so there wasn't like a crazy amount of flavor but i think that that one in the lemon kush had the two most distinctive non-crc flavors out of the batch that being said the lemon kush might have been a tiny bit harsher i think the trunk funk is great smooth the blue magoo's pretty smooth tastes pretty much like crc the blueberry cheesecake is solid um but not not amazing so i'd say pass on the blueberry cheesecake pass on the blue magoo i'm really sorry cheesecake yep scoop yourself up some raspberry cheesecake some lemon kush and some trunk funk and just double down on those three and you'll be happy you'll be super happy overall though at 15 and g bro like all of these are very fine for 15 and g altered stays slaying it and uh these are awesome honestly these are great so yeah yeah 15 a g not a bad deal yeah i'd say i'm happy with all of them overall you know it's cool to have some different strains but now we know uh the three that are our favorite just wanted to relay that on to all of you guys just in case you're looking to go outside yeah you're curious and it's hard to smell through your mask so yeah not that you shouldn't wear a mask for your mask um but it's hard to smell so we couldn't really tell exactly what was really good until you tasted it and brought it home right so yeah it's good to make reviews like these so appreciate all the love everyone yeah let's see it's like 1 30 right now i'm gonna be live over on my twitch today at uh i don't know if you need to say that on your youtube video do you yeah because i'm going to upload it so i want to let people know that they can come and catch me live on the twitch what if they see it tomorrow then the funny because they'll probably still be live yep truth i'm live most days at 4 20 p.m pacific standard time on my twitch sometimes i'm live a little

social media down below our instagrams our twitch and all that shenanigans then it goes live on twitch every once in a while but um it's a little more rare than my streams i i try to go live every day so i don't have to say that i'm [ __ ] yeah we'll catch you guys over on my twitch later today for a nice session", "EF-9I38ud4s": "it's cookie season y'all that time of year where you're making a whole lot of cookies around the holiday season is there anything more iconic than Turkey's we're gonna give you our tasty tested sugar cookie recipe complete with everything you need to have some darn good sugar cookies this holiday season [Music] all right so let's get started so we're gonna make our dough first Bruni's room-temperature softened butter listen that is not melted butter melted butter is not the same and we go you want a really pale color so that's why we're using white sugar here and this is a secret ingredient I know it doesn't look like cream cheese but it is cream cheese and this is gonna give us a little bit of like a savory flavor and a little bit of tangy anus as well what we're trying to do is cream the sugar and the butter together so if you're feeling a lot of granules when you take your finger in there that's not good we're trying to kind of almost dissolve the sugar and the butter so we're gonna whip these together for about five minutes they're gonna be much paler in color when we're done it's gonna be much fluffier so like you'll see a vision will change that's just whipping in air to that butter and sugar and then don't forget scrape down your bowl to make sure that you are incorporating all the ingredients equally so now you can see we've got a really great creamed butter and sugar we're good to go at this point we're gonna add one egg two egg yolks and our second secret ingredient is a combo of extracts I think like vanilla is pretty common in movies but we are gonna add a little bit of almond extract as well a little bit goes a long way it's a pretty powerful flavor but it really adds something extra to these sugar cookies and it's really delicious like you're gonna taste a difference and to that we just want to make sure that all that liquid is well incorporated into the butter and sugar so once we have the liquids well incorporated we're gonna add a little bit of kosher salt here again not to make it salty just to be a flavor enhancer and balance out that sweet and so now we've got that in there we're gonna add our all-purpose flour an X goes in a little bit of baking powder this ingredient is our third little secret ingredient for this recipe cream of tartar cream of tartar is actually what's left over and the barrel after wine making and it's basically like just an acidic ingredient you're adding this and this is gonna help with a few things but didn't give us like a really cool texture in the end and it's also gonna prevent the cookies from browning too much so I'm gonna fold in just to get it started because there's a lot of flour in here I don't want to make a huge mess so I'm gonna fold to get it started finish incorporating it with the beaters because it is a pretty dense mixture there's a little bit of Flowery bits that aren't fully incorporated that's fine again to have like a really flaky and snappy cookie you don't want to overwork this mixture so you're kind of like just incorporating the flour you don't want to go much more than that this dough is almost kind of similar to like a pastry where you want to keep it cold all the time there's a lot of butter in here so if it gets too greasy it's gonna be really really hard to work with and you're not gonna have really clear defined shapes dough goes on in some cling film and then you can use the cling film to kind of like pull the pieces together it's just kind of sticky so this is a really easy way to not make a huge massive so this is gonna go into the fridge and then we will roll it out in about two hours here are a few things we might need for rolling out your cookies you need a rolling pin or a wine bottle whatever you have at your house and then something to measure that thickness with a ruler or our fourth little trick of this video which we'll get to later if you are making a lot of cookies or you're like an avid Baker they do have these like kind of cool rubber rolling pin thingies I don't know you call them like a rolling pin Stoppers guards maybe it really makes sure that you get like that perfect quarter-inch but you have to have like the perfect sized rolling pins and you have to buy them their specialty so we're going to show you a hack so the enemy of rolling out anything is sticking to the surface that you're working on so have a little bit of flour nearby as you remember we want to keep our dough super cold so I'm gonna work in batches I'm going to put half of this back in the fridge and only roll out half at a time all right so this is the trick that we learned in culinary school you really want an even quarter-inch all throughout to get the most even thickness you want to press down in your gel like this and it just kind of spreads it before you want to get into rolling every so often you wanted like a quarter turn and that's going to help make sure that you have an even roll as well as to ensure that it's not sticking to the surface this isn't like pie crust where you really have to be careful about the shape that you're making or whatever this is just kind of a free-for-all some to a good place I'm not really sure how thick mine is so how do I measure this you could use a ruler your not so annoying about this ruler it's like why does the zero start so far up the ruler it's not so annoying but how else can you measure bottlecaps I was looking all over the kitchen for something else that's 1/4 inch I like to lay these around the dough while I'm rolling out just to make sure that all sides are that perfect quarter inch the other thing too is pour out that extra bench flour and that's what we're going to use to flour our cutters to make sure the cutters aren't sticking too much to the dough so dip the cutter all the way in flour dip off the excess and then go ahead and then just give it a little like Josh a little shimmy to make sure that you've totally made contact with the surface in the bottom and if you have enough cutters what I like to do is go ahead and put all the cutters down and leave them and not make sure that nothing's pulling or tugging and you get a really clean shape every time and now you can start pulling them out sometimes the cookie comes with the cutter and sometimes it doesn't so I like to kind of move around pull off the excess put it off to one side save that dough because you didn't use that again just be careful but you're not like pulling or tugging and everything because you really want the shape to be really clean and then look at that so you can definitely reuse these scraps what you want to do is get them back into like a cohesive dough ball and then put them back in the fridge they're really warm after all that rolling and working with them so get the cold one out of the fridge and put that one back in there for another like 20 minutes or so so they confirm back up and there we go if you have some shapes that are smaller than the other ones I would put those off to the side so that if you need to pull them early you can so that they don't over bake okay put these guys in the fridge you put them in the oven now they're gonna spread away too much they're not gonna have a clean shape they will come out super clean super crisp as you can tell they're still very pale and they haven't spread that much yay go ahead and take them off and let them cool completely on a drying rack time to decorate so we chose real icing because it sets a little bit harder if you're gonna be really crazy with decorating royal icing is definitely the way to go so despite its royal name a royal icing is pretty simple so all you really need is some sifted powdered sugar you might need a little bit of water a bit of salt an extract if you'd like it and egg what's the thing about this is that we will be consuming this so you really want to make sure that you're buying pasteurized egg whites so they're safe for everyone to enjoy or you can use meringue powder which is an egg white substitute we might need water it kind of depends on what we're going for but first we're gonna add salt and a little bit vanilla for flavor I'm gonna put this off to the side so all the liquids we're gonna put on one side of the powdered sugar and I'll show you why in a second make sure to shake those egg whites ahead of time and they go again making sure that they're on one side of the bowl and so now we're going to just work in that one part of the bowl and just slowly incorporate more on the powder sugar as I go that's gonna help make sure that I have a really smooth icing you're trying to incorporate all that powdered sugar at once it just look a little bit harder to work with and also you probably will get some lumps royal icing is all about consistency so depending on how you want to decorate yours it's kind of like two consistencies that you're going for there's a thicker consistency for more of like lining things out or like borders of things and then there's a flood which is gonna be just a thinned out version and that water is gonna come in handy when we're looking for that flood consistency so we're starting here with a thicker royal icing we're also gonna add coloring to this which will thin it out a little bit too so err on the side of thicker when you're getting started so we're gonna separate the icing into a few different bowls if you're gonna be doing a lot of decorating or using a lot of different colors it's probably worth it to double or even triple this recipe go ahead and put in your gel food colorings to get really really bright colors the thing that's cool about royal icing is it sets right so it'll set kind of hard even in this time what we're trying to get everything set up you can already see a little bit this kind of skin that forms on top so you do want to work a little bit quickly with royal icing or else cover it with cling film and then just to fix it just add a little bit of water and stir so now we can do one of two things with this flood consistency flooding or dipping let's go ahead and put the cookie dip it in the icing make sure it's really well coated knock off any excess and then couldn't kind of settle into the cookie and be a really smooth and even shape and then the flood what you got to do you want like a thicker frosting in a piping and then go ahead and just trace the outside with whatever color that you're doing and then you want to let this heart in that for a little bit before you go to the next step the ones it is hard all you need to do is take that thinned out icing and you can either spoon it in like I'm doing or you can also put it in a piping bag and pipe it in and then use the toothpick to spread it out evenly that bit that you piped in the beginning is dried so it kind of acts as like a wall or a border to ensure that all of that icing is staying inside if you're gonna put sprinkles on it go ahead and put the sprinkles on when it's wet but if you want to decorate over that go ahead and let that set for a good like 10 15 minutes or so and then you can continue decorating on top of it so it kinda pens what look you're going for and as you can see like these dots are kind of settling on top of it and not really falling into that flood and then if you want to decorate anymore or put any other like toppings on top of it you're gonna have to layer more icing on just to make sure that they stick there's like something magical about this baking cookies it's kind of like what gets you ready for the holidays right like you know it's the holiday season when it's time to bake the Chur cookies and it's time to decorate them and you know people really appreciate the time and effort that goes into like a home decorated cookie and like there's a little tea a professional no but that's not the point you know the point is that you took the time you did it you put in your love and care there's like no better way to bond with your friends and family then doing something tangible DIY and creative like this go make some send us your photos have you ever seen a cuter cookie cutter and oh my god I can't say that three times fast cuter Cuddy cooker i cute have you ever seen a cuter cookie cutter in your life I can it's so cute [Music]", "GzNHJN2XTEE": "hi YouTube recreational grower in my garden blue Magoo day 55 supposedly this is supposed to be ready any time soon he wasn't there the people that I got the blue Magoo from said that it was a 55-day plant and they never had theirs go past that I read a couple reports that say 55 to 60 days some grow reports I don't I'm not seeing it I'm flushing like crazy event flashing for almost a week now I'm gonna keep questioning for at least another week you know there's there's over 50% red hairs the trichomes are stacking on each other they are turning cloudy just a little bit but I still haven't gotten any blue coming out of her she's supposed to be blue Magoo and she's supposed to turn blue towards the end of her run so I'm just not seeing it so I'm gonna let it go for a couple more days again it is day 55 on the scrub here the Home Depot special in a 7 gallon pot of soil under the thousand watt high pressure sodium with the orchid broke them on the walls she's in the right environment so you know we've got her on a we had her on a regimented feeding schedule now it's just just pH water but yeah I'm gonna let her go another week so we're getting closer YouTube we will eventually have our trim report and our final wait for you here and in other news when we do sister here's on day 20 of flower on the Home Depot strog under the thousand watt high pressure sodium with the orchid grow film in a five gallon smart cut so I'm telling you I'm and I like the smart pots that I don't like them because it's just awkward um and I don't want to like that which is probably part of the reason but I mean looking at this bun road on this the Skog here they just leaps and bounds beyond what this one was at the same time and this one's turned out good again you know from my other videos you know I'm trying really hard to get that symmetrical or consistent to canopy and so on this next one the one I have here you'll see it's an angle and that's measured out from the light source my first attempt at a strong and I try to get it as equal as I could the second one here I've got kind of a concave going on the inside is lower than the outside the outside has raised up a little bit although I have the one footlong thousand watt high pressure sodium I'm hoping that will help out a little bit but right now I have to blame all of this the size of the bud growth since its had the exact same feeding schedule as the bloom of you number one to the day to the dosing the only thing that I can say that increase the bud size of the stage is the hair power of the smart pot so dam use smart pot I don't want to like you you're just awkward to water I don't feel like you're consistently watering throughout the pot but you're showing some really good results but yes there's my update for plants on the property measure 91 or again recreational marijuana here's my poor plants I got a couple others right there on the right which are just they were flowered from two weeks of badge but here we are we're getting close I will have an update last week when I cut this thing down and YouTube I think I think you should see me do that so thinking YouTube like its subscribe comment and we'll be back in a week", "U9pF2WhhRzg": "all right so I started supplementing co2 today I know if you've been watching some of my previous videos I hadn't been supplementing co2 because I put a Malibu compost layer down before planting and we're getting a lot of co2 exchange coming from the soil and it was doubling and tripling the ambient co2 levels are doubling the ambient co2 levels in the room and the past week or so they started to dip below ambient and into the 100's for parts per million and that's just not enough co2 for regular photosynthesis right like for the whole process to happen so we filled up the 50-pounder and we're rockin so let's go in and see how things are looking right now I'm just got it set at around 800 parts per million I'll ramp it up to maybe 950 or a thousand but I'd like to keep it kind of low at this at this rate because it's above ambient and I'd go through the co2 a lot less and I also find and I don't know if there's any HVAC guys out there that might have some input on this but I find that when I've got the co2 running it like 1500 parts per million that the mini split becomes less effective and I don't know if that has something to do with the co2 being in the air or any of that so if any HVAC guys that are watching have any input on whether high co2 levels will actually affect if will make the effectiveness of your mini splits or your air conditioner units less effective I guess right you can see the light came on it's dosing out doling out the co2 as it falls below my preset level and then it'll kick off the other beauty of the eye ponic so anyway let's going sorry about the noise I got my humidifier going hopefully it'll kick off in a minute let me shut the door so we can hear that happens alright so I can't remember what day in Flour I am and I'm really sorry for that I'll have to look back I know that these things are just exploding the blue Magoo's have just taken off very happy with this fino I got it's like we're gonna have lots of lots of heavy stacks attract development just coming on really well and oh come on and as with everything else in these beds it just keeps getting better and better and I'm really happy with the amending that I've done the blue maps are doing great the lots of stuff happening in the soil take a look [Music] and the worms that I got they tend to stay really big dark quick so if I've looked if I've looked in one location or if it's too dry which I think that I run I run my beds probably a little drier than I should then I should be once I get into flower I get really kind of nervous about having too much moisture in the beds so I run on the side of caution and just run them a little dry and I think that that pushes my warms deeper but anyway when all is well up here I don't really stress too much you know I'll occasionally go down to the soil and and poke around and make sure everything's good but for the most part I leave the moisture up to the bloom at sky trust them so anyhow I think we've got a good thing going and I'm very excited to see how things are gonna look here in the next couple weeks now that I've got co2 supplemented we should see some rapid growth and some fat flower sets this is the the random miss pick or whatever when the guy I got the clones from threw this one in and he might have thought it was a blue Magoo but it's it's stacking really nice flower but it has no aroma whatsoever as of yet no smell even with the trikes I mean just no smell really bizarre whereas the exact opposite with these blue Magoo's even in their vegetable smelled beautifully like a fresh berries and right now it's like berry and cotton candy I mean it cotton candies what I keep getting when i smelling it it's so [ __ ] sweet so anyway as you can see the i'm not really pulling them out and staking them or doing any kind of low stress training or any of that I'm just letting it go au naturale and I would and I'm just gonna see what I get yield wise if there there's been a lot of concern from people when I took the trellises off that it was going to affect the yields the plants really are filling in these the spots this was that dud runt kind of plant that I just let go and it's doing okay it'll probably just be fresh frozen or something or dry it heart you know grow it out and dry sifted or something but everything else the beds have really seemed to do a pretty good job at filling in I have put a few steaks and pulled things into the steaks to try to to try to fill in some of those gaps but I'm really not stressing or worried about it at all one thing I am doing different I had a Gavita go out on me in the past little bit and it's I'm waiting to get back from from the cellar so we can get it returned so in the meantime because I was started flowering these solo I'm actually running the other seven kavita's at 1,000 and this is the first time I've run them at those because I've typically been running them at 8:25 and that's usually because I start flowering way too late and the and the buds are too high so now that I've flowered the plants at a reasonable height that can actually utilize the 1000 watt setting I could probably even utilize the 1100 watt setting but I I don't want to push my luck things are really nice in here the environment is on lock then the plants are reciprocating the love and I don't want to rock the boat so so any hoe as always I'm ever on the lookout for p.m. and all the other things that we are looking for because I've pretty much stopped the hi p.m. spraying a couple weeks ago so now we're just kind of I'm at the mercy of the plant health right and so far so good everything's looking just fantastic and I'm really really just in love with this no-till way of cultivating and I really like the interest that people are having in it because they see it this can be done with minimal effort as long as you've provided the appropriate inputs and have a basic understanding of the biology and what's going on you'll knock it out of the park every time and it's not really you knocking it out of the park it's Mother Nature knocking out of the park and it's you facilitating it so once again I'll drive that home we are facilitators and cultivators right we're facilitating this sacred union and the reward is this I can't I can't say enough about it this is the fourth cycle four cycles almost a year of the same the same beds amended once in that one-year period one time so now there's no sign of nutrient lock out none of that I don't want to sound like I'm tuning my horn but it's not my horn I'm Tooting some other nature's and I'm just shouting the call out to everybody that there's an easier better way to do things anywho and I think the next order of business is putting this Arctic insulation against the this wall and getting rid of that janky-ass [ __ ] band of plastic just looks terrible I'm always self-conscious that when I shoot the videos so there it is like the seedy underbelly are texting and the [ __ ] weird doors that I've just kind of stored in here I don't know there it is the goods and the bads all right guys hey thanks for sticking it sticking it out with me and I really appreciate everybody's encouragement and keep hitting me up with the questions peace and love", "WkA2ul4OXd4": "good morning YouTube it's Saturday morning it's December 7th it's freezing cold outside there's a little bit of snow falling down and I'm home alone with my son and I thought what what better than do a little bit baking in the kitchen we're going to make some sugar cookies today everybody loves sugar cookies I want to do a little twist on it though I bought some Christmas sprinkles at the grocery store and a little bit of some food coloring and I thought we kind of just make it a little bit more fun for the kids I find a lot of times colors and textures are very important to actually give him to eat stuff not that we're necessarily trying to to force sugar on them but anyways we're going to go through it here we're going to do a basic sugar cooker sugar cookie recipe I'm going to divide the batter in half add food coloring to wanted to make it blue we're going to spiral it together and then we're going to wrap it with our Christmas sprinkles and we'll do our slice cookies my son was here I think he's going to come back and participate I hope but anyway it's it's Saturday morning fun so let's jump right into it I'm going to take you through it here we go so we've got three cups of flour this is just a basic sugar cookie recipe okay three cups of flour one and a half cups of white sugar I've got 1 cup of butter I've got 1 teaspoon of baking powder 1/2 a teaspoon of salt 2 eggs and 2 teaspoons of vanilla so pretty simple recipe I've got the oven set right now at 350 degrees and the concept behind this is creaming okay I don't know how much should baking experience you have but it's pretty simple stuff add your eggs and your butter to your sugar and you're going to cream it all together add your dry ingredients to your flour once the two bowls have everything mixed into it you mix the boat together and you're done so it's pretty simple I'm going to cream it together and I'll come back to share here we go sugar get the flour in the road I'm going to take my sugar I'm going to add my two eggs to it pretty simple stuff number one let me just get somewhere to put shows hey dinar you're going to participate are you going to take off on us yeah I says I got to be and be new or Bubble Guppies on the TV so I'm out add the eggs okay pretty simple stuff I'm just going to mix them in make sure the eggs the yolks are broken so right away you can see it turns all the sugar into almost a liquid just like that oh okay pretty simple simple stuff take my butter same thing its softened butter okay you do not want to try to do this with something that you just took out of the fridge it's going to be an absolute nightmare for you there's no reason that you can't cheat take something out of the fridge put it in the microwave for 30 seconds just make sure that it doesn't you don't want the melt you know there's a difference sometimes when you bake cookies okay say your wife or your mother or whoever baked some chocolate chip cookies and you see on the bottom layer of those cookies there's this really thin brown crust and it's very crunchy that's because they used melted butter and when it settles on your pan the melted butter will actually separate and go down to the bottom of the cookie and it burns along the bottom whereas when you use the melted butter it's more incorporated and it'll actually cook through the cookie better so there's a little tip for you there okay sugar butter and eggs where's my wet ingredients okay I got two teaspoons of vanilla I want to add to this as well remember teaspoons and tablespoons are different do not mix them up vanilla one vanilla two the vanilla just going to add a little extra sweetness not that the sugar you put in there isn't going to do it on its own and then we're just going to mix it around pretty straight up stuff okay so that's our cream mixture done right there let's go dry mixture flour okay don't want a teaspoon not tablespoon baking powder boom simple simple simple we're going to do a half a teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of salt I will write the recipe be careful when you're doing salt last thing you want to do is add too much I will write the recipe for this in the description thing below so if you're not calling along and you want to just check that out after you can that's pretty it that's pretty simple right there now you want to mix this up ahead of time okay mix your flour your salt mix it all in your baking powder before you cream it in the other mixture because you don't want to have that just clumped in one session what's up my dude February what it is make everybody you gonna help no ok so we got them together and I'm gonna come back okay next step pretty simple stuff go to a bigger bowl if you use two small ones to start with like I did flour no sugar check cream mixture this is the easiest easiest easiest recipe to do but it's a lot of fun especially for the kids when they want to stay up just fade and now all we're going to do is we're just going to mix this until it's fully incorporated and it turns into a nice smooth surface so it's going to take me compliments and mixing I'll come my seasons they're going to incorporate their it's starting to turn into a cookie dough okay so as you can see I've now turned it into a dough i you got to add a little bit of water sometimes like if it's not coming together properly just sprinkle a little bit of water on it hidden what's your deal dude you want to participate in the movie or not oh haha a little dude here hello are we making cookies cookies this is what it's all about folks it's all about kids and he's gonna love this even though he doesn't want to participate in the hard part which is making it he's gonna love it when they're done aren't you okay let's go back next thing we're going to want to do and I'm gonna use my hands kind of guy we're just gonna take it and you want to separate it okay two halves you're going to try to make them as equal as you can so in one bowl we're going to have our regular white section of the cookie okay straight up in the next bowl we're going to have our food coloring stuff so I want to spread it out a little bit you can use as much food color as you want the tricky tricky part of this is food color is not super fun to have on your hands and I don't have any gloves so I'm just going to make do with the SU sandwich bags they'll do the trick and then keep your hands clean from the blue so I'm just going to add you know enough to make it a blue like this isn't rocket science here this is cookie making so you just want to put enough food coloring in and again ideally gloves would be fun or the way to go here but we make do with what we have to do and then I'm just going to incorporate it all together so give me a few minutes and I'll come back when stuff so there you go blue and the regular color the white one so this here took a little bit of mixing I did have to use my hands a little bit the gloves didn't really necessarily work out but it is what it is you've got the blue color you've got the white color so now our next step is going to be the flower of this surface we're going to roll out the two sheets and then the idea is put down this sheet put down this sheet and then roll it up so I'll come back once I get it floured and rolled okay as you can see I've rolled out the first one I don't think I need to show you that flour dough roll it add a little bit of flour at the top so it doesn't stick very very simple stuff so I didn't bother to put that in and then it shouldn't stick I mean it might a little tiny bit but nothing crazy so that's the first one and now all I'm going to do is the same procedure with the blue as you can see I've got the blue one rolled out and I've got our white one rolled out you want them to be relatively the same thickness which we've got going on here and relatively the same size the other side one can be a little bit bigger than the inside one and now we're going to put the choice there's different ways to go about this I'm going to treat it like a pie crust okay I know I can't get the whole shot in on the video here but we're going to fold my cookie in half the one with the no food coloring is the more brittle of the two okay fold it in half so that I can pick it up this is the hardest part of the whole cookie recipe okay pick it up as quick as you can get it on top okay again this is the hardest part oh she's breaking a little bit on me here just remember to this is going to be hidden inside so it doesn't have to be perfectly pretty but you do want it to be halfway good looking not look all haggard not that the kids are going to care anyway all they hear is that they're getting some cookies there we go so we've got our one color on the inside one color on the outside a little bit Haggart I'm going to come back after I get low like you probably get a better shot right here so I've got them in between now I don't you don't have to patch it all up and make it look pretty I mean this is going to get rolled I think that that's just fine like that I could have done a better job flipping it in but it is what it is okay now the concept behind this is that we're going to roll it so just give me two seconds and I'll come back okay here we go so now this is going to be the same concept as cinnamon biscuits I'm sure everybody's made cinnamon biscuits before all we're going to do is we're just going to roll it okay so once you get your lip started it's going to be pretty easy there we go and I'm just going to roll along same concept to cinnamon buns rolling it up you don't want to tear it you want the nice blue color on the outside rolling it up look at that that right there it's perfect we didn't write perfect okay it's adjust the camera so you get a better shot over that is your cookie roll the start of it and all we're going to do just like swimming biscuits I'm going to cut off one end I'm going to cut off the other end and let's give you a shot right here so that you can see that's what we're looking for right there okay give me a minute knock okay now it's the fun part so as you can see I've got a layer of saran wrap on the bottom as with all the movie camera a little bit as with all sugar cookies you're going to need to put this in the freezer or the fridge I'm going to go fridge for an hour so we need to wrap it up nice and tight but first we got to make a Christmassy right so I've got my Christmas sprinkles if you let it sit for a minute - after you're rolling it it'll stiffen and it makes it easier to work with so all we're going to do is we're going to put our sprinkles in here and we're going to try to get them to stay now as I wrap it up and I squeeze it in it's going to work better for me right so I put my sprinkles in and then when I roll it I'm going to squish my sprinkles all into it so I'll have it back once I get a little bit of trouble getting the sprinkles to stick so the secret to everything butter okay let's take some butter let's give it just a light brush when I'm trying to saturate anything cookies already have butter in it anyway and another recipes that I've done you put butter on something and it's stiff so let's try that now hopefully this is gonna work out better for us there you go everything's trial-and-error right I mean I haven't really done the Christmas sprinkle cookies Oh at all so this is a first for me but that goes to show you right there you know a little bit of this and that goes a long way butter it all out to a nice happy place that we can get them all stick and she gonna look great Christmas Eve I'll come back to that I got her done you can see I made a colossal mess with the sprinkles but I got saran wrap underneath it and again the concept is that we're going to wrap it nice and tight right so wrap the saran wrap over once push it down and then I'm going to just roll it up you want it all to stay nice and packed inside take your end if you can twist it you can do whatever the heck you want to it loop it over the top same with this end here loop it over the top now I'm actually gonna do one more layer just tie right on second wrap back you can see it looks really really really good like obviously we had a little bit of trial and error with the sprinkle part but that looks very Christmassy very sharp so all I'm going to do is same thing I did the first time this time I'm just going to do it a little bit tighter okay there it is perfect that is our Christmas tree sugar cookie load so I'm just going to put this in the fridge for an hour and then we'll come back and you can also squeeze it out a little bit too like if you want to if it's not even when you had it rolled out on the ground you can give it a little squeeze like this it's going to firm it all up on the inside and make sure that all your layers are nice and packed together I'm going to put this in the fridge for an hour 1 hour time frame has passed so now it's on to our next step this has been refrigerated we're good to go need some pan spray nothing really complicated two different sprays so they don't stick boom done now we're going to unwrap them you still going to be gentle I mean they've been in the fridge for a bit and it has stiffened up but you still do need to be gentle and I'm sure we're going to make a mess with these sprinkles everywhere so we'll just unwrap saran wrap like so I'm going to take one out so that we're not fighting with it I've already got sprinkles coming out I tell you that's where the big mess is man is the sprinkles so all I'm going to do is I'm going to roll it and it's the same concept like I said as a cinnamon biscuit let's just get it unrolled here there you go ok so all I want to do is I want to cut cookies smell take the first one right off look at that this is what I mean about you had to squish it a little bit just to give it the right - to smash it all together so you don't have any lines in the middle where there's gaps look at that these are going to be so good you get quite a few cookies out of this recipe I've got the oven going at 350 degrees behind me don't cut them too thick okay and leave some space in between them so they can expand as they cooked I think they look wonderful the kids are gonna absolutely love them you know it's just a fun little holiday cookie to make especially on a nice Saturday morning so I'll come back once these are all baked up for you but you can see plain as day pretty neat little pretty neat little rig so sooner Baker's a pretty shot shot of them we got two trays ready to go in the oven and here we go okay so we've got them in the oven I just put them in we're going to put it in there at 350 degrees for eight minutes and there you have it folks sugar cookies it's got the spiral inside it's got all of our little frog Christmas sprinkles on the outside I think the kids are going to love it let it cool for a little bit and rock and roll thanks a lot for watching please subscribe to my channel", "e6Vr0R7Ag68":

speaking of fresh cups you shout out to all of you who Kaiser would make this all possible it's me coming back every week it's making sure that you guys get to know are they selling us good weed or they selling us some [ __ ] that's dried up harsh burn your palate and completely destroy the experience that you were expecting when you bought this cannabis that had this great write-up came in this beautiful package it looks so nice and then you touch it cool like magic you trust it dust and now you've lost all the Terps all the flavors gone you're out 55 bucks doesn't sound fair to me what's the fire this let's see what you do my nose is on fire this is hot I try to grab some kind of flavor profile that might exist there's not much it's all kind of been decorated by this heat that's going on from this canvas that I don't believe you're so adorable my passion is to assist life as a weird tasting this coffee right there I like my weed like I like my coffee strong flavorful this right here not so flavorful that Kaos cooks it was strong it has some power was a flavorful is the smoking experience what I expected it wasn't starting to find out that you get some lower grade strains 2018 and the flavors because the Turks are in the one and a half it's a higher percentage range what a smoking experience but this stuff right here it's not that great it's not very enjoyable I really wish it was I've had a bad run maybe you got to experience a little bit of bad and I'll come some really good it's a learning curve this thing here Massachusetts is brand new everybody in this game it's just getting a game correct they're learning it's about to learn to weave and learning to get this [ __ ] done correctly with the help of all of us in the cannabis a little bit of outreach a little bit of conversation about possibly entering the volvulus and booze packs into all of your package and going out to your consumers to make sure their experience there's nothing but the best that's all that's gonna provide but my opinion I'm gonna keep burning this this right here was only 40 bucks burn 240 lat eight down to the ground see what I do there is no flavor of that experience is gone I'm just smoking weed right now and this kind of money you", "2WUs7vHwuLg": "hey guys welcome back its apex yeah I'm finally feeling better let's go Pineapple Express I got two G's of this um

roast them ahead of time is gonna make our mash beautiful so I'm gonna make it look like this art we're gonna blend the cauliflower with cream cheese and ye and then chop the brussel sprouts to put it on top and this is what I call kid-approved food this is actually what I call picky eater approved food because here's the raise your hand if when growing up mama used to boil them brussel sprouts or steamed them for an hour because when you do that they let off certain gases like sulfur and it makes the whole house smell like Oh Oh wet fart no no no good we don't do that we roast them at a high temperature I actually have my oven at 425 which I'll turn off now because when you roast cauliflower and you roast Brussels sprouts magic happens right they get nutty and roasty on the outside and creamy on the inside oh we don't make it that far maybe in the house Maggi thieves in the house you've got a super check from John we already 1990 every time you get a super chet art ghost like this so I know and it blinks like that we also use this on the camera rig in the grocery store to let me know the time frame of the video so art I'm gonna give that and you not only did John Welsh keep

thrive market for up to thirty percent cheaper we're talking keto paleo gluten free dairy free we're talking pasture raised pork grass-fed beef organic chicken it's pasture is but they don't call it

Utah Chris you like how is the house come to going Farrell the house ends on hold we're waiting to begin our taxes back and we're really picky right I'm 42 I want the perfect house so what we're decided we're gonna do and I guess we talked about this a couple weeks ago is we're not gonna find a prebuilt outdoor house or a new construction house that fits our needs so we want to find the house that we love the bones right and then Rehab it especially the kitchen I want a kitchen literally four to five times bigger than this with certain specs no one's gonna build that unless we build it ourselves so wish us luck with that and then we'll see how it goes so here's what I want everything to look like check it out art we're taking boneless skinless chicken thighs because they rock and have so much moisture we're gonna wrap them in prosciutto and sage dip them in seasoned almond flour pan fry man avocado oil serve it with the mash with the Brussels sprouts and in the book you can see this one is a meal prep it's egg free actually it shouldn't be paleo - I wonder why I didn't like that and then macros I mean look at this you blew it our serving of chicken one gram of net carb per serving a mash 6.6 that's what you want to see right real fan reviews awesome stuff so let's get rockin and rollin I'm gonna slowly preheat my nonstick pan back here we have 651 people watching right now okay we have 600 Amira's in the house the ophthalmologists from the Bronx hey like share everywhere on farmers only on Christian mingle tinder Facebook Hindi Lux bumble all those things hey guys I'm starting with boneless skinless chicken thighs all right why did we like chicken thighs and not chicken breasts because they're vastly superior they're vastly superior actually they rule like oh do we all enjoy that all duals oh yes right I mean here's the deal like chicken breasts are fine and all but they have no fat they're overcooked very easily you have some leeway with chicken thighs so if you overcook it a little bit it ain't matter so a little bit of salt go down a little bit of pepper on both sides the Doyle rules is going over quite well by the way I did good do you guys like my flub where's like the Sam's Club Hall and I meant to say O'Doyle rules just like I said yeah that's right I'm like just like o'doole I'm like darn it we realized it while editing and I'm like no it did not work out aren't you like in the pepper a little bit of salt and pepper on both sides and then we're gonna put the sage leave in there wrap it in shoots and dredge it in seasoned almond flour no crispy skin this time oh we can't do crispy skin with saltimbocca it wouldn't work but you see me do crispy skin it is a magical magical experience when that happens but you would need the skin on you'd have to buy loan on skin on chicken thighs take it to your butcher counter and ask them you know my friend please please take the bone out but leave the skin on and they'll do it for you and you can save those bones and make bone broth it's a winner winner chicken dinner for everyone yes really this chicken dinner is something you do quite often I don't think I've eaten this here since the book yes the last time we made this was probably January of 2019 so it's been a long time I think I've made it since then four stories but yeah hey guys if you're just joining keep leaving a comment down below let us know where you're watching from what you're making for dinner share the livestream check out the thrive market promo code I'm about to use their Aggie in a second check out the cookbook on Amazon things are rocking and rolling art and I went to Walmart today we shot a video about doomsday coronavirus prep what's the healthiest non-perishable canned and frozen food items you can get in case you don't want to go out in the time of a pandemic we shot a video for the best things to buy at Costco right now of course we did it in the home because we can't shoot a Costco anymore for now but what is rockin and rollin we're lovin life and we're loving the family so next I gotta flip the chicken back and by the way I'm using organic chicken now thrive market has really good chicken too I don't think they have boneless skinless chicken thighs but the chicken is good the beef is good but for me thrive market is all about their pasture raised beef not on the pasture raised pork it comes from a small Georgia farm called White Oaks past year and the bacon that I'm gonna have for breakfast tomorrow I think I still have someone left is literally a game-changer where is it I can't find it right now but there bacon in there pork shops will make more of that next week because they're sponsoring every live stream in March how amazing is that so here's what I want to do I want to get my pro shoots prosciutto de Parma all right if you had a choice between prosciutto and Hamlin de espana which one would you choose I really like the I know especially the pricey one the mail so Jesse and I were in South Beach last weekend for the Food and Wine Show and we stayed at the SLS Hotel and had a couple meals at Jose Andreas's restaurant and we had to really taste the ah come on ah croquettas and some other delicious tapas that was next-level very very high-end was great okay so this is prosciutto del Duca we actually got this today at Walmart but they don't have that at our private market so rip that open Wow Lukas Ortiz is his dinner tonight is 100% grass-fed ribeye reversed seared with rosemary and garlic yeah Oh insane sauce Lukas art might actually jump off

seasoned almond flour Eli V says primal kitchen has a new cocktail sauce um I actually have that in my pantry right now and then make a new tartar sauce I hope it's on the thriving market soon it's dairy-free made with avocado oil it looks amazing but tartar sauce I should work on that our cocktail sauce I'm sorry it's pretty easy what's the base of a cocktail sauce all right let me catch up

red carpet for you and art yeah they kind of been doing the opposite but hey it's all gonna work out in the end I have a favor confirms you cats up and horse right thank you yeah lemon juice a little bit of vinegar too so do that do sugar-free ketchup can you make the Flav City one if you want to buy primal kitchen do a little bit of prepared horseradish from bubbies that's really good quality one do lemon juice apple cider vinegar salt and pepper and then you don't also stir in a little but a little bit of stone-ground mustard or Dijon mustard I think that'd be really lovely too yeah hard time getting this off here there we go Johnny's good did you enjoy seeing him so if you did sounds like they want him Oh III didn't call him today we were so busy and we didn't get the call from John

body workout about four days a week because when I was younger I had time to do certain muscle groups now if I only get to the gym three or four days a week I can't afford just to do one muscle group so I'll do a total body each day minimal rest in between sets and I will stretch a lot do a lot of ABS a lot of active resting and stuff like that for active risk active resting is like I finished

core cuz for me I'm on my feet all the time I don't want to be big jacked guy I want to be limber flexible and have a strong core so I'm not standing here all day and getting uh getting sore back and

this is where you want to be on a Friday night I mean Fridays with flame it's legit the place to be did you buy all the Disney stock you were talking about I did I bought 500 more shares to worthy of course I bought it yesterday in the pre market at 220 and then of course I went as low as like 217 or something but then close today around 220 I bought more Disney stock and I bought a little bit of Apple stock today even I'm nervous about that so now I'm good to go now but I have a feeling that the market has bottomed I have a feeling that the Fed reserve might make some positive cuts or a rate cut on Sunday night and I could send the market up like five hundred or a thousand points on Monday but it's pretty scary stuff let's see the t-shirt so that's the Chicago flack using a whisk and a knife my brother got that for my birthday a couple years ago I sure we're still folding here I'm not doing the best job the knife would also actually have to be blue yeah it's true good point Emily Flores 499 super Chad hey from Miami great great meeting you last thank you then we had a great meet up at the Thermomix pop-up in Miami and we had over a hundred people come people drove from far away like Orlando Fort Lauderdale it was so cool and I was hoping to do a meet-up in LA but because we're not doing a long trip because Jesse and Rose aren't coming now because of Corona I won't have time for the meetup so once again Corona ruins something else I was asking if you're sick she says hashtag stuffy no I'm not sick but for some reason I woke up this morning my throat's very scratchy it could just be the dry air as soon as I woke up this morning I started this scratchy feeling so I've actually been drinking tea taking this i'll show you this immune activator I bought and I have these cores immune shops okay this is done not my prettiest work but it'll work let me see if I can use this extra pro shoots and cover up some stuff here wants you to tell the ingredients yeah I know the thing is it's so hard for me to prepare ahead of time I actually chose this dish ahead of the normal time I had had done it like 11 o'clock this morning normally art and I finished filming on Fridays and we have what art like an hour to figure out what to buy it at the grocery store in rush home but yeah if I was better prepared I totally would well charisa sampson hello from anchorage alaska it's my first live whoa welcome after watching your videos for two months everyone say hello to ker so what do you guys do in Anchorage when it's so cold in the winter what's the typical Anchorage food is that your standard like fried fish stuff or you guys eating like oh look what did you know to be 800 seals up there and stuff like that there are the Eskimos right for everyone asking rose is sleeping yeah Rose hopefully will be out soon she literally fell asleep right as we're going live keep in mind I can't keep my eyes on there and art only has two eyes okay now I could have some Kido wine cheers to the end of a week a week that saw the stock market down 3,000 plus points coronavirus spreading around the world but I we're home now we're not going outside or having a good time do you eat that whole leaf thing okay on the chicken absolutely it fries into the skin is delicious thank you now maybe here's my almond flour season at every step of the cooking process right I said it like a British there all right Canadian I'm like art art says a couple words sorry Ireland Irish and Canadian he says sorry like Canadians and then Irish you do watch yeah thank you much I'm like art I mean how's your dinner is good thank you much self almond flour a little bit of salt unrefined sea salt we actually talked about that in today's uh coronavirus inspired doomsday video when you want to get things that last a long time salt is the ultimate preservation tool but getting unrefined salt like Himalayan pink salt or celtic salt from france it has tons of trace minerals in there that taste good but also offer electrolytes so if you need some minerals you're gonna get it whereas if you get a salt like this there's no minerals in here besides sodium chloride so I used to use this to cook all the time this is the kind of stuff that actually spikes your blood pressure you want to get unrefined pink salt like Oh pink salt gray salt Redmond real salt you can get all that stuff on thrive market my favorite thing to think to do is go on thrive market use the values search I searched by keto and paleo and then every time you spend now over 14 dollars on thrive they give you a free gift of your choice they keep giving me this almond butter it's an $8 value and I use it in my smoothies every day so between the free swag and getting the $20.00 shopping credit for first-time customers just try it out get the Guiteau I'm gonna use this this ye I rave about it to everyone it's the best grass-fed ye the best flavor ever so once again they are a longtime supporter of the channel and I have the link in the description box that gets you a twenty dollar shopping credit for your fur for the year if you get the year-long membership so check that out mark goobie really wants keto biscuits and gravy whoo mark but mark is the inventor of the Bobby approved stamp and Mark we actually used for the first time today removed out VG and it worked perfectly had a little actually after the pepper grinder was over my shoulder and we erased it so thank you for that it was really cool um let's start front so to fry fry some more we're gonna do a mixture of avocado oil and ghee because avocado oil is a neutral flavored high heat oil which is lovely but the ghee like can you smell this like Regina and Cory it smells like movie-theater butter but instead of being a hydrogenated fat with artificial flavors it's pure grass-fed cream heated to the milk fat separates from the milk solids its KC and free lactose free fat its paleo its keto it's clean right we don't talk about keto in terms of like fat as fat canola oil soybean sunflower palm oil garbage fats grass-fed ghee avocado oil coconut oil olive oil all really good fats that's the kind of stuff you want that's the kind of stuff you can load up on thrive market or anywhere you shop really really important stuff that you put the best quality oils in your body because olive oil has polyphenols this is really good for your brain and your myelin sheath coconut oil has lauric acid such good properties and people poopoo unsaturated fats like ghee and coconut oil forget about it that is the best kind of fat for you all right Scott break you got back-to-back super chat back back I'm a super chef I'm a back-to-back I'm a super chef Morris $2 and a question can you please do a grocery haul for

and arts like I don't like that you said I'm not a baller now if you have a tree nut allergy and you can have coconut so if you have a tree nut allergy would you be allergic to coconuts - I think that would it be different you can use coconut or almond flour either one works here shake off the excess shake it off shake it off just shake it off and drop it in the hot fat let's see here what song is

bought the book please leave a review on Amazon that Amazon algorithm loves reviews just take a minute I'd really appreciate it and here's the recipe we're making tonight art needs a splatter guard - so when we did the book obviously I was a little more careful this is wrapped it perfectly I I was a little hasty tonight but look that's golden brown and crusty this mash if your kids don't like cauliflower brought our Brussels sprouts they're gonna love it it's picky eater approved I've had moms I just spit on your spit on earth I spit a lot he's getting oil is getting spit on so I have mom's email me all the time thank you my picky either Erica loves your Brussels sprouts your cauliflower I love to hear that right Kirby Soto Kirby any 9 thank you so much the first Kirby who's ever given a super chat I'd love to hear that okay let's do this so art in my Thermomix mixing bowl you obviously don't have to use a thermo mix you can use a blender or a food processor I'm gonna put the cauliflower I want the cauliflower to be smooth and creamy and I want the keep missing I want the brussel sprout my Brussels sprouts so good to be a little chunky so I don't want to blend it up I'm gonna chop that by hand so cauliflower goes in but we don't stop there right don't stop we won't stop we can't stop we won't stop well go a little bit of unrefined salt art needs extra oven mitts while filming yes seriously I should have art wear this while filming like that right I mean the only gloved give me a one-handed gloved cameraman he could be the Michael Jackson Jackson up cameraman like that right a little salt a little pepper boy like a little bit of Yi in here just to whip in there and a warm up because I'm anything wrong with every day um yes I do I would limit that to three to four days a week it's still a saturated fat and there are no pork rinds that are actually pasture raised or organic so yeah I would not eat any animal meat every single day I'm all about moderation and if you eat an all meat it has to be pasture raised at least organic or grass-fed right grass-fed beef all the way look at this by the organization from Jesse cheese bin baby bin red bin I mean come on Jesse's crushing Marie Kondo Bobby you just got a five Canadian dollar super chat from Penelope love does your thrive link work in Canada I don't fortunately not it's keep thanking us keep up the good work and special link to heart one behind the cam the beautiful voice oh yeah I wish it worked I think the Megan I see gia and Patricia I feel a lot of pairs dancing you're in Hannah for 99 my 11 year old cadence is watching and a new vegetarian could you explain to her why he's okay he knows I trust what you say okay I will thank you Megan JIAJIA you are amazing no you are dancing pear Tricia celebrating and I haven't seen that one before all these super chance you guys okay let's go back to Megan's daughter cadence this is for you cadence so a lot of people are getting on the vegan-vegetarian bandwagon a lot of people are watching that that Netflix special game-changers here's the deal in the short run you can have health benefits from eating a purely plant-based diet but in the long run you're doing yourself a disservice there's a lot of studies out there that back this up eating meats when I say meat I don't mean green fed traditional feedlot cattle I need to kind of meet the kind of pork that thrive market has grass-fed beef pasture raised pork and organic pasture raised chicken that protein is a complete protein those animal proteins have certain minerals certain enzymes certain certain Hema Hema is very important that you can't get with vegetables so over the long run you are going to be deficient if your plant-based if you eat a lot of vegetables along with really good pasture raised grass-fed meat you're good to go so I'd highly recommend doing that because when you're eating pasture raised beef it's good for the farmer it's good for you it's good for the environment ultimately they kill the cattle but it's done in the best way possible so that's the best way I can explain that a tree so all 2.99 with a pair saying cool whoo Thank You Patrice sind aleena dollar ninety nine message retracted but gave me $1 million super Chad so thank you thank you so much right now I'm gonna whip some air and come up Ouray right [Applause] Perez $10 oh nice hey so come over here art I can smell well it's been six minutes waiver says yeah thank you I can actually it's funny when you get really good at cooking you can not only hear but you can smell I can smell that it's caramelized and ready to go so I just pick it up like that oh yeah oh yeah man so tilt the oil away from you hello hello that's what you want and it's because I did not disturb the chicken I just let it do its thing because what happens already to get in there and you poke and prod around and everything like that nothing good nothing good you're ruining the sear it's probably gonna stick to the pan a bit more that is the definition of gdb right art yes sir all right so can I put the splatter guard back down I'm so happy because I'm happy clap your hands if do you feel that something bulky is the truth did you hear me oh my sweet pea McGee oh say hi to everyone say hi to the loves of our life Rose honey parish and Jesse parish sweetie shout-out to Merrill ease dollar ninety-nine super chat thank you so much yeah on set chair ah yes you roast here here on set what oh geez thousand or juicier than breasts oh yeah more fat more flavor um if you want to see rose crawling for the first time go to my Instagram store you can go to Dessie story she started crawling slowly but she can crawl all the way across the living room it's really cool what Bobby Kesha Holliman just gave you $24.99 best way to cook wild caught salmon the questions are very difficult my favorite career so Kesha thank you very very nice so wild caught salmon which is thrive market has is very lean and meaty the best way to cook it to be honest is to take it off the skin cut it into cubes and make salmon patties google wave city salmon patties or salmon cakes with tartar sauce I have the best recipe that's why it's very difficult to cook get as is because it's so darn lean rose my sweet we missed you everyone's like yo Bobby's cool and all but we're here for Rose honey right and she keeps scratching her eyes with her pterodactyl like claws right well you're you're such a quick healer because you have all that amazing collagen and healing power right nice sweet petite yes sweet pea okay I was gonna do something here we go so Rose we're making the put a o so check it out see how my figure right here is a little bit hot there we go see how it's a little bit tight check it out I need liquid so I actually have in here a combination of organic cream and cashew milk and I put salt pepper garlic see the garlic right there and bay leaves to infuse and that's the best way to make a silky puree without watering it down so I'll add that this is what I do around the holidays when I make IDO mash or even when I make for the family uh potato mash potatoes you have to steep the cream with the aromatics it's very important and I want to get a shout out these guys sent me some cashew milk it's a small company they're called nutty life check them out on Instagram this stuff is so good they make a chocolate version that dusty and I crushed and it only has cashews water dates and vanilla it's so good hey Bubba pretty so that's gonna blend up then we'll chop the Brussels sprouts and just fold them in and get kind of a texture thing going on kids if they're picky eaters which Rosen notch eats chicken livers and yolks and everything but love them that looks really good let's scrape this down rose how was your nap you got to give her a second when she wakes up she's a little groggy but give her a few seconds and the nice thing about 5:00 to 6:30 we call that her prime time she's like so active she's so fun she's shot two or three videos with us this week already our greetings from Amsterdam Amsterdam I haven't been there ever so this needs a little more liquid take a look inside art that's looking very yummy Oh switch with you and I got to get this chicken out this chicken is done and get the next batch yet so what I'm gonna do is just throw the lid onto this and then before I continue whoops I want to I want to get a chicken out but here's the deal art I should probably put it on a cooling rack right because we have a crispy skin there and if I put it directly on a sheet tray it's gonna create some condensation and ruin the crispy skin so always get a sheet tray yeah if you want my kitchen gear amazon.com slash shop slash Flav City I have everything I use on a daily liquid it's just there now these are done so I'm gonna take my chicken can we just get a little love when you see sexy chicken like that I'm bringing sexy back and it's creepy that's gluten free it's dairy free because we're basically using here its paleo and it's so tasty so alright do you think I should wipe out the pan before doing the next batch what do you think I think it'll burn so I remember from the cookbook that if I keep it in there what do you guys think should I keep it going you know I'm I already know the answer I'm just gonna take it you know wipe it out wipe it out wipe it out yeah that's the one thing about almond flour is that it does burn easily so if you're gonna pan-fry you have to do it in batches so let's just wipe it out wipe it out where's Joey from a full house would say cut got it we're so lame talkin about Joey Joey Gladstone right how do I remember that I can't remember we had a discussion about that I know but I never remember so we had to look it up yeah we did neither of us remembered his last name and that is the essence of what art and I do in between filming we look up what Joey's last name was from full house we look up a random SNL quotes from 1992 I wish there was a cameraman following us because the stuff we talk about is a show nothing show about nothing literally or show about severe disorder okay Michele Deery $5.00 my daughter Kennedy eight years old would like would like rose to know if she thinks that she is adorable Oh Kennedy thank you thank you so much Rose had such a fun time by the way in Florida because she's never been in warm weather like that and she's never been surrounded with that many people and she was loving everyone smiling they were back it was really a grand time okay let's get some more chicken in there and then I'll fold the Brussels in here so roast this is chicken thighs salt pepper sage prosciutto and then we put it in season two almond flour because we're making a low carbon keto right and we Pat that flour into the skin and then we fry it in the fat and that's what makes it nice and crispy like the first batch right there okay and guys if you're just joining this is what we're making we're making saltimbocca we're making keto mash and we're hanging out on hashtag Fridays with daddy also known as Flav right whyever I keep saying don't wipe it out but it's been done no fair naked lady said it's all been done it's all been done you have to almond flour will burn how many songs can we sing that's the goal I think we've set a record for today let's keep going it rose just say Papa she says Dada she does we I don't know if let's do that yeah I don't know she's doing it like consciously for me but yeah for the last 10 days she's been going dah dah dah dah dah and we'll come on stop na non stop yeah she is you know she looks like deci but when it comes to talking and camera presence she's all me because you put the camera on her for Instagram stories boom she lights up you light up you smile I think cameras on me oh ok see just like that what's a Bobby approved oat milk um to be honest none because Marc doesn't oh yeah that'd be the only one yeah milk makes an oat milk because it's organic the other ones aren't organic we have a video coming out next week about glyphosate's glass glyphosate's are the active ingredient in

went from a 42 forty-two he's huge like bania like any man yeah hey Johnny if you would it's got yeah I guess there's just salt pepper cheese in there create a little bit of cream yeah sorry rose I can give her a Brussels sprout Irish can't handle that to guess yeah she's not ready for so des she's been doing a lot of research about foods for certain ages and even though a baby could have Brussels sprouts you want to avoid certain foods till certain ages because their tummies just can't handle them grains they really can't handle until like they're over 16 and 24 months old it's very important to wait okay Jenny Janus give me dollar ninety-nine she came in down to 99 and said 20 I love it johnny is number one Johnny's number one of my speed dial can you talk about Amy's and the salt content listen frozen foods always gonna have a little more salt there's 2400 milligrams of salt and a teaspoon when you see 800 we're talking about a third of a teaspoon and a serving it's probably not that much but if you are someone high blood pressure you probably you okay sweetie you probably want to go out for the reduced sodium one come on closer okay so rose now we're gonna take the brussels i think she might be a hungry sweet pea we're asking what her dinner is what who roses dinner is yeah put her down chicken go play let me her dinner earlier she had some homemade apple gelatin jigglers jessie has a recipe for on her instagram it's a really cool recipe and sheets pasture-raised egg yolks that are soft boil she eats pasture-raised chicken livers she eats uh what's up Bubba she eats uh rutabagas really really good stuff why is she so upset Oh Rosie but I just want to roughly chop that and fold it into the mash I made more than the recipe calls for some I'll save some for the side I think this would be a good opportunity for people to share it yeah absolutely people copied the link to this broadcast help us out share it amongst all your social media sites dating sites all your friends yeah your enemies let them know you're watching Fridays and Flav so all right check it out now I just fold it in serve this to your kids to your boo to your lover to your mistress look at that it looks purty and farty and which it is and delicious but that right you check it for seasoning no no so whether that's what you want so that's done we'll move that aside and I'll just save some brussel sprouts here that's right thank you I'm them I'll get the second package of chicken out and throw the last one in there and then we're done check it out our chicken looks glorious is Rose getting more teeth um yes he's he's seven teeth kind of on the top I don't see them but she does but we think cuz she's been very cranky this week so we do think that maybe there's some teeth coming in there but we're not a hundred percent sure what do you think mommy teeth yeah that's it feels like it all right let me rub this out here and then we're pretty much done you guys super easy right Clemence peasy there yeah another reference look at squeezy lemon peasy is it lemon peaceful cuz you didn't say easy peasy crazy so trail okay weird negan reference a little more a bow and then we'll just finish would you hate when that thing runs out it's really not in the middle of yeah that's the Rachael Ray oil dispenser once again my Amazon shop page but when you runs it out you got to pop the top out fill it out kind of annoying oh yeah last ones let's take the chickie chickie so tomorrow's video on the channel you guys it's gonna be the best things to buy at Costco right now they have some amazing creamer coffee creamer from Laird super food they have some new vital proteins collagen which I have mixed reactions about they have amazing organic chicken and kale burgers they have some event they have a ketose snack mix which I have mixed feelings about we filmed the video at our kitchen because we can't film at Costco anymore because they kick this out and it's gonna be great and then on Sunday we're doing a coronavirus related doomsday haul showing you healthy preserved canned and pickled food and some frozen food to stock up on in case a pandemic breaks out you don't want to go in crowded places for food and go out just run networks yeah or a hurricane or a natural disaster we're working good or the walking dead if the zombies come back and they want to eat your brains I'll just stay home by watching Netflix and I'll just eat my Amy's frozen pizza alright you just got a 999 super chat from AMD because of you I am be I learned about more than suction queen like msg I didn't know they were the same and I'm allergic to MSG so now I know and it started to feel love to hear that I bought more AMD stock also um I love to hear that not did get an email from someone this week saying that uh another word for MSG too is citric acid but I'm not too sure about that because citric acid also is a preservative that comes from this person who wrote I believe Bobby also says that malted extra yeah multi dextran is just a preservative that's made from GMO corn but citric acid to me is are relatively harmless preservative right citric acid is also used in some vitamin C's I believe right yeah by Taemin see but I can see where sometimes they might make it into msg but I'll have to do more research about that right now it's fine oh yeah let's do a little bit cleanup because we're in the home stretch right here once again this is how everything looks check it out art this is from the book yeah the chicken looks amazing like legit amazing I'm gonna clean up well you just got a 1999 super chair [Music] amazing well her name I see it Janet you are amazing you are my darling you are my sunshine Gayle roses really upset okay let's push this to the side right you know clean up yeah what should I warm her Rose never cries like that very rarely Oh huh this is roses bone broth and you know you made a really good rum broth when it looks like this okay it's so gelatinous from the collagen the gelatin that came out of the bones it's amazing so I'll take that they're scooping some organic butter not too so here's what I'm gonna do for Rose y'all rose bone broth is one of the best things you can give my baby cuz it's loaded with collagen gelatin chondroitin which is very good for their immune system opportunity for another musical reference oh don't you cry tonight how much I brought them a little more and very good for their gut bacteria super important stuff but also it has the electrolytes and minerals that come out of the bones and out of the bone marrow amazing stuff so I'll just take what's that bit yeah I'm gonna give her skin mmm nothing to get on top oh yeah yeah yeah and then I roasted yesterday for Rosie a little bit of organic butternut squash you don't have to buy organic but for her she's worth it and okay and then I just warm it up in some stock we blend it in the babybullet warm it up first well I'm about to another one we are in Fuego tonight so Rose we do that with parsnips and rutabagas we boil it in bone broth puree it we do that with pasture-raised livers with puree it what else do we do that worth then what else do we do that way a lot of stuff bone broth is the greatest thing to blend it up you could also blend it with a mix of breast milk a little bit too amazing right art please read this comment joining sicko next week do you have a code and do you prefer pelo 61 or Seco um well pelo 61 the red is my favorite you don't have to join the club if you don't want to but if you

you're good to go so our look this is maybe the best skin of the day look at this hour you might have just crushed it on the last batch look at that oh and Yee look at that no one knows or cares that's almond flour no one knows that it's paleo it does not matter that's flavor that's better than most people doing it with starchy flour GMO corn starch or stuff like that it was beautiful all right wash that down we're 1,300 subscribers hopefully better not have thirteen hundred subscribers I'd be bad viewers if we had thirteen hundred something would be very very bad hopefully we'll be at

time hanging out with you art Johnny Rose Jesse and myself we'll see you soon but till though we say into like we always do hash a keep on cooking mad love and peace see you guys that was fun see everybody times with the family", "aKwdz_9qfdY": "what is up everybody welcome back to the 2x4 flower tent we're here on day 45 and today our topics are flushing phenotype hunting and terpene profiles but before we get started if you like learning about cannabis the science of cannabis or you just like watching quality cannabis content make sure to hit that subscribe button and turn on the notifications so you don't miss out on any future videos and as always welcome to cannabinology [Music] so here on day 45 everything is coming along beautifully we've just entered our flushing cycle and we'll talk a little bit more about what that means in just a few minutes the first thing i want to do is sort of just give a rundown of the tent we're going to start over here with our breeding plants and we'll just go through these quickly and we'll talk about our phenohunts and some of the turkey profiles in a few minutes so the first thing i want to talk about is this bewitched bx2 right here this is our number one phenotype what we call the lavender cupcakes phenotype has some really delicious uh sort of a linoleum heavy kind of lavender grapey uh terpene profile with some sort of earthy cupcake notes and it's really really delicious very excited uh this is of course for our preservation run so this is a bewitched uh bx2 cross to our keeper males of the bush bx2 right next to her we have our sfv and these next couple of plants are pollinated with our sex reversed blueberry cookies um if you are interested in that check out some of the earlier videos um the pre i think they were called pre-season six um we did a number of sex reversals and did some sts experimentation so definitely check those out and if you're interested in doing your own sex reversals making your own feminized seats visit our website www.cbgyca.com stskit and we have a lot more information there you can pick up those kits as well in case you missed that link i will also drop those in the comments along with all the other links for the equipment and all the things we talked about as well down in the description so make sure to check that out so this is this here is a super classic strain sfv og crossed to our feminized or sex reversed blueberry cookies and we're making cannabinology really really amazing line very popular for it's high vigor super frost great really interesting sort of exotic terpene profiles extremely high yield it really really stacks so you get these massive colas actually kind of similar in stacking to this although the flower structure on this one's a little messed up this is the blueberry cookies but it really stacks very similar to that but much bigger plants than the blueberry cookies the next plant here this is our purple punch uh sort of a hype strain pretty well known super frosty very purple sort of a light uh grape punch grape soda type of flavor of course this is crossed with the sex reverse blueberry cookies as well we're making purpleberry punch really nice sort of a candy grape lots of deep purples plenty of color in this lime so very excited to have more seeds of this and then here we have our little short blueberry cookies i was hoping this was going to be bigger that we would get more seeds out of it but this is a pretty small very short stretching plant so a little bit short here but this is our blueberry cookies and this is for the blueberry cookies s1 feminized just sort of a preservation of this clone all right so the next two things i want to talk about here are some of the clones that we're running and then we'll hop into our blueberry cookies phenohunt we'll start over here this is the cushman sort of a hype cut here uh really starting to look good very commercial flower look sort of that round dense super frosty flower really looking good really smelling good has a nice sort of sweet fresh cushy taste hence the name cushman's so that's very cool we're probably going to do some crosses with this maybe in our next run with our blueberry muffin do some muffin mints or cush muffin i'm not really sure what i'm going to call it yet if you guys have ideas of what to call the blueberry muffin by cushman's let me know down in the comments i would love some great idea names next up we have our blueberry mac and i guess i misspoke this one is actually a clone this is from seed so this is the mac one capped cut crossed with the blueberry bakery zero which is sort of our our a cut of our blueberry bakery males we have two males that we decided to keep um and this is what i feel like is the better male over the two um so this cross to the mac one uh the blueberry bakery across the back one absolutely beautiful not quite the flower size i was looking for but it did get quite shaded out it really doesn't stretch kind of like the mac one really doesn't stretch pretty slow to grow but beautiful color super frosty looks like it's going to be real real dense i did raise it up on a little sort of riser here this is just uh i think mushrooms came in this or something like that we cleaned it out flipped it over um brought it up a couple of inches to get some more light so beautiful color on this all right moving on we have our kuiper belt another uh variety that's somewhat similar to the mac one actually very slow to grow this one is pretty weak stems but as you can see beautiful frosty flowers already starting to get that that purple in there it's got a really uh really really delicious sort of a sweet uh gravy cushy [Music] terpene profile just absolutely amazing this one probably is going to go into the 65 or 70 days so this has quite a few weeks to go actually same with this blueberry mac i'm expecting this one to go out quite a bit [Music] all right moving over we're going to talk about our phenol hunt here and i will say everybody i'm super stoked about this vino hunt these plants look amazing i'm really really happy with how these are turning out beautiful beautiful flowers really great structure amazing terpene profile there's a little bit of diversity which is honestly kind of nice that way you have you know some sativa leaner some indica leaner but all sort of with that uh common blueberry flavor um so this is four plants of the blueberry cookies bx1 and so one thing that i really like about this is i'm actually finding two phenotypes that are pretty close to identical there's a little bit of difference in terms of flower structure and that's the blueberry cookies number five and the blueberry cookies number three they both have a pretty conical sort of cone-shaped flower both have a really nice sort of round open sweet blueberry terpene profile which is really really excellent i really love this terpene profile very greasy resin which really means there's probably a lot of terps in it which is really something that i'm breeding this for so the blueberry cookies the things that i'm looking for are good flower structure the blueberry terpene profile that the number three and the number five have i'm looking for a little bit higher yield than the blueberry cookies because as i mentioned blueberry cookies is really small a very very short plant doesn't stretch much it's a little bit higher yield and some color so those are the things i'm looking for and i'm honestly seeing that in in all of these plants nice chunky buds pretty frosty delicious terpene profile so very happy so as i mentioned these two the number three and the number five both have the sort of sweet round blueberry terpene profile so these are probably what i'm waiting for is keepers the number five may not be a true keeper but i am seeing this uh fasciation mutation which i believe is caused by an upregulation of a plant hormone called cytokinin which does a number of things um including affecting lateral branching and cell division all sorts of stuff so i'm planning on keeping this because i think i think this uh this type of mutation could be used to significantly boost your crop yield just because the flowers grow really funky and just kind of grow bigger so if you look at a flower like this and you look at the flower right next to it obviously this fascinated one much bigger so i'm hoping we can sort of play around with this stabilize this trait and get some really interesting looking flowers and boost yields much more quickly than with sort of your standard breeding methods of selecting looking for the highest yield breeding that selecting again i think we could use this and i think it would be really cool to have a whole plant with these very interesting cool looking flowers on them all right but we are talking about terpene profiles here so the number three and the number five both have that blueberry terpene profile and then we go over to and then we go over to some of these other phenotypes so for example here is the number two phenotype and we'll get a little smell of this one thing i did notice about this one it has really big trichome heads which is pretty cool potentially really good for extraction as far as terpene profile we went ahead and just sort of rubbed our fingers on there that's a great way to test those terpene profiles it still has that delicious blueberry flavor um but the undertones those so it has some sort of deeper a little bit gassier earthier sort of undertones in there really really amazing though very excited for this one i'm potentially going to make some rosin out of this because of the larger trichome size i think it'll press really well and i also think this one's going to be a bigger healer than the other ones unfortunately this one did get a little bit close to the light so we did get some of those flat tops on there as you can see but i think if i uh had monocrop this we could have brought that light up just a little bit we would have gotten some really beautiful flower structure on there as well so i think this is probably a yielder decent purping profile i would definitely consider this a keeper and i'm in my f3 or my bx1f2 which is basically an f3 i am gonna probably run this one and the number three uh just because this one has amazing trichomes beautiful beautiful trichomes and probably higher yielder so i do want to hold an f3 of this number two phenotype and an f3 of the number three phenotype the number three is definitely the one i'm leaning for it has the flower structure it has the exact flavor that i'm looking for it's got perfect height beautiful beautiful beautiful flowers i already said that i just love how these flowers look i'll give you a little close up there absolutely gorgeous dense frosty looks like they're gonna have some great color really really stoked sorry i know i've spent a lot of time on on this number three phenotype and i'm super super excited about it all right so then we'll go over to the number six phenotype so this one is actually very different from the other ones obviously uh it's a little bit taller a little bit more sativa leaning i mean i actually really like the structure of this at first this one kind of like the number three got a little bit close to the light so we've got some funky growth here a little bit of fox tailing but that's okay one thing i noticed about this phenotype is as it was growing it was actually one of the shorter ones in the beginning but it stretched for a longer amount of time and actually met the canopy of the taller one and i say shorter and taller it's only a difference about an inch or an inch and a half between all these plants but some minor minor height differences really the unique thing here is the flower structure being much more sort of stick like a nice big stick of stacked up flowers much thinner leaflets probably leaning more towards the sativa-like effects just based on how this looks it looks more like a sativa plant so we're gonna get a little smell some terps here so i really just like to sort of grab one of these outer leaves rub a couple of trichomes off just to get some [Music] flavor yeah so this one's very different it's got um what i consider sort of a haze type of flavor it's got a little bit more citrus a little bit more earthy in it definitely sort of a unique phenotype here so this one probably would be a keeper for some people if you're looking for that sativa with a little bit of your sort of citrus and berry notes um this could definitely be for you it's not too tall it looks like it's not going to take too too long to finish probably in the 60 to 65 day range and of course had this not gotten so close to the light we probably would have gotten some better flower structure on here that said i probably will not be keeping this i am keeping it for now but i'm probably not going to move this into the f3 round um just because it's not really the turkey profile that i'm looking for with the blueberry cookies it's also not really the flower structure i love the sort of conical or not the conical the sort of pole like stacked flower but it's not the structure i'm looking for for blueberry cookies specifically one line that i may use this in is in the cabinology in the the thai stack line or the thai exotic which of course is an offspring of this sfv and blueberry cookies here one of those the number two phenotype has this same structure really really uh stacked these really long colas so i may cross that uh do a femme cross between this blueberry cookies and that can have an og since they have a similar structure maybe stabilize that structure get some some more terps in there and things like that but that's all to say that this is a keyboard just not for this line and i am very excited to try out the number six all right from here i do want to jump into a little bit about our flushing cycle we are here on day 45 and day 45 uh usually it's a little bit early for flushing and i'll explain why i sort of consider my flush period starting now but for those of you who are just tuning in who don't really understand what flushing is and why you do it i'll give a really sort of brief overview overview so flushing is basically where you take plain water and you dump it through your media and what that's going to do is pull out any nutrients that are left over from your flowering cycle especially when you use mineralized or salt nutrients you get a lot of buildup in your soil so you might be going and pouring in your nuts at you know 1.5 1.9 2.0 ec um but over time that's going to build up and i've seen build up even in my grows up to three four five thousand if you're not flushing and doing maintenance flushes throughout your cycle which is okay you don't have to maintenance flush it is a good idea though so towards the end of your flowering cycle you do want to flush out any extra nutrients this is really going to help the senescence or the death cycle of these plants is going to help them flush out bring out more color a lot of people will say it also helps with the color of your ash and the smoothness of your smoke there is some debate there's not a lot of evidence to say one way way or the other scientifically but my personal belief is that flushing does help with the color of your ash and it helps make your smoke smoother and more enjoyable so here on day 45 what i consider the beginning of my flush cycle is when i switch my res to plane water so i'm on drippers here i have a reservoir that these come out of and generally for the most for the majority of the cycle were somewhere around the 2.0 1.9 to 2.0 ec on day 45 which is about three weeks before i plan to harvest most of these plants i switched it to plain water no nutrients i used the water from my dehu so it is distilled or sort of close to ro water but you can do this with tap water it's totally fine and i just let that plain water water my plants for the first week and that's going to help bring down those nutrients i happen to have done a number of maintenance flushes in this run so i do know that my soil is somewhere around that 2.0 to 2.5 ec and so i think about a week of plain water should bring that down below that 2.0 mark so that's your first week or what i consider the first week of the flush period after that uh once we get to two weeks prior to our harvest we are actually going to flush do a physical flush pouring lots of water through the medium to get that soil ec down to about a thousand or below and that's really going to help those plants flush out if you have any questions about flushing about this sort of pre-flush period anything like that definitely drop those down in the comments and i'll make sure to answer those there or in a future video uh so that's uh pretty much our update for day 45 but before we sign off today i do want to remind everybody that we are still doing our 1000 subscriber giveaway we're somewhere around 930 or 940 subs at this point

especially my you know my people have been smoking weed for years you know what I'm talking about like some of that some of that hi joy used to get kind of had that like a little bit of like a locker room kind of smell to it but it's like straight crystal mixed with a little bit of a diesel smell missing a little bit of like a locker room smell anyways it's the sugar cookie let's grind her up get into it roll the flood and see how it goes y'all coming on the surf gets a sizable loan gets a toe pad [ __ ] I'm getting stone for my own breath below set so much with the hopes a full dress but I

today you know we're using unfortunately it's my laughs in this flavor but we're using the great high tea lunch but now you're not gonna focus on me you know I love the high tea some of my other friends who are heavy smokers that like you know like one of my homies Dustin we're having he'd rather smoke the front one's the fake backward from the high teas you know what it's all love it's all gravy whatever you'd like picking poison you roll with I mean I literally just like have what you see should have got better so when I said it smelled like a gym locker mixed with crystal diesel I guess that crystal was really crazy [Music] got really nice flavor to it and for something that's so potent I mean like was so much crystalling into I probably don't do that maybe that's why but it's really really really really really soon I can't taste a Grace and scrape over the bud I find that happens a lot more so and the bun itself doesn't have the most potent smoking flavor which is all right you know that sometimes once again it all depends on you like but you know sometimes I'm more than happy without having the overly potent bud itself now if you're smoking a cush or something that's a different story you wanna you won't taste that Kush where you're smoking it but you know for like a nice but like this overpowering [Music] you know what I know it's a 50/50 but I feel like even though it's a good stroke over bud glad to get smoked you know sometimes these last little longer I honestly don't really have a whole lot more to say about it though good smoke I would highly recommend it especially for people you know like smoke on the go smoke during the day what you got [ __ ] to do or [ __ ] that you still need to get done very very nice easy smoke too you could be on public smoking this not gonna be [ __ ] talking your ass off making me [ __ ] self look eats more won't be draw attention to yourself I can't smell with you part of it smells like right now that'll be like after you no dad no all in all very nice but the fact that the flavor is not very potent stupid coming through like the one on this end I have a feeling you know obviously it's smelling weed up here but [Music] for something like that you knows I don't know whatever you know I think all in all a really nice bump though I would definitely cop this again for myself I really like this kind of fun me five years ago when I was just smoking weed 24/7 I just want the highest [ __ ] in because I can can though just like make me feel [ __ ] or just drink coffee and balance myself out all day to get my [ __ ] done and this probably wouldn't have impressed me then so it depends what kind of school you are but kind of smoker I am now this is like perfect for me like this is like I've set this glass few times but this is hands down I should probably my favorite place so far good job good job on this one I definitely coming back I rate this morning you know I'm gonna rate this from my personal liking it - five out of five but um you know I'm gonna give it a four out of five for the fact that you know sometimes it depends what you're rating it right it's like you make your rating the best rapper of all time you rate them once kill you right now what have dope that are right like so on the weed I kind of feel the same way like if I'm raiding it even though it might be something I prefer if it's not like something that's gonna absolutely [ __ ] knock me out and you know what I mean like tear me to shreds then I feel like it doesn't really get that rating you know I mean like about smoking shuang guys like it - yeah I mean - wine tastes good but the Schwank you know on that rating scale but anyway we're gonna cut it there channel some people who teach the collection we'll

going out weekly 8 o'clock on Saturday nights, as we are tonight will always will always have a special guest where possible Today we have Eddie Van Hill Brooklyn New York amazingly here We're making a drink for is called t-shirt weather and it also be telling us what life is like over there So here we come in about 15 minutes or so. So keep tuning in for that If you're watching live tag someone and tell them why they should be watching this show live if you watch it on fake Sorry on playback Hash tag cocktails every day and also tell them tell someone why they should be watching this show We were in a competition So the more tags you put the more the more people you tag in it Then the more chance you have in win the competition last week We did exactly the same thing and I'm pleased to announce that the winner of last week is Dale stammers, so if you watch and Dale will send something out in the post will tag you in in this video Anyway, so you can watch this and you'll realize that you would we'll send some cocktails out in the post It's something that we've been doing prepackaged cocktails across the UK sent out by Royal Mail. So Thanks for watching. Thanks for tagging. We'll get something sent out to you So just to reiterate tag someone tell Marcia to watch if you watch it on playback, hashtag cocktails every day Hash tag someone and tell them why they should watch you'll be entered into competition your win cocktails, right? Let's move on. First of all, I have a drink I hope you all got drinks because we don't want to make drinks without already having one We have a chicken or the egg situation. I'm drinking that bra spritz. Wait you drinking? Tell us what you drinking? Who's watching Stevie TV own in? Battery Johnson Andy Collett pull style a David Lee. Thanks a lot for coming along Please tell us what you drinkin like say on drinking Aperol spritz. The one I want to know what you guys are I'm sure you'll be all drinking mai tais by the end of this So on that note that is what we are making my toys I'm gonna make it two times over my tie is one of these drinks that can be made loads of different ways I'm gonna make a short one. I'm gonna make a long one. There are tubes in the room So one of us is gonna drink in a short one That would be me cuz I like strong drinks and Laura can over the long one Right. So first I'll make the classic. I'll make the short one as strong its punchy you're gonna need some ingredients obviously and they have been listed in this post just to reiterate we are using Light gold and dark room doesn't matter about the brands But as I keep on saying every single week, make sure they're good rooms good vodkas good gins Whatever ingredient show you then make sure they're good because if they're crap, that's how you drink is gonna taste I'm using Bacardi white for my white room I'm using Mount Gay goal of Mount Gay for my golden room for my garnish Dark room. I'm using Gosling's black seal amazing room and actually now the sieve markets are quite well-stocked and Amazon's all over like I mean You can even get these ingredients from anywhere really sous chef online is great for these Fucking purees which I'm using. This is lemon juice you'll need that but amazonia supermarkets will do all these spirits that that we use Next up Cointreau I'm using but if you've got triple sec or any orange liqueur, that's absolutely fine Mon and orgeat it's an almond syrup. So just an almond sugar syrup Again, if you can't find it in your local supermarket if amazon are out of stock sous chef online sou s CH e F online just google it they have all this sort of stuff and then If you're making the long one You'll need some pineapple juice and orange juice if you're making the short on you own it either of those So we're gonna make him both and we start with the I'm gonna start with a short one Ironically, it's in a long glass for me That's only because I when I say long by the way, and I get both that's it when I say long I mean by volume. So it's a it's a larger volume of Liquid that's going in there when I say short I mean as less liquid going in there So the physical height of the glass doesn't really matter. It's how much drink is it can fit in the glass? So this is my short glass despite its size Let's let's fire away let's get stuck in so get your Boston tins get your protein shakers get your coffee cups However, you're shaking your drinks go and get it Next up we're gonna need some sort of measuring device If you're a free pour expert bartender, obviously, you don't need a jigger And if you're making it yourself, you don't care how big the measures are You don't need a jigger if you have got one like me use it because then you drink well balanced so we're going to be using the the Pretty much the original rules that we stick to works out to be about two shots. I'm gonna use a sweetness our base First up, it's white room. It's 3/4 of a shot Next step golden room 3/4 of a shock Don't worry about putting dark rum in yet we're gonna use it as a garnish so last ingredient to make it up to about two shot mark Cointreau triples sake orange secure whatever you got half a shot so that equates to your two shots So now your two shots, you know, you are, you know, you got all the booze in there that you need until the garnish We're now gonna start on our sweet and sour base Which most cocktails have as we mentoring mention every week I'm using funkin line I hope you can see that there If you're using a full lime a fresh line then sorry I mean user full line if you use and fresh line, so a full fresh line will be about 25 mil That's what I've just put in one shot and that's what you need. And then we're going to balance it out with the half sweet So the almond sugar syrup so that's one full lime to half sugar syrup almond sugar syrup and That's pretty much to drink There are like I say there are variations on this drink. This is Trader Vic's drink. This is created I mean the original my attire girly was created in 1944 in his his bar slash restaurant in Oakland, California There is controversy behind this drink if people start tagging who else if I made it The the argument is between trader Vic and Don the Beachcomber, which was created on the Beachcomber created a Maitai in 1933 However, there are a lot more ingredients The drink does taste different but there is an argument between those two as a who first created the my time So I guess really we're creating here today Trader Vic's and I tie it shorter is simpler We can make it from home If you start trying to make Don's my tie you're going to need you know Twice the amount of ingredients and I guarantee you will not be able to get half them in a supermarket So let's start with this one. Let's start with a short simple one Trader Vic's Now let's let's let's add some ice Which I see me piece pair that's quite a bit of ice and then shake it as hard as you can Thanks Alex carve joining Sam Tracy Jill Ally Vicky, right? Okay, that is pretty much this drink done Really easy rum lime sugar syrup. It is arm for sugar syrup. Google it you we have to get it and a bit of orange secure Check it all back in the glass We can't afford to use fresh eyes because with bartending from home and we don't have that much and get rid of some of that glass a little bit short and We can't afford to bees and loads and loads of fresh ice Last ingredient and let's call it the garnish so you don't forget your two shot room Just drizzle some dark room over the top for aesthetics. It looks it's really good And don't forget garnishes are there to improve aesthetics the looks of the drink? Ohyeah and we also need to tell you what's in the drink looking at that you might not know that's room but when you go to Sip out the straw you'll be able to smell there's a lot of room in that drink so if we're making this long, there's gonna be pineapple juice in there so I could pineapple with leaf in if You're to Google how to make a I'd say or Google image might say there's going to be mint leaves in there It's a it's an unusual garnish, really as I say every week you want to garnish it with what's in the drink and there's never any mint in the drink of a mai tai So it's questionable as to whether it should be a garnish but it is a garnish for my tie At the end of the day the bartender who created it, you know probably said that so so is a garnish reminder But for ease of use and easy remembering just garnish it with what's on the drink it adds to the drink there's lime in the drinks on a stick a lime wedge on there and there we have it one mai tai After you how you drink it if you sip it from the top you're just gonna be drinking rum until you get wrapped down with The rest of it if you save it through a straw again You're just gonna stick the rest of it to you get to the room. So I'm gonna mix mine up there We go one mai tai I bloody love mai tais The April spritz can go away. Thank you and that said it's worth Right, we're gonna do exactly the same thing again, but we're gonna make a long drink So if you have just made that and you thought bloody how it's a bit strong chuck it all back in shaker And we'll show you how to make it longer. So 3/4 of a shot of white rum any white room just make sure it's a good one 3/4 of his shots a golden room same rules apply Half a shot triple sec orange the cure or whatever orange liqueur you have And then you sweet and sour Next in line, I got the sweet. So I'll stick that in first half a shot Next up I have my let's on line By the way, it's a national might I'd a National yeah national multi-day on the 30th of June So if you're not making this today Make sure you get your ingredients together for the end of next month and then you can drink my ties all day See how long you last Right. Okay, so that's exactly what we made before. We're gonna make it longer by adding one shot 25 mils of pineapple juice and Orange juice one shot of each So usually when you're making a drink longer it usually ends up to be about 50 mils of mixer to make the drink longer and then We're gonna shake it really hard Really hard loads of ice it's a bigger glass Party should get the better. Look the pineapple juice should get head on it Oh this looks This one looks better I might drink this one Don't forget the garnish nice big drizzle of dark room on top I'll rub my old garnishing Laura can have that I only have one planet polluter I didn't buy a pineapple found the leaf on the floor. So I thought you of that And Lastly bit of lime Oh mint if you using it always put your garnish near the straw So when you go to drink you can smell everything Rum lime that's what it's drunk is Perfect absolutely beautiful absolutely. Love this drink. Hey game director So if anyone's got any questions, let us know one here I'd love to be able to answer them and hear em related questions where you can get this stuff from Just anything in general Giap as a message. Don't forget to tag friends But anyway, we're nearly a quarter past and we're nearly on the second part of the show, which means going to bring someone in live So now let's introduce our next guest we have with us someone I've worked with many years ago He's been working at an Aussie bar called Sunny Boy, which was voted to do the best espresso martini in Manhattan no less Incidentally, he was also sent up new coffee shop before all this kicked off So everybody welcome live from Brooklyn, New York, Eddie Van Halen Eddie, how's it going? I'm good. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you loud and clear I have to put in an earpiece incest everyone that's watching. That's what I've done that Eddie Tell us what it's why is it like in lockdown over there? yeah, it's Pleasure dan was one of my first bosses over in the UK. We work together. He was like 11 12 years ago Because was it? Well, ya know New York is as probably expected a bit crazy Everyone is still wearing masks and everyone's in lockdown and no one's really going out but It's the epicenter of all of this. Well in the meantime, everyone is adapting and doing things like this and and mending to be at home, so People are surviving and New York's a tough place. So it's fun to talk to people and everyone's surviving so Hopefully there won't be too much longer So I mean living in a massive city like that is You know a lot higher rise and that sort of thing Do you manage to get to parks and that sort of stuff for you? Pretty much, you know, it's do you where you live? Yes, luckily in Brooklyn We have the river When you live outside of Manhattan you get to go to the river and have the best views of the city So that's why we've lived in Brooklyn ever since we've been here which has been about five years so we get to go down Sit on the part Sunny day like today beautiful Outdoor spaces to use thank Good. Look I'm gonna hand over to you Eddie. What are your making for us today? Cool. So this is a cocktail perfect for This time of year is called t-shirt weather. I actually Cocktail from SUNY Boyardee bartending in New York They're an Australian Star Cafe cafe bar But they make amazing cocktails and I thought this one was was pretty perfect for today. So it's a mix of just gin St. Germain which is elderflower on the Cure lemon Cucumber and a bit of soda water. So super sweet light refreshing all very accessible ingredients So yeah, I'll get started. The taste is like I can't wait to join myself All right Get the tin so first thing I was listening to you down and over here we do ances I'm gonna convert back to UK terminology, so a shot and a half of gin as you would say Yeah Shut up, Jim I'm using The Brooklyn bass Jim superdelicious and we go through quite a lot better over here. And then St. Germain which I love putting all cocktails. I think it's very popular back in the UK was when I was there Elderflower look you're very sweet. Very floral, but it adds amazing depth to cocktail so half the shot of St. Germain Sanja man, however, you want to say it put that in of 10 and then so I as I got taught a long time you go by deco Magoo is on a couple of weeks ago a cocktail is very simple something strong. Something weak something sour something sweet So something strong something weak now, you know putting something sour which is lemon juice So I'm using the fresh lemon so I'm just going to do a full shot of lemon juice Love using fresh citrus always adds a Much better flavor to a cocktail rather than in the packet spot get what you get Short lemon juice and then the thing that makes this cocktail is Its cucumber sinner so cucumber and sugar So if you have a juicer then you just juice a cucumber if you don't get Cucumber chop it up put it in the tin get a muddler get all the juice out of it and then I just added a bit of sugar to that which makes it into just a bit of a Therapist its Basin or you can do it with anything really, but I've done it with cucumber So a shot of lemon and now a shot of cucumber syrup And then give it a good old shake just four ingredients very simple so getting the ice And I like to use just a short bucks for this one and use whatever ice but I have Some ice prepared. I like using cubes these and cubes or Spyro's or anything fancy like that where you can get these about the Sun for like a quid so boys useful for cocktails and then Strain into I'm looking for yes. Oh, yeah before I do This cocktail which lengthens it makes it a bit more summaries a bit of slow bit of water or a bit of seltzer Whatever you have. So what I do is just add a splash Into the cocktail Just you don't need to measure it just a bit of splashing now, and that just lips it gives a bit of fizz I like it. Fizzy pop down. So I And then what you're looking for is a nice light green cucumber for more color over the drink So give it a beautiful strange And then we got this so now for the garnish I have a cucumber You can either just slice it or what I like to do is get a peeler and make like a ribbon a bit fancy But super easy, so I'll get my peeler and I'll just get on the side of the cucumber But I'll just get a nice big feel and then you grab that give it a little twist and Then pop over the top of the cocktail and then with most cocktails especially with gin it's always good to add some kind of herb or give it an extra depth on the nerves and I'm with Ginny can add anything a grocery tie and lavender? Whatever you want today? I have time going outside So I'm going to add a bit of thyme Add that on the top a little work and that Is a t-shirt whether you can see absolutely love that. Absolutely. Yeah But happy to make it home I'm delicious There we go. Perfect happy You alluded then to have a little garden outside and later, I Want to see it? Yeah Bernie mother in an apartment. I want to see your little garden All right. Let me see if I can give you a little view of what it's going on outside Let me see okay, so I'm very fortunate to live in a place with a view but on a day like today it's worth seeing so I Don't want to see New York that is Absolutely incredible. It's looking pretty special today. Yeah Yeah, so what I always find in New York is the skies Is extra blue I know that sounds weird. But er, it's you just have some beautiful days So, you know very fortunate on a day like today The skies blue we've got nice cocktails to drink You never get bored of that view But as you probably know it New York in the winter It gets brutally cold. So there's so much so amazing, but the winters are tough So we make most of it when M when it's summer Yeah, nice Let your back to you guys and then a sunny boys. What's it like bartending in the u.s Compared to the UK is if the much difference Honestly not so much really obviously the different people Have different standards in New York people usually know what they want to drink so they come in they know the rider having a man hand an Old-fashioned and espresso martini, I feel like in the UK people are more willing to try something You would be maybe educated by the bartender but in New York, I find People people know what they want. Maybe that's just a New York mentality, but Yeah, not too different and then the prices is a lot more expensive for cocktails over here But ya know it's a I found that I learned a lot more about cocktails actually back in the UK with you guys people are getting a lot more campers lot more programs about how to Learn and make cocktails and I feel like the UK is a lot further ahead Than it is in some places in the u.s. So That's incredible really because you have to do a course don't you you have to pass a test to be a bartender in the u.s What's that like yeah do a qualification is a very simple It's called like a file server test, but it's more about like the hygiene so you've got to learn about them how to be hygienic when making cocktails and then it's more just about how to change a cake and it's about how to clean glasses and what kind of detergent using glass washes it's things lying around which yeah, which is good because it means that you don't need to teach them on the job and everyone knows it already so and I Guess the bartender's pay for that qualification and go off and do it off for their own accord doing Depends depends how now she bosses So then Also, you mentioned espresso martini is an introducing you I said silly boys It's at wooden or voted best. Espresso martinis. Can you can you tell us how they make it? Yes So at SUNY Board because we make a lot of cocktails they They batch everything beforehand. So they get all the spirits and we go all the spirits made up, but the main thing that Makes it so good is because it's kind of a cafe and coffee coffee Shop as well. We have cold brew espresso on tap. So we put Mr. Black and we put vodka we have the simple syrup and then we add a bit of cold brew espresso in There as well so we shake that all up and it just makes the most amazing Everyone commit good one but um when you've got good coffee, that's the thing don't change anything. So, yeah Going back to the differences bartender from the u.s. To the UK or vice versa I mean as you know in the UK, we we live off our our wage probably minimum wage or whatever. It is the bartender America is fairly similar And as far as wages go, but you get massive tips over there do the bartenders pretty much live off tips Oh, yeah, that's what it's all about. The wage is pretty much minimum wage in most Bartender salaries unless you're working at a very prestigious place, but most bars Places will give you minimum wage, but then yeah, it's all about the tips And you kind of have to tip in the u.s. You're not like whether your drink was good or not That's what the bottom is live from so yeah, yeah In the UK is to put more feet. It was amazing. But over here. It's kind of just built in to Be nice to try and get bored. No more of that culture over there Sonoma days when I used to work a Friday night the UK and if I walked away with like three quid I was happy so Definitely enough to buy a pine Exactly exactly So I also alluded to you at you were about set up a coffee shop before all this kicked off what how's that going? What you know tell us about that yeah, so It's a very small Place, that's the entrance to a gym That was one of my friends who owns and he's and he wasn't doing anything with the space for us and hey Would you be open for me to coming in and making a little coffee shop out of it? So we built it It's ready to go. It's called Darby And we're about to open the doors just Just before this happened and obviously that's taking a back seat, or hoping to open in July It's an Asda style coffee shop. There's a lot in New York and Which means they'll be flat whites. They'll be All those kind of good things so so yeah, that'd be happening soon For those people who are watching this, I've been to New York Me and Laura are lucky to go on looking on you and there are lot of coffee shops But then everyone goes to coffee shops. Don't they like the busy busy places all day and night? Yeah, New York lives off of coffee. And if there's a space you can open a coffee shop. You'll probably make money So that's kind of what? I've done and as long as it's good people look for good coffee, and that's the keys. Yeah Can't wait to get stuck into that. Hopefully yeah where we should be Orkin soon and Good Also knowing any personally. I I heard on the grapevine that I don't know how many people have seen the circle in the UK It's basically a a thing where people live in a block of flats. They never see each other they meet each other on this platform Bit like today's day and age where you're only ever interact by social media, but the social media is blocked You never see their faces. It's always text. So it's easy to catfish people so you don't actually know you're talking to Eddie. I know His face was used and was it your lifestyle to be to catfish? Someone else's someone stole your identity basically. So yeah Netflix reached out to me on Instagram of all places and we'd love to use your profile on a new show that's coming out Okay, tell me more and then Yes, the show called the circle based in the UK, but the beam into the u.s. And Yeah, they called me up and said hey if we can use your face and your profile for someone else to catfish, we'll pay you This year the circle came out in the US and I think it's an episode for some guy comes in and Pretends to be me That can happen to in that and one of them is obviously and definitely you it seems weird things seem to come my way So I'm gonna back Listen Eddie, you've been an absolute star. Thank you so much for coming on Listen everybody, Eddie Van Halen Right. So we'll post links to study boys wear. Eddie's been working after this in the comments We'll also post links to his coffee shop. Assuming he's got links for that set up and running and ready to go We'll confirm on Monday who our guest is then we'll also confirm what drink I'm gonna make any ingredients you'll need Don't forget if you're watching live tag Someone who will want to see this and tell them why that will then enter you into a competition to win free cocktails Then we'll probably tag The more chance you have in winning if you're watching on playback Hashtag cocktails every day tag someone who you think will be Interested for your chance to win free cocktails easy as that just tag someone That is me.

youtube recreational grower blue Magoo day 32 blue Magoo day 5 each on their own Scroggs 36 by 42 under a thousand watt high-pressure sodium so update time as you guys know I had a little bit of a my problem it gets a lot better I've been spraying every day with green cleaner none of the damage has spread I haven't seemed to mean the live little buggers anywhere on the leaves checking every day and I'm completely dredging this thing with green cleaner I think half ounce to a gallon right now just the upkeep but what she's doing really well it's not it doesn't seem to be affecting her too much she's really starting to get a lot of crystals built up you know we're we're into week five here I'm sorry the middle of week four where are we let's see yeah we're fine I can do math I promise and and she's really starting to fill out we've got a lot of notes on here I told you I counted 73 of them before but there's still a lot to fill in on the sides you know freak last week's left here I'm pretty sure that each one of these is gonna fill all the way and they're really looking quite symmetrical I've got a couple of them that are are kind of sticking out a little bit high here but otherwise looking looking really good so where am I good at number two day five a lot of new growth on here and this is really where I'm able to check to make sure that I'm keeping the spider mite damage down so the new growth is showing up and there's no damage on these and that the it's not it's not showing and you might damage anyways and that's really where I'm looking to see if it's spreading so on blue Magoo number one over here it's hard to tell a lot of those leads are they've been there for a long time you know she's she's she's old and she's not ground ground new leaves she's really working on blood production so it's hard to find any new growth on here to let me know any sort of indicator whether or not those mics will stop their spread but this one does have a lot of new growth stealing back out here now leave with your number two here on day five it doesn't end doesn't have the screen filled all the way up but this one here the screen is full pretty close there's a couple of spots on each corner that could fill in but blue Magoo number two is actually larger in her in her trellis right now then this other one was so my expectations are that she's gonna probably grow out on the sides and I really need to start working towards the corners as I trained her out I've been getting a lot of research watching a lot of YouTube you guys are great of course and there's I'm realizing there's quite a few different techniques with scrub then and I'm seeing that it's a lot more common for people to really just kind of use it as a trellis support system and not not this blanket of bud that I am preparing over here you know with so many nodes on here it it seems to me that I think a couple people are missing the point of what a sprog is for and instead utilizing this as nothing more than just bud support like oh my buds are gonna get happy in alarm to fall over great I mean you could you can do that with dental floss but as I'm doing over here I've got a lot of these that are coming up Paul and I'm I'm pulling them down I'm creating more more nodes available at the same height so that when they do start producing flower I know we're in the flower stage but there's still a lot of scratching she's gonna do and I think that this is the true idea of what a straw is for and I've seen a lot of people just building like big fat wide trellis systems that are great bud support but aren't really keeping those buds those nodes these top branches all the same level as I get down here you can see there isn't any high point there's going to be tall but there's a new apical bud that's gonna take all of that that oxen that growth hormone and direct all the nutrients from the from the roots so trellis awesome I don't I don't think it's a sprog and maybe that's gonna cause some trouble YouTube if you disagree please comment let me know I mean I understand street of green yeah you're using a screening but you're not really doing it we ought utilize the Intuit maximum and you're not using it to redirect oxen levels therefore creating a symmetrical button popcorn thank you I think that once I'm done with this I might be able to peel off a blanket if not which could be could be amazing but anyways thought I'd give you an update thought I'd rant a little bit here we are day five on Blu Magoo here in the straw under the thousand watt high pressure sodium with the orchid growth them on the walls my own made home beat post Prague the first blue Mugu well into flower finishing up week five she's looking great I expect her to go almost probably nine weeks people tell me that she's us they plant I never trust anybody so yeah here we are Oh before I forget so as you know spider mites are the devil I've been spraying them I've got it under control but just to be safe I'm I'm calling it and I'm gonna I'm gonna finish out these plants that are in here and I'm gonna start back over from scratch so at that point you'll see me in the bed closet here and we'll be starting over I'm going to be begging some plants or a friend's going to be vegging some plants for me so that once I thought this room cleaned out bleached out sulfur burn burnt to the ground I'll be able to pull another plant straight into flower which is going to be really nice because it's not gonna be a lot of downtime for that but Oregon law measured 91 says I can have four plants on property prior to me deciding that this was going to end I have my my recreational legal purchased plants once they were available for sale on October 1st and there's really no point in being vegging these out here YouTube they're there I don't want to risk the spider mite infestation down the road I don't want to treat spider mites for the rest of the rooms life here I want to want to be rid of the devil's and start fresh so now that I can get plants from dispensaries under measure 91 there's no reason for me to have to do with 30 plants that were donated like these ones here and I'm very appreciative of the person the donors me used to custome I love it but I'm doing the best I don't want I don't want to fight an unnecessary battle so I wanna borrow these yeah that's that's what I said we've got some conspiracy Kush here and that what else do we have yeah the ghost train pains that one's gonna take it's been 65 to 80 days this one here that conspiracy coach that's 58 these I put that in here on day 2 of flower of bloom I get number two so you know it's like 9 inches tall YouTube but that's awesome I'm gonna have flowered out we're gonna we're gonna give it the full feeding schedule we're gonna let it run its course I mean why not other than that I'm just going to end up giving it away to somebody else and risking infesting someone else for spider mites and I don't want to be bad to anybody so there we are YouTube for plants on poverty to remember tiny one of them's okay then the one is who rich is great so blue Magoo day what was that again these 33 of flower bloom a good day five of flower gostrey haze and conspiracy crush both on day three of flowers so thanks a lot YouTube subscribe like comment and we'll be back with an update certain things",

audience mystery they are mixed so I want to make sure that everybody understands what we're talking about here so let me go back to the presentation here quick let's close this alright so what was I saying that's it so you Linux ISO son then they McMahon I know Matt did the software the application operating system not to Le'Veon types there are two types of operating systems right all application has a matter of fact so one of them is open source open source versus let's say company-owned application or proprietary application for example Windows boo Microsoft all again operates on a Systema so that means Windows is owned by Microsoft it's actually it's a it's a complete property of Microsoft that means that nobody can copy or distribute or can even make any modification to the operating system unless they have this special license or agreement with Microsoft Corporation right now the difference between Microsoft properties in for example Linux or UNIX or any other operating system that belongs to open open source community is the open source community allows you basically copy modify the they distribute or customize basically chanchan open source didn't Sababa sure oh no a platoon system on all of this hall again it's yeah we got this is boom good that one Jamie at the ANA communities were open source community support so open source community there how to develop earlier engineer and I take tiller was an assassin or push add kinky wash double same as that kept your dumb spider there it's like a pull on me do not leaking look hope people cause the fish so there are developers out there architects programmers and anyone that who's active in the community is basically they can contribute in many ways to improve and to make the operating system better one of the examples is less for examples every application every software every operating system has lots of versions and lots of releases right so some of you you are or you are familiar with the Windows application or like Microsoft Microsoft for example they go back to way way back like starting say 80s 85 95 like say let's say 95 I can remember as far as 95 right windows 95 windows 98 windows millennium which is after 98 there was a second edition and then millennium and then Windows XP Professional Home Edition and then Windows I believe seven eight and then 10 so if I miss one or two releases so just because I haven't used the windows for like a long time and she moves again Linux like them was that an old version that abort released a report okay dear Mike open source community gapsin negative the open source community I saw Sonny mallanna Kanaka Jordan Lobby Radha you're the worst neighbor at key have a release level of you so the anima mix Clara English Anna so every release every upgrade every patch when they apply or when they develop a new release that's where the open community source community actually help so we should have it can be design was big alchemist

attack on them and I'm sure what should be again okay they like Madame Chapman a prison that circle again a mastaba secured a national clinic datian you okay wonderful they like let's go next page a platoon system and Linux the melody board member they met again gnu/linux any any to the content of them is what does it do okay so what's the application what's the kernel what's the CPU what's the memory what's devices so those things are you cannot see this everything is in the computer back behind the background behind the scene everything is working everything is made possible by this three four maybe five components that's called operating system so like I mentioned early so open sources that any community any people any programmers can modify and redistribute it so when we say applications first thing come to our mind is application it's like anything you see on your desktop right the the application actually I'm using as we speak is an application browsers a Word document Excel calculator anything is used by user as application and our kernel I think we already kind of touched touched on this topic is basically this makes everything possible between the applications and the rest of the operating system CPU memory and device it's like a communicator or interface I would say okay I'm not sure hardware software bla what are the trip coming to kiss ass in it budget it again being cut a full table so you know but waiter one CPU is country Balan POSIX low possible memory tsubasa should choose the kernel is officially the application that is gear response any job Larry is bullet watch can is the occupied areas that will say okey positives the began you all them again Bobby that was all choose ladder okay those of just love get a dashiki yogi should ask you there like a loft Kipnis Alton I just want to make sure that I want to bring everybody up to speed what is that learning so operating system Linux operating system is another type of operating system just like a Windows or the operating system in Apple products like an apple macbook pro macbook air tablets or even phone and any other devices okay so operating system and began this is a coop complicates target Anaka me don't be confused Judy I'm simple bull operating operating system windows the Windows operating system Intel Muslim Jonah in the master bar CPU kernel are war both dubs the

Apache web server how much system allows you should copper up when I Sherman an ET siva warned again do a good shootin okay and the unibit for a little log okay block the boo hard about the application the heart of it the bullet can walk an event should story Estrada alright so log is where you go find all the history all the logs this is where it keeps everything is happening it's basically recording it's recording the behind the scene okay so for example if you have a web server and you have you're getting an error message let's say you web server is not starting or any application is not starting right for some reason sometimes it's not visible to the user you can't they might give you like a kind of vague information said hey permission denied or this application contains some errors please reinstall the application something like that okay lake is all the tag you get multiple series you really want to know what what the problem is right maybe you can fix it so you go to the lock lock folding process look folding about a stern show was an application under specific direct a lot of are you Sherlock torch says we would get the second and we show a problem and I was a bore at the motion boo application problem Emily appropriate when the motion watching me up okay so that's what well cog and Adam in a museum cook my own be a link and pop again man I'm gonna click says be emotionally key clip that's gonna no vanishes okay they make file sistema let's talk about the file system now Bellucci i can also walk down in worship Him alone watch lenny moon

tutorial so if you go to the Preferences in your terminal this windows allows you this panel allows the change colors windows tabs shell pretty much everything you see all right so I'm not gonna do that right now so which is fine with me okay and let's see we're talking about Linux file permissions oh I think we already basically talk about the file structure so now we can talk about the file permissions nomada kind of how permissions right let's talk about that now my husband who come under the course Schumer says he Janica Bumi my husband should throw it away the mega I'm not a type

the Bala policies with the solar system below so nope nope no problem was fixed English Arusha Kim yeah we told them Toto somebody prefers English that person is still there online okay so yes hi muzaffer [Music] [Music] okay all right wonderful that's a great question first of all I just want to say say thank you for showing interest and in i.t i.t is abroad basically you understand so today I wanted to it's like a kind of a breaking ice I just wanted to reach out to my community the people that I am was big and I deeply care about helping helping out it was big community most big people with girls as the guys anyone that who's interested in this field right so it's almost like a giving back to society so I take my own personal time and I decided to put together maybe small simple presentation once a week so for now is a Sunday now besides this I also offer a private like a classes as well individual classes online classes and those of course have some fees associated some piece because I you know you know I I have a deal so of course I have to pay and you know I hope you understand myself you know I came from IT background I have a bachelor in master degree I also have I also attended high institute universities in Pakistan as well and then also here and I have a certification in many many fields Oracle IBM send certification Linux in etc now as far as the the frequency of the course I would say when I was one week but if you very committed and serious enough and maybe we can talk about offline and maybe we can customize the course for you since you are you're coming from non IT background so I'm open to any suggestions or like I said let me know what's your commitment if you want to just hey you know right now my commitment is just not very serious I just want to learn whatever I can learn then probably you may want to stick around with the open public session which is once a week but if you have a serious commitment to become ITSs like a developer IT specialist and web developer so let me just kind of mention those fields that that falls within my specialty or my reservation so so my forte is like web development that development has HTML CSS JavaScript that's for foreign front end right and then we also have the backend so back in languages like PHP and then we have access to the Pasadena is called the database my sequel so I mean so many so many places that we're gonna be using those languages so if you just imagine a simple website right so you log in to you go to website all of you pretty much every day even like a Facebook go to the Facebook even the page that you're looking at it's a web page somebody created that some developers they wrote this program so what you see is the front end right so little did you know that there are a lot of stuff might be happening in the background which are not visible to the user and that's called a back end so every time you go to the Facebook you enter username password or you look up somebody and when you click on search or any button for example right basically the front end takes the information the user input and pass it on back to the tutor to the back end okay so so this is just the interface and the back and basically grabs it and does what it's supposed to do looks up in the table and if it finds it they'll come back and say okay hey I found this information now go ahead give it to a user and then the front-ends job is basically formats that massage the data puts a nice form a nice layout and represents us to you basically say hey I found this what you're looking for okay so everything is whole architecture is a vet development those kind of stuff that I can help you with operating system Linux any building projects basically all right so if anyone has any interest in a desire that you just want to pursue those fields I'm here let me know I'm available anytime besides you know my full-time job is I'm an IT director in one of the healthcare companies in Manhattan you know I have huge responsibilities I mentor also a lot of young you know newcomers to IT like for example even like yourself that who has well interest in an IT background all right I hope that explains and then answer your question all right anyone else we've got about a couple minutes for questions and answers everybody okay anybody has any questions so far

bake slash product flower review this one is from 420 dank sugar cookie it's a hybrid I don't have any like the the big big nugs there was only like one or two of them in there I forgot to take all the small ones so that you could see the big mugs it's kind of hard for me to show you specifically what this looked like on these smaller nuns kind of breaking these ones up I accidentally broke the big one up to actually put inside the doobie but whatever [ __ ] it so this is sugar cookie the Terps are peppery citrus and hoppy sugar cookie is an indica dominant hybrid with an A a romantic sweetness that is likely to have influenced this strange name you might think this hybrid belongs in the same family as the same Girl Scout cookies but it's genetics say otherwise sugar cookie is a three-way cross between Crystal Gayle blue Hawaiian and Sam C star together passing on the resonance qualities of a Northern Lights ancestor along with tropical fruit and berry flavors it definitely tastes sweet though your new favorite midnight snack may just be sugar cookie as it delivers a deep full-body calm before lulling you into a deep sleep awesome that is not what I thought I was smoking this morning I don't want to go back to bed but sugar cookies night-night I tasted it yesterday it was really good still very tasty after this video I think I'm gonna do one on my big gas live arousing cart resin carton not rosin present very sweet taste you definitely get a little bit of that berry flavor but big shout out to all the new subs big shout out to all the old subs you know thank you for coming joining the channel I thought I had to begin anything welcome to the shed I appreciate you guys thank you for coming on over and the people that I know they can't see this if they left but for all the people are leaving you know terribly sorry that I wasn't your cup of tea in the morning or whatever you want to call it you know not like someone that's got like all the information you know when it comes to growing and things like that I've never grown my own weed in my life so so I can't give a [ __ ] ton of information on grow processes and things like that I hear that growing with nectar is better and it typically yields a higher return rate on you know how much weed is produced but to actually see that with my own two eyes like picking up some clothes growing them with nectar versus oh my last batch was growing outside with natural lights and whatever I wouldn't know anything to tell you about that I'm trying to keep up on which states are going for medical which states are going for pretty much anything really just trying to keep up on it so if nothing you know breezed in Hazel Park is open still just medical at the moment I was I tried to check their side because he said probably you know they're like two to three weeks when they first opened I think it's roughly been two weeks so we'll see what happens I also saw someone post something about uh based on the was either the growers or the caregiver laws that they're coming up with that prices in Michigan for a rack could shoot up again which I think it's just an excuse for them and [ __ ] milk more money out of people before we go crazy with like another like thirty forty stores i stupid you're gonna get your tax money you don't need to nickel and dime us to get more money you know you're gonna get it people are gonna smoke the [ __ ] weed there's no hand you know hands down so if you're gonna offer it at stores and I offered it a fair reasonable price people are going to come in and they're gonna buy it twice as much at that price first is kicking it up to seventy five and eight eighty and eight if you say it's gonna skyrocket I'm imagine what you're gonna want like one hundred and eight kiss my ass you're gonna go buy that they're gonna go to their local people again I bite through a dealer on the street before I buy through a disco I'm not paying those [ __ ] prices you know sixty I would have paid seventy five a little you know seventy-five for some super killer [ __ ] like I mean it better be [ __ ] killer for me to pay that price otherwise I'm just gonna take that money I'm gonna put it on some diamonds or some [ __ ] couple grams will access some [ __ ] but if you guys aren't following me yet and going over to Instagram and follow me at the shed its felt the same way but it has three spaces because apparently other people had the name so I had to put three spaces and to keep my name with my logo up there and it's not like I got a shit-ton content on there just yet but I think that that's gonna have to be part of the way I do my giveaways so whereas I said I'm still figuring that stuff out but I will get to that soon and I will have a reasonable request when it comes to subs likes comments and shares Oh their problem with this wake up bake is it made my stomach feel empty and but with that being said as a sugar cookies from 420 dank so if you got your mad card you can go get the same [ __ ] I'm smoking on and probably my next few videos other than the donkey butter which I will be doing right later today real sweet berry tastes good I definitely feel it in my eyes definitely feel like it definitely lowered me down like I feel like if I went and laid down I cry sleep for another hour so so indica all the way I would say a pretty strong indigo if I had to guess but with that being said like it's a little low go down there and saw em hit the bell for future no future contact and if you enjoy my stuff and the happy smoking I'll catch you guys in the next one peace out", "rQhYAYygjeI": "tell everyone a computer shot given us in to ask Amy about how they would like to be doing here SKB joy Bangla chai tea r82

show you my quick and easy royal icing recipe to make this really simple rural icing recipe you'll need powdered sugar meringue powder water and vanilla extract you can use any flavoring you like such as lemon juice almond extract or really anything else will work first I add my meringue powder to my powdered sugar some people will actually whip their meringue powder with water before adding it to their powdered sugar but I prefer this method because there will be less air bubbles in the resulting icing once that's mixed together I'll add in my water and my flavouring and I'm going to add a little bit more water to my cup just because I'll need it to thin it down later and just in case my icing is a little too dry to begin with so using my hand mixer at a low speed I'm going to mix together all the ingredients until it starts to come together you'll see it's a little bit too crumbly at first I'm going to add just a little bit more water always add water in just a little bit at a time because you don't want to thin it down too quickly after a few minutes of mixing on a low speed will start to come together into something that's really nice and creamy but it's also a really thick icing and this is the start of your stiff consistency icing I'm going to keep mixing on a low to medium speed for another about five minutes until it's really nice and fluffy and opaque you'll actually see the color change over time it'll start as like a you know kind of a yellowy off-white color but the more air bubbles you mix into the icing it'll start to become whiter and whiter of course if you need a really will stark white icing either omit the vanilla completely and or add in a white food coloring and now we have our nice stiff consistency icing and you can tell it's stiff consistency because it's forming a fairly stiff peak the peak pops up and curls over just slightly when the spoon is lifted up from the surface and this is the perfect consistency to use when you're using any sort of piping tip and you want to create a lot of detail such as with a flower or a leaf or even a nice border otherwise it's really hard to pipe I wouldn't recommend outlining or flooding with this because it's very stiff and thick speaking of outlining I'm gonna thin this down a little bit by adding a little bit more water just a little bit at a time until I get the perfect piping consistency icing and piping consistency icing feels a lot like a toothpaste consistency it's kind of thick but it doesn't form a stiff peak it sort of flows back into into itself but it doesn't form a flat surface so you can see it's a really gentle peak when the spoon has lifted up from the surface and it will it'll be perfect for writing for outlining or for creating any sort of small details to fill the piping bag I stick the corner of the piping bag into the bottom of a cup and I fold the edges over the lip of the cup and then I spoon the icing directly into the piping bag and this ensures that there is not a lot of mess there is an icing that's going everywhere and it just makes it really easy to fill my piping bag now to create the flood consistency icing and flood consistency icing can be a lot of different thicknesses a lot of people like 22nd 15 second or 10 second you'll hear a lot of timing involved with flood consistency and that just means how long it takes for the icing to come back to a flat surface so some people prefer really fast a really thin icing such as a 10 second icing some people prefer something a little bit thicker like a 20 second I find that the perfect icing for me is about 10 to 15 seconds you'll see the icing is flowing back into a nice smooth surface after just a few seconds and even after all these years I still count to myself to make sure I have the right consistency icing but that went by really fast so let's count again 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and now it's almost completely back to a flat surface that's what I want but we're not quite ready to put our icing into a piping bag first we want to get rid of as many air bubbles as possible and to do that I let my icing sit for 30 seconds to a minute and watch all those air bubbles rise to the surface and then I take my spatula and pop them by just kind of scraping it over the surface of the icing and then stirring it by spreading that icing around the edges of the bowl sometimes I'll even do this whole step a second time just to make sure there aren't any more air bubbles you okay now I think we've gotten rid of most if not all of the air bubbles that exists in that icing so it's time to put into our piping bag so once again I put a piping bag into a cup and I fold the edges of the piping bag over the lip of the cup and then spoon my icing directly into the piping bag and because I'm using a little bit more flood consistency icing than you know piping or stiff consistency I don't really have room in my piping bag to knot the end of it so I use this bag clip you can really use any bag clip or even a rubber band to tie it off it just makes it a little bit easier and you can refill the bag easily so there you have it that's how I make my roll icing I

[Music]", "GO0_aNbL6Do": "hi again in this video I'm talking about royal icing and consistency adjustments realizing is my favorite decorating medium but let me back up before I dive into how to make it let me talk about the typical decorating icings that are used on cookies and why it is I prefer this one typically there are three one is royal icing the second is confectioners icing also known as glaze and the other is rolled fondant which is a sweet sugary dough I prefer royal icing because it's made with confectioners sugar and egg whites as opposed to confectioners icing which is made with confectioner sugar and some other liquid elements such as water or lemon juice or milk and that might not sound like a big difference but it is the egg whites have a lot of protein in them and they cause the icing to set up and dry very very quickly that becomes important if you're doing a lot of cookies that require a lot of layering of icing the faster those under layers can drive the more quickly you can move on to the next step likewise if you're doing wet-on-wet techniques which we'll talk about a couple videos from now where the icings go down wet next to each other the faster the dry the less likely are the colors are to bleed into one another so there are a lot of advantages to royal icing from a drying standpoint those egg whites also give it a high tensile strength that's the engineer and me coming out but it may means it makes the icing more stretchy so it allows for more delicate line work and detail work as for roll fondant I mentioned that that's a sweet sugary dough some decorators will cover their whole cookies with it I'm really not fond of doing that I don't like the texture of it it will dry crunchy but when you chew on it it reverts to kind of a gummy quality which I think interferes with the taste of the cookie so I do love how rolled fondant can be shaped and molded but I'll typically only use it for small isolated elements on cookies that one can pluck off if they don't like the texture of it so royal icing is my favorite and I'm going to show you how I make it the recipe is also an ultimate cookies and cookie swap but I think it also helps to see how I blend it because consistency is so so with his icing as we'll learn not only in this video but as we move forward so here we've got I start with my basic batch of royal icing starts with two pounds of powdered sugar that's a standard sized bag in the grocery store and I've already got that in the bowl to that I add about 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar which is an acid that lends a little acidity obviously sharpness to the icing but more importantly it keeps the white whiter over a longer period of time so if you're doing show pieces like gingerbread houses that white icing will stay really crisp some decorators add white food coloring to their icing to keep the white I've never had to do that and perhaps it's because I use cream of tartar so that goes in at this point you want to give it a quick stir to distribute that cream of tartar and then the next element that goes in is the egg whites in order to contain any risk of contamination from Salmonella you want to be certain to work with pasteurized egg whites which come in different forms you can use those that come in the container and typically five large egg whites which is what I call for in this recipe would be about 11 to 12 tablespoons of this product alternatively you can work with pasteurized shell shell eggs so these eggs are actually pasteurized in the shell and they're marked with a P and that's what I've got measured out over there I will say that these eggs are much more difficult to separate in the typical egg so you may have to use a little bit more than five large egg whites you might have to crack six of these to get the equivalent liquid content one other alternative to using moist pasteurized eggs is meringue powder and this works well as as well this is simply dehydrated egg whites with some other additives that typically a sugar in it and some other clumping agents that keep it powdery and this would need to be hydrated that is mixed with warm water before you actually put it into the royal icing I typically don't work with it because it can be gritty unless you really dissolve it first and it tends to make the royal icing a little bit more spongy than if you were to work with these products here but that's also a possibility okay on to making it I've got roughly five large egg whites in there they're just going into the ball now this juncture since I've got a really small mixer here I'm going to stir to combine so my powdered sugar doesn't fly everywhere and start this on low speed and my royal icing I'm before I start that my royal icing mixes to a very thick consistency I do that on purpose because when you start mixing you'll notice that the icing is kind of gray and murky and loose you have to mix it a relatively long period of time for it to turn crisp white and the incorporation of air is what makes it go from gray to white so I'm so it's very very thick when I do this because I don't want to pump a lot of air bubbles in it I need to mix it long enough that it gets white but I don't want to incorporate a lot of air so I mix it thick if I were to mix it much looser I'd end up with much more air bubbles in the end product so I'm going to start low just to get it going and once that I see that I've got a mass of sugar combined with the egg whites I'm just going to scrape it down because the powdered sugar does like to kind of ride up the side of the mixed mixer and make sure it's all in the center part of the mixer and it'll be safe pretty soon to turn this to high speed I only mix for about one to two minutes that's generally long enough to get this really sharp white and very very thick okay so it's starting to come together and I'm just going to turn it up to high speed and we're going to continue to mix until it's very very thick okay so now the powdered sugar and the egg white serve have come together but it's still kind of an off-white it's kind of a dirty white so I'm going to kick it up the high high speed the highest it will go pull makes this maybe for one to two minutes and you should see a color change it should be very crisp white by the time it's done you may have to scrape down the sides of the bowl in the process but we're just going to let this go for a bit before I do that and as you incorporate air not only does it get whiter but the icing also thickens considerably now some bakers have recipes that require them to beat for 10 minutes I see no reason for that I beat simply as long as it takes person becomes thick and very crisp white and usually that's about 1 to 2 minutes after it's come together and we're about at that point so I'm going to turn off the mixer and show you what it looks like so as you can see crisp white very very very thick in fact this is so thick I call it glue in my book and you'll hear me referring back to glue as in the course of these videos and I'm referring to icing at this consistency that's made with two pounds of powdered sugar about 5 large egg whites and a half teaspoon cream of tartar this is the perfect consistency for putting together gingerbread houses and gluing three-dimensional cookies together but obviously it's not going to work to create a smooth icing topcoat and some other effects on cookies that we'll talk about later it needs to be thin to the right consistency for almost every decorating task so I'm going to show you a little bit about how to do that but first before I do that this would be the time to actually flavor up the icing so let me get the beater back on there I encourage you to flavor up your icing to taste everybody has a different flavor profile but I do have some suggested flavor combinations and quantities in my book I'm going to put in about in each each flavoring flavors differently as well extracts flavor differently than oils lemon tastes different than anise so again flavoring to taste is usually a good rule of thumb in my book I put in a teaspoon of lemon we'll stir that up but it's important that the cookies taste as good as they look so we want to make sure that's properly flavored and now we're ready to move on to consistent coloring the icing and consistency adjustments normally for this task I would dole out a smaller quantity of the icing because that's that that quantity there is about four and a half to five and a half cups depending on how long you mixed it and the size the exact size of the egg whites and that can cover hundreds of cookies top coat hundreds of cookies and often times I'm not doing a run that large so I usually will dole it into smaller quantities as I am about to do to color it up and now is the time I like to color it actually when it's very very thick as opposed to loosen I don't know what the science is here but I find that and you'll see I just want to point this out this clings very nicely to the spoon and in fact you might come back tomorrow and I'd still be standing here and still be stuck to this spoon so this is what I mean about the glue consistency that's kind of what you're looking for at this stage and this is the stage at which I color because for whatever reason I find that the color sets better with less modeling and spotting if I mix it in when it's thick and then later thin to different consistencies if I put the color in when the icing is very very loose it tends to migrate more as it dries and I just never get the same smooth even finish as I do if I call her this way a word on food colorings as you're going to hear in all of these videos consistency is king for your icing so if you're taking you know all these precautions to bring your icing to the right consistency the last thing you want to do is mess with it by putting in a lot of liquid food coloring to make a really intense color if that's what you're going for so I tend to prefer in fact I very much prefer working with a highly concentrated food coloring and I work with a liquid gel also known as a soft gel food coloring highly concentrated and a little bit goes a long way so it doesn't mess with the icing consistency as much you can also work with a gel or paste food coloring which is even more concentrated but the disadvantage of this form is it usually comes in a little container which makes it very difficult to dole out into the icing you have to do it with a toothpick in this case with a trussing needle what use for other tasks and just is very very messy and it doesn't allow you to create color formulas the advantage of this type is that it often comes with a dropper top which allows me to actually count out drops of coloring and create precise formulas I'm going to show you what I mean by a little bit goes a long way I'm just going to put in a couple drops of pink here another comment on food colorings I prefer certain brands some have very strong aftertaste particularly in the colors of blue black and purple and I find that Chef master brand not only does it come in this size with this dropper top but it tends to be much more mildly flavored so a little bit of pink goes a little bit along goes quite a long way as you can see that's just two drops in about a cup of icing that's about a medium pink if I wanted a little bit darker we just add a few more drops and this is still a glue consistency but if I were to use it for other tasks it's going to need to be thinned out and I'm going to talk a little bit about consistency adjustments there are many that I described in the book but I'm going to talk about the three that I use most commonly the first is for outlining which is creating thin lines with a parchment pastry cone and that requires a relatively thick icing but not quite as thick as this generally I add about Oh half a teaspoon to 3/4 of a teaspoon of water to icing of this thickness to get it to the right consistency I'm not sure the exact quantity and I add that to about one cup of my glue I'm not sure what quantity I have in this bowl so I'm just going to eyeball it at this point I can do this all by feel just by how the icing looks and feels to the spoon but if you're a beginner I would recommend you start with the guidelines in the book the measurements I provide and move from there I'm just going to add a touch more water and you'll notice that I'm not using the electric mixer at this point because I'm adding moisture in liquid I don't want to be whipping it at high speed on an electric mixer and popping a lot of air bubbles into it so I'm going to be stirring from here on out when I do any kind of thinning of icing so this is looking about where I want it for outlining which is again piping thin lines and borders on cookies it's about 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon for cup of glue and what I'm looking for is for it to fall and blobs off my spoon essentially like so and that should be a perfect consistency for outlining we'll talk more about consistency adjustments in each of the videos as I tackle the actual technique but again I just wanted to show you these few consistency adjustments so you get a sense of what you're really looking for here's another roughly 1 cup of glue that I made before and this time I want to loosen it to what I call I'm gonna get this icing off my hand what I call top coating consistency which is the consistency with which you would spread icing on a cookie to leave a flat glassy surface and I often do top coating without a border so I like this a little bit thicker than what you might know of as flooding consistency which we'll talk about next so for top coating to this cup of glue I generally add about one and a half to two and a half teaspoons of water again stirring stirring it in make and I do this by feel now but because it has become second nature I do a lot a lot of cookie decorating every day of the week but to start helps to measure it out and also to know what visual cues you're really looking for I do have a range on this this one and a half to two and a half teaspoons because I want it a little bit thicker top coating for me is covering a cookie without any outline or dam so I wanted a little bit thicker for smaller cookies so it doesn't run off the cookie edge it can be a little bit looser for larger cookies so that's why I have that range on the the proportions there and I'm just going to put in and add another half teaspoon that takes us to about 2 teaspoons of water in there and this is going to be just about right now this one wasn't tinted but hopefully you can see here I'm looking for the icing to flow relatively slowly off the spoon as opposed to plopping for outlining is flowing relatively slowly and those tracks you know when the icing hits the bowl it creates these tracks they should disappear in roughly 15 second or so into the bulk of the rest of the icing if it's at the right consistency so that's top coding consistency when I'm not working with the icing because of the protein in the egg whites it crusts very very quickly so I always cover it with plastic wrap sometimes and oftentimes flush with the plastic wrap to prevent that skin from forming because after you've done this the last thing you want is ice crystals or rather sugar crystals in the bulk of bulk of your icing because they can plug parchment cones and reach all sorts of havoc oops this one I've already mixed outlining consistency earlier I'm going to take 1/3 cup of the thick glue I think this is a little less than a cup and show you what it looks like when it comes to flooding consistency so to distinguish flooding from top coating flooding is when I actually already outlined the perimeter of the cookie and I want to flood the interior with a really loose icing to give it a smooth top coat I could work with top coating icing for this most certainly but you can move a little bit faster if you just loosen it up a bit and since you've got the outline acting as a dam on the cookie there's no risk of runoff if you have it a little bit looser and in this case I generally use anywhere from 2 to 3 teaspoons of water per cup of that glue and again there's a range on it because I will go heavier with the water if I've got a larger cookie to smoothly topcoat and you'll see some of this in the next video so I think I've put in about two teaspoons there maybe a little bit too much for this quantity having a hard time work in the water in and now when working with this flooding consistency icing you want to be especially careful not to pump too much air into it because this is when you're going to be incorporating a lot more bubbles because the icing is looser so I'm trying to stir as gently as possible this to me I overshot with the water I had less than a cup of icing in here and it's running really fast off the spoon what I'm typically looking for is it to run less fast off the spoon and for the tracks to disappear in 10 seconds or less and I don't know if you can see but they're disappearing almost immediately but you know that's actually not a big deal and I'm glad I made this steak the other thing you know that tells me I made a mistake is I've got clumps of icing that aren't distributing well into the liquid so I've made a mistake but you can always correct it by adding more powdered sugar to thicken it up I do prefer to sift the powdered sugar in because powdered sugar can get clumpy and those clumps can pop clogged cones and pastry bags and things and hopefully this will thicken it up just enough to about the right consistency I like it when I don't make these kinds of mistakes because less stirring you do of flooding icing the less air you kick into it so I may have added just a just overshot a bit too much but if you see a lot of air bubbles in it you can wrap the bowl on the counter top that pops some of the air bubbles as we get into the outlining top coating video and flooding videos I'll be showing you how to use a trussing needle also known as a turkey laser to kind of pop any air bubbles that do end up kicking themselves up into the icing so there you go a little bit thicker it's got a little bit more body and it's not racing off the spoon quite as fast this would be a good consistency for a very large cookie I might even thicken it up further for a smaller cookie say to one to two inch cookie that's it unroyal icing and the basic consistency adjustments there are many more consistency adjustments dedicated to each techniques such as dipping stenciling and marbling which you'll find in ultimate cookies and as we'll talk about in the future videos and until then Liz sweetly", "jD1Y4Lc5DmA": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I've got some Girl Scout cookies hybrid flour from true leave we've got a THC percentage of fifteen point eight C VG's at 0.6% that's a total of sixteen point four percent cannabinoids these are fifty three dollars a jar normally I had a ten percent discount today so that brings it down to forty seven seventy is still too expensive for flour but I decided to go ahead and I've been hearing a lot of things on the forums about people not being happy with the $53.00 eights from truly which doesn't make any sense at all because it's the most expensive eights they have so I figured I'd check it out myself and see if they really are putting crappy little mini buds in these things which why why would you do that so here we go let's open it up see how smells and looks we got a nice steel in there looks like we got a bunch of tiny little mini buds really yep that's what it is little minis huh this has a really interesting smell to it it's kind of like it's definitely an earthy smell it'll be a little bit of a sweetness to it that smells like sweet dirt almost yeah let's take a look at these things all right look at this these are very small these are definitely small so this is what people have been talking about and not happy to get smalls when they pay for you know a regular eighth and you came out with the smalls product for a cheaper price so what's the deal why are we paying fifty three dollars for this what's why are we paying less half price for the smalls I is this a four gram ounce I mean a 4 gram eighth I bet it's not a 4 gram eight all right so let's look at it looks like the boats have some nice purply purply leaves on them or purpley calyxes I should say they're very compact dense nugs you're digging a bed you got some compact dense snugs on them and it looks like they got a nice coating of trichomes that smell very interesting smell maybe maybe a little bit of a Sour Diesel kind of smell in there too it's not a very pungent aroma at all I'm surprised by that I figured I'd be a little bit more pungent in that let's get this weight up and then we'll go on for some close-ups all right 3.5 so right on the money right on the money 8 I guess those are becoming more common with truly gone all right let's get some close-ups of this stuff okay let's take a look at these baby little nugs here so they got a nice amount of trichomes on the surface they don't smell very potent you know they don't smell that dank or very pungent it looks like this is about one of the biggest buds in here these two you see how small they are a little bit closer so as you can see they do have a nice amount of trichomes for the size of buds they are it's not super dank you know does this justify the $53 price tag no it does not I don't think so how does how is it justified to pay double for this when you get even better when you buy minis it doesn't make sense so they don't smell that pungent they don't look that amazing they look good they do look good they have a good amount of trichomes on them you can see a bunch of bare patches too though they're not fully covered so yeah I can kind of see why people have been complaining if this is what's happening you know couldn't you understand let's get these things toked oh and I almost forgot to mention that Girl Scout cookies is a cross between oh gee cush and Durbin poison comes out of California and it's just gonna be around for a long time to come it's so popular you know it's just one of those strains that people fell in love with so let me get some of this stuff choked up and we'll see how it is tell you about the effects and I'm hittin the bong so we'll see how smooth it is - all right where's all you scissors they want to pick a nice purpley bud that's covered pretty well we'll see how it does get this all chopped up here so you know not too happy with the whole situation of true leave kind of playing cat and mouse with their stock right now it's it's a little bit silly to me I mean you know you should be building long-term customer relationships right now that's the whole point of a rollout like you're doing to gain market share and if you just piss people off while making weed available to them at the same time then when someone who doesn't piss them off comes along probably gonna go do that don't you think I'd say so actually I'm gonna really power this thing up so I can get a good hit of it you're really go ahead a bit you'll really be able to see how smooth it is I might be hacking the shadow knows already death got that chopped up pretty well get this bull pack here that's probably good that'll probably do me up nicely see so not too excited about the lack of selection stuff lately but I'd say true we did have a big selection today there were like six strains and eights and they also had like four or five strains and pre-rolls it's pretty decent selection but in general like you know fluence not delivering flower here right now harvest isn't delivering delivering any flower I believe I can is out of flower I mean the selection sucks man come on guys come on all right let's get Wow so that is a very smooth smoke I probably could have gotten away without coughing on that to be honest with you it's pretty nice I can feel the effects definitely already I like about a bomb really because it's quick oh man you get one more of those I think I could do with one more of them the flavor man I mean it's smoked flavor really there so unfortunately you know smoking does have a little bit of a different effect for me so it is worth it at some times and you know like you like you just saw you can just take a really big hit pretty quickly and walk away and you're done for a little while you don't really have to sit there and do a whole session and all that good stuff setting up a joint and smoking it can take a little while a pipe I find I often pack the pipe but because it's so unenjoyable sitting there smoking on a pipe I'll end up not smoking the pipe you know I mean it'll just sit there and I'll be like dang I'm not medicated like I should be well you have been smoking it because it's so dang harsh and so you know there's trade-offs with all the methods all the methods have got rolling trade-offs keep that in mind at all times and also keep your hands and arms at all times so are you safe put off by bears number two number two see we got number two [Music] that here was definitely a little harder oh man you sure I got that bowl oh yeah we did all right so I've had a couple of bong heads of this stuff broke out cookie come in on that 13.8% um you know I'm not the most medicated I've ever been in my whole life but I can definitely feel it it's not a couch lot kind of thing I definitely could do some housework right now just some cleaning done that kind of thing so yeah it's not that a full body medicated feeling it's mostly mostly in your head mostly so there you go I would say that this is a bad deal do not buy Girl Scout cookies at 53 dollars why would you you know everybody on the forums is saying you're gonna get minis and you are and you're not even gonna get a heavy jar you're gonna get three point five on the money apparently or under I've seen a couple people say they had under and what's the benefit I don't understand it relieved so I mean you know I guess really the only way to think of the minis is it's just a little sale it's a little flash sale that's it it's not an it's not a product that they're keeping on the shows so tisk tisk and I can't wait till we have more selection right guys I think that's what we all are pretty much thinking at this point so thank you very much for watching you all have a good", "HPhn6kicDYQ": "I was going everybody I just wanted to do a quick update and let you guys see how the ladies are doing everything is outstanding in here everything standing standing upright praying and I've got if you could see a bunch of the barley cover crops starting to come up and some of the other cover crop poking through since I added the new mulch layer the new compost layer we've had a lot of activity the beds have really responded the worms have come up to the surface and are all deep inside the compost layer doing their thing turning it to houmous so you know the growth has just been tremendous so I'm really happy to see very happy plants with lots of growth been topping we've got plant count the past couple grows I was a little out of compliance with my plant count and so now we're on the money and we're gonna have to have to do some some training letting things get big and then filling it in and weaving it in to fit these spots here so in each bed we've kind of got a dead space that we have to deal with and figured since I'm on the tube as much as I am compliance is probably a smarter option so here we are with our compliant beds and the growth has just been just been so good really really happy this plant has kind of went a little funky on us and we got some kind of yellowing almost like it hit a little hot spot in the soil when I remanded maybe I threw down a little heavy here and and it could be just a hot spot or it's just a sensitive sucker and she's looking like she'll come out of it so I'm not losing any sleep we've got a couple that are that were little smaller than the others but so far everything once the once they really set there it's an explosion they just take off I mean they're just really roaring so I'm happy I'm happy with the way things are going I've been doing the method one full years and once a week on the weekend the want to try to find you a good worm shot here so anyway there's a lot more activity up here at the surface whereas before I was having to do quite a bit of dig in to see any worms moving around so I'm happy to see activity pretty much everywhere I scrape I'm seeing activity so new cover crops coming up and in some spots it's really it's like it's lifting the hay cover crop it looks kind of cool and that's allowing oxygen down into into the compost layer you know this help facilitating that aerobic activity that's so necessary for the food soil web so yeah very happy with the blue Magoo my little Craigslist score turned out to be a score for a change and I'm getting ready to pop the beans to send off this the seed tests for the square one genetics and then I think I'm gonna pop something from redline so medically fit and THC Titan thanks a lot for sending me those beans and sorry it's taken me a while to pop them I hope I hope it's still valuable data for you at this juncture so peanut butter cookies and then I can't remember exactly the other ones from

the decorating company in New York City I am going to show you how to make oil icing we got in this bowl five and a half cups of sifted confectioner sugar and we're going to add seven tablespoons of egg whites and then we're going to stir it up and beat it up so here I'm going to pour in the egg whites and I'm just going to stir it up so that when we go to mix it with the hand mixer sugar doesn't go flying this confectioner sugar has been prease if tenacity or confectioner sugar always when you're decorating cookies because any little lumps and bumps in the icing will make it difficult for you to get the icing through the little pastry tube alright we've got this pretty moistened so this looks good I think we're going to leave a little bit more egg once we'd like to keep the ice and thick so they can dilute it with food coloring but you can tell if you're it's a little dry and just add tiny bit of egg whites as needed so that's it a little more egg whites and we're just going to pour in a little bit maybe a tablespoon and give it another go okay so you want to see if any soft peaks have formed so we've got very stiff peaks at this time so we're going to give it a little more egg whites okay so this is nice and stiff and what's great about having it stiff is if when you add the food coloring it actually dilutes the royal icing so if you start with it nice and stiff you can make deep colors without diluting your icing and then when you need to dilute it for flooding you can go ahead and add more egg whites so the main thing about confectioner sugar is the consistency so I'm going to show you how to do piping consistency and flooding consistency and I'm going to take a spatula and scrape the sides down because any little bits of icing that sit up on the sides of the bowls are going to dry out much more quickly than the bulk of the stuff that's all together so I'd like to keep it all down at the bottom of the bowl so now I'm just going to take a damp cloth super-important to cover it with a damp cloth if you even if you covered with saran wrap it's not good enough you need to keep moisture in the icing otherwise you'll get crunchies everywhere in your icing will be really difficult so going with", "EB9I3Od0K74": "[MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, guys. It's Tracy from the decorating\nroom here at Wilton. Have you ever seen those\ncolorful decorated cookies that are so popular in\nbakeries and in social media? Now if you've ever wanted to\nmake these beautiful cookies, then you're in luck\nbecause today I'm making the royal icing you need\nto make these cookies amazing. The icing I'm going to show you\nis a thinned down royal icing. And some people know it as\nflow-in icing or flood icing. It's actually all\nthe same thing. And then the decorating\nroom, we refer to it as thinned down royal icing. This icing dries to\na smooth hard finish that looks like porcelain. And once it's set,\nit's pretty durable, which makes it perfect to\npresent as gifts like in treat bags or boxes, unlike\ncookies iced in buttercream which never fully dry. Now in case you\nare wondering, this is the exact same recipe we used\nin the Wilton decorating room, and we've used this icing\non hundreds and thousands of cookies. Now I love this recipe\nfor icing cookies because it's so versatile,\nand the consistency is completely adjustable. I also like that it's\nmade with meringue powder because it makes your\nicing shelf stable. Now some recipes use raw egg\nwhites, which is traditional. But using meringue powder\nallows you to make the icing up to two weeks in advance and\nstore the decorated cookies at room temperature without\nany of the safety concerns that come from using raw egg whites. Now thinning icing\nis fairly simple, and it's really fun to play\naround with and experiment. Even if you're a\ntotal beginner, you'll be making perfect\ncookie icing in no time. Now let's start with the\nbase of our cookie icing, which is a modified version\nof our royal icing recipe. We have the recipe\nin the link below, but I have some\nadditional tips for you. Now if you've made\nroyal icing before, you already know the importance\nof sifting your powdered sugar because it can sometimes\nclump together and especially important to sift powdered sugar\nwhen you're decorating cookies. Now not only can the small\nsugar particles clog your tip, but any small lumps\nand bumps will show up after your icing dries. Now make sure to use\na clean mixing bowl free from any grease\nbecause your icing will not set up when it comes\nin contact with grease. Now here's our\nsecret for achieving the right consistency-- slightly under beat your icing. Our royal recipe calls\nfor about seven minutes of beating on a stand mixer,\nbut for cookie decorating, probably around five\nminutes is enough. But what's more important to\nlook for is the right texture. Now, you want it\nto be thick, shiny, and smooth just like this. Not light and fluffy. And beating this icing too long\nwill make your icing foamy. And once it dries,\nit could be crumbly. And my last tip is to\nalways cover your icing. Royal icing starts to dry very\nquickly when exposed to air. After making your icing,\nimmediately scrape the sides and cover your bowl\nwith a damp cloth so that it doesn't dry out. Or place your icing in a bowl\nwith a tight fitting lid. Otherwise, you could end up\nwith small, dried particles of icing that will be\nvery hard to dissolve and will also clog your tips. And it's a good idea to keep\nyour spatulas clean maybe in a glass of water\nwhile you're working, and cover your filled icing\nbags with a damp cloth as well. Today, I'm going to make two\nconsistencies of royal icing-- a medium consistency\nfor outlining and a thin consistency\nfor covering a cookie. Using these two icings will make\nit so much easier for beginners to avoid overflowing. The icing that covers\nthe entire cookie needs to be thin so that it\nfloods the surface evenly to create a smooth finish. But using this icing alone is\nhard because it's very fluid, and it could run down\nthe sides of the cookie. To prevent that, we\nrecommend piping and outline with a medium consistency\nicing that creates a dam to hold in the thin icing. To make medium\nconsistency icing, I'm starting with a 1/2 a\ncup of stiff royal icing. And I'm adding an 1/8\nof a teaspoon of water. I'm going to use a small\nflat silicone spatula to mix. I like using a silicone spatula\nbecause it makes it easier to scrape the sides, but you\ncan use any flat utensil. I also like to use our\nangled or a flat spatula. Now flat surfaces keep\nair pockets from forming. So I definitely\nrecommend flat spatulas over spoons, which\nhave curves to them. Now I'm stirring very carefully. You can see I'm not moving\nup and down with my spatula. I'm getting to all\nthe sides of the bowl using a figure eight motion. Now using a flat tool\nand gentle mixing motion prevents air from\ngetting into your icing so that you don't\nget air bubbles. Now you might be tempted to stir\nquickly just to get it done, but that will definitely\ncreate air bubbles. Because of weather\nor temperature, sometimes you'll need to\nadd a tiny bit more water to get the right consistency. Now if you do, just add\na little bit at a time, and don't worry too much\nabout being perfect. Thinning icing is\nnot an exact science. Just focus on seeing and\nfeeling the right consistency. It should be more\nspreadable than stiff-- kind of like marshmallow fluff. And as you can see,\nmedium consistency still has some body to it. It should have soft\nto medium peaks when you pick it up\nwith your spatula. This makes it so much\neasier to control when piping outlines, especially\nif you have intricate shapes. I'll keep going with the\nsame bowl and thin this all the way down to thin\nconsistency or flood icing. Now this is what we will use\nto cover the entire surface of the cookie. It needs to be thin enough so\nthat it flows on the surface and self levels so that it\ndries to a smooth finish. But it needs to\nbe thick enough so that there's enough body to it. To make flood\nconsistency, you'll need to add a half\na teaspoon of water to every half a cup of\nstiff icing to start. Now since I already added\nthe 1/8 a teaspoon of water to my medium icing, I'll\njust add a little more water. Now just as we did with\nour medium consistency, we are stirring very gently\nwith the flat tool, again, using a figure eight motion. I'm even more careful\nhere because thin icing is more prone to air bubbles. We want to avoid air\nbubbles because they will rise to the surface\nas the cookie dries, and they can create\ntiny craters. Once again, you will\nprobably need more than this, but it's better to\nstart with less. Now gradually add\nsmall drops at a time until you reach the\nconsistency of something like school glue,\nmaybe a little thicker. A clean medicine\ndropper is a great tool to have to add water\nslowly and carefully. To check if we're at the\nright flooding consistency, we're going to use\nthe 10-second test. I'm going to take some\nicing with my spatula and drop it back into the bowl. If it sinks after a full\ncount of 10, then you're icing is set. See that? The drop completely\nself-leveled and disappeared. After you're done\nthinning your icing, you will still have some air\nbubbles, and that's natural. Decorators have all sorts\nof ways to get rid of them. And in the decorating\nroom, we like to let the icing sit for\na little bit, anywhere between 15 minutes to an hour to\nlet the bubbles rise naturally. You can go longer, but we\ndon't recommend overnight because the icing will\nstart to separate. But no worries. If that happens, just gently\nstir to bring it back. You can make it go\neven faster by tapping the bowl on the\ntable several times to force the air bubbles up. Then you can gently stir the\ntop surface to release the air. This icing is now\nready for decorating. If you're pressed for time\nand looking for a shortcut, just use our\nready-to-use royal icing. Now Wilton also carries a\nready-made cookie icing, but it's slightly different\nfrom today's recipe. Now this type of cookie\nicing won't dry as hard as our thinned royal\nicing, but it's convenient to have on\nhand for simple projects. Now thinned royal icing\nis such a versatile medium for cookie decorating,\nand there are a ton of design possibilities\nbeyond covering a cookie.

[MUSIC PLAYING]", "fjl4KlzTCvc": "today I'm going to show you how I make royal icing this is the recipe that I always go to whenever I'm going to be decorating sugar cookies these are the ingredients central need and let's get started I'm going to start off with my stand mixer here you can also use a bowl with a hand mixer that would be just fine I've already added my powdered sugar and I'm going to add in my cream of tartar that helps to stabilize the icing and prevents it from weeping when you store it I'm also going to add in my egg white if you have a problem consuming raw egg whites or don't want to use them you can always use pasteurized egg whites I'm just going to turn my mixer on to low and combine that and once that starts to come together I'm going to stop my mixer and any powdered sugar that's stuck to the sides of the bowl I'm going to tamp down and make sure that that gets combined as well and after about thirty seconds I'm going to stop my mixer add in my vanilla extract and I'm going to turn my mixer on to high and I'm going to beat this for just a minute or two at this point the icing is kind of like a sticky gluey consistency so I like to thin it out just a little bit by adding one to two teaspoons of water or so then I'm going to turn my mixer back on to high I'm going to beat this for three minutes after three minutes this is what the consistency should look like if you don't want to pipe out your icing and don't want to you know get real fancy with the decorating you can go ahead and use the frosting or icing just as it is to color my icing I prefer to use americolor gel paste food colorings these are an ultra concentrated food coloring you can buy them at Hobby Lobby you can also buy them online they're relatively inexpensive and since it is so concentrated you want to start off with just a few drops of food coloring you can always add more to make it darker but it's quite a bit harder to make to lighten up the color now to thin out my icing so I can use it in a pastry bag I'm going to thin it out with a little bit of water you want to start out with maybe a half a teaspoon of water and thin it out until it comes to a 5-second consistency basically what that means is that ribbons that fall off of a spoon get absorbed back into the icing within 5 seconds if you find that you made it too thin you can add a little bit more powdered sugar to this to thicken it up just a little bit and before you add this to a pastry bag you want to make sure and cover it and let it sit for about 20 minutes to make sure that any air bubbles that you've stirred into it come up to the surface and pop you don't want the air bubbles in your icing when you're piping and speaking of pastry bags you have several options to choose from for icing you can use a cloth or a canvas pastry bag you can use disposable pastry bags you can use a parchment cone you can even use a plastic baggie with the corner snipped off any of these options will accommodate a decorating tip or you could just snip off the corner and use it as is once you get your icing into a pastry bag you can go ahead and start decorating your cookies however you so choose I prefer to flood my sugar cookies basically what that entails is doing an outline around the outside edge of the cookie about an eighth of an inch from the edge and you want to start from the outside and fill in and when you have the proper consistency you can see how the icing just floods right into itself this creates a nice even and smooth finish on top of the cookie if there's any holes you can go ahead and use a toothpick to fill in those holes usually they just flood right together now before you store your cookies or wrap them you want to make sure that they are dry you want them to dry for a good 12 to 24 hours make sure that the icing sets up nice and firm and then you can go ahead and pack it to them or store them any way you so choose and that is how I make royal icing go ahead and check out my other videos for more decorating ideas and thanks so much for watching [Music]", "OE1O_7fCcCw": "hi guys it's Hani here welcome to my youtube channel today I'm going to talk about royal icing consistencies and how to use different consistencies of realizing in cookie decorating let's start with stiff royal icing stiffer icing is a thick royal icing that holds its shape and it can be used to pipe pretty roses or succulents you can use it as a cement when you are building a gingerbread house or decorate the gingerbread house roof with it I also like to use even a stencil spread a thin layer of stiff royal icing over your stencil and then lift up the stencil revealing a beautiful design underneath stiffer icing holds its shape so it's ideal for making creating textures you can use decorating combs toothpicks toothbrush spatula and even a fork to create a texture to make icing a bit more fluid we have to add water I like to use a spray bottle and room-temperature water first we're going to make piping consistency royal icing you can see peak is falling down immediately but it never really becomes blended with rest of the icing you can use this icing to make simple lettering swirls and outlines for general flooding I like to use 15-second consistency realizing what this means is that when you run a spatula through your icing line that you made will disappear within 15 seconds fill the piping bag with icing I like to use disposable piping bags and I like to seal my bags with a tape sealer this is a really handy gadget to cut the piping bag find a seam press it in the middle and then cut straight across to distribute the icing evenly use a needle tool or a toothpick if you see any dents in your icing add a little more icing and then smooth it out 15 second consistency realizing is also ideal for creating variety of wet-on-wet designs and as any decorator will tell you each decorator likes to use different consistencies so just because I like to use 15-second consistency for creating wet and what doesn't mean you have to maybe you prefer finer icing and that's perfectly fine just fine the consistency that works best for you [Music] I also like to use 20-second consistency realizing for flooding small areas and for making eyes for example I would do individual flower petals which 20-second consistency it's also flood icing but it doesn't spread as much as 15 second consistency it's not as fluid another consistency that I like to use is a ten-second consistency this is the consistency that can also be used for general flooding or for flooding larger cookies like gingerbread house panels and I also love this consistency for the dipping method it works really well for the dipping and we are moving on to a four second consistency this is a super fluid consistency of royal icing I like to use this consistency when I need to brush a thin layer of real icing on a cookie here I'm creating a window panel and you can also use this icing when you are making a mouth I did this with Cookie Monster and again you can find more samples on my blog link is in the description box under this video thank you so much

"[Music] welcome back to my channel today we're going to be taste testing this week's crumble uh selection they do like a different selection of cookies every week so we're doing this week's selection and it's the week of st patrick's day so a couple of these are like lucky charms yeah it's like um st patrick's themed so yeah we're gonna insert a video of what the cookies look like right now and let's get to it we're just gonna like taste test each one and then like we'll eat the ones like we like you know later show it to the camera oh i already broke them up can you show us the camera this one is like a snickers is he relaxed like i'm allergic and she's gonna put that in my mouth this one's like a snickers one so she's trying that one i'm trying this isn't chocolate so i'm gonna try it i'm gonna try it for her she doesn't like um chocolate i don't like minecraft ice cream i hate mint chocolate chip ice cream but do you like the cookie well i like your cup of your patties i don't know so i figured i like it to me your peppermint patties taste like what you think ointment smells like yeah it does which is good though let's begin i'll rate it one to ten uh-huh i give us a six i don't think i would order it again but it's good this flavor i give it like um an eight nine i guess because it's really it's really it's good it's really good and it has a lot of snickers on top but i also like can't tell whether this is like peanut butter chocolate chip or what where are the cups i just bit into a part that had like a good chunk of sneakers in it it's a tent there's a 10. totally a 10. okay your hands are so nasty now i don't know okay it was gooey you're gonna have to break the rest off for me because you're like might have like chocolate okay this is key lime pie i think they added because it's like green i think so there you see patrick's okay i'm gonna break her off a piece because her hands are like peanut butter i'm just gonna split it basically i don't think i can eat that much of it oh my god you don't eat it's like i just taste test she's trying to eat every single one okay i like i really like the icing way better than i thought it was gonna be yeah um okay this is six i was gonna do the exact same thing i give this one to six it's kind of tart so if you don't like sour taste i can move the box honestly you don't like things that are sour and tart you're not gonna like that so six oh lord i'm just moving the box okay okay i've had this one before chocolate chip cookie it was my favorite one it's basic but okay let's see that's how big the chocolate chips are 10 out of 10. here we go definitely 10. it does not get better than this i know and i'm actually like not like a chocolate chip cookie fan but those ones i could eat those over there these are so good this is actually my favorite i think this is my favorite flavor i'm telling you this is like it's different oh this is her first time having crumble you have to get in the camera it's our first time having crumble ever first time all right ready this is the chilled sugar i think i've had this one before it's pretty good i'm actually um like low-key allergic to this one but we just call it oh my god you're allergic to it why it's got almond in it almond flour um usually we have a lot of the same allergies so if she's allergic to something i'm like i have to ask her so you can check and see if i'm allergic to it too six or maybe seven because i've ordered i've purposely ordered that one before so yeah seven this one is giving four to me really do you not like sugar cookies i do but they're saying it i'm quiet so you said four i said seven but it's pretty it's pretty it's really cute okay and this is the last one oh my god now i love white chocolate chip cookies they do like a red velvet white chocolate chip and i do a pink bubble with chocolate i know you look a mess but so this one's white chocolate chip but it's got lucky charms on it i love all your charms and i think this is like cream cheese i say and it's like heavy oh i love a good cream cheese icing okay i want to get like a and at this store they have this thing called a cookie cutter okay you press the down on the cookies and it cuts it in four so like if you want to split them with people because i honestly don't think that anybody could really eat one full cookie like in one sitting by themselves you have clearly you don't know me because i've eaten four in a row no problem okay anyway ready one two three eat at the same time as me okay ready one two three this is my favorite give me two ten this is my favorite there's something about fourteen of ten yeah twenty out of ten only one cream cheese icing and the white chocolate chips i don't like things that are too chocolatey my camera is dying these were amazing go to crumble it's like they're spreading all over the country so i'm sure there's one in your city but oh my god this is a favorite one any last words i don't know like when they're gonna get these again because you know they do like a different they do the cream cheese with the white chocolate chip a lot okay but like the red velvet the big moment yeah this is good this is really good i'm loving the cream cheese icing and i think that if you're the type of person if you're like me and you don't like things that are too chocolatey or too sweet i don't i can't do something that's overly sweet this is very sweet this is no really to me the cream cheese icing kind of takes it down a notch because the pink sugar one was way too sweet for me to me the cream cheese icing kind of takes it down a notch like it's just sweet enough i'm all gone this is so good we should've got that's one because we have the 24 right or 12. 12. yeah we got a 12 pack and it was i think for 12 cookies and a pint of ice cream and it only cost us like 30 dollars so we just should have got a 12 pack of these if you're gonna have like a party i would totally do this for a birthday party or something like that like if you're having a party or you're having a get together or you're having like a movie night or something with your friends it's definitely worth getting a party box um and like they also have like a i think what like a four or five pack of ice cream so you can get like different individual flavors of ice cream and these like four or five pint sizes which that's pretty cool if you're celebrating something and they do catering and i think for the catering they make like little mini cookies and stuff or like regular size cookies you can give me one individually oh really didn't seem to have any at this location because we looked on the menu on the electronics i'm pretty sure maybe we came too late but i think if you're having a party or something like that like it's definitely worth getting the party box or getting the catering side i would do this for birthday for sure um and they have really unique ice cream flavors too like they have churro well they're ice cream flavored they have last week they had like a cheesecake flavored ice cream my birthday's coming up so i see us doing this for my birthday for sure depending on what flavors they have do you feel like every week there's always something that you like i don't get every week so but do you look at it like but yeah i'm like oh my god i went like um i think it was the third time i've been the crumble it was my first time each time i like loved the 50s so every time i go and this year they're like rolling out like i think like like 70 maybe i made that up but they're making like a lot of new flavors this year if you go on the instagram page it says it they show you all the flavors from the rest of the year that they're going to be that was as introducing as i could eat of this one but it was so good so good i'm actually shocked that i like the key lime pie one because i do not like cumin pie i knew it was gonna be good i didn't think it was gonna be good so there was some surprises in there but overall they're all good so if there's a crumble in your city go on their website put in your zip code try to figure out where the nearest crumble is and definitely go to crumble get one cookie if you live in that kind of life if you get the party box if you're not gonna like every box at least the four pack because we're back you could just eat a bunch on that like all week you know yeah that's true you know because the 12 might be too much get a little we didn't get the cookie cutter but we probably should have gotten the thing that separates the cookies so yeah you've got friends that want to munch in some cookies with you get the cookie cutter so good we are gonna go back to watching hbo and um eating some ice cream all right don't forget to like comment and subscribe yeah to my channel yeah carmelina and let me know what you guys want to see next yes let me know in the comments which one you think you would like the most and if you've ever been yeah and what was your favorite flavor we want to know right you guys thanks for watching catch you in the next one bye bye bitties", "9-DUie9AVQM": "[Music] smoke was good with its trained tasters is your board Milano cookies doctor huh me with me as always Diego what's up man and this is the cookies episode man long waited we just saw our cookies dropped out here in Seattle and you know I've been a fan of cookies for a long long time and that slowly has declined as their shakes been cut become like mass-produced yeah and like I really wanted to get into some of the things that you know we liked about cookies what we disliked you know what we think that they can do to to kind of match what we're looking for as far as like herbs and energies like this this shit's crazy to me because as you can see we've tried a number of different things from there's even some that aren't up here grenadine [ __ ] London pound cake big apple my mates yeah we've had a lot of different stuff from them and the general census of the people that I know is that it's overpriced and doesn't taste that great but it's crazy because this is this is this is long-awaited weed you know we wait a long time to get this stuff up here and yeah it's crazy there's a lot of said people that weed yes but maybe we mind just haven't done the amount of money on some of my homies I didn't spend any money this time because I was just out in California and I got it from burners on Haight Street and the best thing I got from there you know was the outdoor grenadine that was $30.00 in 84 but I bought cereal milks I bought the Aerie Payton's I bought [ __ ] cheetah piss I bought a number of different strains and it just none of it smelled or looked that great you know and those ones were $70 up here I think it's like 58 $60 even at that price this is not it's that the quality is not meeting the price in my opinion but yeah I mean like no disrespect to anybody who bought cookies - cookies from the from the buyer to the supplier we showed nothing but love and respect because we want to go find good weed we want people to hype the good weed you know so when we see this stuff get hyped we're expecting nothing but the best from people who we like you know we I bought cookies clothing I buy I've been listening to burners music since him and jacket were putting out mixtapes I lived in the bed you know like it's it's a real grassroots thing that they have done and it felt real you know I felt connected to that but throughout like lying you know if I spent $70 on the eighth I want some [ __ ] that nobody has not some stuff that smells like dried stems and they all smelled the same that's what everybody was telling me everything smells the same look the same tasted the same and not that it didn't look that great like I seen pictures and that [ __ ] looked wire I was like yo that should be like if you see that way you're gonna say that some stupid but if you smell it taste it and also I smoke too but the first one in the day I spoke was a London pound cake blunt not even get high and that's a real problem for me because I need gas really but this is the cheetah piss right here and this cheetah piss is not from Seattle this cheetah piss right here was brought to us from a cookie store in LA and this right here I'm gonna say the quality of the LA stuff I'm hearing is way better I went to burners actual store expecting to get the best of the best because that's his store I wasn't seeing that this came from LA and I'm not hit that [ __ ] of some Dodie you like the cheetah piss down there he broke it up it was so [ __ ] sticky and so plunging yeah I can see why they call it cheetah piss because it has a funky odd smell not my personal favorite but it is some gas like you know first time hit that tastes crazy bro yeah it tastes it tastes good smells good I mean it has a funky look but that's how like I feel like cheetah piss and cat piss likes trains are like I mean I don't think they have any relation but you know cookie film and and these guys who produce these strings those guys are geniuses you know they're they're they're scientists I feel like the quality was lost in a you know in this famous branding and in this over over saturation like you guys are mass producing it now and I feel like the quality is being lost cuz like I'm gonna be 100% honest with you up here in Washington we got some hitters bro we got some straight hitters like then you can go to the stores and if you're spending that amount of money you're gonna get [ __ ] stupid fire stupid flame you know and those prices aren't even like what we're like we buy [ __ ] you know get like shipping baby roll [ __ ] from high tide [ __ ] from Mother Earth farm share from tranquil forest shake from hell allowed you know no mids we buy it [ __ ] from a lot of different producers and all of their [ __ ] is is worth I feel worth the price you pay right you spend around 30 40 upwards of $50 feelings sometimes even more than the price we pay less yeah oh yeah like we're getting plugged for $40 an 8 if you smoke some [ __ ] white runs from high tide or seen our high tide review pink rising I'm sorry yeah pink runs my bad you're getting a paper inside you're gonna know exactly right away like yo that's some stupid Dodie and we're not just gassing it up because we [ __ ] live out here you know we love weed you know so we want the best and we want to show you all what the best keep the best around you keep the best I don't know man but I have a really mixed of like view on the cookie stuff like if it when it comes down to buying it I'm not gonna buy it unless I can [ __ ] see it and these bags don't give me anything and every time I've bought one not really been happy like at least with the Whiterun jars before they're making it first of all $70 at some discos for just the purple bag plank and then also two in Cali when I bought white rats out there I bought the third or eighth outdoor right grunts it was [ __ ] on the indoor migrants what is this you know I understand up here it's indoor but you know what jar I feel like I don't know you hit oh yeah that was one of my favorite strains we reviewed at 9.6 yeah of the drawer you know doesn't top that regular runs my tranquilo oh hell nah that [ __ ] look at that [ __ ] for the price it had to help my tranquil rents is the highest rated on our show so nine point seven on this on the lip licker scale [ __ ] man I honestly bro like this cheetah pisses gas I want to try these strings again from a producer that like through this but I'm not willing to really spin you know like I spent fifteen hundred dollars down there my whole stimulants breath the whole stimulus sauce I gots weed that's weed money spent two whole stimulus and some on weed when I was down there in California so we could do reviews on them and this is our first cookies review because I wasn't happy with any of that stuff and I didn't want to bring you guys a review of me just like trash talking people [ __ ] yeah and that's not the purpose of this episode either it's a trash talk because we know a lot of people that bought this and we're like y'all [ __ ] that [ __ ] you know but we're not you know we still want to give people a chance and be able to you know figure out what we're going wrong so shout out to cookies and them for you know doing their thing and then building their brand up but yo that [ __ ] is all hype this is all highside like us we're not gonna hike the bag you know we're gonna hike the [ __ ] bud and if what's in there ain't that fire I'll tell you welke loving the whole drawing everything about this market in gold is is dope [ __ ] burners got dope beats and don't music don't bass dude [ __ ] locked in with good people like you can't really knock none of that but if you're hyping the weed the weed is the the weed is the key thing here I like doing the same if that [ __ ] ain't good enough to the standards and I can give you that like 75 if this was burners favourite London pound cake I like I wish you could see this like hey bro this is your favorite right here for real cuz like I'll ask you like that [ __ ] I was this your favorite weed for $70 and for me I'm gonna [ __ ] it I know you don't pay that but like I don't know but then I'm torn because this cheetah pissed for my lace and [ __ ] straight gas ya know like I'm I'm packed out right now yeah may not be choking up a little bit earlier I mean I'm interested to hear what you guys think like what you guys think is the leading factor to the to the cookies we'd not be in that grave and I say it's the grower because like like you said mass produced these things I feel like yeah because it's so hyped you got the cheetah piss I'm gonna give it an 8.5 overall because it's not really my flavor as far as weed it's funky and it's what you would expect from more like a strain named cheetah pissed it's got that like flunky come and Westie smell but a super gas that's why I gave it a 10.5 because it's gonna get your [ __ ] blowing out your socks brother [ __ ] will get you late the genetics lemonade gelato 42 and London poundcake 97 so that's a lot of [ __ ] hitters right there you know like to have all cooking you got some Watteau in there you got some pound cake you got some lemonade like I'm not really too into the citrusy stuff too so maybe that like maybe the gelato and the citrus made that funky so ah yeah I love all the limited product we're gonna see the cello sorbet a couple of those strains were probably one of my god choose tell yeah but this [ __ ] is fire bro oh yeah it's a was the genetics again is it was a gelato 42 into lemon pound cake 97 and eliminated yeah so that's those are all good strains you know what it has me baffled a little bit cuz I'm like [ __ ] is this tree to put so much more gas than the [ __ ] we got appear like genetics genetics everyday rights work on that all day that's not even my flavor of [ __ ] but this has to be super baked to have it take that any day of the week over you know like you would never usually hear me say as a person who does not like those type of weeds to say I'm choosing this cheetah piss for over Gary Payton you know because I've had to paint into and it tasted [ __ ] gas before weren't wearing when I've had it so I know this stuff can be good but it's just not what's your what's your rating on the 8.5 so yeah so I gotta stick with the 8.8 just cuz it's it's it's high up there for me but it's not it's not it's not too high but it's high it's some gas I'm marking I definitely recommend it for y'all that can get your hands on it but on a good batch and I give us that you know 8.5 because like I said it's it's it's not really my taste of weed and like the blood structure to it was like not that appealing to me but not that it didn't look beautiful it's still beautiful but it's no crystal ease like it's a light rain with some like kind of dark green stuff red hairs a little bit of I can see it like having some purple mist if you've done like a you know outdoor setting cold cold type of winter but Musti Musti bags mouth love that oh yeah so overall we'll just like round that up run that 28.6 or something yeah so okay point six overall like I've told y'all before man you know we do this [ __ ] I'm biased there's no there's no hype in this for us we love we love to get high we want that [ __ ] that makes us feel good and takes care of our mental and puts us on a level so when we spend the money on [ __ ] and we don't get that way it's a you know and we take it a little first yeah so we want to let y'all know and we want you also to chiming give us your opinions on the cookie stuff up here in Washington or wherever you're at and you know once again shout out to y'all man for for watching it to an end it's your boy Milano cookies got the homie what's up man it's Diego hit you hard you know yeah man tune in a bit with this come to me for the plug when you need a little Calla for your bar we to a flutter bud I just put my weed in the club soda water love California", "mn_F6MZk854": "[Music] look what I've got here this is something buy cookies and we love trying new cookie strains some of the best flowers we've ever tried actually from cookies like Gary Payton so we try a cookie strain we are looking for the best and this one's called purple drank and this flower is definitely purple and I would say it looks pretty evil right and this goes to the same question our buds getting more purple and you know if you're old school and I'm definitely old school they would always have a saying the greener the meaner and in my day that was true purple flower darker color flower was more sleepy you might look at it and think oh my god it's so beautiful I got purple flower but it wasn't better than the green of a meaner but today they're mixing up all these flowers so you never know where to fire is so today we're gonna check out the purple drink and so I've already got two scoops in the straw we're gonna add a third one right now then we're just gonna tamp a little bit to hold the flowers inside the vapor Cup straw these are all handmade so they're all fitted exactly you can see the flower stays in and we're gonna stick it right down into the vapor Cup heat chamber which equally heats this flower all the way around and it has great airflow and I would say in about a minute and a half it's gonna release the water or vapor that's inside the leaves there's no burning and it is sweet and you can't believe it and it's incredible for these cultivators that are mixing up all these flowers I'm telling you you're really missing out not knowing what your flowers taste like and I had a comment the other day if people say they can taste the terpenes out of joints and you maybe can but it's not the same experience it's like out of a per cup I am telling you this thing is like incense you can taste the flavor exactly like the smell and you can't do that by smoking and I would say also that when you're done this you are not feeling so burnt up in the throat it is smooth sweet and if you got the right flower incredible so purple drink comes in this packaging and you can see it's by cookies and this flower has I said 25% THC and I actually got this at the cookies dispensary down on Melrose I drank I drove down there it's about a two and a half hour process let's say give or take and people down the road are really nice but when I got down there all the flowers I wanted they either didn't have them or I got wrong flowers in the back you know I was talking the girl was kind of nice and I was enjoying it and and I didn't really pay attention but like even with I'm going to talk about because I think if Matt Atkins Darden has clear labels and the information is on the kingsguard label so I got wrong strains in there they were in a bin they put in the wrong strain anyway it's not a complaint just more you got to check your bottles know when you get them to make sure you get what you want cuz it's not the first time this has happened for me anyway we're gonna try purple drank so it should be ready to go you can see we have vapor in the straw this cup set to 3:30 and we're looking for the best of cookies and I'm telling you you gotta have the game to be Gary Payton where there's another one I'm gonna talk about it in the video take j1p 3 if you see cookies j1p 3 that may be the best one one of those two or Gary Payton so you could see this flower makes a lot of ate this flower has a light weedy taste it also gave me a hazy feeling it was really that strong but it's definitely like a weedy I'm gonna call it dank taste it's very very dank I think that's right instead of purple drank it should be purple dank cuz actually this is a o we d OG dank --is-- that's what I think the flavor tastes like it's so enjoyable but we're looking for the best and what do we think of cookies purple drank I thought this flower was an eight which means it's a good flower but is there better cookies flowers definitely uh what do I buy purple drink again I don't think so but if you want to try purple drank it's a cookies right now so you can run down there on Melrose and you can try this I'll go for the doctor it's an eight thanks for joining in if you want to see LA's best flowers you can see mom weed entertainment.com they have the sweetest the strongest and also the doctors picks if you want to see paper cup paper cup it's on vapor cut calm and I'm telling you you will not be disappointed this thing it's so strong you're gonna use less flour and be more stone in fact you'll be stung to the bone if you like the videos please subscribe I appreciate you joining in party on my friends [Applause] [Music]", "PwOJ0GhmexM": "what's going on YouTube it is ham this is the Brougham review I went to call today I picked up some new strains this one is the sugar biscuits Roxanna 29.3% THC let's have a look at this wow that's a fat nug right there oh yeah I'm really hyped about this one this is probably Clarkson where I wanted their highest THC levels

"JMrIp9ADNh4": "Hey what's up everyone this is Drew,\nowner of Connoisseur Concentrates, and we are back to do another terpene profile\nbreakdown video. I am joined again by my Chief Lab Technician; Professor Matsumoto\nand my Media Director; Audrey and we're gonna be doing a breakdown video of our\nGirl Scout Cookies terpene profile. Now everybody knows Girl Scout Cookies. One\nof the most important things is that I searched everywhere to get a perfectly,\namazing sample of the weed and then do my tests from there. Girl Scout Cookies\nin case you didn't know its lineage is a hybrid and it's a cross between OG Kush\nand Durban Poison. Very unique smell it is the parent for a lot of amazing\nstrains. I won't even go through them all I know a few but quote on everything\nright here on the spot. We nailed this one. This one you know we put out the\nThin Mint Cookies and it was okay, this is far superior, far superior in my\nopinion. Smells exactly like the strain. So first thing you're gonna notice that\nthe Girl Scout Cookies is clear and that is because it falls under our organic\nline of products, meaning that all the ingredients are organic terpenes blended\ntogether. There is nothing synthetic and nothing artificial in it. First thing\nyou're gonna do when you see this bottle, buy it, is you're gonna open it up and\nsmell it, so I'm gonna give you a walk through on what this bottle smells like. It's very mild, sweet, but not too sweet.\nIt's also, it also has a gassy flavor. One of the things that I tell everyone in\nevery single video; you should never buy terpenes based on what the bottle smells\nlike. A lot of people go to stores and they go to fairs and whatever expos that\nyou go to and you smell the terpene bottle, you buy it from there, that is the\nabsolute worst way to do something. It is a rookie mistake. All the terpenes, I make these terpene profiles, inside these terpene profiles\nare 20 different terpenes. When you smell a bottle you are smelling whatever\ningredients, however many a few of them are evaporating off at room temperature. That's creating a different smell than if all of them evaporated off at the\nsame temperature. Which is the way that we create them and the end-use of the pen. I'm gonna let Audrey explain that a little bit better. Right so when you are\npurchasing your terpenes the most important thing you have to keep in mind\nis that the pen almost never tastes exactly like what the bottle smells like (That's true). A good example of this is vanilla. To smell it, amazing. Would you put it in your\nmouth, probably not. You have to know this when\nyou're buying terpenes because at the end of the day your customers and\nclients are gonna be tasting that pen, not smelling your bottle. This is what makes\nour product better. We spent hours formulating these lines and terpenes for\nthat end-user and end-taste, rather than smelling it at the counter. Absolutely\nour bottles don't smell that great because we're not making perfumes, we're\nnot making colognes, we're making flavor ingredients. It's the taste that is most\nimportant to your business. That's why the Professor is gonna explain to you\nexactly what this pen tastes like when all the terpenes are being evaporated at\nthe same time. Thank you, thank you so I recently made up a pen of that Girl\nScout Cookies and I'm gonna tell you what it tastes like. Oh man one of my top fives, definitely on\nthis one. I initially got an earthy note in there, followed by a clean, sweet, mild\ncannabis flavor. You know basically tastes, basically like the strain that\nDrew was talking about. We really hit the nail on the head on this one. And you\nknow this goes without saying it's a mild cannabis profile meaning that\nyou're gonna get that earthiness and that sweetness before that little bit of\ncannabis. Yeah definitely, the Girl Scout Cookies has a flavor that's all it's own. That's why it's so recognizable when you smell it,\nyou're like either this is it or this isn't it. We nailed it, it-it's right on\npoint. One of the ways that we differentiate our strains is, excuse me our terpene profiles, is based on whether they're blended profiles or\nseparated profiles. A blended profile is your gonna taste all these flavors\ncombined; the same thing through the inhale and the exhale. Separated profiles; first\nyou're tasting gassy, then you're tasting sweet, then followed by a little bit of\nearth at the end. Where does this one fall? I would categorize the Girl Scout\nCookies as a partially blended terpene profile, meaning that you're gonna be\ntasting some flavors at different parts from the inhale to exhale. So partially\nblended means that it's still separated but still blended at the same time. I\nmean pretty much exactly like he said. The flavor, so when you take the profile\nof how much it actually tastes like weed, that's gonna be different from how\nstrong the profile is relative to other profiles. Audrey's gonna explain a little\nbit more about that. Right so every terpene profile varies\non how strong the actual flavor is. Girl Scout Cookies for example, is\ncategorized into our medium strength profiles. We designed this profile to be\nan enhancing agent, rather than a masking agent. Meaning, when you're smoking on\nthat exhale you're gonna get that cannabis aroma still enhanced with the\nfeatures of this profile, rather than that smell being masked like it\nwould be if you were using Banana or Bubblegum. So I can tell you if you've\ntried our Thin Mint Cookies this is far superior. I've reformulated this, this is a\nlater generation of terpenes. I'm actually gonna retire that Thin Mint\nCookies. So if you want to try this go to MrExtractor.com, we have samples and\nwe have any size that you want. We can accommodate any size order of this. If\nyou want to try it in person you can go to any of the Terpene Labs we have\nacross the country.

man the lungs always there they're always willing smoking handlebar my lungs are a few man be talking that crap before we don't inhale for you no more anyhow this is a pretty nice train it's got a wonderful bus I want to jump from Pleasant that what stands out right now just from what I've been puffing on this last what but almost five minutes worth I guess it's buzzing but I haven't only seen that it's kind of creeping up it seems to get stronger and stronger this is I wasn't really expecting much because at all called Pawar and freaking wasn't looking that great but I just kind of wanted to get a glimpse of what the the highest like with the effects are like and just from what I'm getting off with this strong buzz bar and she's a creeper I feel like it kind of grounds me out like I'm kind of open I wouldn't mind if some stranger came in I don't know where we tested those boundaries yet I am going to be doing a pedicure for my wife we're gonna go through the salon store she's gonna check out what kind of polish she likes and I'm gonna go give her a foot scrub and I figured foots going with her heels and stuff so I haven't really ever done this before well I've done lots of foot scrubs but painting toenails and doing this kind stuff so I watch the videos on YouTube so I'm gonna try it out way after this so I know this is a strange we're gonna go and try something out like that way so I feel like I'm pretty good right now but we might finish this bowl and this visible on this video is like 12 minutes I don't want to be too long I guess I'm ready to go to the salon anyhow we're gonna go give this strain of the test run or smoker for the rest of the day throughout the evening tomorrow morning on a wake and bake but we got a baby due so we are on high alert the highest alert ever the highest alert we can possibly be right now that's the alert that we're on anyhow everybody's having a wonderful day we'll see you guys later boss alright so we're back back from taking this cookie glue for a test run and I gotta say man I love it we've been blasted nothing but cookie glue for the past two days and she's wonderful she's like I don't know if the word is versatile however you're feeling she worked with you um I found like the very first time I hit this we came back from doing all our runarounds and we're supposed to go to her bread store I wanted to take a quick smoke break so we did so I did I did the first half of my screen view and then I found had a little more time left so I started talking up some more of your stuff and man this thing got me super stoned like it couch me out man I want to fall into sleep the breast will we go to one o'clock on Fridays go half price on other birds right so that's where they get to Oregon where so we go over there well I woke up was like 3 o'clock in the afternoon I was like holy crap my family so you gotta we went down there but I want talking about there and I've just been passing nothing but the cookie glue and she's wonderful man I felt like if you're kind of tired if you're exhausted if you haven't been getting your rest you're lacking on your sleep stressed out even is kind of like sometimes overbearing you keep you're exhausted emotionally and mentally but I felt like if you are in any way shape form kind of exhausted or stressing she'll count you out man it was for me that was my experience they did smoke cons awaken bakes and she's very productive I had a wonderful like the past two days we had been busting our hump our cleaning this house my wife is like four days overdue from her from giving birth and it's big we've been on high alert we went to the hospital once they sent us back so it has been kind of I would say nerve-racking but along those terms man but with a stream like this it's been very mellow it's been very chill and everything is kind of like and if can't can if no can no can but with this strain usually can always can anyways that's not about that what it is about that this is freaky cookie glue man and cookie goo can she can enough ready the vent is blowing and I can't really get a good light and I don't have a whole lot of this stuff left cuz I haven't kind of hitting it but you guys gotta see this bah [Music] whatever that is not even know of a thing just trying to right make something rhyme like it seems so I don't know chair set the mood anyhow Rosenbach we pressed on rosin I gotta say this stuff is fun but the more I do I I was thinking kind of is collecting this stuff and next thing I know I've got this wicked big old wad on my

my mixing bowl with white vinegar and clean paper towels now I'm going to wipe down my rubber spatula go ahead and pop my paddle on my mixture and if you're using a hand mixer you would do the same exact thing just wipe down the beaters that you plug into your mixer hand mixer even if they're metal wipe them down with white vinegar basically anything that's going to come into contact with your royal icing wipe it down with white vinegar I also have a sifter here but I'm going to use to sift my powdered sugar however this is designated only for this use so it never comes into contact with grease so I don't need to wipe this down now the next thing you want to do is take a cup any cup doesn't have to be a measuring cup so now I am going to measure out five tablespoons of meringue powder into this Cup so take a big scoop level it off one two three four five so it's five tablespoons of meringue powder to every two pounds of powdered sugar so if you wanted to do if you wanted to do a double batch you would do ten tablespoons of meringue powder to four pounds of powdered sugar which I already have my two pounds of powdered sugar weighed out okay now to my five tablespoons of meringue powder I am going to add half a cup of water so I've already got 1/4 cup of water in there I'm just going to pour another quarter cup in there and I'm going to give that a stir to get all that powder that meringue powder saturated I find that if you use warm water it eliminates a lot of the air bubbles in your royal icing later on when you're decorating cookies so I'm just gonna give this a good stir and then I'm gonna set this aside so it can dissolve now we're going to sift our two pounds of powdered sugar into our mixing bowl if you're using a bag of a two pound bag of powdered sugar you can just dump about half of it into the sifter or whatever you're using this is actually like a strainer that okay then I just give it a couple taps and I'm just going to take my spatula which again I've already cleaned with white vinegar and I am going to kind of smush the powdered sugar through through the mesh and this part is pretty gory but we do this with every single batch of royal icing so that we don't end up with a bunch of clumps you can also do this you can hold the sifter at an angle and tap it or you can use one of those sifters where you crank the handle whatever you prefer this is how I do it I like that this big round thing sits on the bowl and I can fit quite a bit of powdered sugar in it at a time I picked it up at Dollar Tree I think for a buck I had a different one but it broke you just want to make sure it has a pretty fine mesh on it so I'm not gonna make you guys watch this entire painful process I'll come back once I have this all sifted two pounds of powdered sugar sift it into my mixing bowl I've got my five tablespoons meringue powder dissolved into a half a cup of warm water and then I've got my imitation clear vanilla extract I like to use clear so it doesn't discolor the icing and then I've got some white gel food coloring here from here we basically just toss it all together so the first thing I'm gonna do is give this one final stir I'm gonna dump this whole cup of meringue powder liquid into the mixing bowl and then I'm going to go fill this up with more warm water because you do have to add some additional water so let's pop this pop this on the mixer pull it forward and basically what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna have a tablespoon handy for my clear vanilla extract I'm just gonna turn my mixer on low speed it's gonna throw some powdered sugar at you and as that starting to mix add one tablespoon of clear vanilla extract about 15 drops of the white food coloring and then I have my additional warm water here to add if needed it turn my mixer up a little [Music] now I'm going to stop it scrape down the sides of my mixing bowl even though this paddle has a scraper on it you still have to get up here where it doesn't reach just knock up that sugar down into the bowl give this a scrape now as you can see this is very stiff so it's actually hard to get off the spatula and if that's what you want if that's the texture or consistency you're going for you are almost finished it's also important to mention you don't want to over mix your royal icing because it will you can go too far in the other direction and it'll become grainy and icky [Music] so this is what I like to call a glue consistency royal icing this is what you would use for an edible glue if you were building a gingerbread house or something like that this is nice and stiff as you can see the peak here doesn't fall over at all it's very stiff I'm going to add one tablespoon of water to this just to smooth it out a little bit because I am going to be piping with it if you needed a flood consistency icing to ice sugar cookies with you would just continue to add water until this is a fluid consistency okay just gonna scrape this down check and see if it is the consistency I want pop that back on let it mix for a few more seconds and then it's all finished okay and that is it in the next part I'm going to show you how to thin this stiff royal icing to a flood consistency to decorate sugar cookies with her", "EF8PNU9oHpY": "while YouTube it's time looma goood number one my first attempt at growing this plant and the first time I had ever grown using the sprog technique and she's ready days 72 day 71 of flower it's just a couple of hours away from the end of her dark cycle which I'm told is the best time to harvest the last flush was she's ready for another flush today so that means the soils empty she's got as little moisture in her as possible right now I'm excited I'm really excited YouTube I can't help it you know I when I saw pictures of stroggs and I saw and I ran into them I mean it just really means Suns maximizing not necessarily my yield but a consistency of product across the board so I don't have any top buds I don't have any bottom buds I just got all the same bud you know it's not like anyone specific nug it's gonna be better than anything the others and I'm really really excited about this YouTube so here we are blue Magoo in a southern gallon pot of soil with advanced nutrients under a thousand high pressure sodium with the orchid growth film on the walls they 71 of flour a full eight-week veg cycle she was given to me root bald and in a Dixie cup because that's just how I end up getting my plants but anyways really excited YouTube so I'm gonna take her out of the scrub now and maybe I'll get some pictures I'm going to bring her in to where we're gonna be some trimming so I'll be back :", "Mox_mCUTgyM": "[Music] well I've never seen shown to carry such a way and for

overwhelming to try and make all those beautiful sugar cookies that you see every year so I thought I'd show you the basics on using royal icing and once you see how easy it is it'll be a lot more exciting to make your sugar cookies so let's get started [Music] the first step to decorating your cookies is to outline the edge with icing then fill in the cookies with icing this technique is called flooding with a toothpick fill in any holes by gently and in a circular motion dragging the icing into the areas that need to be filled then tap the cookie gently on your surface to let out any air bubbles you can also pop them with your toothpick let the icing harden for 15 minutes before continuing this allows for the layer of icing to be raised versus sinking into the icing which I'll show you next then with my light blue icing I'm going to add a thick dot of icing into one of the corners of my cookie dragging my icing to create a line towards the other end of the cookie and end with another thick dog now I'm taking my dark blue icing and piping some more details on my snowflake [Music] you we can add fun details on your cookies like these candy sprinkles just let it dry and that's how you create that look now another technique is called wet on wet icing now another technique is called wet on wet icing because I have here a cookie that has been flooded with icing and before it dries I'm going to pipe some lines onto the cookie so you have to wet icing is combining together before they dry then I'm taking a toothpick and dragging it through the lines to create a wave effect make sure to wipe the toothpick off on a paper towel after each time you drag it through just rotate the cookie after each line to make a really fun design to my Christmas tree I'm going to do another wet-on-wet technique I'm going to add some white dots to my wet blue icing and drag my toothpick lightly from the center of the dot out on all four sides which will create a sparkle or a twinkling light effect that I've let it dry for 15 minutes and to create some texture I'm going to add a stem to my tree and some dark blue dots this would be considered a wet on dry because we've now let the first layer of icing dry before adding the dark blue [Music] [Music] another fun and easy way to decorate your cookies is to add a lot of sprinkles so I created the same design as the first cookie but while my white outline is still wet I'm going to dip my cookie into some sprinkles like this oh [Music] my gosh it's so pretty it looks like snow if you want to do two different colors side by side without them bleeding together add one icing first let it dry for 15 minutes and then add the other layer then continue to decorate however you like with wet on wet icing or wet on dry to create your layered effect knowing these basic steps you can really go wild with your cookie decorating and make any fun designs you like mix what colors you start with on the bottom and what you layer with to make a really beautiful array of cookies [Music] if you want to see more fun videos like this one make sure to click on that subscribe button down below please make sure to send me

so round two second attempt going marihuana recreational marijuana in Oregon under measure 91 the law says I can have four plants I've got two right now one of them in flower which is this one you see here which is only five days in and the second one is another blue Mugu it's in another room that I'm gonna keep vegging out for like three more weeks or so and then I'm gonna bring that in and I'm gonna put that one on that side underneath that light so my goal here will be to have two plants in flower each one under their own light on my brand new home aids frog setup on both sides and then two in bed as well and that way I will never go over the eight ounces of usable product on my property at any given time and it'll give me enough time to dry this out and cure this before the next plant which will go right here comes up so here we are my first frog I learned it on YouTube thank you so much YouTube you guys are amazing I learned it on YouTube I bought it at Home Depot I spent $8 and about a half an hour yeah and that's not that's it it was really easy I've seen that you can go in and you can buy like sprog budding and you and hanging over stuff and things and you know I've never used it and I'm never really talked to anybody that's use that other than the person at the store and you know I can really trust them as far as that commission will throw them so I got on YouTube I did my research I found a lot of instructional videos on strong techniques and growing and I kind of took a lot of those together and throw them in so what I did here is the plant while I was in bed I got up for almost four weeks in bed and I had control but which is great because last time I got my plants right up they were already in flower when I got a mention anyone when in effect I said hey give me plans friends he threw and dropped off plants but now tonight was I was not able to do any of the training through the bench process and this time I had four weeks of it this was a pretty established plant when I got her she was in the one gallon pot and she's already two feet tall I thought about her over and I met and I bent and twisted in a taint and I darn near soldered and welded her in town and I got her really frilly flat and I actually just put this scream on three days ago and she's now in flower day five so I think I did really good fingers crossed I did it correctly but only time will tell unless you guys comment but I'm doing wrong please speak up because I am I'm learning it from you guys learning as I grow I'm getting almost all of my information from YouTube information I get from my friends I'm packing up and verifying through you guys cuz there's a lot of knowledge out there and this is my second try so really my first try of doing anything through budge and the next plant that's coming in here I've had full control well I got it as it was already a rooted clone so the weather will go over here other than cloning it I wouldn't have had everything to do with it and I'm totally responsible and I'm excited about that so I've got this frog in place and I really thought that I would try to focus on one thing and learn one thing at a time with each plant as I progressed because with little learning process but I said you know I think I'm pretty okay with the straw baler now to make it it was using screws using the drill using some string hanging from the wall what is that hard the manipulating the plant a little bit and I'm I'm still researching back because again we're only on day five a flower isn't going to get quite a bit of growth on here and I do have a lot of the screen to fill out but I've also got a lot of screen is starting to crowd a little bit so I need to kind of need to pay attention that I want to stress her out but I do want to keep leaving her through it please like anyhow vacuum when I sing I decided that I'm going to learn how to feed so last time all I did was followed the bottle on the back of the Fox Farm catching a minute recording is and you know just off the shelf I'm getting anywhere fertilizer and this time I've taken the advice of a couple of people and they've given me a feeding schedule and the food that I should be using I took that information to the grow center and I talked to the people there and I found a little bit cheaper way of doing it we got some some basically the Cu Cu nutrients lots of money haha so which is huge for me because you know this is listen this was recreational marijuana this is not paying the bills marijuana this is what's let's have fun with this awesome la misma past so here we are I kind of sketched it out about on the wall here nobody to this but my blue Magoo schedule and it's written out how are we feeding her through the weeks there we go and then over here on my little shelf some of the nutrients I don't know anything about this my goal is that every week that I'm using a new nutrient I'm going to learn everything I can about it and what it does for the plants as far as I can tell by the schedule and they've given me I'm going to be using these three or four ingredients on top of that something like but here's something I don't know what it is but I'm getting that in like a week I'm gonna be using each one of these for like two or three weeks so that should give me plenty of time to really learn what it what it is what is fitting to the plant and how to look for indications on if I'm using it correctly so YouTube I'm really relying on you for this one I hope you come through I've learned a lot from you guys already

"Hi and welcome to Bold Baking Basics! This is where we get stuck into the fundamentals\nof baking. These videos are about getting you baking\nwith confidence, anytime anywhere. Right now I'm gonna show you how to make royal\nicing, and it\u2019s a really great recipe to have in your arsenal around the holidays,\nbecause it is used to decorate cakes, cookies, and even to glue together gingerbread houses. Previously I have shown you how to make royal\nicing to decorate cookies, right now I'm gonna show you how to make royal icing to decorate\ncakes. As always the recipe can be found on BiggerBolderBaking.com. Okay, let's get started. So the main ingredient in this royal icing\nis egg whites. Now if you are worried about eating egg whites,\njust note always buy good quality, use fresh, you can also heat treat them by putting them\nover a Bain Marie and whisking them up until they're nice and warm. Also you can make royal icing using a meringue\npowder and I'm gonna put that information on my website. So I'm making my royal icing on my stand mixer,\nand you can use an electric hand mixer, that will work really well too, however it\u2019s\nreally hard to make this recipe by hand because you need a lot of elbow grease. So into my bowl I'm going to add in my egg\nwhites, then what we do is turn on the machine, just onto a medium low speed, and just let\nthe egg whites whip up a little bit before we start adding in the sugar. So as your egg whites are getting foamy, I\nhave a little secret here, I'm going to add in a little bit of fresh lemon juice, and\nwhat this does, it kills any bacteria that's left in your eggs. So it\u2019s been around a minute or so, my eggs\nare nice and foamy, so now I'm slowly gonna add in my powdered sugar. Now just make sure that your powdered sugar\nis sifted because you don't want any lumps, you want it to be nice and airy. So just one scoop at a time, gotta be patient\nhere, just hang out and slowly add in your sugar. Let one scoop mix in then go in again. And then keep on adding sugar until you get\nthe desired consistency that you want. So now come here to me I want to show you\nsomething, I've added in around 3/4 of my sugar and I want to show you what my royal\nicing looks like. Do you see that texture? And how drippy it is? This is perfect for decorating cookies, it\u2019s\na nice consistency, it\u2019s not too runny, it\u2019s nice and thick, this is fantastic. However, we are not decorating cookies right\nnow, we are going to decorate a Christmas cake, we need it a lot thicker. So, back down you go, and we\u2019re gonna continue\nadding in more sugar. So at this point I'm going to stop adding\nin my sugar, I do have a little bit left there, but I'm not gonna add that in because I can\nsee that I've got the consistency that I want. So I'm gonna turn off my machine, go in with\nmy spatula, look at that. That is what I was going for, this is perfect\nto decorate a wedding cake, Christmas cake, whatever you like. It holds its shape, it\u2019s a beautiful color,\nit\u2019s going to make amazing snow on top of our Christmas cakes. If you're not using your royal icing straightaway,\nthen put it into a container or a bowl, lay cling-wrap directly on it, and keep it at\nroom temperature for around 2 weeks. So this video is a three part series, I showed\nyou how to make marzipan, I showed you how to make royal icing, and next I'm going to\nshow you how to beautifully decorate a Christmas cake. For this royal icing recipe and for my royal\nicing to decorate cookies with, head over to my website. I\u2019ll see you back here really soon, for\nmore Bigger Bolder Baking.", "NprcZCpOHHU": "what's up party people we're here and we're taking a look at tropical cookies by gold seal farms this is an indica dominant cross of the girl scout cookie strain and let me tell you guys pretty good it's a pretty solid medicator from it's frosty buds to its little hints of purple to just how like nice the nugs look to the endless waves of just soft like buzz and euphoria that come over your body once you smoke it this strain has proved to be a perfect chill output and excellent strain to medicate insomnia with who from the second that you open the jar it's just Sour like fruit coming right at you oh it's just so funky and then at the back end you get this hit of like musk and like spiciness a little bit it's a really nice combo of just like pow sour fruit fine I like [ __ ] musk really powerful you just pop up in the jar and you start getting the smell creep over the entire room this stuff is dank the nugs themselves or lookers Brown I really love one another has these little hints of purple when they creep up the spines of fan leaves and it just looks like the nug was infused with some sort of comic book like steroids superpower it's like [ __ ] it's really nice and then when you know that it's not necessarily a purely purple bud and these are just like hints of purple it a and when it's like a fruity strain it's a really nice combo I found that a lot of fruity like bright like you know / police light buds have always proved to be super [ __ ] fire and this one is no different the buds are very frosty very well manicured they could be better manicured there are some fan leaves that pop out that are not that frosty and I'm like man you could have done a better job you know this you're slacking a little bit here man but other than that it's a pretty good manicure it's pretty tight it shows off the structure of the nug pretty well just super frosting you know I really appreciate when you break open a strain and you can just see the forest of trichomes the lie hidden within you know it's not just the surface area that the surface frost sheen that you're seeing the snow did not just land on the top of this mountain no it is in the various heart and soul of this nut here and it burns pretty well let's burn a little bit less up its back a little bit in the bowl it is almost a crime to break apart these mugs oh they're so beautiful very well cure it just breaks apart very well in my hands it could go maybe a little more on the cure but uh it does a lot a lot better than some of the wet stuff that I've seen burns well like meet me complaining about the cure would be me nitpicking at that point I really love the high of the string it's a really relaxing anxiety of reducing pain relieving medicating stone man your body is just hit with waves of just relaxation like it's not a pulsating body buzz it's not like a like a sudden buzz or anything it's literally like this relaxing almost lean on your body it's really nice and then you also get your mind relax as well so you're getting like this really nice pain relieving body hi you're sinking into your chair it's perfect and then your mind is also able to be put at ease and just let loose of any stress anxiety and this and the weight of like present thought and stuff all gone really nice and I both departments perfect indica for chilling out getting ready for bed let's take a hit not bad like I said more of the earthy musky pneus comes through the hit not as much of the sour fruit you get a little bit in the back end but it's not like right up front you know now not as much as I would like especially guava brown I love those like crazy like guava s tones you know it's not a [ __ ] strawberry this cherry that almost like artificial asked flavors it's like a raw like sour fruit flavors real it's nice one of the things I don't like about the high is that it's not that focused you know it's a trade-off that you get with such a heavy hitting indica it's not a great strain for focusing you know wouldn't recommend this before work and I wouldn't recommend this just like with chillin with the fam or something like for dinner like I don't know like chillin with your wife watching TV you might be not enough can't even focus on the complicated plot if you're watching Game of Thrones or something you know it's one that you just kind of want to maybe chill play an easy video game and then knock out but other than that it's a pretty solid strain man like if you know what you want to do with it you're met I smoke this right before bed and it puts me right out and it just helps me just relax sink into bed not have any anxieties you know sometimes you smoke a weed and you know you start thinking about your heart while you're laying in bed or you [ __ ] I think you're gonna die or you just you get this fear and anxiety and stuff and some strains kind of squash that feeling some streams never even muster that thought and this is one of those strange for me highly recommended super frosty super skunky super good high man just super good quality from Gold Seal I'm really really satisfied with the quality that they're pumping out it really looks and feels top shelf you know from their packaging all the way to the actual product itself you know it's all great but I'm really surprised I'm really enjoying it I give this strain a 9 out of 10 it would almost be perfect if it had a better burn you know if they had a clean white ash it for burn like perfect and if it were just you know a few slight improvements you know the cool manicured a little better if it was just treating a little better you know it could be a stellar 10 out of 10 bud easily but thank you guys for joining me on the strain review hope you appreciate it looking at this pretty but this is one I would consider that it's a pretty bud once it's got those little like little purple hints brats

] hope you guys enjoyed peace out", "N8QdrkXSDFA": "hey friends we're doing another cookie tutorial ah shoot see i got it on the camera lens here in the south we have an abundance of citrus now i love to work with blood oranges primarily because they just give things this beautiful kind of pinky orangey color super fun blood oranges are a little more intense than say regular navel oranges they can tend to be slightly more bitter and the next time you cut one open give it a good sniff and maybe you'll notice a slightly irony smell hence blending more to the whole blood orange vibe but don't worry we're gonna actually candy these slices very thinly sliced blood oranges with the rind on because it actually gives it a nice chew at the end but we're gonna smother them in sugar syrup and it's going to make them sweet take off that bitter edge and then we're going to gently lay them on top some beautifully vanilla scented shortbread it's going to be amazing so let's get to it let's get these oranges prepped first thing you want to do of course is give your oranges a good wash because we're going to be using the whole fruit you're going to need a sharp knife for this next step because we're doing thin slices it takes about two oranges you want to get anywhere from 14 to 16 good slices mine are about a sixteenth of an inch thick you definitely don't want these to be so thick that they're not going to give you a really nice texture to eat or be too difficult to bite through but you don't want them to be so thin that the pulp in the center tears so it's kind of a fine line so just try to really find you know do a couple test slices and figure out how it looks and how it works for you get those sliced up once you have your fruit sliced do be sure to save those little ends and scraps because we are going to be cutting off the rind and chopping it up to use as zest in the cookie dough later on so nothing goes to waste here people time to get our sugar syrup going this is going to be two parts sugar to one part water so just basically two cups of sugar one cup of water with plenty to candy two oranges i'm using a rather large pan if the slices are sitting on top of one another you're going to have to come and stir it more often so they get some separation and they're able to candy evenly we want to bring this up on low heat so that the sugar can dissolve and saturate but we're not caramelizing the sugar so i have it set kind of between low and medium and it takes a little while you know might take like 15 minutes for this to come up to a simmer but just give it time once it gets to that simmer get your orange slices in there and you're going to want to keep checking on them you know every five minutes or so to make sure that they are evenly candying if that's a word and they're separated and they're moving around and they're hanging out and they're you know just just doing their thing correctly this process could take anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes depending on how thickly you did slice those oranges and how large your oranges actually were you want to make sure that the rinds are completely translucent you don't want any kind of thick opaque pieces left make sure they are evenly ready to go and then you can just pull them out lay them out in an even layer on a cookie sheet or on a piece of parchment paper whatever you got and let them cool completely we want them to cool and let the sugar syrup kind of evaporate and soak into it a little bit before we try to put them on our cookies and work with them now if you want to save your orange syrup it would be divine you could use it for mixed drinks you can use it to soak cakes or you could even just you know candy more fruit whatever floats your boat now i mentioned before about using those peels that are left over so give those a nice little slice chop dice dealio you actually want them to be pretty thin because we don't want large chewy pieces of orange rind in our cookies so take your time and chop it up really well mince it very very finely very very fine now we're using vegan butter sticks for this please don't use the tub butter it will melt and not work and it has air in it and just yeah we're going to get that into the freezer while we prepare all of our other ingredients now to prepare our cookie dough you want to get your dry ingredients into a bowl you can go ahead and mix it with a fork totally fine no fancy equipment necessary once those dry ingredients are nicely mixed go ahead and add in your cold cold butter i mean it's cold so if it's too hard to break up with a fork just go ahead and use your fingertips we're just going to pinch it basically and work it with our fingertips into the dry ingredients but not too much we don't want to break this down into a very fine course meal you want the pieces to be bigger it almost looks like you just broke up the butter a little bit coated it in dry ingredients and just leave it like that and that's totally fine because what's going to happen is the less that we break this down the more layers we're going to get in our shortbread so you want a nice marbling within your dough you know but go for this right here and then we can add in our remaining ingredients so the milk the vanilla and our orange zest or chopped peel whatever you want to call it get that in and i'm basically just picking up the dough and squeezing it together you don't want to break the dough apart or work the wet ingredients in too much we just want to bring it together because the more you work this and break it apart it's going to break up our butter but we want our butter to stay intact so just kind of squeeze the dough together until it's well hydrated and basically all comes together into one mass and then we are ready to roll it out at this point i did turn my oven on to let it preheat to 325 degrees fahrenheit so that it was ready to go go ahead and flour your work surface pretty generously we do have chunks of that vegan butter in our dough don't want them to stick to anything flour the top of the dough and then give it a good roll out we're looking for about a quarter inch of thickness we want these cookies to be decently thick we want them to at least be thicker than our orange slices so what i did is i just laid my orange slices on top of the dough and cut around them with a sharp paring knife mainly because i wanted the oranges to be the showcase of the cookie and it's kind of a surprise that there's cookie dough underneath but this dough does not spread it puffs up but it does not puff out so i wanted to do it this way because i don't have any cutters and all of our slices are going to be different sizes so just this worked out nicely worked my way through the dough and then got them all onto my cookie sheet you don't need to give them very much room around the cookies like i said they don't spread very much but once you have that part done you can get them on the cookie sheet into the oven i baked mine for exactly 15 minutes that seemed to be the magic number where the shortbread baked the whole way but it was still extremely tender super happy with how these turned out and it really toned down that super strong acidic bitterness of the blood orange this is kind of an interesting way to use the fruit and a great way to use the whole fruit which i am a huge advocate for no food waste so i hope you guys try this one out if you do let me know what you think down in the comments or head on over to instagram you can find me at sweet life of underscore amy post a picture of your cookies tag me and uh i'll probably share it in my stories just saying and now for my favorite part i'm gonna take a bite of one of these cookies which by the way these cookies if you let them sit overnight in an airtight container obviously once they cool the orange slice softens up slightly more and soaks a little bit more into the cookie and just gives you a better flavor profile and a better overall texture so that's a little little pointer okay hmm", "OGvmgi9KzSs": "what's up everybody King pong here today we are doing a weed review over some

good place to go ah smoking this sugar cookies so thank you for watching thank you for subscribing and smoke on fellas", "oOo8X0i3KJ0": "oh hello welcome back to Greenpeace yeah welcome back on today's episode we're gonna make it some pot cookies but not just any pot cookies gluten free pockets to all those people who think gluten intolerance is a myth I would say to them suck it for today's recipe we're going with gluten free chocolate chip coca pretty good we'll see in the kitchen welcome my kitchen so the first step in the process for making our pot cookies is of course prepared or marijuana now I'm order to do that we're going to do something called D carving but layman's terms were just potentially maximizing the amount of THC that we can get at the batch or making a weak that's pretty much it see native kids when we needed in order to do this we're going to set our oven to the lowest temperature possible finally goes to 170 and then we're going to break up our marijuana we went with California stepchild for the cookies today make sure there's no stems or seeds no that's pretty cush am I wasting that and throw it in so let's do that you will smell you know a little you know marijuana aroma it sounds like Christmas and you were ready think we're going to go here much like with cookies when you're baking as soon as something comes out of the oven you want to scrape the bottom really quickly that's the good you know THC we don't wanna waste them my glass is on so I'm now grinding up our marijuana with my grinder you want to make your marijuana it's finely ground as possible before starting to bake with it because the more find the grind the easier it is for the extraction process that's why you grind up your weed before you smoke it now that our marijuana is ground up ready to roll I got my panel set here now you want to get a little bit of water in your pan I use about an inch most people do a little bit more I turn our stove on and just wait for to boil we're using a one-to-one ratio and that would be half an ounce of product to half a cup of oil or butter the oil that I'm using today is extra virgin coconut oil it's very high and high quality saturated fats those are the best fats for extracting THC from your marijuana I'm now adding the coconut oil to the boiling water coconut oil have been melted down I had that an hour I told you this  poison alright so once you're ready to add your marijuana mixture turn your heat down to a low simmer just pour it in there and you're gonna want to let that sit there for at least an hour to an hour and a half some people go for like seven hours a whole day in a crock pot but that's just unnecessary because after about an hour and a half that's all you're really going to get and now we wait so it's been about an hour and a half on simmer we let our product cool for about five to ten minutes now we're going to pour it over our cheese cloth into our container she's caught this preferred if you don't have cheesecloth you can use coffee filters but some people think that's a little bit dangerous I tend to agree kinda sorta looks like I'm squad squeeze any end of someone's testicles you wanna know the truth you want kind of like once you're finished straining all of your product into the bowl you're going to let it sit and cool so that the water separates from the oil some people prefer to do that with refrigeration or freezing we're going to go with refrigeration today and the fridge we go and go back we have now taken our and a coconut oil out of the refrigerator coloration here pretty green we're looking for we are now going to remove the excess waste water seal that nasty gunky we don't want that now once you clear away all your wastewater you can then use this can of coconut oil in any recipe that calls for butter or oil basically for baking cookies brownies cakes anything you like and that my friends and neighbors is can of coconut oil one on one here we are I have my baby hat on ready to bake some cookies while the ingredients are on the table we have three fourths cup dark chocolate chips with two tablespoons coconut flakes Freeport's cups sugar with 1 teaspoon cinnamon 2 cups garbanzo bean flour with 1 teaspoon baking soda and gimmicks in hand with whisk measuring cup for later two eggs and of course mechanical our first step is to whisk together alder dry ingredients are car bonds bean flour and baking soda in goes our cane sugar and cinnamon for the win and now we have our chocolate chips and coconut flakes very important to whisk the dry ingredients if you don't do this and that's why they fell you get a nice even mix around everything is incorporated with everything else you know earlier I looked a little bit of the can of coconut oil for my hands may already there and pitbull bust feel a little good metal or nothing guy you know what you dive into that pool start paddling get some more water in there now once you have all your dry ingredients incorporated and mixed together we move on to the web and that is obviously the eggs and the coconut oil I have a saucer full of water simmering over here out of your egg here in the leg replace all of our coconut oil amazing back into our measuring cup  eat all this you always pour the wet over the dry and you mix together just enough you know so that everything's incorporate you don't want to over blend because then the cookies or the paintings will come out rubbery nobody wants that's nobody wants that knowing what sauce pants are going to put this in here now our eggs are fully whisk you pour those in as well now we are ready to whisk together everything and anything answer a little bit moist and clean we're not going to go inside just like pulling this together in the rest little ball okay now that our mixture is complete we will put in the freezer just for like 10 to 15 minutes and then we will bring it out and begin you know placing them for baking and into the freezer we go hidey-ho now that our cookie dough is how to freeze from ready to go see it's just like ban so I great and go football right there that goes to our first batch ready to go we're going to pop it in the oven into the oven we go 360 for 15 minutes and then you're ready to get your bun Chee's on and then get your munchies on so the oven timer has done the cookies are ready there you have it folks I know they usually say on other shows don't try this at home but if you feel up to it give it a shot well it's on a batch number two good night sleep tight wish you the best degrees tonight", "llW6jtgvzCw": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] my name is Willie Christie and I'm here today at the cannery West in Los Angeles today we're talking about edibles and specifically cookies they make all types of cookies there's red velvet cookies vegan oatmeal cookies peanut butter cookies chocolate chip double chocolate chip triple chocolate chip fudge dipped cookies any cookie you can add weed to it so first up we've got the classic chocolate chip cookie this one's from big Pete's based out of Santa Cruz awesome company they do a 10 milligram per cookie six pack so you're actually getting 60 milligrams in this which just makes it a little more affordable instead of drop in 25 bucks one thing I like about these guys it is full spectrum oil so there will be a slight cannabis taste and that full spectrum effect is better than distillate in my opinion that trade CBD and all that trace other cannabinoids is just gonna increase the overall effect next on the list canna Co cinnamon sugar cookies classic twist on the chocolate chip you've got cinnamon and sugar no chocolate chips so if you're allergic to chocolate or you don't like chocolate or you're just trying to mix it up cinnamon sugar is a good option Kanako's been around for a while they do a lot of paleo vegan gluten-free friendly edibles as well so this package is your hundred milligram package 10 cookies 10 milligrams apiece that's about a dose to two doses for your average consumer keep in mind that these are baked goods they have butter sugar eggs you know it's a pretty natural recipe so either store them properly fridge freezer or have a couple friends to share it with so this is the vegan oatmeal cookie from Korova it's a good vegan option for those of you that are used to only getting butter here's something for the vegans out there one thing I like about Korova they've been putting this guy on the back of their package for years this is the warning don't be this guy don't eat the whole package if you don't know just as a rule of thumb know your dose take your dose and wait up to two hours to feel the effects and then once you've eaten it it's gonna be a total experience of four to six hours of or being high next up we've got the CBD THC one-to-one vanilla bean cookie from Korova this is a nice option for edibles because we haven't really seen CBD and edibles up until the last couple years this is something to try if you've been wanting to try THC and CBD if you get too paranoid with THC having some CBD with that edible will help moderate any anxiety that you get from THC also the one-to-one ratio is the most potent ratio for killing pain so if you have some type of you know body pain or chronic pain a CBD and THC cookie or edible is going to do a lot more than just the CBD edible or just the THC edible finally we've got dr. norms CBD vegan peanut butter chocolate chip cookies so this is non psychoactive or rather non-intoxicating you can eat the whole bag and you you're not going to get high but what you're gonna notice is just a little bit of chillness anti-anxiety and certainly some anti e inflammation if you have any swelling or soreness or arthritis chances are the CBD is gonna help out with that without getting in your head [Music] so those are some of the cookies that we have here at the cannery West don't forget 10 milligrams of THC and a cookie is the same as 10 milligrams of THC in a gummy it just comes down to your preference or your dietary needs you know if you need sugar free this or vegan gluten-free that it's gonna be the same find your dose of THC and you can explore any type of different edible for you [Music]", "grctrI6QVWU": "Oh scrubbers only went back another stream review would shoot for you guys today today we've got a nice one we've got humble family farms animal cookies now humble family farms I've been I think I found them first I bought like a gram of their dad so I'm somebody concentrates and then I got wind of them looked a mop saw that they were killing it over there needed to get some of their strains on the list first one up animal cookies animal cookies is a spawn of Girl Scout cookies fire og now Girl Scout cookies crazy fire we all know that took over the world fire og is one of those classic oh jeez that's just legendary but with those two makes you got yourself all proper Poppa mixture going on here you know the categories visual Cure smell taste and affect you know the deal let's get right after it first category visual now the visual of this bud super green visually it's super lime green it's got orange hair is everywhere sugar is decent sugar not crazy crazy intense for the visual I'm gonna go I'm gonna go [Music] I'm gonna go on eight on visual it's everything you want lime green orange has yellow he has sugary underneath the bud everything looks nice super decent it's going eight on visual next category care I don't care on this is decent the buds I have a great bounce back the buds have a solid snap when you crack them open that freshness smell just is more than ten to five when you crack hope that's how you know you got a good care I'm gonna have to go with the score seven on care smell now to smell it is bud like I said earlier smells like fresh vegetables and smells like if you were to take a cucumber and cut it open it just smells like like water fresh whole and spring just fresh out the ground super filtrated it's got a decent smell to it but it doesn't scream exotic like I got really get it in there I'm gonna have to go with the six on smell because it's not that potent it could be better even when you crack the bud it it's kind of hid it in there and never mind if it's not a gassy smell like gasps he's so potent that it like overwhelms you so because it's like that fresh fresh vegetable Eve odor you smell it really doesn't punch you in the face like that next category we have taste so I'll taste that you got a spa kit let's get it Cheers humble family farmed animal cookies bred by AJ 207 on instagram look them up let's good Cheers [Music] okay Flavor Flav is gonna get 1/8 slave it tastes way better than it smells it doesn't smell bad it'd just be any type of exotic flavor comes from the taste of it it's not in the smell of it it kind of throws you off so I'll go with an 8 on the taste and step in one more time boom effect now I give it a second to let it kick in and it's got a good effect definitely a heavy indica but not too heavy I could smoke this during the day but don't get it twisted it's definitely an indica he definitely have some heavy eyes it's definitely gonna be there with it but um I'll go with uh I'll go with a Eitan effect solid effect there you have it home or

especially for my main man small world 420 a k-8 big country yeah what you're talking about but this is a cookies push about to go on the flour and like I said man this is absolutely out of doubt not only one of the strongest buzz I ever smoked but it just grows so strongly you guys saw every single 50 or 55 seeds pop go take a look back your honor man take a look back but this video is basically about phenotypes okay I got five cookies in here right that I brought from the crib and these five are out of those 55 let's go arrest away I kept ten to the best we knows from those and that's what we got man and there are female every single one all ten of them were females I don't know that has something to do with the way captain strain man hook this [ __ ] up or what but yeah man even small world I think he popped 10 and got nine females canvas Carol she she she cracked ten I think she got nine out of them - yeah so phenotypes is we have seeds and you plant them of the same breed same strain should I say and you start growing and they look a little different but actually I've been you know not just me but me and my though homie we've constructed these to be pretty much the same shape so it's hard to see what different phenotypes there are but you can tell the difference I'm who's growing like that and who isn't and those are the ones you want the ones who were growing like that let's just take a quick look second you know could be pushy the strongest [ __ ] seeds strongest marijuana cannabis plant I ever grew it's so strong it's just ridiculous that's phenol number two let's start back you know one which is a beauty I love her too right just sick ignorant yeah me and then this phenol number two we topped her and all that and cut some [ __ ] and we wanted the bus when she comes up she's straight there's phenol number three no I'm saying saying [ __ ] she looks very similar to number two you know you know number three there's phenol number four which I love her this is my favorite female right here you know we got Grandmaster level topping you know in fact we're gonna take no we'll leave it like that for now we'll leave it just like that for now you know you did you want your canopy to be you want everything to be the saying that if we grow in the same string you want everything to be the same and then when you smoke each Fino you remember which Pino was which but anyway yeah so right now my caffeine Oh number one three let's take this one right move that next to that who's that next to that water well this makes me know that I'm loving she's one of them fat squatter tank [ __ ] yeah hey was this bushy [ __ ] right here I mean you're just gonna go crazy and we're [ __ ] with turbinator and we're back [ __ ] a Remo over here y'all yeah so we over here at the trap not allowed to show no parts of the house or the room which was actually the basement and it's all good though we're doing it you know her name and without our super lemons in there we've got that Larry og in there and big body when he was still at the crib with the plants he [ __ ] up the Larry og excuse me the bloom cookies man when I made him big home [ __ ] the water went to work did it double came back they were [ __ ] out yeah but uh this is big buddy big little big things in little places so what happen used to make sure when you grow the same bud and different seeds of the same bud that you smoke it and you remember what you know you like what we know is that kill even though all this cookies cush is kill like none of it but you know what I mean yeah bills let me I would it do laughs do you would it do toy soldier would it do that eg would it do eighties baby yah well Dec 3 5 7 man would it do oh let me say something real quick probably everybody else I'm saying you know how you got your subscribers on the left and you start getting more subscribers and then people started dropping down so you don't scroll down as much it you just [ __ ] with this known could be you usually watch and then people kind of get out of it start falling down further and further sucks man but these tufi knows look at that fluorescent green all that and I mean this one's the only one that got that feeling I be looking for man also straight man told me to uh take a leaf off each phenotype invented right he does 20 at a time for each strain he does or makes or whatever but he does ton 20 at a time and he'll literally mark them this is an old-school grower than that it literally marked down what Leafs taste the sweetest the markham one to ten take a leave from that one down one down one down that one they'll take a leaf mark down on which tasted the sweetest mark down when he crumbles it up he'll crumble it up and smell it and smell would taste the sweet I smelled the sweetest and then he goes for the taste in the high and he marks all those down because it's all about yourself is an old dude that just [ __ ] with me [Music] and he created the real popular string in fact of 99 but I'm not gonna even blow him up like that yeah I mean because he asked me not to even do this [ __ ] like that I mean he did about six years or somebod I mean they found like 300 plants next doctor he was growing right on top of the federal probation office jacket and these dudes climbed up to put new windows in for the feds on their part of the building and they went to his window which was one story higher and they started [ __ ] with the window and they went looked in the window and saw his [ __ ] you know I mean long story short they took his [ __ ] weed money and the plants that were in bed and nothing makes you know Donny they took all the dried [ __ ] and I don't think they took any like wet but but they took all the dried [ __ ] they can handle like 32 pounds in there and he had like a hundred grand or like 90-something grand cash in there they took all that and then the [ __ ] told on I said there's marijuana growing so not only did they take his [ __ ] stash but they [ __ ] snitched on and have the boys downstairs come upstairs and you know and then and then six years later so I understand why you don't want to [ __ ] with it no more like that whatever like that after doing some time I mean nobody wants to sit in jail over this beautiful plant why why man we just spoken man I'm crawling for my head man selling this [ __ ] I don't grow enough to sow and those who really know no we don't grow enough to sell come on man and my help a friend out but other than that man ain't no real local motion won't moving train around here with this we've grown that book with head man we giving that goes good the fellow growers of I field grow up good enough to grow this good good because it takes a real experienced grower or somebody who's just got a green thumb from jump from day woman like my were small world I mean it takes somebody like that anyway when you get strands like this [ __ ] cookies pushing Girl Scout cookies and blue cookies and pink cookies and animal cookies all that [ __ ] man you gotta know you gotta know what you're doing with those cookies are [ __ ] you know yeah Bon Appetit come on that

back here with free Mike here and Nicola Dickens the weed woman show we are revealing hi integrities cookies push very pretty grab a bad about a minute a UH there's my scale see how much each one of these little buds way okay this one is three point four grams that is a good bud three point three grams and let's see you are one point five grams so there's a nice little dent buds that we got here so let's start ripping them apart so let's see we want to hear the crackle when we open this mm-hmm oh it smells amazing well let's see what we're gonna do today so this is cookies cuz cookies pushes an indica dominant hybrid strain created as a cross of delicious Girl Scout cookies and X roll push strains this bud was bred to be sold in coffee shops in Amsterdam and the offers a moderate THC level the THC level is between 15 and 18 percent it's a 3% CBD 70 percent indica 30 percent sativa it says it's cerebral energizing euphoria happy and relaxing which sounds amazing I could really use energizing euphoria today and it relieves the symptoms of arthritis bipolar disorder chronic pain cramps depression insomnia loss of appetite muscle spasms and nausea so that is the reason why I picked this particular strain muscle spasms are a big one for bladder cancer patients and I am constantly spasming and it never feels good I don't know any spasm that feels good Azam's yes but not spasm ooze oh that grinds nice I'll get out of this it has a good grind to it it's got a good stick to it which I like like sticky pieces a little too much chemikal though I would personally suggest another couple days of a rinse it's not overpowering but it's definitely there so I would recommend rinsing a little bit mm-hmm rinsing the stage again so yeah when I do my reviews I do it with a clean bong a clean grinder I'm shushing rappin it beautiful colors the amber green the purple those are beautiful it's got a good strong stem in it so on this on cookies crush we had five and a half grams out of these two the buds so we can kind of see what I'm looking at yes I inspect my weed Wow that's a good thing look at that stem in there yeah that's a key what I'm looking for is a level of moisture I want it to be able to stick turtle form but I don't want it to fall apart see how it came apart really nice but it's still sticking into that form that's what I'm looking for so when I plopped this down on the paper you'll see how it sticks into that round form which is what I want it to do that means that I have some moisture in there which is good but it's been dried enough all the way through perfect little stem came right out of there which is perfect I'm sure let's put some of this stuff into the barn okay let's pack a bowl smells I get my grinder to go back together fresh bomb so how's everybody's Monday [Music] oh that has some flavor hmm I've definitely had some flavor again can taste a little bit of the chemicals a little more of a rinse but good very great flavor it's a sweet kind of cookie kind of a sugary cookie type of a taste a there it is ah this one hits kind of hard when it starts hitting you you'll feel it in the head you feel it in your sinuses for the most part at first they start warming warming warming it's not even a word warming up kind of camp up my my I can't put a name to the aftertaste this one does have an aftertaste but when you finally feel it hit to your body will relax I can feel my bladder relaxing so it is better the aftertaste takes a while and get rid of which is unusual miss enrichments actually stayed in my sinuses don't really feel that euphoria yet but I do feel the first part of the relaxing coming in I feel my muscles starting to calm down I feel my brain starting to slow down and I'm like okay now I can think of all the things that I need to do today one of the things that prohibits it really gets me is by the time all is said and done and I'm actually dressed and ready in the morning it's like 11:00 if I it's about 11 o'clock and then I'm I'm pretty much worn out for the rest of the day after that so it takes a lot to get up and actually just get dressed and put my makeup on and do stuff like that so I find that I stick with my work Simpson oil and with my cannabis purely for the purposes of being able to get up and move and walk in and have a semblance of life it's hard when you don't feel good and you're chronically sick what you really want to do is is sleep all the time you don't want to be awake because if you're awake you're feeling it with cannabis I can be awake and not feel that way which is what I'm looking at that's what I do personally if the entire time that I'm awake all I want to do is go back to sleep it makes your life miserable and sleep the only reason why I can say sleep is to go to sleep is because when you're sleeping you don't feel the pain like you do when you're awake you dreams really or you sleep through it so that's you know a lot of why people that are sick or chronically ill do sleep a lot is is because it's it's easier it's an easier life the more we sleep the less we feel so that's why I use this is so that way I feel more like being awake than I do being asleep so good job I decided that I'm gonna do this on a rating system on a five bud rating system so the first bud will be the smell of the cannabis when I'm first opening it up which was beautiful great aroma had a beautiful smell so I give it it you get one bud for that dryness and texture beautiful job it looks great tastes beautiful so for taste you get your bud I would", "ROTAFMEb668": "[MUSIC PLAYING] Let's talk about royal\nicing consistency. You can use royal icing\nto pipe decorations. You can use it as a glue to hold\ntogether gingerbread houses. And you can even use it\nto decorate a cookie. The key to using royal icing is\nknowing the right consistency and how to adjust it. If your icing's too stiff, it\ncan be pretty hard to pipe. And if your icing's too\nthin, your decorations might start drooping. And you do not want that. Let's start with stiff\nconsistency icing. This icing is best\nfor decorations that really need to stand up. Stiff icing is used for piping\nroses because those petals need to be upright. Some decorators also\nlike stiff icing for gingerbread\nhouse construction because it's really sturdy. Since it has less water,\nit dries pretty fast, which is exactly\nwhat you want when you're sticking parts together. Our royal icing recipe is\nalready stiff consistency. But if you're in\na humid area, you might want to make this\nrecipe extra stiff. To do that, you're going to add\na teaspoon of confectioners' sugar, just a teaspoon at\na time until you get it to the right consistency. Next we had medium\nconsistency icing. Medium consistency royal\nicing is pretty similar to buttercream. It's pretty versatile. You can use it for\na lot of things like borders and rosettes. When you pipe those pretty\nlittle drop flowers, using medium consistency\nis really important. I cannot stress that enough. Some of the drop flower tips\nhave really tiny openings, and stiff icing will be\npretty hard to push through. What's worse is that it can\nclog the tip pretty quickly because it dries so fast. In fact, if you're having\nproblems with drop flowers, there's a really good\nchance that your icing needs to be thinned to medium. To adjust a stiff\nconsistency icing to medium add an 1/8 of a\nteaspoon of water for every 1/2 cup of icing. If your icing is still dry,\nyou can add a little bit more, but just make sure you're\ndoing it in small increments. Thin consistency\nroyal icing is very different from buttercream. Thin consistency buttercream\nstill has somebody to it, but thin royal icing\nis pretty liquid. Thin consistency\nroyal icing is mainly used for flooding cookies. Some people know\nit as cookie icing. It dries to a smooth,\nhard finish that looks almost like porcelain. To make a stiff\nicing thin, you're going to need some water\nand a lot of patience. You need to add 1/2 a\nteaspoon of water to 1/2 a cup of stiff icing to start. This will begin to\nthin down your icing, but not quite\nenough for flooding. You can keep adding water\njust a little bit at a time until you end up with a\nconsistency of thick school glue, maybe just\na touch thicker. I want to talk quickly\nabout what liquid you use to adjust your royal icing. Water is the standard\nliquid that we recommend, but, like buttercream, you\ncan also use corn syrup to thin your royal icing. If your icing is the\nright consistency, but it keeps breaking or maybe\nyou're having a hard time with decorations that have points\nlike the leaf, for example, try thinning with corn syrup\nbecause it's going to give your icing just a tiny bit of\nelasticity that water won't. Royal icing thinned\nwith corn syrup will take a little bit longer\nto set up compared to water. Whatever consistency\nyou end up using, the most important\nthing to remember is that royal icing will set up\nhard when it's exposed to air. So remember to cover any open\ncontainers with a damp cloth and do the same for your bags. Put a damp cloth over your\ntips so they don't get clogged.

cannabinoids and 6.66 on terps that can't be good definitely smell some orange definitely some gas smells like orange gas um real crystally looking too real sparkly that stuff sparkle to it yeah it's pretty hard there's some uh flat pieces in here which is nice very orange too in color all right let's fire it up this is a cross between agent orange and was it agent orange and skittles orange skittles it's real dry it's not wet it's real dry all righty it's a real dry product like that i move the banger around like that it kind of hops around it doesn't really stay in the middle some of the other products like gems and juice or the cake icing it stays right where you put it me wow really nice flavor let me taste the orange mostly gas though this is a very chronic chronic flavor very tasty very smooth too very nice i'm actually kind of impressed usually when the products dry like that it can be a little bit harsher so very nice all cleaned up in the banger very nice nice product that was my first rip of the day too oh my heart racing a little bit so it's a hybrid it's probably a sativa leaning hybrid though cool eyes getting heavy yes sir all right loving it sunday morning

waiting for one more participant who will hopefully be jumping on shortly but uh i guess this conversation was inspired by uh some instagram posts right yeah it's a long-running conversation definitely and observation of how do we communicate when we're discussing the things we do you know gosh it's it's something i've been like my emblem for my seat pack says working on since 85 and i lost context to which land races were in a hybrid about 93 the poly hybridization that was coming through in commercial smoke was getting complex and i i could say it was that nigerian this had afghan and this had some mexican but then once it got past a triple poly hybrid and we started getting out with these fancy elite strains i didn't know what the heck was in it it was great but um yeah so so uh but the discussion of the land race is is um what does that word mean when somebody says it the people want to bring up fisticuffs over an acute definition but if we open up the dictionary there is no definition in the dictionary of the word land race so people appoint all sorts of different scientists as it's this or um and and and they literally people ought to get fisticuffs online over you know as far as you can um i'm right stuff and it's like well the fact of the matter is words get used in common context and in um as well as uh scientific context as well as um uh yeah so that's the broad spectrum there and then when somebody's gonna insist on my jargon or my word usage then it complicates things because someone over here has heard something and just need to clarify really what everybody means when they say it and um the fact of the matter is that does range from completely wild and if it exists there's debate on to whether wild cannabis natural stands of wild cannabis actually exists that are not feral right and so hence the technical taxonomic term sativa which means cultivated right um people get in debate over whether there's three specifications that have been determined through genetic information now rudor alice sativa in africanica okay and and so all this stuff can get confusing and how uh were these all escaped from cultivation are they pretty um i'm sorry uh greater driest period right did the stuff distribute before then on the winds or the birds or is it all in this uh historical period okay these are these are huge questions that we can ask in defining whether even a wild stand of cannabis that's been there for time and more memorial uh is actually feral or native right and this is this is a like um wow that that goes back when did cannabis separate from hops and i didn't i didn't take the second to look it up was it 20 million years ago i don't remember exactly but but so specification and diversification and was it wild all the time the man once it got to you know we know in the in the chinese tomb i believe 6 000 years and i'm just going off my head i've not researched this stuff recently and these are articles we can all verify but they found them the pale skin blonde haired blue eyed guy that was buried with uh canvas plants and they're like yeah that stuff was potent right um so so we've had this genetics around for a long time and people have been cultivating it a long time and how long is it once it's gone feral does it become naturalized at what point is it a native plant um or a new endemic versus an island endemic these are terms that people use i try to keep in the middle ground here so everyone understands between the scientists and the end consumer of a seed for instance because it's really hard to buy commercially produced land races any level because most of them take a long time they're difficult to grow and there's all sorts of intricacies to growing them um is it the same thing once you move it outside of its place of origin and those are all part of the definitions that that are discussed um is how true this day is does it stay true to seed is it how much diversity is in there in it and and once it's left its place of origin when is it no longer a land race and it's become something else because somebody's inbred it just by the nature of bottlenecking once you've removed from that population that's so diverse with all the males and females blowing in the wind right whether feral or native or if it's the commercial population that's produced near one of these feral or wild populations all of this changes oh go ahead no no keep going all right so all this has changed exactly what it is in your hand when you have what we might call a land race right so that word in its usage is is broad spectrum right it it covers a lot of stuff and so so what i'd like to do is i got sick and tired of saying in my understanding of what a land race is and and part of it might have been fantasy from just ignorance right and that's that's what we're trying to alleviate here but growing up and then going through uh college and studying um plant breeding from the perspective of a forester the term land race was referred to as the wild stock right and so to me in my mind land race is like um was was uh taking a woof and back crossing it in staking out your prized breed of race dog in alaska so it can get bred to by the alpha male the wolf pack and yuri and so so the wolf pack being in the land race was my understanding of what the land race was right now of course other people have a very different understanding of what land races and and there's some very firm um astute uh beliefs and people are firm on this and that's their right that land race only means stuff that's been cultivated by the handyman so it would be actually the pack of of the race dogs that's getting um cultivated and not the wolf okay and so if we think about that that's two major schools of thought right there or were in the definition of what constitutes a land race so so would the person who calls the race dog land race call the wolf wild and feral or and they would say the word is not a flood yeah okay so for them and i'm sorry i even use the word race dog okay sled dog would be better please sorry scratch race dog sled dog okay so we don't confuse land race to race dog because that's too very if you look at the uh on my instagram today i posted because there is no definition of land race in any paper dictionary that i have and i collect dictionaries they don't have any newer ones but they they go back into the 50s um there's no land race is this is a common usage word in the english language and so so how do we agree on this stuff and there's just have all these papers we can research and say it's this or that and i presented one and the way i read it from my perspective is like it says yeah it's it's barely worked by man or or it's it's not it's wild okay and that's how i read that paper but someone else who has a different perspective reads it and says it says clearly that it's worked by a man okay so i'm not saying you have to use it my way i'm saying this when i'm talking these are the words i use and this is uh and why i use them in in the discussion definitely developed on my instagram page and um but the part of it had to do with azarian has um developed this wonderful concept of [Music] um looking at the plant where it developed on the earth and so again for my forestry perspective i'm studying all the plants and identifying where i might find one on the landscape so i can know what a plant community is in um like dealing with what kind of trees i should be planting on the landscape maybe um you can identify it by the brush and and the plants that grow there uh because of elevation and you know latitude um and your your relativity to bodies of water like the ocean or various other things like that where if you've got aurora any uh how how the landscape affects weather right and that has to do with where you are uh north and south in elevation okay and so i know it is the further north i go i can find lichens at lower elevations but the further south i go towards the equator in the northern hemisphere i have to go to a higher elevation to find a lichen or a pine tree because they have specific requirements they've adapted to but if you go north those can be found at lower elevations and that has to do with proximity to the sun right and how much um spectrum of light you get when the sun's affecting you right and so so we all talk about our spectrum and our and our growth whether it's in a greenhouse and we're adapting with supplemental light or if it's in a closed environment and we want to be um uh specifically maximizing our returns for the energy inputs and lowering our footprint right and understanding the spectrum that the plant that we're working with originated in to maximize its returns is a really pretty cool tool um that's just one way i interpret what i see here when i look at his um graphic that he's come up with in a land race description so i actually just quickly i found i found the the better quality version of the graphics um but do you want to start by just setting the table with with when you personally with an understanding that other people mean different things but when you personally say a word what it means to you so i'll walk through the slides and you can just talk about each one sure sure yeah and and this is you know i've been typing out my scribble scrabble uh chicken scratch i can't type i can't write and and the stuff uh guitar you know it had any people follow this is the words i've been using as long as i've been teaching uh through the internet and were developed through my diverse personal i don't just read cannabis medicine plants i have bred uh my yeast from shall we say land race corn varieties um to have a multi-colored blue corn and that you know i've worked on this for for 20 years um and i have it growing outside right now yeah and that can express its ancient corn origins this essentially it can come out with with really bizarre uh expressions of its original genetic that you will never find in a polyhybrid okay and this is where here's a huge separation once it's gotten past a certain amount of baldneck and we'll get through this in these slides it's no longer a land race it becomes inbred and it becomes a cultivar and it becomes and we have just like looking at soil horizons it's like there's there's oh horizon there's the oa horizon there's the a horizon yeah and and so there's that section where it inner phases right and and so at what point does it no longer be a land race and call it so yeah go ahead go ahead bring those up and uh we'll go through those in my perspective and again i do i collect wild grasses to me a true land race has been a wild plant that that woof out in the woods right okay and um zero hand of man steering the populations these are the rarest of land rays if they exist in the cannabis population we can debate that my understanding is there are maybe a hundred different wild populations in china alone talking to somebody who lived there a couple years ago who's collected some of them these crazy wild treks in the no man's land and literally canyoneering and mountaineering in the wild remote um and so um right right intermixing the entire product so we're talking about this is the most genetically diverse populations when they're when they're wild because they have all the males and females nothing's been removed and they're intermixing through the wind at all times and just being naturally selected to that environment they become endemic and however much time it might take that's a great a great debate because that covers the next one which is the feral wild populations right and i claim to have a uh a true north american land race and this is the word usage i'm using where it's a um and actually so before general language we had we had uh pharaoh we had native wild in separation in true land race and um down in the red there's a bottle okay i missed uh what's going on there um and and so the feral naturalize adapted and and so in the discussion we can say that that could be happening through as man moved around as man traded um and or through animal transfer and it gets to a new location of gaps and so there's there's a great um a great diversity in how long it takes any given plant to adapt like with garlic which is pretty much clone only unless you know the secrets of actually sexually reproducing garlic which can be done um there it's a clone a colonial clone itself clones right and it totally adapts through man selecting it right over and it usually takes about three years when you put it into a new environment you plant the best of the cloves you get off a bulb boom boom boom and you select for the best cloves to come out of your new soil and microbial and air environment right and and rain and water coming out of whatever tap you're feeding it right all those things are affecting how that garlic is going to grow or the field and the difference from my my home here and 17 miles away in in the sand and the in the the clay and the in the irrigation water versus the tap water here right so it takes three years for that kind of even in that sort of distance in space in the landscape and temperatures and things three years for it to adapt with garlic it's a clone and you're choosing each one right i'm choosing that clone that's that's expressing um epigenetically okay so so we have that feral adaptation whether sailor dropped some seed um whether it was a farmer growing their rope or growing a medicine plant or whatever it was that it was being cultivated for and transferred around the world by the hand of man you have or whether it was a bird or whatever it's gone feral and adapted and that's what my new mexico land uh land grant is right and um and so it's it's escaped captivity at some point in time between the late 1500s and three generations ago of human occupation um and you know grandpa says it's old so um and my history understanding was that the priests brought what they needed with them and they were growing him back in the day when they were conquistadoran because they needed their brown robes and their ropes so you know how long it's that's hundreds of years okay through epigenetic adaptation um down in south america and central america and mexico we have other things that we classify as land race that have been they were brought over either and or by slaves sailors and uh what for not for different purposes whether it's uh medicine for physical medicine or medicine to spiritual medicine um for instance my my new mexico i'm sorry my nigerian yoruba bantu is a cultivar that is a regional uh expression there and that gets into our our different the next flight i guess it talks about those ones have been all been steered by the hand of man and some of them escaped and have wild populations near where man grows them okay and so the general usage that most people talk about land rays may or may not include that first category of wild that i call true landlace um but most people talk about land race they're thinking about these these fields that or or small plot small gardens that people utilize uh that involves the hand of man we're selecting no modern technology no laboratories being involved in this right um way i read the definitions used over time it is the most minimal usage of the hand of man if there is any involved in it so for instance over time and they talk about something that's been grown in place for time immoral um so um that that would be like a grain for instance right these old grains that people have grown in different places whether it's a rice or a wheat or a barley or corn here in america you know it was selected from a wild plant and it was grown in a region and it was selected using just like man that one looks a little better that one produced a little better that one if i plant it and eventually it's like this doesn't necessarily i'm going to grow if i don't plant it right i got to shuck it a couple of micro but eventually it's going to fade out over time it's going to be this weak little wild stand that's not barrel and they don't produce a whole lot if they don't get the proper tilling in the soil and things like that so so um grains can go back to feral too but but so associated with a land space a geographical area a nation um that embodies the people and the land okay so that that's the weather that that's going to do with with the geological forces that create the weather and the soil right and uh where you are in that northern latitude and that elevation zone um all that's that's going to affect both what the people who are using it um and or steering it or dealing with it so we're talking about a grain again that was selected a long time ago from being a wild plant and it was grown right in the same proximity as those wild plants over long generations and continue to be interacting with and eventually it was less interaction with the wild and more just like just an open population of males and females interacting but they didn't select into a bottleneck um and you know then and then we get into like people still using the general terminology for the land raise these cultivars they get once it's been collected by a botanist or a seed company or the name of the company that shall not be mentioned you know comes in and says this is now my invention because i found this one particular genetic strain um but it you know it was grown by this village in the india particular basmati rice for time immemorial right um and then so so i've got these cultivars and at what point was my cultivar no longer can i call it no longer land race right i've been growing pakistani chitchakush um that's one of these ones that derive from a wild population somewhere near the hindukus region of afghanistan um downhill it's south of there and in the foothills regions from the wild populations as i understand it originated um a lot of people say most of wild populations from afghanistan were wiped out during the russian occupation and those genetics only exist in seed collections is cultivars that have neck right um one of the things i wanted to point out with who was having is our around is is that they are actually in india uh there's a place that white people just really aren't really we're not allowed to go um it's a national preserve of genetic diversity of all plants and animals and species or not and that is like there's wild original cannabis growing there from time to memorial right and uh that is kind of so so when you get into some of the populations that people have have cultivated for sure ross and and areas nearby how far does that fall and go is it interacting and things like that are all asked questions and um some of the stuff i was going to bring up is how do we prevent um um man's pollution as we move things around and probably hybrids and distribute them and that's something my mentor lamented with in his own reality that he took seeds when he traveled the hippie trail and gathered from the sweet spots around the world where people were growing these garden varieties regional heirlooms uh in proximity to the wild populations and he was able to examine the wild population and go out and compare it with what they had in the garden and say well i want where am i getting my seed from right and um you know but he would leave some poly hybrids with them some people say in a smaller population you're going to pollute it and then a larger population is going to get wiped out but i have a hard time accepting that the small population gets wiped out and a bigger one just absorbs it that that's not in there somewhere is the recessive situation and so you know i'm kind of the understanding beliefs that you know besides these really remote pockets of wild genetics that aren't affected by anyone's pollen blowing around that's been selected by man there isn't a whole lot of wild stuff out there left um and that true original unadulterated even or those um i think a lot of the varieties have just been corrupted personally and that's one thing i'd like to talk to about is he seeing that and dealing with people and documenting folks around the world and and who are growing in situ and this created some really cool cooperatives to get these genetics out and rediversify um so so if you think about like an hourglass um you know wild populations got the most diverse it's got it's got all those nails going around females going around right right but as you get more selection it's getting narrower and narrower narrower right your bottleneck when you bring it out of the field and we have this cultivar and so um when someone uses the word land raise again a good a good thing we want to know is what level of that selection process is it at is it something that's grown in proximity to wild is it something that might have been a wild feral wild whatever right it can be super diverse it's also gonna be wild right that's it's gonna be wild you gotta tame it it takes work to bring that into submission to where it's something that like you can do a production thing um besides like being sadistic why would you even bother what most people say they see those little spanky little flowers and stuff like i why would you even bother with that man what what is what's your you know well having to fully understand fully better understanding of how everything works that's one thing for me um my desire and strife to produce more sustainable uh production methods you know affecting um um how how agricultural systems work in the world has been one of my life goals even along with being a household name for hard work and the best dad i can for my daughter doesn't my three three life goals and and so like uh you know if i collect wild grasses in my um hikes around on the hills and throw them in my front yard is it now a land race is the wild cultivar but we're not talking grasses i'm just using these examples these are things i do and when um you get for instance um something uh a a thai genetic right and there's a couple of uh it's kind of long understood from some of the older generations there's a highland and a lowland thai and that's stuff that you see in azarian's chart um describing um my my descriptions deal with the end user the concept of where did that come from is that coming from a garden patch in the jungle there's a bunch of wild plants and these things can grow for 18 months of flower after nine months of vegetation and throw off an entire arm of male flowers off of a female plant completely destroy somebody's growth regeneration's in if i didn't gain that wild genetic right and that's where my word usage comes from and why i want to expand like when people are talking it's like and then versus i've got i've got this pck that's been worked out i don't know how many generations canadian ran it before the guy i got it from got it and he ran it for six generations and i've now run three four i'm getting into like f5 of an inbred side shoot trying to keep two males and two females on my main line going right trying to keep that 60 40 purple but i've been selecting towards more potent purple right and then my offshoot is just like everything's these pinks and purples and oranges there ain't no green left except for on the leaf and it's got the frost and the potency of the green this is no longer pck right it's no longer pakistani just a fish at that point and and the my hybrid stuff is it still has diversity you're going to find my mentor told me walking in the fields around pakistan around the the um the titular kyber that um it was um the narrowest leaf plant he had ever experienced in all his travels right and all his breeding and and what for not was the what we call pakistani chittel chitralkush and mainline think of it as an indica because most of the selections were more of a wide leaf plant he says that was the narrowest plant he'd ever seen as far as leaf structure goes and i ended up getting some in and um they were coming out of this genetic that was already and read those many generations that were thinner than a pencil just amazing and i wish i could find these pictures and repost i don't think i have them on my instagram but um so so when when uh you see something from me called purple mutant chitchill stardust i literally found the narrowest leaf mutated inbred pakistani chips i don't know how what this guy i got it from said he thought he had read the trade out but there it was and i had to tease some pollen out of it because it seemed like such a runt right and this is the stuff that my mentor and i would discuss why would you do that well ended up producing one of the largest colas i'd ever grown it like out of a small pot of its you know downline descendant that so it's like you if you don't do it you're never gonna know it right it's like scott growing a moldy grow room so he knows how to fix it okay i do the same thing with with bugs and stuff but i also do the same thing with these runt plants and and so we're really just opening up the genetics of these plants and literally we we don't understand the true potential of individualized medicine regimes all this stuff that's we've lost a lot i mean there used to be 12 precursors to human and we really are or humanoid type things that were cruising around at one time and then we keep finding the indonesian hobbit people right and various other lineages that became us and that's all lost there might be a little bit of genetic code in some people and some regions of the world but for the most part so so we don't want to lose all these capacities of these plants and that's why we do preservation okay and that's why we we do these expansions first and when i get a hold of any genetic that's been bottlenecked or not i try and do an open pollination as many males and females as i can when and i do have um we all have the tendency of initially trying to remove um whatever mapredization we can right and so i try and do two of them where i do a selection of fibers one that didn't express her mathematicization or intersecting i'm gonna use that one um for in writing at the same time i'm doing an open pollination we get to the next situation is man that's a lot of work to do it's a passion right it's not for everybody there's a lot of intricacies for doing it when you get these plants in from different parts of the world one of the things that cued me into understanding the lighting and stuff um dj short we talked about in his projects when he's observing cultivars and moving around in his room where they would get different angles of light and different spectrums from the mixed lighting back in the day was hydro hps and metal halide right and that's all you had was the blue and red and then you would observe the ones would be stouter under direct angle of blue or red versus the side angle of one or the other and these are observations i make with timing a year putting things out from flip back into the sunshine and trying to determine like how do they respond with re-vegging and stuff and i'm kind of reverse engineering trying to figure out what's in this right what exactly went into this polypoly hybrid that i'm trying to breed to cross back across to my woof strengthen produce better skin what's going to pair with it and who am i going to give it to so and they ask me what fits in this region of the world right all these are reasons why i love what he's doing with this chart and describing the origins and then and it's just another way of describing where we found failure in for instance calling it a wide leaf or narrow leaf drug type when we see the pakistani agency that we all think of as an indica it actually can have an extremely narrow leaf and um of course everything i'm saying here there's somebody out there who's sitting there going [ __ ] alex is full of [ __ ] right this is my reality this is my experience this is how i've gone through the last 35 years and come to this point and i'm trying to explain to you how we all need to communicate and make sure we keep moving forward and why i i've given up on saying you have to talk like i talk or if you see my discussion on this today it came up and it's like yeah this is people get up and arms over and we have all the egos and and and i go back to it's like i'm owning it up you know everyone loves frenchie and i had a real bad experience with him over word usage literally the word keef and and i've been using it since i was a teenager and i broke out the dictionary that was printed the year i was born that literally describes the etymology of the word keith from old moroccan i'm sorry old old um uh arabic right and and the frenchies first experience with the word was in morocco and it describes chopped up leaf and tobacco and that's awesome that's his experience and and but for whatever reason our frequencies are so tight and there was this incongruency in our communication and then sorry you're not an [ __ ] we just miscommunicated and had a this is what i'm trying to say here is let's all continue to move forward on this communication understanding why there's so many diverse forms there's also irzon on his page shows these guys and i want to say it's in miramar i could have this wrong but these guys use that exact um technique for consumption of cannabis where it is literally this pressed ball of cannabis that they chop up with tobacco and it's this like regional process and i and i meant to at one point when we were in that discussion look at what the word was that they use for it okay and and because there's there's a culture that's using that today and has that process and that's their culture like that their exclusive consumption process is this really crappy just feel wet process packed together into these big bundles and like anything that in the western culture and they have this amazing cultural process and a piece of a special knife in the stone and then they carry a tobacco and they a little thing of water to wet it with and they mix it all up and they make this paste and they smoke it and that's how they consume and you know we want our dabs or some of us do i like flour personally whatever or hash i love that i've been making hash since mid 80s and i haven't stopped um i like playing with it i like handling i love all the different forms of it from around the world and there's some amazing different techniques of producing resins and but we all today use the word keef the same way it's that resin that collects at the bottom of the bag and it's very similar to the chocolate but the original word means feels good and the best translation i could find um and so uh yeah i'm i love making land race um hashes the different flavors and stuff um yeah so so i guess i was heading into um about like some of the intricacies of growing and you know understanding those lights and stuff in your grow room and understanding that using more blue light when you're in flower sometimes might be important to keep a plant from stretching out you're stealing um and uh i don't know i've got i had a list of things that we were gonna walk so just quickly on our slide chart so after general land raising garden variety right so i kind of went through that just talking about how as we move through from from selecting a wild or feral or whatever it is population something's getting grown in a small plot whatever in primitive agriculture it's going to spread it's going to go feral and you've got wild populations nearby um a great example parallel example would be like for instance um bozeman montana sweet pea festival right sweet peas grow wild all over the place and then people have their prized sweet peas and they're interbreeding and stuff right and they got their garden varieties of sweet peas and you can you can go online right now and find hundreds of very specific garden varieties of sweet pea and they all grow getting produced whether it's been cultivated into but they kind of select from something like that um and that's that's kind of the best way i can describe that it's more of a it's getting intermixed with the wild population still in my mind right and and but you know as we all understand there's so many diverse pathways of how all this stuff moved about how many possibilities that um you know and when uh consider maybe with my new mexico land grant when the padres and the farmers there were growing that and it um it was uh first went wild right and they it kind of they had a cultivar it went wild the wild population started adapting however long they continued cultivating it it was interacting right so so there's different pathways of this happening um whether it was growing wild and they're like so hey that that's a a better one for for fiber um [Music] these are it's kind of weird so so it's kind of hard to just literally see this is how it happened right it's like like how do birds migrate from in the weather patterns in north america they go all over the place where's the water at and then um and how does it happen it's confusing so to simplify it and say this is the only way you know went to pontagonico i used to believe all cannabis originated from hindu kush i don't believe that anymore um it's quite possible the pollen says it came from the himalayan pactos of northwestern china today in the discussion somebody brought up the possibility it all came from africa i'd never heard that one before so um but but there's there's definitely there's ways that we able to see with better information uh science somebody asked us to bring up today that if there's actually three species of ginette of of of cannabis and i'm not a geneticist so much but it um the the somebody has come up with genetic proof showing that the ruderalis is different from the um sativa from the afghanistan right and um which how did those developed how did did rooter alice go wild from afghanistan or from from a fire plant or um you know and then we look at we look at some of the the the chemical analysis of some of the older genetics and say well there's a lot of cbd in some of these and what were they you know some of them have that long inner node that they have some of that cbd and you get that kind of natural one to one developed over time to that heirloom selection process that i've described in there where it's we don't got any science to look at what's going on here you know it's a whole different thing once you have a laboratory and you're creating these hybrids that are scientifically analyzed like uh um the the genetic uh the genetic analysis guys are doing looking for the markers that say this one here's the mold for mentor or this one here marker says uh this one's susceptible to mold right and they're looking in and that's the same thing with our tomatoes but what ends up happening at that point you get all these super poly hybrid tomatoes that are developed in the university for disease resistance because you know tmv sucks in your tomatoes and you grow heirloom tomatoes um you're seeing a a wild ground cherry tomato it's a whole different thing um so so but but the the super hybrids they don't necessarily have the flavor the um and and so then they started reading back in and doing these these disease resistant uh heirlooms and same same kind of concept i'm looking for when i'm reading with land race or whichever level of them breeding from wild to um you know full-on i got to change the name now it's no longer pakistani fish it's pakistani fish um if you've ever been to zakistan visit it's a great place um after the pandemic yeah so let's see i guess the next slide was regional heirloom is is what i'm talking about right and that's what that's what most of us give is a land race i think literally when it comes down to it um we're getting something we call it an afghan right but you know since i started breeding or working with afghans i like i got like 30 different afghans they come from different families or regions right and like that pakistani chit-chat that's what i call a regional heirloom and and the discussion that we see in the literature talking about what is the land race this kind of like really gives us that that heart of that name right i think this is what most people are really getting at when they say land races is it's like what this this is uh it it totally coincides with the region whether the land it's not necessarily a selected one-parent bottleneck hybrid you know inbred it's got this diversity to it it's got the hand of man to it it's a production cultivar that's been selected for desired traits right and so so that is i think like if you've got a bell-shaped curve with word usage in the word land race that's going to be the highest point of occurrence uh the top of your curve let's see um china did cannabis studies on the land race determined it was the latitude that was the key factor and greg refactor to what if you don't mind following up on that they got a lot of your personal uh i'll let you know when he responds cool cool yeah they got a they got a lot of diversity there it's a big place all right and um yeah you know it also wasn't always all china so i have something from china that we would call several of them that i would love to get into a laboratory and try and revive i've been interested with that seemed to be dead no one was able to to revitalize and we need to get these ending into an auger with enzymes and stuff but this other one that i got a hold of and it it went through a collection in glastorban i think uh germany and their seed bank and was released and i acquired it through the infamous press and and uh i ended up acquiring pretty much the entire stock of original hemp seeds that he had before he bastardized a bunch of stuff with it and whatever happened you know hands off of that but i ended up with whatever went down i ended up with people giving me or i acquired through trade one of the largest collections of old genetic camps and um one of them was um a uh it's funny because he was calling them land races but they're they weren't these were full on like turn of the last century into the 30s in europe um cultivars primarily but some of them were closer to land race like this thing from china that's called the pink or senpai is what i've understood to be called and it is tested at three percent and three percent tac and cbd by people who had access to doing that and it was a definitely it's a fiber and a medicinal and it also produced a very beautiful healthy seed so it was a protein plant as well and it was multi-purpose and that one particularly was spread all over the mainland of old china and into korea in japan as well all tend to have that same genetic as what was reported in there i'm not sure if that one came out of glastonbury one of the other seed repositories that disposed all of their seeds sometime in the 80s i'm not mistake you know after our government went even more full bore on the war on drugs and such like that but um yeah so so um it's pretty neat trying to really look at the whole big question there that the china genetics that he determined they had more they had three zones one seven one northern and one in the middle yeah which coincides pretty much with what um with uh what is our ends presenting and um and he goes a little bit further and adds that elevation factor into your latitude and because um you know you you get island endemics and such like uh with plant species as they get separated um you know like like for instance um morocco right and in the atlas mountains the elevations that they're growing over 12 000 feet in elevation right near the equator right so that can you take that and you put it down at sea level and it's not going to perform the same thing um and and that's where he's getting into and determining how and what you know it's beautiful watching these guys growing their belia right and and uh i think we'd all agree we consider the lydia to be uh grown if over time immemorial in that location it's an open pollinated but cultivated strain right so regional heirloom is what i would call that um may or may not have wild populations nearby and but watching these moroccans when they they plant that like right about now things starting to sprout up there they you know they're up to 14 000 12 000 feet or above and here it's covered in snow it's i i went the powder ski and had one of the best runs in 10 years and 24 inches of snow the other day uh 10 000 feet was my top elevation right um so we take those things into into account right um they plant those now and they're little seedlings and come into um they don't got it wrong i think it's into june or or july i i could be wrong it could be the very beginning of august but it's like i'm harvesting garlic and they're sifting dry sift to beautiful the lydia um and it's like well is that an autoflower can i in but it it is what it is there i don't know how that's going to perform specifically elsewise like that right i know some other people have grown it and that's all no so so knowing how bottlenecked it is once you get it after those people grew it and things like that it all changes um some of the stuff that i was going to tap on today and we'll bring up we found out early in in when azeri and i were doing uh interactions um that taking seed even from a local cultivator and sending it to some location far away that sea might not ever germinate and so it's best to for people in that location to to select the cultivar or representative of whatever that land race might be from wild to um to very well inbred regional cultivar or heirloom and um that that uh getting reproduced in mass and modern um kind of situation where it can epigenetically adapt to a different growing situation um not in the field and then move from that position into people's private collections for breeding preservation abroad exit you and that's a word will you you might see it and then we've when that's the the word that brought me on the show actually was when i saw you guys talking about exit 2. you know and again so that's reproduced as best you can away from the place of origin and in situ is reproducing in its place of origin so and that that compounds that whole it's like well is it wild is it not wild inclusive in land race so once and here's where the magic happens is once you go to a wild population and take it to the hand of man does it magically become a land race if it only includes the hand of man anyhow um these are all just deep thoughts from alex um because i'm not telling you you have to utilize my word usage i'm saying this is the word usage that get used and this is the discussion around it and have a better understanding of what you're getting when you get it or don't um it'd be nice if people did more production of some of these because they're they're amazing um again you're going to get it you go man that that's just horrible i'm going to show you something right now this is one of the most asked for medicines from from patients let's see and it literally it was just foxtails and it was a feral sheila waffy from india that the zaryan sent me back the day i had inbred sent back and hybridized and created something i call peacemaker taking that pakistani which is horrible for mold all right those dry climates they don't they don't do well when you move them to a wet climate right um and i hybridize it with that tropical open stem the the picture in my mind is a bunch of small little golf balls on a big long stem they're too small to get big enough to rot inside because if you can keep those smaller than two inches they won't but those those are those are all reasons why it really helps to know what um the person you're talking to when he says land race means and um again we all know there's some people that um this only means that and i'm saying well it means this depends on who's saying it like um that word [ __ ] if we open the dictionary we're gonna find an actual definition of it and that's where you know if we could it'd be great um to agree on it that way um jargon just don't don't pull the thumb over somebody because they didn't use it the way you want them to that's the way that's what i come to is just like hey this is how i use it this is why so there's this last one slide we we did the regional right yeah oh yeah yeah yeah and then this one called the bar of land race yeah so i kind of went over that that's what once once somebody who's take gone out to that that location on the land where the people interact and and and have created that what was mostly referred to as land race out in the field um it becomes um a cultivar right you selected it and there at that point it bottlenecks there's no way to maintain the diversity of those field crops above right and in descending order you're losing you're losing diversity and and so we we call the we cultivar we ibl we select and for the most part most of us are just using the same heirloom selection processes and some of us might have access to um testing in the laboratory for for um afterwards seeing what the contents of the plant is and some of us might now have um access to to genomics to see if this is susceptible to rot okay so at that point these things are no longer land races right they are cultivar of land races and to call them a land race is incorrect unless you're utilizing that hyphenated um uh word right but but again that's that's mostly what we're buying when we buy a land race is something that's been bottlenecked in bread and whether it's two males to females is sometimes the best i'm reproducing and you know we have the best of our capacities to do these things one of the most important things i find in in the ethics of it all is just disclosing what you did to the next person has a clue right a lot of the stuff i get i got in trade and have not a lot of knowledge of its previous stewardship and um so that's like it helps to know all that stuff that we're talking about these start system when i do grow it to see what happens you know and uh by region what was it used for these things all all vary greatly and how they process it and that's going to make a big difference in whether it fits in what you're doing in your breeding or or producing a medicine for yourself or others um searching for that medicine think about um that this first cbg plants scraggly ass scraggly looking little things right and just in the matter like three years those guys hybridized that cbg production into these beautiful big plants that look like cannabis flowers marijuana flowers whatever you want to call it you know using the terminology it's all cannabis but it looked like these scraggly wild plants first started out with just a couple of little calyxes on it right um there's potentials and all of this stuff the story about the the the miracle pig right wilbur and uh name your name your runty plants that do the right medicine for you wilbur yeah um yeah so yeah then you start hybridizing with them i'll finish that bottleneck talk or the hourglass right so we've we've bottlenecked in and species or genetic diversity has been completely refined from that wild at the most diverse in those wild populations with no selection of male or female and they're able to adapt to that locality and then and then as it interacts with garden or regional and you still have open pollination but not necessarily you may or may not have wild populations around them because of agricultural sanity or sanitation and things like that um you you might have um a couple of males but when you're doing these production runs those guys are doing these huge fields in afghanistan they can't do that all with just one mail right they do go through and call mails and stuff and i'm sure they have specs for it i've not been able to chat with any of them about that i just see some videos of doing it sometimes and and people do this differently every village every region how many land races are there you name a village anywhere where it hasn't been eradicated and there's a land race right that's you know we get we don't have places here where we get we're starting to develop land races back in the states and stash everything gets bottlenecked after selection it gets more bottleneck more bottleneck whatever you're fine more refined and then you start breeding with it and maybe some of those those recessed traits get expressed and in in those pretty much every time you start hybridizing that's going to happen you've got two refined cultivars of anything whether you're super poly hybrid and then back refined into an ibl five and you cross that to another it's possible to be there any seed you open up it's a new hybrid there is those possibilities with some recessive or double recessive or chain linked double recessive comes out and expresses itself through all that's important and understanding but it okay so yeah as we probably hybrid though we're just calling hybrid everything man we got all this diversity and all this this gene pool that we have with all of these poly hybrids we have on the shelf and it's like no those all came from a very select few group of land race cultivars back in the 80s and that all everything hybridized from that right and now we're just in the last through the internet been able to go global and connect make these connections where we're now rediversifying from those open pollinated pollen populations and people are getting this genetic populations that they'll be able to select through and um each person who goes through a 10 or 20 pack of one of those is going to have a different representation a different cultivar and a different possibility where that can go especially with their library that they have to work with yeah that's uh so oh here's a question smiley's garden at a question i was thinking about earlier which is let's let's go back a hundred years ago when it wasn't being eradicated or 150 or whatever and people were traveling around the world and this is something that was growing in different regions of the world if i brought seeds from outside the local wild population and introduced them wouldn't i be adding genetic diversity rather than starting with the bottleneck yeah yeah okay so so in that scenario that's totally hypothetical because back um a 120 years ago say before eradication really began um it was going seaport to seaport it was getting traded by by overland traders and nobody who was selling it knew the breeder you know we're going to get that happen but you know in the 70s when my mentor was doing this exactly what happened was that but what happens is is if you bottleneck into a dominant genetic presentation and bring it into that diverse population it's going to dominate and overbear right you've got an extremely diverse population there but if you end up overbearing that population like what arjun's says happened in jamaica okay they say bringing in polyhybrids into that zone completely wiped out all the native uh land races that they had heirloom there for generations okay and there could be legal ramif you know reasoning for that as well where eradication was happening right but you know and but but you know at the same time when they're saying that it had no effect in the the land race populations of africa totally absorbed or in the utility absorbed the genetics they brought in that's questions that my mentor and i were like yeah i he and he had him i believe a master's in plant genetics his his parents were human cancer uh geneticists uh both nobel prize winning um doctors and stuff and so our discussions would go as far as i can but the like i i i only understand so much right i i have so much science and other people have none and some people have extremely more than me right um so so trying to trying to figure that out you know my understanding my belief is those original diverse populations were way more diverse than after we've bottlenecked and created these dominant strains that have dominant bottleneck polyhybrid situation um so so if you went in there with um like a less dominant hybrid that it wasn't so strongly bred in and it would more easily be absorbed right and and so these these are things that you hear about people who are breeding with the mail over time and they're looking at i know what this mail does and i hit it to a new female and see what the response is right um eventually in breeding you get to be able to really understand these these intricacies and um part of the hard part of as we move into the scientific world and legality of cannabis is translating all of this before it does completely bottleneck and and here at the university of utah they're studying for instance um hemp genomic scientifically in a laboratory and wonderful bugs does bugs be i'm sorry if i got it i totally got it wrong but the good doctor up there is used to working with he's a master of understanding light and plant response to light and my understanding is he did quite a bit of work with the lettuce all right and but lettuce had already been inbred to specific cultivars for 100 years in laboratory you know analyzed and everything and and then um here we all know and understand that each one of these different what we will call a strain of cannabis or hybrid of cannabis completely acts differently to all these different environmental uh stimuli and an epigenetic response to these things and and so one cultivar does not feed the same way and it's very difficult to feed them all at the same time on one hydro system for instance right and so but they're doing science with a strain of hemp in a hydro system and hemp just doesn't even like hydroponics to begin with unless you've adapted cultivated and bred one that likes a wet foot but it generally likes a more open loam for it to grow in preferably in general right i'm gonna say that because they're all different um and that that's where where we end up having issues with moving into science is like man this thing is it's a it's a big thing you put your head around um and and wrapping your head around that entire concept it literally each five minutes of what i said today is a whole two-hour show with a panel right having a discussion um i'm not saying anything other than it's not my way or the highway it's a big wide way and uh let's all walk our way along it and and some point along the way here everyone's gonna get healed hopefully let me bring up um this chart you can kind of give your comments on it and then maybe next week we can let me see he hasn't i i'm guessing he's asleep that would be my best guess yeah i mean it may well be you know literally on the other side of the world from us right um there's also a bunch of controversy came up on my post today uh uh pre-alluding to the talk and you know he i don't think he really wanted to pursue controversy and and might have felt shy at that whatever i don't want to presume either um so so uh but this right here and this whole this today's talk was spurred from his second presentation of this uh i'm not sure if you got it so fine for me i can't see it on my phone but but uh so the may 13th of 2020 is when he first posted it and it's clear and the newer one he posted it is a little fuzzy and basically what i was describing here is like you know so up in the arctic at sea level you can find liken at the equator you got to go up to 18 000 feet if you can find it right but uh it's there and you think about like the snows of kilimanjaro right there in the middle where um and of course they're like melting away but um that's a whole nother reason why we want to understand land races like where can we do this and use less water where can we adapt where can we make things work um you know back crossing that woof you select where you're living on that chart you select you know someplace around the globe that corresponds right and you can go you can go up and down you can go from the far corner right as long as you're kind of like looking like okay i live that this amount of uh latitude that's up and down north and south right um and i'm at this elevation where else on the globe can i select a particular to match what would i want to back cross this poly hybrid i have to strengthen it okay um how am i how am i going to make something work better for me where i live to provide for all those around me with putting less energy in it reducing my footprint how all this knowledge adds up right you know some of us just grow these things and see what they do and like not everyone can do that but it's not with the amount of people i've helped with some of these more wild plants and they're like dude that one so our roads here take the seed and grow it um it's um it's it's a powerful thing once you've got it all under control though right the communication the acquisition the presentation um for for [Music] our medicines let's see oh boy is so fine and at 50 years old i haven't found a pair of glasses that work yet and i don't know exactly why but this is this is talking about zone a tropical lowlands a1 16 to 20 weeks tropical highlands yeah 14 to 18 weeks zone b temp temperate lowlands same exact thing as the round chart in a different form right right different graph form so yeah so it it literally is just just kind of like saying hey this is where this was done at because because we can find tropical plants with wide leaf we can find alpine northern latitude plants with narrow leaf okay and so those are great descriptors but they don't cover everything and mine my little group of words they cover what they cover and they don't they aren't ultimate descriptors of everything right and what he's describing here does not ultimately describe everything either it's just another tool we can use to communicate in the discussion of what why where when um you know if you know it it might be 120 days of flowering that might not be something you want to spend you know your hard end dollars on investing on trying to reproduce without having a artificial environment for depending on your location if you live you live in a mediterranean zone you can play with just about any of these things because because if you understand how your your personal environment is um right that's another thing is understanding where you live and how much you can uh minimally adapt to your your micro climates with with a greenhouse or a cold frame right and that's one person's cold frame is another person's greenhouse um but that makes a huge difference you know understanding what these things are growing in whether it was a field or a wild or whatnot or what they prefer and like the kind of soils and what kind of cultural practices were done to the soils and the fields they were growing all that stuff can really add up into trying to reproduce that experience whether that is exactly what you want to do is reproduce the particular um sacred plant experience that comes from a various region that we no longer have this international shipping trades that used to bring the stuff around from various ports um and different medicines and you know you hear you hear people talking about the little fender joint you'd smoke it and several hours later you're just spaced out of your gourd like what just happened to me and it was like an 11 sativa you've never experienced that because you've never grown 120 days sativa even though i think now they might be a little more potent than that some of them i know i know i'm quite certain when the the the malawi gold i offer is considerably more potent than that i don't know that i don't know that the shield of waffy was though when it came down to it um and um maybe 15 tops but that's the one when i had it that everybody wanted so actually magma seeds asked in the very beginning and i told him i'd ask you later but he asked where you sourced your malawi from um there's a guy that went by the name of the illegally alive who i uh supplied uh his fico for his cancer treatments and uh he went full on pushing the legality of um of uh cannabis medically in florida uh after we saved his life um with fico raw cannabis oil and uh he was so damn sick so so i ran a group called the land race traders club and through that group there's about a thousand of us that were uh we had a mission statement that was basically to provide uh medicine to those who need it and reproduce and preserve for those who made it the future and our only deal was you couldn't charge anybody you could trade and pay stamps and um through that group i made quite a lot of connections and we did some other amazing things some other groups spun out of that and we healed a lot of people we saved a lot of lives um a lot of things shizmed off and then but people saw that there was a financial potential for that group and uh we're quite angry about uh a not being able to advertise in that group we're very strict and or be like uh i did do an offering charging postage for years of hard work where i distributed a [ __ ] down a seed for free otherwise the small nominal everything was under twenty dollars a pack and um included whatever it was people got upset and and that that place fell apart and somebody reported for for selling uh drugs which never happened through there and um that's why i acquired that that particular fellow that everyone was hating on because they didn't realize he was like dying in the hospital you know um and in need of love and not people harping on them for not getting the seeds they traded with them and that that's exactly where that seed came from it was labeled malawi gold and the pack when i got it and there's later there there's definitely once you become a public figure there's people who who uh disagree with you with all sorts of stuff and some people become a nominated to you and by no means do i have all people who love me um you reading that discussion day on instagram i'm an [ __ ] to people who perceive me to be an [ __ ] um there's one person in particular who's called into question a particular person who grew that seed from seed 12 and 12 and it produced a wider leaf uh throughout that entire um growth period of growing from 12 and 12 from seed than you would expect to see from a fully mature plant that was grown from sexual maturity stage after it had uh vegetated for a while and then flipped over and as we all know every plant will have a wider leaf to a narrow relief as it um progresses into flower and uh you can see pictures of um franco standing in fields of um malawi gold particularly where you have extremely wide lease down by his calf and extremely pencil thin leaves up by his elbows okay so um this is just a trait that occurs in all plants and as i said before there is diversity in all of these plants and before i even presented and i checked with a group called the uh malawi land race preservation and it was a couple of brothers there in malawi and i checked with them and he said yeah we have great diversity depending on highland and lowlands and to cover all of our geography and weather here that this this uh wonderful country has and it's part of our land race and uh you know i grew it out 120 days and before it matured under the microscope and uh smoke it and it's like holy [ __ ] nothing i've ever smoked before and i went ahead and sent out some packs of malawi gold maybe it doesn't and like you said this this one patient grew it like that from seed 12 to 12 to try and cut out some of that six month period and uh one person who had an amenity to me decided to say this person who had also never grown an afghan skunk in their life or malawi gold in their life started a huge conversation and tagged me 300 times in one day in another land race group declaring that it was not malawi gold but other people have grown it out um can be lydia and um colorado grew it out and uh affirmed in her belief it is definitely 120-day malawi gold with khtv in it and whatever y'all can buy a sack and grow it out and have it genetically tested if you desire but that's that's part of the reality of all of this we really we don't know it um unless unless you went out to the field and got it yourself you don't know um but i went through all that confirmation and dealt with like everybody asking where that came from for you're the first person in two years now since i've heard anyone bring that up and then uh i've blocked mike on every platform i possibly can because i just don't need it um someone wants to pay for the genetic test i i got some of the downstairs i'll send it please do um it'd be neat to find out if it got the hybrid at some point or whatnot but uh there's something else i'm going to work on very soon with stan craig i i'm not sure if phil stan craig is kicked the bucket or not i know he was sick and i acquired sort of the same group of people from him malawi gold that he had inbred down over 12 generations into something closer to 60 days maybe 70. and um soon hope to open that up and and do a concert comparison of the two of them um but but definitely at some point though the particular malawi gold i have was bottlenecked away from that general population right and um so if at any point you know you look at it you say that doesn't look like the malawi gold i've grown well it probably isn't um and that's the nature of it this is definitely an inbrey cultivar that i've got not i i can't fathom it being anything that was close to being a wild or or garden variety from malawi but it does still retain specific flavor notes that meet the criteria the flower structure from what i've seen meet the criteria yeah it's a it's a great question and thanks for bringing it to the forefront appreciate the opportunity to teach and learn yeah what's your nature social media though is like anyone can say anything right i've never known that but it ain't what that is right that's what we call a troll but i have an opinion troll i have a pointy red hat a beard and a red shirt sorry what is it uh is it too late for you and your daughter to go skiing it's only you know what 120 yeah yeah i know you know she doesn't get out for another hour so if there's questions and stuff people want to have discussion i'd love to if if that's all we've got for now i'm i'm um i've got plenty of work to do that's all i really have in my notes that i can think of i hope i didn't offend anybody because i know i always do but i i think it's funny because my my biggest takeaway from what you said is we all have different definitions for things and that's okay you know as long as as long as we clear that up at the beginning you know we don't get into arguments and fights we just like hey this is what i'm talking about this is what i mean what do you mean we're you know that's um i had somebody on on one of my little soil presentations of natural soil tell me hey you're going to bring some bugs in to your garden at some point like yeah but that's the point and then you look at his page and it's like salt grower never organic it's like well yeah i guess i wasn't talking to you was i um but that's what i do is i teach organic and more this more basic rudimentary cannabis uh history science love stuff and try and make it uh go from we're all in this from the scientists to the end consumer right and in that word sativa means a very different thing all along the spectrum and saying i'm better than you because my meaning of the word sativa wasn't proper in the context you put it in just doesn't help so someone pointed out uh we have four ironically 420 people watching right now perfect so why don't why don't we end on that and we can out we can always come back later uh cool i got a whole lot of [ __ ] to pack up and hopefully some patient people on the other end uh cool i get i got some seeds to go out too and uh all right well thank you everyone and and yeah we'll we'll regroup with uh indian land race exchange uh possibly next tuesday possibly tomorrow not sure quite what day uh maybe we'll try a different time slot to make yeah you're still awake yeah definitely appreciate you all thanks for listening and watching and having a great discussion and grow on all right thanks everyone", "c9YHvOAPIYs": "type of consistency good morning everyone except for guess what it's actually not morning it's actually very late in the night because we were doing a special blog for you guys today I am partnering with sugar cookies by step and you guys we are gonna show you how to do sugar cookies we've done this once before it went over very well those are Valentine's cookies but we need Christmas cookie it's time it's time and christmas is upon us stephanie is going to show us the entire process of making sugar cookies ooh Stephanie is gonna show us exactly how she makes these exactly what goes into them she's going to clarify a few things because we were just discussing the questions that people always have some questions of people always say how many cookies does it make what kind of butter is it what do they say salt I get asked if it's salted or unsalted I always get asked if it's a typo that there's four teaspoons of baking powder typo answer though answer all of them okay so how many cookies does it make I think it makes three to four dozen depending on the size depending on the size you guys because she makes a cute little teeny tiny one tiny ones you could get sixty but I mean if they're like average three to four it probably poor doesn't well it's pretty generate quite a bit yeah it makes about four dozen yeah Psalter unsalted salted salted okay salted butter is it a typo to put four teaspoons a baby without a lot of typos there's four teaspoons oh where did you get this recipe I wanna know the story behind this is that my dad had it as a child and it was this thing is ancient just kidding Johnny it's right I don't my dad grew up doing this recipe with his mom and they got it from a neighbor lady oh and some neighbor lady a new job there's some neighbor lady it's from the neighbor lady yeah I have posted this recipe on this is how we bingham calm on our blog but i think i'm going to do a revised recipe with the details of salted butter how many it makes so we're gonna get started stuff is gonna show us how she makes this recipe it's really easy although I've never done it it's super OB we need a cup of salted butter softened I usually just put it out the night before so if I'm making cookies the next day put it out the night before room temperature it's a little bit colder in the winter than when you wake up in the summer but and this is a Bosch mixer I have a standard KitchenAid I was wondering when I came here the first time I was like what are you using Team Bosh not 10 kitchen aides I know once you've had a Bosch mixer you would never go back to kitchen it just looks like an old machine they're known to make bread we make cookies here so after room temperature softened butter salted salted one that's a sugar Wow one teaspoon of vanilla I don't want more dishes so I just use the cap good if nobody wants more dishes why would I want to do dishes gonna mix this first and then we'll have aches [Music] I'm just gonna scrape the side make sure it mixes really well I'm gonna mix the dry ingredients separately and then we're gonna add them in there we have four cups of flour I do get asked what kind of flour it's just flour it's just white flour like it's just regular flour not cake farming or anything it's nothing special okay and then I do a half a teaspoon so not the whole thing but again I don't want more dishes want you to want to do the dishes I'm using the same with half a teaspoon of salt and then four teaspoons baking powder well mix all of our dry ingredients together make sure that they're evenly mixed we'll add it to this step all at one time yeah oh you mix okay Wow all in you're going all in looking for trick guys this is my trick so then I take my bowls I don't want flour everywhere super-nice doh okay now it's ready it's ready so now she has got it all mix she's going to put it on this awesome silicone mat just awesome kiddo what are you putting down flour but it's probably somewhere between third is perfect it's honestly she's been doing it for so long she just knows what to do look at all of these tricks though remember the first time I watched Stephanie do this I was just shocked that she like beats the crap out of her dough so you guys can see not how thick she has it not crazy thick it's just perfect honestly and she uses a really great silicone yeah this is actually Wilton oh wow that's a great silicone rolling pin yeah any craft store would have it are we ready - Mindy should do this I'll do that yeah do it let's do like six of each so we can have enough to practice on [Music] my favorites I want to be a rebel and do the bumpy side I know it's cute but only if you're going to baby shower or something Wow look how perfectly it fit we did the right amount of stuff everything she uses is like silicone she Pat's everything in the flour and she's putting his very close together and you guys will notice she is using parchment paper I think the parchment paper goes in this drawer look okay we should show everybody your course so this is from Orson giegi yeah and she buys it but it's not like a half she cuts like a half of an inch we saw her do that in the last video they don't play well together anyway she uses this parchment paper puts it down that way I think the bottom of her cookies are never browned they're always just perfectly cooked they're all ready and you guys are gonna notice they are gonna stay true to their shape spread very much they really don't I've been so surprised I'm gonna make these for myself we're gonna do these on Christmas Eve we're gonna let the kids do it okay look you guys double oven I need to get one of these how long do you cook them so when I give out the recipe I can to just say 350 for eight to ten minutes because I really think it's gonna depend on your oven and I don't even know if this is really a thing or if I'm just making it up in my head but I have seen because we live in Utah we're kind of it a little bit higher altitude that can also affect your cooking so it's gonna depend on every single oven so yeah they raised but they don't necessarily spread like some no they don't use their shape oh I forget we have to going on here and our little square these are gonna be so cute these are gonna be Santa's obviously snowflakes and Christmas trees we are now going to make the frosting Stephanie has like a really awesome method to this if you have a really awesome method because oh I don't see what I was looking for but where's your squirt bottle oh yeah okay we do that later oh it's in there okay these are two pound bags by the way the recipe calls for four pounds powdered sugar once it gets mixed with something like this you get a lot yes two bags of this the next step which is probably the most well I use Wilton meringue powder because I've tried other stuff and it does work it did not harden icing like I wanted it to so stupid Wilson even though it's pretty pricey but it works so well this recipe calls for 3/4 a cup I have had people ask me what if I want to half this recipe just use one bag of powdered sugar and they're like how do you have 3/4 a cup I take this and I just fill it up halfway so is this the 3/4 3/4 if you want to have this recipe just fill it up halfway are we making a full wrestle somewhere between a third and a half I mean it's like one and a half one third somewhere around there is the water room temperature cold what does it I mean I think warm would be best and we'll do two tablespoons of vanilla or any flavoring I mean I do vanilla but a lot of people like almonds would be good yeah so any any flavoring you want now we have to mix it I broke my hand mixer because well I break them about every two to three months seriously you ought to buy a new one every two to three months because this frostings thick and I'm making these multiple times a week and so I'm not saying I'm gonna break Mindy's because it won't happen I could use a new one I've had the same one since I was so I got married are you serious yes no I buy a new one like every two or three months I mean I wonder if it's because I was buying the $20 ones man I bought a nicer one and it's still broke so oh okay well buy the crappy ones yeah here is my crappy one that still has everything in it cuz I don't use it that much look and you have all the different options for mixing let's do it so what I'll tend to do is kind of get that mined powder mixed in a little bit before I actually turn on the beaters I just like to kind of get a mixed you know together then we've got our water mixed with vanilla will you just go all in right away I'm curious to see if she breaks it after one [Music] so now comes the part that Stephanie is so amazing at and she's gonna try and help me again to do it you know with every different cookie design that she does it's like a new art she is going to now show us how she mixes all of her frosting so the meringue powder is what makes the frosting setup so she's covered it in a white paper towel until we're ready to use it so what I usually do is actually what you want to remember is to mix this well it's just but I think that's good enough for today we're gonna start with white because we're gonna be the fair amount of white for what we're doing this consistency for piping what you want it to be is similar to toothpaste kind of a soft but what we're gonna do is mix colors put them in the saran wrap and those are gonna go into the piping bags almost show exactly but for now we need some white I don't even need to thin it out I think it's gonna be pretty good consistency and you take it you put it right in the middle of that square saran wrap fold corner to corner and then just kind of twist it up and we will let it sit well we do some others so we're gonna need to do some white what we'll do with each of these is will probably be needing like an edge and then a fill icing so a piping and a fill so the piping obviously is this consistency or it will keep its shape and then I feel like Singh will be really thin so we'll Piper on that edge and then fill into the middle now she has put some new white so here's the first white this is what we're gonna turn into a color no there's not gonna be the fill okay bill what we do and I use a spray bottle so that we don't get too much water at a time so you can work with the consistency and make it the exact consistency that you want if you were to just walk over to your sink and put some water in here you're most likely gonna get too much so it adds it nice and slow that's it really slow you can really like decided how much you need she's gonna go back some more okay your arm has to die after all again I do have like blisters on my hand oh my gosh good now there calluses now as you're doing this what is the consistency you want of the fill I see I think we're getting to that point so the fill icing needs to be the consistency of like probably shampoo so it will fall right off the cookie got an edge it's very runny but not too runny I mean it's it falls right off the spoon so what we're gonna do is put it into these bottles but a lot of time I can tap it on the counter to get the air bubbles to make it to the top because we don't want air bubbles in the cookies you guys everything that Stephenie uses has a silicone bottom I noticed that about this little bowl she used this one has a silicone bottom she's the silicon spatulas everything she uses is that soft silicone tell us what kind of coloring you use oh yes that is another common question actually people wonder how we get such bold colors cuz you know their little stuff you buy at the grocery store the little drippy yeah that doesn't work so americolor is my very favorite brand except I have something else this is this is hobby lobby's brand and it's just as good so you can do either one this one I'm running really low but I like it some change and so does a little bit go along oh yeah it's very potent it's very very old yeah really great colors so what we're gonna do is we're gonna mix this blue and I first want to get a piping consistency then I'm going to take a little bit out for my piping and then thin out the rest of it so that I'm only mixing this color once and so the color is match [Music] she has whipped up all of the colors here guys will see all of those right there and now she's making up the black but she says okay we need to talk about this what do we need to know about the black okay there is an icing consistency that is somewhere in between piping and whoa and what it is is it just kind of means that if you were to take your spoon and like run through it that it'll take about 20 seconds for it to get back to settled oh wow so we might not be quite there yet you might use it for just things that you need them to go flat but you don't want them running off the cookie so it's just an in-between and it's really hard for me I'm not super good I just find that perfect 20 seconds and is it always with black or is this just this is just design that we need right now I just need it you guys are gonna notice that her little cup has all different colors in it it's because she started with the lightest color first and worked her way darker so she didn't have to wash and rinse them up every time do you notice the theme Stephanie hates dishes [Music] these are her piping bag these are the bags I don't put the icing right into the bags as you've noticed they are rolled up into a saran wrap plastic wrap stuff and we are gonna put them into these piping bags so you put in your coupler thing put in your coupler first and then you'll get your color he'll kind of twirl it around again you're gonna put it straight in it's just much faster than sitting and filling bags oh yeah done that much much cleaner too and she just cuts off this ran up off the end puts on a tip there you have it perfect we'll do that so I was just over here looking at all the different things I'm like do you always use the same size so what size one of the most common questions like people ask is what size of tip is good for piping and I always use a two and then for writing words that's like a 1 sometimes you could use a 2 for that as well depending on how small your writing is she has like every shape size I feel a little bit like a child we have like a little art setup here she has a trait I have a tray we are going to do this you want to start with the sound of first art the San Jose because they have sprinkles on at the end and we need the whole thing to be pretty dry before we can do the end sprinkles I'm going to show you that and then maybe is gonna try okay for these Santa's we're gonna do a super easy white rectangle just down the middle that's it then so this is the piping now this is called the fill or the flood yes either one is fine and you're just gonna put it in fill it up there and I like to take a toothpick and just swing it to the edges you know help bring it to the edges I don't let it go over the edge and if you see any bubbles you can pop them it's hard to see them but you kind of Easter they'll show up and that is what we need to start with and then you let this set up for just a minute yeah can't let that set up we're gonna do the same thing with red I'm gonna need rectangles of red gotcha but if it goes over [Music] a little later okay ten more five to shoot more I feel like I can do this because I do nails all the time but cookies and nails are very different can I leave that while I do do next one yep next we're gonna do red on these little Santa's so we neither red on each side so you're basically doing another rectangle [Music] get them dry and work on foods you've got here okay we're gonna put them under the pan while we work on other stuff so that'll be good and give one more perfect okay now ready the snowflake most cookies are gonna have two or three layers you need to get that base layer down which way we're doing and then we have a couple more layers of things on top of those these are only gonna have two layers because we're gonna do blue on bottom and then the white snowflake design and then we'll be done and then the Christmas trees that we're gonna do are actually just one step all these are kind of like when we did like the frost the fill on the fill and then we yeah like played with it a little bit as you can see this cookie cutter it does all these fancy shapes but to be honest I don't do that because once you pipe on the snowflake design you really can never tell that you did that I tend to just kind of go around not really following any hard edges because I just in the end I just don't think you're gonna be even notice this looks hard you could do it maybe the same thing piping around the edges fill in the middle then we need to get this under the fan so that we can do our snowflake design I notice if I fill this way you know kind of cross but you get too much in the middle so when I'm doing the snowflake so I'll kind of turn to go there's like two spots two spots and two spots like that and then just spread it out with the toothpick oh that sounds easy enough so we'll just fill these up get them on the fan and move on to our trees this just goes to show you how much work and how each cookie has so many different steps so we just did the blue I broke one of my cookies on the shell flakes and I ate at the little corner those chicken and now we're back to the Santa's is the 22nd frosting she was telling us well if you remember we had the 22nd I see and the reason I wanted it is because we're gonna make buttons a lot of the time when you're doing like dots or any kind of dot you've got to have it settle it'll settle or you can do this and it'll settle those looks so good though so then that 20 second hold sheep but it is not running everywhere before we do Santa's black belt these two knots are not the same size they should be we're just gonna put some white down the middle of these colors just kind of puts a little finished look on it then we're gonna go right over the top of it we are gonna make a rectangle going this way so many rectangles so many rectangles if you notice we are doing piping and fill with this same icing xxii because we needed it for the buttons anyways it works just fine for we have out you spread it around it'll be fine so there you go we did the rest of our Santa's they're over there drying by the fan and now we are gonna start Christmas trees they're gonna be super cute these are gonna be a one-step cookie and you'll get like your fun sort of I mean yeah one layer there's no drying before you have to wait for anything right okay okay we're gonna outline in white you could do any color obviously if you are under green [Music] that's gonna be the fun part we just barely put the white on it is still away I'm so excited I have a bubble I wanna pop okay so you're gonna take green fill icing again you can change the color but you need some sort of fill icing and we are going to go like this so I can fourth woo then you're gonna take your toothpick you're gonna start at the bottom right in the middle and just go straight up the my gosh they're beautiful then we want something that looks like lights right some little Christmas lights so don't want them all over my floor so we'll put them on a plate we're just gonna like kind of scatter these Christmas lights and honestly this is this part this step is not on my Instagram posted my last either side of it I thought it'd be cute aren't those cute they look so cute and you know what's cool is the colors are not bleeding in the frosting cuz sometimes bring your do that we just had to add sprinkles because we're working with the bands people of ours wrinkles okay ready we're gonna do a pretty simple tree stump I just like to go back and forth like a little tree stump yeah so I just went back and forth then my thing got clogged we're gonna try another one but you can just make it super simple like that those are so cute [Music] now we're moving on to the snowflake again so we let this dry for what 20 minutes or so and then we're gonna do a snowflake design before the middle dress I'm going to get some little blue dahlia just put it right there and then the design you're gonna want to do is just use little bees I guess you can see these look like Elsa cookies they are Elsa cookies [Music] we are now back to mr. Santa Claus hey guys we're gonna hope that this is dry enough so we can apply some sprinkles sometimes if you apply sprinkles too early it sticks to the whole country one that up and the work that a short on time as you can see it's a little up it pastillas the reason we did this though is so we have kids running everywhere right no no okay we're having fun we are gonna actually make Santa a thick buckle on his belt and so I'm switching my tip to a four if I had a five a 95 but 4 is fine we're gonna hope this works out I think what I'm gonna do sometimes I will pipe something and then sprinkle right over it other times you can pipe and then you could even put some sprinkles in here and just turn it over oh that's a good idea so I think that's what I'm gonna do so that I don't completely hit the entire thing we're gonna make a pretty thick square here might even go a little thicker like that okay that's his belt buckle there oh my gosh that's perfect oh yeah I think that you can just kind of make sure you get sprinkles everywhere if that's bothering you like it is me okay that is so cute okay this is my favorite just kidding I love the tree I don't know I love them all [Music] now Steph is doing the cleanup process you guys can I tell you it's way more fun to make a mess in someone else's house yeah just kidding I hope they're cleaning up she has to do it all

see you guys tomorrow [Music]", "PmiW2BYbtBY": "hi it's ashley from sweet dreams bake shop and this video is a bit of a follow-up to my live video if you caught that yesterday where i started making these vintage bunny cookies now i showed you guys how to do a little bit of this but i'm going to go a little bit more in depth so i am using some pipe and sled icing if you don't know what that is you can check out this video i have on royal icing consistency and notice i did not use a piping bag for this this is a very very large cookie so when i'm doing very large cookies like that i just find it easier to spoon on that royal icing this is a short clip from my live where i showed you how i painted on those flowers and i also did some wet on wet technique on a different cookie which i'm also going to make into a little vintage money cookie i'm going to be showing you a little bit more about wet on wet technique later on in the week if you want to see more about how i create those kind of brushed flowers don't worry we will go back to that in a little minute now i'm just freehanding a little bunny here i want this to look more vintage so i did have to look at a little picture but honestly it never really turned out exactly like the picture so i just made a little bunny silhouette and i am filling that with some flooding consistency now in order to brush these flowers all i do is i take a little bit of piping icing and i do recommend piping icing so that it doesn't just lose all of that definition completely then i'm taking a dry kind of hard bristle brush and i'm just brushing it through so we get those really nice strokes if you find that the icing is lifting completely that means that your icing needs a little bit more moisture so add a little bit of water to it but not too much i first tried to use this technique when i was just starting out with cookies and then i tried it again and again and it never seemed to work and i always found it was because the consistency of icing was not correct so whatever you do make sure that you always re-whip your royal icing to make sure that it's the right fluffy consistency to give it even more of a vintage vibe i did go around some of the flowers and added kind of a squiggly line as well i'm going to add on a little bunny to our wet on wet technique cookie right here as well i'm going to do it in a bit of a different direction you'll notice there that i didn't really like the shape of the bunny that i created initially so i just scraped it off now make sure that the cookie is fully dry before you do any scraping and if you want to know how to dry your cookies quickly go ahead and check out that video in the right hand corner now i'm creating a bow and i'm being very careful about which lines i'm going to create right now since i'm using flooding and piping consistency i am going to want to dry those layers in between so that i maintain the definition same thing with the bunny's ear here you'll notice that i did one section tried it and then i finished off the other section decorating cookies and wanting that kind of puffy look rather than a sectioned off lined look which is how i used to do my cookies is really really reliant on the order that you do the cookies in and it's also reliant on the texture of your frosting as well i'm just brushing this out so there's not a definitive line but i am going to be adding on these little easter eggs here now it's really really important that when you're adding on any of these things that your consistency is correct because if not you're going to get flooding everywhere so you do want to make sure that your pipe and flood consistency is nice and puffy after this bunny is totally dry i am going to do a little bit more of that brush technique on the side just to give it that vintage vibe i'm using my piping consistency to create all of these dots all over the place you could do this with pipe and flood consistency but then you would have to leave a space in between every single dot now i'm using my edible pen to draw on the eye and i couldn't really decide upon the exact type of eye i wanted until it all started to come together then i'm adding in a few black lines here and there i want to make it look a little bit more sketchy now you'll notice with this easter egg one i'm going back in i'm filling in all of those gaps just to create all of that definition so see how we have the eggs kind of stacked on one another instead of things all melting into one another that's all about letting that dry properly now this is how i drew the other eye except this time around i knew what type of eye i wanted to draw for this and then i'm going to go ahead and add in those lines i'm being very very gentle by the way about how i'm drawing on this even though those layers are dried using my special technique it is a little bit more susceptible to being punctured so i do want to be very careful with it still [Music] then go ahead and add on whatever other details you see fit [Music] if you were watching my live then you heard i didn't really have a definitive plan for any of these cookies but once i saw it get to that point i really thought this cross hatching would look really nice here to create these lines may look really really tricky but all you're really doing is you're dropping and lifting those lines and you just want to make sure that you leave a tiny space in between even squeezing pressure is also the key so there we have it we have our adorable vintage bunny easter egg cookies and i absolutely love these i will never want to eat them so more than likely i will give them to somebody else who hopefully will eat them and enjoy them i briefly talked about how on my live it's a little bit trickier pricing these larger cookies it's a bit of a harder sell because you don't want to implement a minimum with this but it's a lot of work so i would only offer this as a stock order for thirty dollars and for the smaller cookie it would be six dollars per cookie and i would also implement that 24 minimum thanks so much for watching guys don't forget to like share and subscribe so you can be part of the sweetie fam right now i'm uploading weekly so make sure you hit that notification bell so you know when i upload also be sure to comment request or ask a question i love hearing from you guys bye", "_LVFvWNXCOY": "okay what's up you guys take four again as usual technical difficulties so tonight has been a pretty good night for me hope you guys are doing well yourselves I was looking back at my videos and I realized when I was doing four strands the last two nights I was kind of like doing a review kind of sort of but not really I realized I didn't lemon G in both videos so I was like oh god how did I myself I got plenty of flavors but I decided let's slow down what's the rush it's not even December yet yet some really cool strains to review and so I decided to cut it down to two and then tonight just because I've been such a good boy got two kids to bed after a long night of feeding and pooping and cleaning and pooping and feeding and cleaning finally got them to bed and got the dishes done and go my wife's laundry done I'm in good it's past midnight and this is take four as you can see again my ice has completely melted because this is my first and will be my only drink of the night but I warmed up my dinner again it's a little past midnight but let's get to Davin let's stop talking so the two strings I was going to do tonight I wanted to do some more crafts some silver push live resin coming in at seventy five point five eight percent TCA and this bad boy smells very sweet it's got a very sweet smell not a citrusy smell more kind of similar to like like a sunset sherbert or kosher kosher maybe even Lucky Charms this smells a little bit like the Lucky Charms which I would really like the Lucky Charms so we had that and then the second strain is when I've done a long time ago but it was sugar live sugar and this is live rosin and it's definitely different definitely this is blue muku and this is coming in at 86.3% the8 now the sugar that I had some out last time I was there it was it was moist it was a lot superior than this a lot less crystals and yeah it was more it definitely had a stronger room aroma now and I could be wrong but I think it's just a matter of the head put a lot of Terps in there so it had a very strong smell and even taste but definitely I don't think is good as a high I've had blue Magoo a few times and this is the second or third time I've had to live resin so I'm looking forward to doing that strain for number two but I wanted to cap the night out with something good I've already done this and I haven't really reviewed it I barely did a video on it it is the viola 3 layer cake and this is my string that's coming in at 99.9 percent THC a check it out it is something to behold mmm it smells like garlic cookies are like Khemu garlic cookies or something like that anyways I was gonna pull out another piece of glass tonight but I have like three or four pieces that are like flower pieces and they take a lot of water and need quite a bit of it takes like a chug and then I have a couple really small pieces that I wanted something with low filtration because I want to taste these but I want to also have some filtration so I decided to just go with Old Faithful this is the Aphrodite rig from smoke cartel and they are not paying me they at all I'm not I don't know I'm not saying I love this ring it's my daily driver I'll tell you that much there is a choke point right before it gets to the two little propeller spinner type deals right there where if the oil gets down there and gets right where that choke point is it won't allow air to pass through into those and so it completely stalls the regen so that kind of sucks we're not going to do an insert today we're gonna do this we're going to put it straight in the bucket because it will go quicker I can go lower temp I can monitor it better and we'll be quicker with the whole thing so that's do you know I was gonna do a bigger dad because but then I was like you know I actually already did a dab of this for to my first take and phone messed up so let's take two or take four technically Cheers hope you guys are having a good night or morning how do you want to look at it okay so I'm gonna read this long just because apparently my files in trance work and my phone is telling me I only have 21 minutes or something and I can't really tell because I'm gonna really look right at the moment see where we're at but that taste is amazing it really reminded me a coaster cuz a really fresh clean it's a really good taste I wish I had another one on the balloon Magoo we're gonna go through this I'm sorry I probably it's probably for the best I talk too much anyways take a few of these diamonds out get a little Terps with it I like to clean the sides leave the big rocks for the last night cheers let's go right at it [Music] my god okay so that 100 that was uh it was good that was good it tastes good um like I said the last one I tried was very chirpy yeah definitely more to me than that nice the taste wasn't as sweet as I had anticipated but when I smelled it it didn't smell as strong as the last blue manures but I'm telling you it's just a matter of interface last but not least I don't even know why I'm doing this I can barely breathe I'm break a tiny little stone off here I had to break a big stone to pull this off 99.9% okay need to take a break all right I gotta run this phone screwing up I'm surprised you didn't shut off already oh good I did it in time uh for what saying now that I'm completely twisted guys I'm sure some other people may have questioned the numbers in my first video and I haven't dad but not much since I've actually been sticking away from Ikea I think maybe because I didn't want to be let down but since then I've breaking off tiny a little bit let's try it each time was a pretty good experience when half the size of the dab I usually do maybe a quarter it's really in my new amount that I need to do with it it gets you right there right behind the eyes well if I had to pick taste wise honestly honestly out of the three of these taste wise the craft gets it the silver cush gets it taste wise potency wise obviously the three layer cake no doubt potency wise it kills it every time good strength like I said I've had it several times and enjoyed it enough to get it in several more times so hope you guys are safe hi happy enjoying yourselves peace and love have a good one", "x8DmFYomNag": "yeah three there four weeks old this one's cool we florrum these ones are three weeks down the three days I don't know why they're so small compared to this one but this one's a giant look at its lock on it see that see but the leaves are doing that thing you can where they crumble see that I don't think it's a fungus I think it's over watering I do turtle girl water did initially in this area harro garden so I'm gonna get him out of here and pull you in dirt fungus I don't want to introduce the fungus into mine cabinet which they don't have yet my cabinet but I do have show you what I do have I have Fox Farm soil see that there's my light right here here's my inline fan right there so I'm all ready to go I would do a damn good job with you you see me do down I'll do a job with here see my dad okay picking it up you'll see this knob okay yes", "ahxZujQ_sqQ": "okay please excuse the increased speed of dialogue but i have found that i have to literally pause the laundry machine the ac i have to turn everything off to just get some decent audio to speak to y'all i have grape sugar cookies by bedford grow and i'm saying it in that specific tone because this was a strain i seriously have not seen for about two years right when i first got my card the effects on this one between me and some of my other friends we just felt we're really special we're really just in their own way relieved anxiety and induced relaxation with such unique terpene profile that it just stood out above the rest i almost couldn't believe when i saw it on the menu and i had many choices but i had to grab this one so without further ado and before my what does that mean does that mean you're turning off ugh god [ __ ] but as i was saying let's get that first sniff grape sugar cookies bedford grow it's been forever i literally do not even remember what this smells like oh yeah it's bedford so they have that lift and peel [ __ ] if you don't cannabis packaging is [ __ ] [ __ ] it does not do anything okay so here here we actually go the real first sniff oh my god licorice licorice oh my god oh my god this absolutely has grapes and licorice oh and the licorice is like black licorice it's like not even cherry or anything oh oh it's just it's nice to receive a strain with grape in the name and still be hit with such a a musk if you will such a such a funk oh my god that is crazy um the looks are outstanding let's definitely get in on these [Music] wow seriously we've seen some some vibrant buds on the channel but these are nuts you really really see i i mean these are it it's sugar man it's literally covered in trichomes beautiful colors beautiful colors coming out of this this almost looks great this looks fake this is crazy let's get this grape sugar cookies in the air man almost feels like a uh whoa whoa dogs going crazy wind you know holy [ __ ] okay this wind's getting crazy i'm gonna just hit this [ __ ] i brought this the taste is insane it's got it's got that same like licorice thing going on whoa whoa man whoa i have chills i really have goose bumps i'm telling you ah so refreshing so enlightening almost 21 thc one of the lower testing strains that we've tried in a while i'm telling y'all there ain't nothing in that number man obviously there's something but what i'm getting at this [ __ ] is smacking right now smacking it's always a unique situation when opening up a strain like we did last night with grape sugar cookies i say that because i had clearly consumed cannabis before you know opening that package and doing the first sniff and taking that first hit with you guys however the effects the effects they played out like night and day i you ever like get lost in a high i say get lost in a high as in you consume it and you're so affected by it you almost forget you took it where i'm over here just digging into my chest my chest always has like a tension and pain from it and i'm just literally with my fist digging into my chest and before i knew it i literally was just like whoa kush [Music] before i knew it i was like yo you took that hit like 15 minutes ago you're high as hell so i'm happy to report no bunk no bunk here no mids effects terps on point i'm very excited for really a whole day of smoking this grape sugar cookies even from here got a solid foot between the buds and my nose that licorice my guy that red vines i don't know dog i don't know dog if it was a beauty contest it'd be hard it would be hard to pass this one up what's the point of this clip uh the point of this clip is to tell you i had a very successful wake and bake with the grape sugar cookies tried that for the first time today uh what would a successful awaken bake be uh if it helps me instead of distracts me from accomplishing my goals i was like to work today uh for reasons outside of my control there was so much construction going on around here and a construction crew blocked my car in in our tenant lot they weren't exactly nice about me having to like contact the building manager for him to contact them to tell them to come outside to move it they didn't even bother they didn't even bother asking me do you want us to move the truck they just moved their doors and had me like just back on out what are you doing needless to say the scenario was one that it enraged me because i've been dealing with this for months if it was just a one-time thing i have no problem with something like this but i just want to point it out it's literally been like an everyday thing it's i'm not gonna even get into how much it [ __ ] annoys me um through that um up and down little bit of disrespect from the contractors um i never broke my cool grape sugar cookies kept me locked in locked in on just the prize man getting the day's objectives done not freaking out on folks for no reason besides my own emotional turmoil but [ __ ] man i was real happy about that so grape sugar cookies already was a winner on looks terps effects medicinal value as well worked out for me overall if you could find uh you know a better deal through palm springs it was better oh my god what's that a dog hair in the weed what is this what the [ __ ] is this it can't be a dog here john wine airport what city is john wayne airport in oh okay okay is that just nellie's hot in here that ryan was just saying good gracious has foundations yeah yeah that is hot in here i okay describe myself as the biggest nelly fan but he blew up when i was like in the sixth seventh grade so like man his og hits they're [ __ ] awesome an actual wake-and-bake of that grape sugar cookies upon breaking down this flower that same licorice terp right man [Music] [ __ ] [ __ ] oh those same chills whoa whoa eyes are tearing like crazy undeniably that licorice flavor still there getting my ass kicked can't even lie oh [ __ ] yes sir yes sir let's get it [Music] yes i know i've uh oh okay you don't gotta pull me like that i know i've described the immediate effects of the grape sugar cookies but i haven't really gotten into uh the main show it's like relaxing to a point i don't want to fall asleep but it's like oh my god i got all these kids behind them it's not that it makes me want to fall asleep or anything like that it's just that it can almost like have me forgetting where i'm at you know what i'm saying like normally i don't be filming in public with like people walking behind me me just like talking to my phone you know what i'm [ __ ] saying my eyes [ __ ] and i really don't care um that those people saw me filming um so i guess you would say more in the cleaning if we had to choose between the two that's that's what i would say so what do you just eat these plants let's go ah [ __ ] with that being said it's time it's time to send off that grave sugar cookies man and i've got something really cool to say to send it off i just found out yesterday that illinois high times cannabis cup results came in and guests who i saw take a medal home grape sugar cookies by bedford grown man place second place in a hybrid flower so number one props to bedford man they've been an all star on the channel seriously not a stanker in the bunch um so that was really cool to see while doing the review to see that it's actually an award-winning strain man coolest book that being said i'd like to try an award winning stream for like the fifth time tonight if you could tell already all right so [Music] hmm", "GoES2SmhvNI": "hey everybody welcome to Lexus world Merry Christmas to everybody you'll notice I changed up the background a little bit in light of the season because we've been on the old background too much lately but today I wanted to do a quick how-to pro tip about diluting your pollen in order to make a whole lot more of it this one's kind of for you breeders out there for you commercial cannabis growers as well as just for you folks who enjoy making your own seeds rather than buying them a lot of the same people greatly enjoyed my pollination how-to guide and my making feminized seeds guide a link to both of those down in the video description but those episodes were kind of dry I didn't initially think a lot of people would be interested in them so I cut a lot out of them including this tip on how to make a ton of cannabis pollen because I really didn't think too many people needed to know that but then I also didn't think too many people were gonna watch those episodes and they did so shows you what I know in any case the solution to diluting pollen is flower see pollen is ridiculously potent just insanely potent so you can actually cut it with something and as long as you keep it very dry and very clean while you're doing the cutting you can actually create a lot more pollen and it'll still work terrifically how much more well how about 10 to 12 times more that should last you a while and obviously there's more than one substance that you can do this with flower is just the most easily available and the cheapest so what you do is you take a little bit of flower and then you heat it in the oven for 20 minutes at 180 degrees Fahrenheit or alternatively heat it in a pot on low heat for 20 minutes that creates what's called heat treated flower which is very useful for diluting things in while keeping them very clean keeping bacteria out and so forth once you're done heating it make sure that it cools down all the way and once it's fully cool then you mix in pollen at a rate of a quarter teaspoon of pollen to two and a half to 3 teaspoons of flour that seems like a really crazy ratio but pollen is just so potent that they'll actually work just fine and boom you've just increased the amount of pollen you have 10 to 12 fold while keeping it potent enough to work terrifically now remember you still have to store diluted pollen with the same careful procedures that you use on the regular Paul and as you've learned in my pollination episode make sure you keep it refrigerated and so forth and the end result of this will still be mostly a white looking powder so don't mix it up with anything else if you get what I mean I also wanted to point out that cutting pollen in this way and increasing the amount you have isn't my idea credit goes to a fellow named Uncle Ben who was a really really big user in the role adapt forms for many years he helped a lot of people he put a lot of good information out there I didn't agree with him on every single thing but I really admired the guy for the efforts that he put in so Uncle Ben if you're still out there again credit goes to you for this method and I hope you're having a good Christmas and that's my how-to tip for the day hope you guys enjoyed it my regular viewers may have noticed I've been leaning a lot more into my off topic channel lately and you can probably expect that to continue a link down to the off topic in the description as well and the reason being is that the episodes for my off topic are a lot more organic than the episodes for this channel plus let's face it over 250 episodes in I think we finally covered the really urgent cannabis how to's so there's just not as much content to be made here anymore still they're certainly gonna be more new content for this channel coming up we've still got to get rolling on the winter Gro Journal pretty quick here so subscribe for that hit that like button if this was useful and we'll see you all next time", "fDVtEoT_N30": "how YouTube recreational brower in my grow room here the plants are gone cut them down day 61 off this frog and day 66 on the other plant I'm really excited one of them we just finished trimming up it's just about dry the other one the one that was just a load like just lollipop - we did not do any training - I just cut that one down and hung it upside down and cut all the families off of it but I have not done the final trim yet and I'm just letting it hang on the stock the other one I trimmed out green probably not gonna be the the eight ounces per plant yield from the blue Magoo but still so pretty happy with it I wanted to kind of go over my my filtration and the way that I have this setup here and a little bit on the room I'm gonna move the lights around a little bit but we're still gonna keep the setup the same I'm going on a standalone building this is and the 12 by 8 tUFF SHED with about a 13 foot 12 foot pitch in the middle and the way I have my filtration setup if I have my my filter at the beginning here and then that goes into the fans so the air is getting sucked into the filter and being charged into the line causing positive pressure on the lines as they go through the hooded vents I'm still running on fresh air from outside so that's the reason why I have the hooded that's still put in place and I haven't taken those off once I go to close system and I start running tier two and we'll remove those those classes but right now I've got the charge pressure running through the Lyons food each light and then up and out and exiting the top of the building of care and by having the fan at the beginning of the line I have positively charged my system with filtered air so any week that I have in there it's gonna go back into the room instead of going outside and then back into that filter to be filtered again before it exits the building so that way I make sure that all of my smell and all of my odor exiting the building has been filtered at least once and any leaks that I have are leaks to the inside of the building which are then contained so and the way that I'm playing live fresh air in is I just have up here a line coming from the top of the building on the other side and by having the fan sitting pressure through the charts lines and out the building I have caused the negative pressure inside here compared to the outside which causes an automatic drop coming in from my pressure in eventually and by eventually it'll be really really soon I'm going to be attaching that fresh air in line to the top of my budget which will be the first recipient of the fresh outside air that just comes through a regular cotton filter and then dumps that into my bedroom so at that point the budge which will not be consuming as much of the pressure will utilize what it what it uses and then I'm going to have exhaust ports coming out the bottom of this bench closet which will come back into the flour room and create that cycle again so I thought I take the second kind of show you guys how I have this set up also let you see the ladies Obama coach on the right and Venice Beach on the Left gonna be putting these under a new frog setup going to be double double layering the trellis and doing a lot more I mean it's gonna look like I'm gonna butcher these thanks but I'm really trimming back and what I'm going for in this round is basically just just the coolest just the tips of each of the nodes and defeating that apical growth pattern hopefully it's gonna happen this is this is frog number three number six and number seven five and six anyways it's coming up YouTube either the Obama coach or the Venice Beach num is going in and that's the one that I'm gonna be focusing on bunch here will tell which one's gonna be the winner so anyways comment like subscribe I will be back with a trim report on the Corolla Queen number for that just finished up here in a couple weeks so thanks a lot YouTube", "vLswsSfq9uk": "hi guys in today's video i want to show you how to make these realistic blueberry muffin cookies using a couple fun and simple techniques so you can make them at home too [Music] in order to get the realistic texture of the muffin liner on the muffin cookie i'm actually using a muffin liner to create that texture so i'm just cutting it in half and removing the bottom so it's just a strip of that pleated parchment paper then i outline and flood the bottom portion of the muffin with some brown flood consistency icing while the icing is still wet i'm going to press that parchment paper into the icing once it's dry i'm going to peel off that parchment paper really carefully you're going to want this icing to dry at least overnight it'll take a little bit longer with that parchment paper on top then i'm going to pipe in the top portion of the muffin using a stiff to piping consistency icing i want it to have a lot of dimension and so that's why i'm piping just kind of a rough blob on top and i'm using a damp brush to just smooth out the surface a little bit to make it look a little bit more uniform and flat but i still want a lot of dimension in this cookie so you can see that the bottom portion of the top of the muffin is standing a little bit higher than the back portion or the top portion of that muffin and if you think your muffin needs even more dimension and more bumps then you can keep adding more until you're happy with it but still work a little bit fast because this icing will dry quickly next i'm going to pipe in some dark blue blobs where the blueberries were in the muffin and you know if you've eaten a blueberry muffin that those blueberries kind of pop and expand once they've been baked and they look like they've kind of melted out of the cookie and once both portions of the muffin are dry i'm going to go in and start adding some painted details first i'm going to add some shadow to the crevices of that muffin liner using a dark brown or black gel food coloring diluted with a little bit of water or clear alcohol and then i'm going to go over the ridges the top points of that muffin liner and pipe on some white gel food coloring or a white gel paint really you want to make the the top points the high points look even taller by adding some highlight in the deep points look even deeper by adding some shadow once you're happy with it go in and add some spots where the blueberries are kind of poking out of the bottom of that muffin and showing through the muffin liner now it's time to paint the muffin top i'm going in with the same gel food coloring i used to actually color the icing so a light brown i'm just adding a little bit more color onto the top of the muffin and just stippling it around to create a little bit of texture but i want to add even more texture to the top of this cookie so i'm going to stipple on some light brown piping consistency icing over the top of that cookie with a round fluffy brush and this just creates the illusion of a more rough and textured surface of the muffin then i'm going to go back and add a little bit more paint on top i'm going to concentrate the darker paint on the bottom of that muffin top where it meets the muffin liner the muffin typically gets a little bit more color there where it's hitting the actual muffin tin and then i'm just going to blend it out to the top of the muffin then to bring a little bit of life back to those blueberries and make them look like they're actually just like melting out of the muffin i'm gonna paint over them with some dark blue gel food coloring just to give them a little bit more depth and dimension i even like to add some color around those blobs of blueberries to make it look like there's juice kind of flowing out of the blueberry the last step for these muffin cookies is to dust some white food coloring powder over the bottom of the muffin where that muffin liner is to make it look a little bit more like a paper surface the next cookie i want to show you how to make is this muffin tin with fresh blueberry muffins inside so the first step is to outline and flood the entire muffin tin i'm actually leaving circles where i want my muffins to be you don't have to do that you can just flood the entire thing but it just helps to have a planned out kind of map of where you want those muffins and how you want them to be spaced so i'm just outlining and flooding with a light gray flood consistency icing you'll want the icing to dry for at least four to eight hours and once it's dry you can add some texture on top by brushing on a little bit of that same gray icing and once that icing is dry which should only take a couple minutes you can add on some painted details to the muffin tin by making it look a little bit more weathered i'm adding some shadows to the inside of those holes of the muffin tin just to make them look a little bit deeper and then again some shadows around the outside i'm also going to paint on some silver edible food dust to make it look a little bit more metallic and make it look like an actual like aluminum muffin tin and the last step to sort of weathering this old muffin tin is to add some brown painted details around the actual cups of the muffin tin this would be where like grease has burnt or there have been spills over time you know how old muffin tins kind of get that weathered look so that's what i'm trying to recreate with this brown color now it's time to fill the muffin tin so first i pipe in some stiff consistency ivory icing and then top that with that stiff consistency light brown icing and then i just kind of swirl them together it's not necessary to use the two different colors i just like the idea of having a lighter inside of the muffin even though you probably won't see it now it's time to add in some blueberries so i'm going to use both dark and a lighter blue icing to create the blueberry blob so this is going to look like there's a big blob of blueberry juice that's kind of spilled out topped with an actual blueberry that's still intact and that's what the lighter blue is for my biggest advice when piping blueberries on top of these muffins is don't make them identical or symmetrical or even or anything because it's just going to look like blueberries are kind of scattered on top of these muffins and the last step for this muffin tin cookie is to add some painted detail so i've already brushed on some of that brown icing to create the texture and then i'm going to go in and paint on some brown color again focusing more of that color around the base of the cookie where it's meeting the muffin tin and then blending it all on top to create a nice golden crust on those muffins and you don't want to forget about those blueberries make sure to add a little bit more blue coloring to those blueberries to really make them pop and that's all there is to making these realistic-looking muffin cookies i hope you enjoyed this tutorial and i can't wait to see your very own muffin cookies be sure to tag me on instagram at lindsay.rule and if you want to see more tutorials like this subscribe below", "sfA64i6PruI": "[Music] what's up everyone welcome to another cannabis critique today we are talking about brownie scout uh this one is from gti off their rhythm line off the relax line it comes in at 28 thc and this is like a proprietary strain for them so they try to act like it's super super special it's a cross of platinum girl scout cookies with a mystery strain as they say on their website but according to some other websites they say that it's a cross of platinum girl scout cookies and kosher kush so you can uh take that information and do with it what you will let's get in to the breakdown on this one the look is uh kind of fox taily the buds were very small and very very frosty they were visually sort of impressive looking but they had like that very fox tail like that triangular shape uh they were very very hard as well they didn't seem to be overly dry just very very hard so i don't know if that was like a specific thing of this strain a specific property of the strain or what the deal was with that but these were almost like like rocks they had like barely any stem to them at all but like small fox tailey buds i gave the look a 9.3 out of 10 they were very very frosty nice green color to them the smell on this one was a complete let down had basically absolutely no odor to it whatsoever i smelled it my wife smelled it and she agreed that it basically had no odor i i could barely detect anything you maybe get like some earthy notes and the odor doesn't really increase when you break it up it's basically like an odorless strain i don't know i don't know what the deal is with that but there's no odor so i gave the smell a 7.8 out of 10. now the high on this one is where the flower shines it's kind of a creeper it doesn't hit you right away uh but when it does hit you it's very very heavy it's kind of like a body high a relaxing sleepy type of high you get like a nice warmth after you smoke it but the the high is kind of short in duration in my opinion but it does hit you real real hard like probably i'd say five or ten minutes after you initially smoke it i gave the high a 9.4 out of 10. i really really enjoyed it just wish it lasted just a little bit longer now the taste on this one was again kind of a letdown kind of mimics the smell almost has basically no taste very little taste just like kind of a sweet earthy uh little little flavor to it if you really really try to get it but it doesn't have like a bad taste so i gave the taste an 8 out of 10. the breakup of this one was very fine the hard buds broke up and do it like almost a dust but not quite but it did have a lot of keep to it so i ended up giving the breakup at 8.5 out of 10. so overall i say this stuff is a potent bud i think it's ideal for medical use it's ideal for pain relief if you need help sleeping it'll help you relax ease you into your nighttime activities uh mostly sleep or just like sitting on the couch and maybe listening to a pink floyd record i think that one would be great for this i gave it a 8.6 out of 10 overall for the brownie scout kind of a infamous strain across of girl scout cookies which you're not allowed to say anymore they have to call it gsc so my my suggestion to the growers is they should name the next one girl scout attorneys that's all for this cannabis critique be sure to like comment and

increasingly disconnected from the canopy from the beds themselves and and that big crazy cumbersome trellis netting was really just felt like a physical barrier and man now that it's gone I feel like it feels way more open and that I don't know I feel like I've done the right thing and I think what I'm gonna do is pull plants out and stake them to open up and fill in these dead spots but I really feel like the plants are gonna be healthy enough to support their own weight I can supplement with steaks but man I'm telling you I really feel the room feels more open and less constricted and I can actually like get into the beds into the middle portions of the beds if I have to I could I could you know not put weight but just get a little leverage to get in so I'm really really really liking this now when I get into full bloom am I gonna be feeling the same way we will see that's why those are gonna stay right there if I don't like it the way it goes this cycle I'm gonna slap those puppies right back on but I'm telling you I love the feel of it in here I've been also been turning the lights on two at a time rotating them up for I mean amping him up from 600 to eight twenty five so now I've got the whole room all the eight kavita's are at 8:25 I'm about a week into flower and yeah I'm really really glad that I pulled those trellis netting off so I just wanted to kind of pop in and show you guys the what I did kind of on on a whim here and like I said it's I'm feeling like it's nothing but the right thing to do I really like the way the room feels and looks said it a million times already but by all means you guys leave me your comments and opinions and feedback some of the comments I'd like to know what you guys think and what your feelings are I know that I'm sacrificing some stability with the flowers but you know these these plants are really Hardy and realistically your plants should be able to support itself anyway let me know what you guys think right", "DXJg8IEfZPc": "alright hey everybody it's that time we've got to harvest underway here I wish this camera did did these buds justice but they just doesn't right now so anyway I've had a lot of questions about my harvest and drying caring process so I'm just gonna do a brief rundown on what I do so as you see I've got a row here that I've harvested and I'll I'm literally taking just bucking the leaves like I'll take a branch and then just you could see them hanging there big branches and just buck all the shade leaves and put them right back down into the soil I don't give a [ __ ] about the trichrome material that's on there these little buglets that are down here I'll just pop them off and put them right back in the soil yeah I know that's a bowl I don't care it's going back to the soil it's not a loss it's just not a loss it's being recycled I'm happy with that and you know I think a lot of people get really uptight about their material they want to try to save every [ __ ] trichrome and it just it's just not necessary I've got plenty of material here I'm gonna have plenty of by-product you know a couple ounces of larf ain't [ __ ] and I'd rather it just go it's more worth more to me to go back into the soil and not have to [ __ ] with it so anyway so that's what's going on with this is what the this all of this leaf material the the Roly Polys or the wood louse are gonna consume this and it's going to be it's gonna be gonzo in no time so as you can see some of that you know we've got some pretty decent track row material there and in like I said I just really don't care so it's gonna go back to the soil the soil life will consume it and yeah so that's that so as you can see you know our chicken supports out and all you know the plants are just flopping like crazy but we've got really nice really nice dense buds and you know next time around I think I'm just gonna I'm gonna have both my wife's and my cards in here so we'll be able to do 30 plants and I'm gonna be a lot happier with the canopy density with that so anyway I'm gonna take you in to kind of show you what the dry and cure what I do in my dry and cure space so so anyway this is this is my drying care space and so basically what I try to do in here is I try to keep it 65 degrees and 65% humidity that's going to ensure a nice slow dry and cure and we won't trap any chlorophyll in the material and so I basically just use these move everything in here and I've got string hung up and so I'll turn the light off everything's in the dark like I said I'll bring the dehumidifier in here to make sure it stays at 65% and then I've got a portable AC that comes in here that that keeps it nice and chilled in here so yeah this is the and honestly this is going to become my bedroom so I need to actually build a dry and cure space because this this next cycle I'm converting it to a bedroom proper so I can actually pop some of the beans that I've been getting and everything so take you back out here so yeah I mean that's basically the long and short of it I think that drying and curing shouldn't be a mystery you know you really it's it's gonna be the thing that separates you from the amateur from the first-timer you know is that getting your dry and cure game down like that turd preservation game down because anybody could flash dry this [ __ ] and you know and sometimes sometimes you can get away with flash dry and if your material is just excellent I've had to do it in the past and sometimes you get lucky but for the most part you really don't want to if there's one part of the process you don't want to cut corners on it's the drag here and that's kind of I'm out with that but as you can see everything is turned a really nice dark purple we've got the kind of the beginning of a fox tail happening which is the indicator that the plants have hit their maturity and their peak maturity and not to mention the milky trichrome is just visible with the naked eye so you know what I'll do is I'll do a follow-up video when I got the whole bed down and I've got everything drying in the other room that way you can see the volume that we're dealing with but I'll move those you know ten hangers or so into the other room that little room gets filled up pretty quick so over there I've got a lavender cush plant I got from seven seven finger rocks really nice looking baby I'm really excited to have that as a mother I got some of the bud that he grew in his living soil and it was just [ __ ] stellar I mean it tasted like tasted like lavender gonna be [ __ ] incredible so you know imagine that it's called lavender cush so you know that's the long and short of what's going on here this is the mystery it's a skunky girl I'm anxious to try try her out but anyhow I hope this gives you guys a little something to chew on be good", "QpXKpLBG_VA": "alright hey everybody it's been a bit since I've done a done a video I wanted to show you what was going on in here we're about ten days from the harvest window and we've got a nice good proper fade going on this is the random the random one we didn't know what it was but it's starting to frost up nice I'm not quite sure how long that puppy's gonna go but the others the the Blue Magoo are really they're clearly gonna finish early we've got really nice like just even on the fan li's those track those trikes there at the conversion it's just really really looking good so it's it came you know it was a topic of discussion the other day with SoCal and about how flushing works in no-till or living soil systems and we we kind of discussed how it's you can still get a fade just because all the nutrient nutrients are available in the soil doesn't mean that the plant is up taking it the plant is in its last its last moment so it knows what it needs it knows what it needs to do it's not going to just continue taking nitrogen when it knows it's a hero five weeks into flower or whatever so that's the benefit of going with the living soil because you're allowing those natural processes to take place with the plant and letting the plant dictate what it wants to uptake or what it wants to leave behind and that's how you end up getting plants like this with plenty of food source available for them in my soil they're just not up taking it because that's not that's not the point they're in in their lifecycle so trusting the natural process trusting the plant and that it's it's going to use the processes that's been developed over time to give you the truest expression of the plant I wanted to give a special shout-out and thanks to sub cool dung beetle Malik spider and the guys from the weed nerd show for having me on I'm gonna be on again this Saturday and I'm really looking forward to you know helping people make the small changes that they need to to start growing cannabis in a easier in an easier way that's going to bring out the truest expression of their plants and I I'm excited I think we're making some headway with folks and just the fact that I've been asked on again this Saturday feels really good and I'm hoping we can get people really hot on the note to well come on there we go so you see that that's not spider mite webbing that's actual spider webbing so don't trip folks there's a little more there you got a few little guys in here that patrol the canopy it's hoping it would focus on that you get an idea we got really heavy track production in this particular blue mcgoofy now I really wish you guys could smell it but um you hear so you're getting an idea I probably won't do another video until after the live stream with of this Saturday so give you an aerial view you can really see the fade taking place a lot of Purple's coming in from that blueberry part of the blue Magoo I've never grown Williams wonder which is the other half of the pheno here or the other half of the strain is blue Magoo times Williams wonder and so yeah so what we got going I'll take you down show you some soil life and then we'll get on with our lives pretty much anywhere you dig in a living soil in a living soil system you should be able to pull up worms I mean that's just just what should be happening like everywhere everywhere you stick your hand if you grab a handful of dirt you should have a warm or two in there and that's really kind of what we're shooting for when you pull these there's always something moving in a handful of good soil so that's definitely what you want to shoot for that's what's gonna allow it's what's gonna compost all that all that good material it's in script boy soil you should find worms when you look close you can see before that this is just this top layer is all castings natural castings where it was previously Malibu compost I'm hoping it'll focus there there you go so you can see there's an abundance of little soil mites and wood louse all kinds of stuff happening in there in combination with the the worms those all break everything down all right left anyhow after that like I said we're about ten days from the harvest window I'm really excited to test the flavors of this blue Magoo the smell is so sweet and great I'm just I'm thinking it's gonna be great for the great for the rosin but the flowers alert are just looking stellar super frosty and dense very very dense my camera won't focus for [ __ ] today sorry guys all right that's probably enough all right guys be good", "koRz78s_C6U": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel today i'm going to be sharing my favorite basketball design this original design is from jill at the funky cookie studio and i'll link her instagram page below start by flooding with a light shade of orange the darker shade of orange will come from airbrushing so make sure this color is light enough to show contrast [Music] [Music] for the texture on the basketball we'll be using nylon netting that's held in place with an embroidery [Music] hoop [Music] make sure the fabric is close against the cookie and lightly airbrush with orange [Music] i used my projector to draw the lines and then traced over that with black piping consistency icing use a scribe tool or a toothpick to smooth out the ends [Music] and that's all there is to it i hope you enjoyed this tutorial and give this design a try the next time you make basketball cookies there are so many great basketball designs out there but this one is definitely my favorite thanks so much for watching and i'll see you next time [Music] you", "onXcTX_8shc": "how you do recreational grower in my garden this is blue Magoo on see here day 26 in the straw recreational marijuana measure 91 in Oregon I've got four points on property each one has faced 30 days older than the other this is the oldest of them in the Skog here for just an update a couple of things actually first off a correction the last we last video that I put out so when it told me that I was interpreting the law incorrectly in Oregon and that I am allowed up to eight ounces per person and and their home and then one else while they're outside of their home and that was explained that since I have two people here on the property that I would be able to have up to a pound and they smoking something it wasn't marijuana because you're only allowed eight ounces on the property at any given time of usable product which is dried flower no matter how many people are on the property so I'm only allowed eight ounces I've never grown ass frog before I've never I've never grown blue- before but is she kind of paying out here this is a 42 x 36 inches prague under a thousand-watt high pressure sodium and my first time I've ever really been on a nutrient schedule and she's doing really good a couple of issues to come up you know this is my fifth plan of ever grown youtube and you know what I'm I'm learning as I grow I'm learning everything from you guys and there's so much information out there and you guys have been so helpful and that's why I am she's looking as good as she is now is is because of how much you guys know and on that note I have to really say thank you because um like I just said I don't know what I'm doing this is the fifth plan of ever ground and in my video a couple videos ago and I was in my bedroom and one of you guys noticed that I had what looked like the beginning of a spider mite problem and I didn't know what to look for and as soon as I woke up and I saw that comment I raced out to my bedroom which is actually just my garage and probably how I got the spider mites it wasn't a cantata clean environment and I need to fix that and I'm going to address that we're going to get the bed moved into this room here on the shower the flower room is going to going to be split down the center but because of you guys and you guys taking note in and really paying attention and I was able to get right on that and I started spraying with the stuff i was told to spray with and i can't remember what that is but i've been diligent I haven't seen me spreading of that but i did also notice that when i came in here I had a little bit about starting in my flower revolt which is discouraging but I'm really you know and I'm so proud of everything that I've accomplished here and the last crop you know I got in full flower I wasn't able to fetch that I got them already in flower by a couple of days on january first i'm sorry/not january first july first when when recreational marijuana was legal here in oregon and i didn't get to I didn't get to do anything other than just turned on the lights let it grow um but this year is my first plant that I've been fully responsible for and I did all of the trimming I'm sorry all the training she is not men high stress range this is all low stress training and everybody you know I got her in a one gallon pot I've been training her since and I'm really really proud of it and and all of that has come from you guys if you know I have to throw this thing away become spider mites and they do come back or something I'm still really really happy with what I've learned here it's a great canopy development run again 42 x 36 inch I don't know how much is going to yield I hope it yields the legal limit announces youtube I really do but just to be safe them as I'm taking it down and probably to send a bit of it away to to friends as it's wet and let them let them finish drying it let them carry let them smoke it with them enjoy line no so that's if it finishes out if it doesn't then again I'm not too bummed the spider mites really you can see some of the damage here on the tip to leave this was almost a week ago when this was noticed and I haven't seen it spread and the way that I was pulled to look if you don't know I got spider mites are like the devil like tonight and they're like really hard to get to get rid of if you do have them but underneath your flower they like to hang out there during the sunlight days or periods because they don't like the sunlight but they eat the chlorophyll in your plant which causes enough stress and reduces the amount of chlorophyll that they that they ingest enough to make a noticeable difference game plan and I'm having that you're possibly smoking bud carcass which you know nobody likes that targets in their bowl so you know I've been spraying imma spring spring spring spring and I'm following the directions and they aren't coming back so fingers crossed we've got this in the bud but if not again you know I'm copy of what I've learned this isn't this isn't my my rent a paycheck this is just purely for fun recreational marijuana in Oregon Metro 91 it's it's pretty rad what what the voters are able to pass here and I'm trying to figure out my my formula as I learned to grow and I'm learning from you guys you know I've got this month's Prague here in like four days we're bringing in the other blue Magoo which will go underneath the other sprog the other thousand want high pressure sodium and as i said earlier before i'm going to be my veg in here so i'm going to build a little bit of a wall and i'm going to bring the tea or the two fives in here and veg out in here i've got the got the climate control and you know I've got the heater at the air conditioner and my client has really been pretty studying parama being see this but it's pretty dark there so forty seven percent humidity right now 75 degrees well hi it's 79 or I'm sorry then the lowest of 68 so go to probably a little bit low in the evenings but really a lot of that is under suggestion of you guys to to one of the ways to stop those spider mites from being able to breathe they don't like colder weather so trying to connect them in the butt trying to do everything you got the same thank you so much for commenting this is the difference between you know make it or break it right now how'd I maybe let those go even further if I didn't notice it if one of you guys hadn't spoken up I'm who knows write me now so thank you so much YouTube please comment subscribe like all that stuff and thank you", "zQapSMrcWJM": "hey yo

demonstrate the two most basic techniques of using royal icing on cookies piping and flooding so since it's Valentine's Day I baked some heart cookies and we're going to flood them Pink's and white so let's get started this is what you'll need I prepared two types of icing today a thicker piping icing that I put in an icing bag with a number 2 tip and a thinner flooding icing that I put in a squeeze bottle I also have my scribe tool which I use when I'm flooding and I like to keep a paper towel with me in case I need to clean my tips and tools here we go to get a nice even consistent outline I like to touch the icing to a tip of a cookie and the stickiness of the icing anchors it to the cookie then I gently apply hand pressure to the icing bag and while I'm squeezing I guide the icing in place around the edge of the cookie you might notice that as I get to the top of the heart a transition point I drop another anchor down onto the cookie then I anchor it and I go back around the second curve of the heart never dragging my tip onto the cookie this results in a nice high outline and a nice even outline that will create a clean edge when i flood the cookie I'm going to outline a few more so I have my heart cookies outlined and I'm ready to fund them in realizing is nice because it flows in evenly and then dry smooth for a royal icing recipe you can find it on flower box bakery calm and I'll explain the differences between the consistencies so to flood I have my squeeze bottle and my scribe tool and what I'm going to show you is my technique that I call the bump and wiggle when I start flooding I like to bump the icing along the edge of the outline just like this I like to go around the edge to give a nice even smooth outline to the cookie then I fill the cookie in with the icing as you can see the icing is a little bit on the sixth side definitely not watering if it's watery it'll spill over the outline then I take my scribe tool and I gently wiggle the icing into place tapping it ever so carefully over the outline this helps the outline to disappear and give the cookie a nice smooth look if any air bubbles pop up my scribe tool is nice and sharp like right there and I can just stop it and it's gone and now I'm ready to fill in the hearts on the tray as you can see on this heart I didn't get all the way to the edge so I can just wiggle the icing into place to create even lines tapping it in two corners and along the edge to help that outline disappear you might notice that the hearts are moving position that's because I feel most comfortable decorating on a workspace right in front of me I do like to decorate directly on the tray but I move the cookies and turn the tray to get the best results so there you have it it's not easy but it definitely gets easier with practice for more tutorials supplies and recipes check out flower box bakery calm happy decorating", "jRR5AlG6n_0": "what's up guys what LG here hope you all are having a great day and today I've got a strain review of some sugar cookies oh gee I received in my most recent pick up from low price bud so I'm gonna be looking at the strain smelling it see how the crystals look and I'll be tasting it as well so let's get into it right away so this came in my most recent order from low-priced Bud my fifth unboxing on my channel here so in that order there was death Bubba dosey doe g13 gasps and this trigger cookies right here so amazing orange hairs on this one an abundance of them actually more than I've ever seen inside is looking very nice - nice trichomes they're just busted open in that time here absolutely amazing liking let's take out that stand right there [Music] these orange hairs just looks so nice I can't remember the last time I saw a bud with this many orange hairs we're gonna give it a smell test here [Music] very subtle smell to it but whatever you do smell is very sweet and very piney a lot like most of the buds off of low-priced Bud that I've been getting at least have either a sweet kind of smell to it a piney smell or a gassy smell or anything in between honestly but nonetheless they all smell super great it was only when I was getting quad-a products / gas leak products that it started to smell a bit different than usual so probably the weights of grown and whatnot so here's another look at the nug all right so I'm gonna grind up a couple pieces of this here I'm going up these three pieces here and you'll see what it looks like grind it up and then we're gonna try some so then getting used to this grinder I don't know if I've mentioned it but this is the biggest grinder I've owned and so I'm so used to having small vendors just grinding my stuff up quick but this one takes a bit longer but it doesn't matter all does the same thing so this is what it looks like ground up very nice you can still see a lot of the orange hairs let me try to zoom in here lots of trichomes bit of purple actually in there as well but yeah you can see a lot of orange hairs in here so I'm gonna pack a bowl now and we're gonna try it out so I got this new bowl here from bong outlet dot CA it was nine dollars with shipping came up to 19 it has a built-in screen and honestly I just wanted something small nothing too fancy and it works perfectly in my opinion so I'm just gonna pack this bowl here very nice and we're gonna test it out now all right so we've got the bowl packed here I'm gonna let you know how the taste test is and how the high is cheers all right so a lot like the smell off of this bud very very sweet flavor coming off of it almost like a candy but I can't quite put my finger on which one it reminds me of exactly but definitely very sweet and very enjoyable to smoke as far as the flavor and as far as the high if I'm not mistaken this but is indica dominant like most if not all the strains on low price bud and you can definitely feel that nice relaxing and stony high coming off of these mugs here off of this string I would definitely recommend you check this one out along with the other strains on the website there's a bunch of things to look at and I'm almost sure you'll find something you'll like or you've never tried before so let me know what you guys think of these buds here let me know what you think of the video and what else you'd like to see have a great day thanks for watching [Music]", "Q1TbKHD0_Vg": "alright hey everybody how's it going mmm I'm back off of a week vacation a week six days vacation to go down to Southern Oregon and check out the living soil symposium and as you know my rooms automated so I had no [ __ ] worries come home to beautiful lushness I actually flipped them into flour before I left so there's six days in now looking great this the little funky spazzy one starting to spat take a snap out of it so I'm happy to see it's the you know I didn't yank it and I'm glad like it's going to produce something so everything else is just looking just outstanding I wanted to say I met a whole lot I was really really surprised with how many of you folks came up to me and you know it was probably two dozen you know at least 20 20 or 30 folks came up to me and really expressed their appreciation for the note field talks and for the YouTube videos and I was really humbled by that experience I you know I figured I was reaching folks but men it really means a lot and I met so many people and so many you came up and shook my hand and introduced yourself and I had some great talks but I have a terrible memory for names at times especially in situations like that I have a little social anxiety so you know I'm kind of a spaz spaz doubt in my head so if you were somebody that came up and introduced yourself dude by all means please hit me up with a DM and remind me who you were and where where we talked that way I can I make sure I'm putting a face to the YouTube handle and then I can get the get proper shout outs to you guys because I really you know I don't you know next time I see you I'd like to remember what we talked about and all that so I hope I'm not blabbering too much and I hope it makes sense so if you chatted with me at the living soul symposium dude hit me a DM and remind me who you were and you know that way I can reinforce all you guys in my mind because I really really really appreciate and if I said enough really there but I really do really appreciate the fact that you guys came up and express your appreciation it really means a lot I'm kind of jumped out of my comfort zone to do this because I really care about the cannabis community at large and and I'd like to you know to see this open-source information exchange continue to happen and everybody grow incredible cannabis and heal themselves in the world yeah warm and fuzzy right so anyway one of the things that our take away that that I got from that and from GreenSource Gardens on Instagram it's the guy from Europe of UK I believe and he's pointed out that I've been conflating cover crop and companion plant so I wanted to just do a quick talk about that that a cover crop technically exists in between cycles or in or in the off season where you don't have the plants that you're cultivating in there and so you know a cover crop is void of whatever plant that you're going to be harvesting or that you're growing for harvesting purposes and at the moment you plant so so you have the build the soil cover crop lens it's a cover crop blend and when you when you plant it in your beds the moment you make room and put your cannabis plants in there it's no longer technically no longer cover crop and it's technically a companion plant so you know it seems like I'm splitting hairs it seems like there's some hair splitting going on but really I think it's important because cannabis cultivation isn't the only place that uses cover crop and companion plants and so unlike permaculture design and other kinds of farming it can be and if you're doing research you can find you could go down the wrong path if you start looking at cover crops like companion plants right are you thinking of them in the same terms because they do they do different things the same plant will do different things for your system based on what's happening in it so I hope that makes sense I'm going to have a new no-till talk this Wednesday I'm jamming to Seattle and back so I'm going to be a little tired it's going to be a quick one and but I want to just kind of touch on what I what I learned at the symposium and I'm going to touch on the the cover crop companion plant thing again and then just do some Q&A so yeah everybody that came to the living soil symposium and and came up to me and said hey man I really appreciate it I got a lot of love and respect for you guys for everybody you know and that's part of this movement so anywho I'm gonna let you get just wanted to touch base show you that the garden is doing great the companion plants are doing awesome see that I called them companion plants hahaha right so they're rockin all right y'all peace", "9GAr2qmBriQ": "[Music] [Music]", "H5uzStKAff0": "just in time for

i'm your host dave frank and i'm joined by north coast journal's news editor thad greenson and arts and features editor jennifer from mikko cahill welcome guys david how are you doing right on doing well a little sunshine out there today and got some good news friends family news about more vaccines in the pipeline so i think people are starting to look towards that fourth of july weekend as a potentially uh you know fulfilling and rewarding date on the calendar where we might actually have some degree of normalcy so hopefully that's permeating your guys lives as well fingers crossed yeah stay optimistic right as best we can do um so that let's dive right in what's going on on the cover this week of the north coast journal well this week is our annual cannabis issue so um it is about all things uh all all things cannabis news um recently um but occupying the actual cover space of the paper is a story um following up on some reporting we did a couple years ago about the roanoke park public safety department to the police department at roener park and um some cannabis interdiction activities they'd been doing that became raised a lot of questions from the article it looks like there's been a federal indictment handed down on one of the local police departments in the 101 corridor can you tell us a little bit about the background on that and kind of what brought us to this point yeah so two two officers have been indicted in the case so far um and their indictments were unsealed friday um and so that's a lot of the documentation was was the actual charging document that we built the story on but the story takes root back in um in december of 2017 when a man by the name of zeke flatton actually a movie producer was looking to dabble in the cannabis industry visited humboldt county bought three pounds of cannabis and was transporting it south to a lab in the bay area for testing when he claimed that he was pulled over by an unmarked suv and by two officers who were wearing kind of tactical gear but no badges no name no name tags no patches kind of affiliating them with a specific agency they identified themselves as being with the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms and um asked if he was carrying cannabis he said he was asked to search the vehicle found the three pounds and basically said we're taking these you can expect to receive a letter from washington dc and we're going to go now um and zeke flatten is is a former cop himself um and um and a really sharp guy i mean just from interviewing him he's one of these people who has a pretty meticulous memory and an eye for detail and he said that it just didn't feel right um something felt really off about the stop he noticed that the officers never ran he gave them his license but they never ran his name um back to dispatch to see if you know there was any warrants or anything out for him didn't seem to run the license plate of his car um and didn't give him a receipt for the seizure of his cannabis um and so he said pretty quickly he came to feel that he was robbed he also noticed that while they said they were from a federal federal agency the car that they were driving had california exempt license plates which didn't line up again he's a pretty sharp guy who picks up on these details and so um he pretty quickly came to feel that he'd been robbed by what he figured were actual law enforcement officers but out acting outside the scope of their duties so he made a complaint to the fbi um and to the mendocino county sheriff's office because the traffic stop happened in mendocino um and that's kind of what got this ball rolling that now um you know two pl two and almost two and a half years later has resulted in these indictments almost three and a half years later so one of the things that he said was that um it wasn't the actual loss of value um that really triggered this it was his thoughts about something bigger must have been going on if this is how he was getting treated that maybe other people were getting treated the same way so you said he reached out to federal um law enforcement but there were he also reached out to local media is that right and kind of what element did local media play in bringing the story you know the momentum that built around this original complaint yeah it played a huge role and certainly zeke zeke flattened feels like it was it was crucial that it was really the tipping point um but i guess to your first point yeah he said that he really felt like um it wasn't the loss of three thousand dollars worth of weed it was the the violation and as somebody who'd been a police officer previously i mean he kind of understood that oath of office and he also just started wondering like if these guys are so brazen that they are going to impersonate federal officers outside of their jurisdiction and stop me in broad daylight and steal my weed like what else are they doing and who else are they doing this type of thing too um so worry you know he said that he made the complaint to the fbi and felt like it was initially kind of taken seriously or whatever but he was worried that it would just kind of die quietly that it would make it from kind of the the the main fbi office to the field office and then just kind of be quietly go away and so he decided um i think about a month after making the complaint to contact kim kemp a reporter based in southern humboldt and um to her credit she she took it very seriously um and um and started you know vetting his story and making calls and one of the last calls that she made before kind of going public with his allegations um was a call to the to atf just saying hey did you have officers in the field this day in this area and were you involved in this traffic stop and um while some of the other agencies had kind of been um i'd say a little bit evasive or a little bit squirrely or not really you know didn't seem terribly interested in her inquiries um atf did and atf i think seems like really kind of its ears perked up but the the idea that somebody might be out there impersonating its officers and so not only did they they give a statement to kim but they also um immediately kind of reached out to zeke and asked if they could contact zlatan and i think he said that they were on the phone with him within an hour of kim contacting them um and then come to find out they then exerted some pressure it sounds like on the fbi and on local agencies to kind of saying hey this is something that needs to be taken um seriously and and zeke really believes that that you know kim's inquiry and her subsequent reporting really got this ball rolling um and after she reported i think one or two stories on um on zeke's allegations um the um the lead roner park officer um who's been indicted uh or former officer uh jc tatum who headed the the roanoke park interdiction team um took a really kind of interesting step of issuing a press release kind of in response to kim's coverage trying to explain away zeke's allegations um and um the fbi the f the indictment certainly says that this was a fraudulent press release in a fraudulent police report designed to kind of cover his tracks um that's the allegation anyway um but there were some things that just didn't match up about the press release and from just a journalist who's seen gobs and gobs of law enforcement press release releases it just was strange it didn't have an exact date it didn't have an exact time it didn't identify the kind of car zeke was driving it didn't name him you know didn't have his name in the press release didn't identify a quantity of marijuana seized it was just it was atypical and i think a lot of people noticed that and then it brought a new attention to this case so the uh the charges are cons for two officers tatum and huffaker are conspiracy to commit extortion under the color of official rights and then officer tatum former officer tatum also faces additional charges of falsifying records in a federal investigation in order to cover up alleged theft right so what and then also a charge of tax evasion as well oh right exactly yeah like uh al capone the tax man will always get you um so you know what kind of transpired in this investigation um that that you know what are some of the elements of the story that kind of sent out to you like that you said he was the head of a of a interdiction task force yeah and so yeah what what are some of the details that kind of stand out in terms of the 101 court or interdiction team so i think there's three things i'd want to hit on there the first it was actually not in in the indictment but was uncovered by kqed in an investigation it did after kim kemp's initial reporting in this um and they requested gobs and gobs of records from from roanoke park and and they found two things that were kind of interesting one is that roanoke park was kind of nationally awarded for its interdiction efforts at the time um for just the amount of the quantities of cannabis it was seizing and the amounts of cash it was seizing this was from a law enforcement perspective an enormously effective interdiction team um headed by tatum and then um they found that um basically when when a law enforcement agency seizes say 50 pounds of cannabis it's kind of impractical to expect them that they're just going to hold all that as evidence until the case goes to trial and so what they do in these large drug seizure cases is they hold on to a sample of it but then they destroy the rest and there's a really meticulous process they have to follow to do this of getting a court um destruction order and then they're supposed to you know um transfer the the drugs to a specific officer who's then um uh kind of ordered to destroy them in a very specific way and then document it with a destruction um with destruction documentation and so what kqed found is that for at least 800 pounds of cannabis over like a two-year period rohnert park was unable to actually show documentation that it was destroyed they had court orders telling um the department to destroy it and they had documentation that it had been handed off to jc tatum the sergeant in control of such things but there was no actual you know proof that it had been destroyed so that raised a lot of questions um then in the um in the indictment itself um federal agents um reviewed lots of body camera footage from the roanoke park police department and they were able to document numerous cases i think they identified five or six of them in the actual indictment itself but where officers seized cannabis or cash from drivers i think tatum was involved in all these traffic stops and did not provide them with any documentation did not provide for them with a seizure receipt and then also um for which the agents were unable to find any other documentation of this traffic stop so within roanoke park police records it was as if the stop had never happened it never existed there's no police report attached to it or anything like that um but they have this footage of them actually taking custody of cannabis from people um so that raised a lot of questions and then the last aspect is just the irs investigation um the irs did what seems like a pretty exhaustive investigation over several years of um officer sergeant tatum's um financial records and what they claim to have found is um hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash deposits um into his bank his and his wife's bank accounts and family members bank accounts um all of them in sums less than ten thousand dollars which and if you over if you deposit over ten thousand dollars in cash the bank is required to report that to the irs and so the they're alleging that this is very much a pattern of somebody trying to conceal illicit profits um and so all of these three things together i think really raised questions about the scope of what was happening in roanoke park um over this time period and um while the indictment is really related to two specific traffic stops in december um and um and then for um you know for sergeant tatum the um you know the tax evasion and the attempt to cover up as well i think the um other information indictment really kind of leads one to believe there might be other shoes to drop and there might be other actions coming gotcha well there's so much more in the article um hopefully people check it out thank you for sharing uh your insights on this with us um i know these officers are facing a lot of time and and it you know we'll see how it plays out and we'll see how you know i'm sure you guys will follow it down its uh path um yeah so what one other thing i wanted to ask you about um there today actually breaking news uh happy st patrick's day there's breaking news in the sacramento bee about the eureka police department a few officers communications can you tell us real briefly a little bit about that breaking story yeah real briefly um a reporter for the sacramento bee um obtained from from an unnamed source um screenshots of group text chats with six epd officers that include um just lots of very vile things uh misogynistic and um really dehumanizing language um directed at uh people that um that these officers were in charge of protecting and serving so it really raises a lot of pretty alarming questions absolutely something that we at the journal are following up on as we speak and we'll continue to do so and hopefully uh bring more of that to light well fantastic thank you yeah that's available online like like north coast journal sacramento b's also online check it out um how about you jennifer what's going on this week on the arts and features beat with you you know so for our cannabis issue um i you know i had wanted to include something about you know people infusing foods with cannabis for a while but i'm not sure if you're familiar with jessica ashley silva if you um she's written for us before she covered the guy fieri barbecue contest at the fair the sweaty meat fest i believe she called it and um i i saw that she had posted a while ago a fail and you know i love a food fail but this was an infusion fail and so i asked her to jump in and write about it and also i want to say that i feel partly responsible for this fail um i asked jessica to write about a cannabis pairing dinner which was a virtual event usually you know cannabis dinners you go and you get a whole infused multi-course meal that i don't know how you get home from but um you know when people do these really fancy-schmancy meals infused with cannabis but this was a virtual one given our times and so she cooked at home along with a chef who was you know using fancy oils and swirling things on dishes and it was you know very very fancy and it it gave her a sense of maybe hubris and so she and some friends dove into some cannabis cooking and everything was going great and then she had this very cheesy burger that was so great on this some sort of infused burger thing and then she was like why don't i just make some infused cheese and she made this attempt and to her credit she made a really beautifully formed three fresh mozzarella balls and um you know they look great if you look at it in black and white if you look at it in color and she wrote about the you know the the hubris the fall the tragic outcome of trying to infuse it because it came out sort of the color of silly putty sort of a brown gray unpleasant and um when she described trying it she was like you don't taste brown please don't taste brown please and it tasted so brown it tasted as she she describes it as tasting like dirt hay and dead plants yeah and then of course you know like a good you know growth raised in the right family she tried not to throw out food and she tried to apply it to a pizza with a lot of garlicky pesto and hope no no nothing nothing could cover the taste of of swamp from that mozzarella but um you know she talks about sort of the basics of of how you infuse food and um it was a learning experience for me to read about um but also i really like her attitude um uh if you're if you're in humble foodies you know her it was one of the admins and um she's very funny and even honestly i always enjoy when she you know blocks someone or kicks them off of the side it's always great fun but she talks about the value of food fails and most of the time on something like humble foodies we're sharing you know our successes look at this amazing rack of lamb i made look at this fantastic fettuccine i made and people don't really share like oh jesus what did i do to this poor piece of meat but here she is and she was saying that she learned something which is that okay mistakes were made and here's what she could do instead next time like maybe a flavorless uh instead of working directly from flour maybe she could use you know a flavorless extract would be better next time or you know maybe mozzarella is meant to just be a mozzarella right it has that cure maybe we infuse other things um but she you know she took it as a learning experience and she also was like well you know what i did figure out how to make some cheese so hopefully she'll be back to do that again but um yeah if you've if you've ever tried failed or tried to smile through someone else's failed infusion meal i strongly recommend it i mean the only thing that i forgot to ask her is if it's i mean i would imagine that the thc quality was still there but despite that i think um despite the effects of cannabis it didn't make her enjoy it anymore which is too bad that's yeah which you know i i get the boost of um the boost of enjoyment that people get from you know having cannabis infused foods i i totally get the draw if it's a tenth of what i experienced when i was pregnant then i don't know why everyone's not eating cannabis infused food all the time but other than having to drive um but yeah it's a fun read and you should definitely check it out and definitely not do what she did that is amazing yeah so it sounds like mozzarella should be left as mozzarella you don't need to infuse it it's kind of i mean isn't there already a high to cheese isn't cheese its own drug so it takes more and more yeah speaking of uh own drug um you did a satirical piece maybe not so satirical uh cannabis strains we need in 2021 and wish were real tell us a little bit about that because that is hysterical i'm gonna say it's only barely satirical because um so i've done this for a few years in a row and i have had a couple of people who were like so i don't understand where can you buy these yes actually there isn't one that makes you feel like a disney princess that's not real i made it up um what i what i like to do is go through and look at real strains and look at their descriptions and how they describe the crosses and whatnot and look at some of the really hilarious names that they have and i must say that one of the challenges is coming up with names that aren't already strains so you know when i was looking up like there's a there's a strain that um a fake string that is for people who are really upset about dr seuss you know if you're like really upset about it which relax relax what happened on mulberries or what was it i can't what i saw on mulberry street i have a copy it's not great it's no cat in the hat but people are so upset about not making more of them you know the ones that are out there are out there but people are so upset about and i thought well i should have a strain that helps people cope with that stress and i looked up and i could not believe there isn't already a strain called who hash [Music] but evidently an opportunity missed um and there are a few other ones that are some of them that are meant to help you through the stress of the pandemic like darth vaxxer which is sort you know sort of my little tribute to thaad who is a very big star wars fan as you can see from his background um and uh legion of zoom which is meant to help you feel more more like you're really in the room with people when you're even on screen um which i personally don't want [Laughter] but some people might you know it can be very draining having all your interactions remotely she says as she's having a skype conversation with someone that she used to sit in a studio with truth but it's fun to do so there's one um q-tips which i think was really funny about q and on and there's some other contemporary uh references but others are just more like um you know broadly uh appealing i suppose like tell us about sofa cushion uh sofa cushion is for when you just need to ride out the rest of the pandemic just keeping it mellow you know a lot of people have tried to be really productive during this and personally i feel that's a mistake it's been you know it's been so emotionally and mentally taxing for us to go through the ups and downs and the sort of national grief and personal grief and all those things and yet we have all these things telling us you need to hustle you need to be working on your side gig you need to be and some of that is survival financially but some of it is just the social pressure of always be productive always be doing something and so this particular strain allows you to just uh what do i have that it's it's um a couple of indica strains inertia and lazy boy to help you sink deeper and deeper into your couch until you become one with it which you know let me help you with that tap into your inner fauchy one kenobi yes somebody feel free if people want to make these strains um you know just send me a small fee and we'll be good yeah you got to trademark that stuff well right on there's a lot more in that article definitely folks check it out that's just about going to do it for us this week it flies by unfortunately uh north coast journal is available on newsstands now available online uh pick one up stay informed stay safe jennifer thank you both so much and we'll see you guys again next week see you next week [Applause] do [Applause] you", "yWda9pSruL0": "hey what's happening everybody just wanted to do a quick update things looking really good we're I can't remember the exact date count for less than two weeks in the flour and we're getting really nice stacking early on which is kind of indicative of a blue Magoo my understanding is that she can be as early as fifty days so I'm gonna you know and with the stacking so hard this fast I'm really I've got high hopes that she's gonna be a quick finisher and we're we're starting to get a really nice stretch going on in here so the ends that I took the trellis out I'm gonna start you can see stakes here occasionally I'm gonna come in here and start staking and pulling out and filling the dead space where I had to leave dead space because a plant count like here's a dead space right here that will be able to fill in with these you know I'll bring this one down and then it'll it'll grow up towards the light right so it's kind of like what we talked about I talked about maybe six months or so ago about when you can kind of do a low stress training how there's growth inhibiting hormones that you can deactivate by bending these at a you know ninety degree angle and then these will start to grow up right so that's that's what we're going to be shooting for when hitting these holes but you can really kind of see across the board we're getting a really nice stretch and now I'm because I didn't know the parent genetics these were clones that I bought from somebody that I didn't know yeah I know I know it's like [ __ ] without protection but I've been on the crazy lookout for a [ __ ] Hermes and I you know so far so good knock on wood and anyway so like I said I've got a few holes here to fill now that we've got the stretch happenin I'm gonna I'll be able to pull things in fill those holes with just a steak I'll just put a steak in there and bring three different branches to it and tie it but different locations on the on the stake that way I don't have a [ __ ] million eye pokers in here and so this bed is done really good at filling in the space there's not even a there wasn't even a plant in there so they've done a good job there's a little dead space over there that I'm gonna have to fill but other than that I couldn't be happier with the growth rate in here I'm gonna begin supplementing co2 levels the after that the the booze malibu compost kind of worked through its process in here and so we're getting you know by midday our ambient co2 levels are right at right at normal ambient levels three 350-400 anywhere in there and so i'd like to supplement it and get it back up to 900 that way we can you know maximize photosynthesis and what Matt anyhow so things are looking really good I wanted to apologize for the live stream again last night you guys I really thought that I had a whole another hour there Taekwondo got done early so it was my [ __ ] on the scheduling and then I really kind of wasn't prepared I had to drive to Seattle so I was a little out of it a little little pattern a little loopy so I promised to make it up to you guys next Wednesday with a thaw out well thought out and organized least first half of this livestream so many who just wanted to come in and share the the goodies with you oh yeah and also I think I got an odd duck I don't think I know this is not blue McGill this is not a blue Magoo it's just not the same leaf structure the stem rub tells it all the blue Magoo is just super aromatic even even when it was a little clone he was aromatic this one.you stem rub it and nothing and I mean [ __ ] nothing so that's the only one that I got from the dude and I imagine you know like the guy wanted to make a sale I reached out to him and told him I needed 18 cuts of one kind and had 17 or it was an honest mistake you know let's just assume it was an honest mistake I mean they happen right I gotta teach myself not to see that not to just assume ill of people like he could have been an honest mistake he did he be a solid with these starts they're really [ __ ] good so we got a mystery it'll be interesting to see what it is I'm a little you know like I don't know about it that has no [ __ ] smell so we'll see maybe it's a late bloomer the rest of these the bloom that are definitely blue Magoo's are [ __ ] just just loving it anyway I'm rambling hey I want you guys to be good be good to each other it's like I've said before let's grow plants not egos and let's please guys be respectful on my comments section you know I know I have a tendency to be short with people who are [ __ ] idiots and so I can I can come across as disrespectful at times but it's usually after someone has just just been blatantly disrespectful so if you don't like what somebody has said or the way somebody is delivering information on my page and you take exception to it there's a respectful way to to open dialog with that but just telling somebody to [ __ ] off isn't isn't what we're what I'm looking for on my page and so I'm just gonna respectfully ask you guys to like and be nice and kind to each other on the chat especially when people are giving information you know we're not all people people people right and some of us just might have a certain way of delivering information or presenting information in an on a message it's really hard to gain emotional content so you might be reading somebody's message one way and the guy might have been singing in a completely different way and so we got to take these things with a grain of salt and I'm really just kind of appealing to you guys and trying to trying to get you guys to tackle the comment section with some humility and tact and if you don't agree with something somebody has to say open the dialogue I mean geez there's no reason to just fly right off the cuff until somebody to [ __ ] off for no apparent reason or because you don't like what they were saying or you assumed that they were being combative or whatever let's let's all just take a step back and realize that this is just information exchange so yeah I'm done with that hope I didn't mean to add that one minute rant about it but I think it's really important I want respect from everybody to everybody on my page now somebody deserves disrespect by all [ __ ] means I'll be the first one to light into him but let's uh let's try to understand each other first all right guys love you all peace", "WUPQsCwwCnQ": "very chill very laid back very friendly very open if you walk in here you'll notice like a lot of the

"1PbOkVa_-38": "hello and welcome to carry DS artistry InDesign limited I'm Carrie D and today we're going to look at coating the cake in wall icing so let's move straight on the look at material and equipment firstly we have our marzipan cake which we did in a previous video I've got a royal icing side scrape and this is a straight version and it's in metal there are plastic versions out there and there are serrated ones I prefer the metal ones so they don't actually bend it when I'm putting it around the cap we also have the wall icing straight edge palate knife is essential we have our raw icing which we obviously made in a previous video as well and a turntable if you're doing a square cake you could get away without using a turntable so let's move on and roll ice the size of our cake now as you saw we did coat our cake in marzipan we let it rest overnight for 24 hours and this has given us a bit of a skin on our marzipan as far as pretty royal icing on the action you will need for your palette knife is a paddling action so if I'm doing it on the side it would be back and forth so I'm going to load my cake with royal icing instructions for making roll icing or actually on the website as well and this has been made with exactly the same technique so just putting royal icing all around the side of our cake basically loading the cake ups before I start working it down unfortunately the process of making raw icing will actually put air bubbles into the royal icing however when you alter paint your cake you will spend time doing this paddling action to remove those very same royal icing bubbles a bit more on don't worry about the amount you put on you will be taking at least a 30% of it off back off when you pull the side scrape around so work your way around by doing longer turns with your turntable it will give you an indication as to how much more working down you may need to do with your royal icing keep the top as tight as possible I always count sides of my cake first that's my personal preference some people cut the tops first and then to the side so once you're happy that you pretty much got a lot of the air bubbles out of your ball icing go on to using our side scraper now the action you're going to need to do is you're going to need to keep the scraper in one place and turn your cake continually all the way around it's a good idea to practice that motion before you do it for the first time make sure your scraper is vertical and resting on the board that way have a straight side to your cake so I'm going to do is we're going to pull our scraper around all the way around the cake when you come to the starting point here we'll just pull the cake scraper away you'll end up with a mark down the side there and that's called a takeoff mark the take-off mark will be there on any wall iced cake you do there is no helping it I will tell you how to get rid of it when we talk about finishing cakes off now to remove my top edge I will take my clean pallet knife make sure the edges clean resting it on the top of my cake I will draw it gently in towards me the reason I'm doing this is I want to start establishing that really sharp edge on the top of your cake that's what makes your painting stand out it'll also make it a lot easier when you're doing borders if you're piping along a very straight line that's sorted and as far as your board goes use the same scraper run it around the side of the cake try not to dig into the side of the cake you want to remove any excess icing from the board for the simple reason that if you let it dry there when you do your second coat of royal icing you will find you will end up with lumps and bumps in your coating do not add to this icing back into the bowl because if you see you've got grey marks on it that's where some of the silver ring is move come off the board okay so let's move on and let's take a look at coating the top now as I said previously the paddling action for adding royal icing to the cake will be as follows you'll be smoothing it back and forth and you need to be able to paddle and turn the turntable at the same time obviously if you're left-handed this will be reversed and your work in the opposite direction so once again I've got my royal icing and I'm going to load the top of my cake to excuse the noise I've obviously got a bit of a wobbly turntable today now what we are attempting to do here is to work out as many air bubbles as possible we have left our side coating overnight to dry out if you don't you will find it impossible to do a top and side counting and give yourself a sharp edge as I said previously this is my method of counting a cake there are different methods out there you may find that someone else's method worked better for you than mine I found if I side coat a cake and then I leave it for 24 hours to dry and then top coat a cake I can obtain a really sharp edge as you can see I've got to the point where I believe I'm pretty much there as far as working the air bubbles out as a quick test or if you hold your palette knife down turn your cake entirely that will sometimes give you an indication as to how many air bubbles you've got left so now is the time to try and pull our royal icing straight edge across now when you hold the raw lighting straight edge you actually need it to be at a 45 degree angle to your cake if you hold it too much up directly upright your turn to get judders if you hold it too flat you tend to smear and it'll dig right into the top of your cake so 45 degrees make sure you think is a far enough apart that they can pass over the cake without digging in I rest the turntable up against my body that will stop it moving some people will put it onto a countertop and do it on the countertop so it don't doesn't swivel okay rest the blade down pull it across the top of the cake trying to keep the pressure even across the surface of the cake lift it off at the end if you have got a problem of an air bubble somewhere in it that's fine just pull it across again if your coating a royal iced cake I would recommend three coats first would be a firm peak second would be a soft peak third would be a run-out coating which you basically scrape on scrape off the reason the first coat is not that important is because it's a royal iced firm peak it's there to mask your royal icing mask your master pan sorry to clean the sides off I'm going to use once again my sharp blade and I'm going to go along because side of my cake is actually dry I can clean side icing off without digging into it just to clarify because my first coating is only there to cover my marzipan I do my best to get a perfect coating but I'm not going to stress over it because I know the next counting will cover up any small bubbles or imperfections in my coating okay one last we but clean around and that's how I give myself a top coating on a cake now I would leave this for 24 hours before I started work on the second coating which again I would work on the side then again on the top then when I do the final coating over to the side and once again on the top at that point you would then have a flawless finish to your cake but patience is everything and practice is also good okay thank you let's move on and talk about a few more tips about royal icing a cake now we're going to address the problem of the takeoff mark as I said you can see here I've got where my takeoff mark is between each coating if you take a small sharp knife just gently scrape down you can tear that down fits on with invisible so that each time you do accounting you then won't be building that Ridge up when it comes to your final coating which would be in wrong icing if you run out you will probably find it'll be completely impassive on now I'm going to talk about coating the board here or what I call the splay you're going to use the same action as you did before you're going to load your board depending on what your client has requested this could be a coating in paste or this could be a coating in two different color so be aware that if it's a little front cover you don't want to get it onto the side of your cake bit of a paddle we're trying once again to remove all of those air bubbles from it once you're happy that you've actually got to a point where you feel you've worked out most of the air bubbles from the royal icing central keep your ball tight as you go and as we did with the side coating you're going to need to turn your turntable completely around in one action so if you look for the takeoff mark traditionally people put all the takeoff marks at the same place there's going to be a takeoff mark with this action so resting this at 90 degrees to your cake or you could use a side scraper you can put your palette knife down turn this in one action go completely around your cake if you do find you have any over sized air bubbles go around one more time just to make sure that it's smoothed it out I'll take your palette knives away then go in and tidy up the outer edge now I would normally if I was doing a wedding cake leave that to dry for 24 hours and then I coated in grown-up icing which is a very soft icing and let it flood in and you'll get a really nice smooth finish to your board take a bit of damp tissue paper or Kleenex make sure you clean the board edge very carefully the reason for this is you'll find that you're not going to be able to get your ribbon stick to a board if it's got any icing on it once you've done that go in and use your sharp knife and if there are any bits where they're all icing is actually come up on its side of the cake just remove it you'll find that because you're wrong icing coating is completely dry you won't have any problems lounging the side coating so there you go let's move on and look at some tips now I've quickly coated a small square dummy I coated it yesterday just to give you a few pointers if you're using a shaped cake now if this was going to be coated with raw icing there are a few more steps you need to take when coating the side of the cake you would coat that side and that side let it dry and then the next day you would coat that side on that side this will enable you between coats to actually clean the corners down and that's what you're looking for is really sharp corners now if you use the same process with the hexagon a Pentagon and octagon always remember if the sides are adjacent they actually need to be decorated separately with a heart-shaped cake you will find you'll do one side clean it down leave it for 24 hours or several hours till it's completely crusted then do the other side and clean it down that way okay hopefully you'll have some really good times cause your royal icing cakes and hopefully have cleared up some of the myth about coatings okay bye-bye now you", "9kxwFXqdh8Y": "[Music] you", "DeJePN_VXvI": "how's the grass oh yeah the grass\ngreener over there okay well glad you're enjoying it good\nmorning everybody say hello to my little rest area dear friend over here um you\nknow it's starting to look a little different although it is green

just\nfine so I did get asked to move from the lot up there I originally was told to\npark there and everything is gonna be okay and then security came by and said\nthey're having a big concert up there and all the RVs and everybody has to\nleave so they directed me down here which is fine it was the inconvenience\nof having to move basically who cares I had to put the bike back up but they\nhave better designated RV parking down here so I would say shoot for the lower\nlot no matter what just in case there's a concert I guess and I thought the\nthing about going in and talking to that guy and saying why did you tell me to\npark over there they just kicked me out no biggie\nI'm oh I'm all set up and comfy and run in the generator right now because I ran\nthe air conditioner all afternoon and brought my lithium batteries down to 22%\nlowest I've ever brought my lithium battleborn batteries down to so I'm\nrecharging the battery bank as the Sun kind of sets just to go to bed with a\nhundred percent battery life that's that's the plan anyway\nno no biggie I'm okay it was kind of an inconvenience but that happens they are\noffering free dry or B parking so look at that sunset though it's awesome\nthat's I five on the other side there the resort over there on the other side\nyou never thought I'd see a casino looks pretty scenery out there what's up my\ndude

solar and batteries\nlithium batteries I still have that five hour limit where the batteries can't\nkeep up with what's coming in and I'm gonna have to fire my generator for a\ncouple hours to get it back to 100% to be able to you know so and I've heard\npeople that have double the capacity of batteries like camper van Kevin he's got\n600 amp hours $6,000 worth of lithium batteries and even he even he can't run\nsolar every single day but maybe a mini-split more efficient air\nconditioners in my future for next summer for Miranda yeah what was that\nthe wait and see all right now no biggie it works math we're making some changes\nso my next video we're gonna leave Oregon we're gonna cross another state\nline in my very next video it's already planned although I'm gonna stay here\ntonight I'm not gonna fill them anymore gonna relax and do a little bit of deep\ncleaning and relaxing and like I said do you not into my very next video there's\nsome big changes on the way I'm not scared of the heat even those triple\ndigits it's not scaring me away there's always a way around it\nyou know what I'll remember these triple digits next time it gets really cold\nokay all right well you guys take care of checks and I'll see you in a few days\nI guess", "D4IdjF4P4xM": "and this is breeding Cuba by Dean who women seem cool that doesn't say wouldn't it hey guys love the show

wanted to give you a little heads-up about the garden and what we have going on here as people start to drift in things are going well here I think if you guys saw my last video I put a bunch of those feminize seed which I've never used before I've never popped many feminized seed I got those in jiffy those little jiffy pellet bucks I haven't used those in about a decade but I soaked those in a low water Sheila G and and and let them soak up and now we've got over half of the seeds it popped already I'm gonna take a little video tomorrow show you guys what's up I finished my all my rear mending process and I talked dressed with with some fresh barley straw and like I said I'll show you guys all that in the new video as we get ready to drop the new little transplants into the soil and I think next time I'm going to just if I ever do went feminized again we'd go a seed straight to soil but I had to reinvent ooh this cycle so I wanted to play it safe but it looks like we got people pouring in and that's good I'm glad people are coming back I got a lot of really positive feedback on the first on the first session and I think you know it gave me some motivation to move forward I was a little hesitant but it seems like things like it's a good thing so anyway today we were just gonna continue I wanted to kind of do my disclaimer again by no means am I an expert or a professional or a master and all I can do is share my experience and observations with you and what's worked for me and my goal in this whole process is to kind of walk you through the cycle that I've gone through and I'm getting a gram a watt two pounds the light and it's doable with fresh water only and and that's it during the growth cycle your only input it can be done and and you don't have to sacrifice quality to make that happen so this this particular talk like I said I really wanted to break things down and I know a lot of a lot of you guys that are on interviewing you live know this information already I really appreciate you coming out because you know it's it can be redundant the information can be redundant but I'm really targeting people who've never done no-till who want to go the simple route and go take the minimalist approach as I'm doing and so that's my goal here there's a lot of a lot of add-ons that can be done to my method but all I can do is speak to speak to my experience and and you know otherwise I just be kind of faking it and so anyway I think we're gonna go right on to like cover crop the cover crop aspect because we touched on the soil and the importance of having a living viable soil and that that's really the magic that's that's the engine that drives to this whole thing is the soil so cover crops are kind of one of the most commonly misunderstood aspects - no - I think for the beginner for somebody who's never heard of Noto because they immediately think that they're going to compete with resources in a sense and that that that's that that's that's a misnomer and I think what there's a lack of understanding with what's happening with the root system and as I've said a lot of you guys know this stuff already but we're gonna break it down from square one for the people that don't and so I think we need to talk about rude exits and the fact that your plant root system isn't just a straw that sucks up its it also exude --zz things and and it exudes vitamins and sugars and enzymes and all of these things we could go into those individually and talk about the importance of each one them to the soil structure and what they do but you know at the basic most dumbed down level those sugars and enzymes and vitamins help attract various microbes that help break up the nutrients and minerals and make them more bioavailable to the plants so if you have a more diverse group of cover crops that are actually exuding and diverse in diverse group of vitamins and enzymes and the sugars that we've been talking about you're gonna have a a more diverse bacterial colony in your in your beds and so that diversity is going to equate to better nutrient uptake and more nutrients that are readily available so the cover crop to me that's the most important aspect is the root exits and kind of enriching the soil in that in that regard now there's also other aspects of certain cover crop like legumes and and whatnot that are actually nitrogen fixers and these will literally pull nitrogen out of the air and fix it into into the soil into a bioavailable form for the plant so we've actually done a test at one of the places that I was working with we got some bill to soil soil tested it before we planted anything in it it just said when we just put the beds in we tested the soil for all all its nitrogen levels and whatnot and then we tested at the end of the grow cycle and it actually had higher nitrogen levels than when we started and we had and we had gone a full three months cycle of edged one left edge and two months of bloom and ret and had higher numbers at the end so that's a real testament to the power of the cover crop I'm the living cover crop and and what they can do for your soil and the real importance this time I've got my milady lacy here with me she's going to be kind of going helping me out with some of your guys's questions I realized last time that I just black up through it and I and I missed a lot of your questions so I'm kind of open to streamline that a little more nitrogen fixers those are all any of the legumes so you know clove clover is actually really good and I believe fetch is another good nitrogen fixer the clover tends to be the most popular and it it's it grows really vigorous and I it's one of those ones that really take over in my beds I'm sure you've seen some of my pics on IG so any of the clovers would be great for nitrogen fixing the Builder so cover crop I really like it once again it fits that kind of diverse profile that I was just talking about some people are kind of hating on it because of the climbing they've got some climbers in there and you know I I don't find them to be that much of a problem I think I think they're kind of it's kind of cool aesthetically when when they climb up through the canopy and when if they start to be problematic like latching on to a bud or something I'll just yank them and then just throw them down as a mulch layer so I like I can't say enough about build the soil there they've got a really good resource their website is you know it's not the slickest website in the world but it's full of information and those guys are always eager to help so yeah I think moving on I think we cope that covers the cover crop you know and there's the obvious benefits as well as moisture retention and and and that kind of thing and you can get by with a living cover cropping you're only kind of mulch source but it has to be fairly dense and I've found from my experience that once you get a canopy over it you get a pretty good die-off which is cool it just all breaks down it goes the nutrients go back into the soil and a kind of a closed loop but I do still use barley straw as well so I'll do like a living cover crop and then let that sprout up and then use a barley straw over it water the barley over the barley straw and then cover crop seeds into the barley straw so we get that enzymatic and response from all the seed sprouting inside the so at the soil level and then there's a kind of a die-off from the mulch layer being put down and then there's a new kind of resurgence with the new cover Crump it seems a little redundant but it's what I've been doing the past few cycles and I've been getting really good results so I'm kind of not rocking the boat in that regard so and that's that's the long and short of cover crops you know I don't think anybody has any questions with that we're gonna move on and we kind of covered mulching - barley straw it varies you know I think you know I like I don't know eight inch half inch thick a fairly decent layer you know I like to be able to pull it back and see a bunch of fun fungal activity happening and and the worms right at the surface so I'm really trying to eliminate a lot of air that's circulating above it from getting down there because we do want that we do want some decomposition going on underneath that layer so I think it's got to be thick enough to facilitate some decomposition right so anyway I think molds like that really covers the mulch I I'd like to take when my cover crop it's big like the clover gets crazy and out of hand or it's just everywhere I'll just take some scissors and and trim it down and give it a haircut break it up and throw it in as mulch and it just goes back in for the worms and like I say that's another closed loop in a sense the nutrients just go right back right back to the woodchips I don't have any experience with them per se and in to be honest with you in the past I've always heard that they were a no-no that they could Rob nitrogen from your soil but that's just kind of me hearing old farmers talking you know as know it's not rooted in any experience so I've heard lots of people saying what chips are just fine and that they actually promote a bacterial and colony so that might be some for some of you guys that have experience I'd love to hear your input on that I'm hesitant because I've been told that's a no-no some of you might actually have science behind it to know whether it's a good or a bad thing or not I'm not using much no I wouldn't say so I mean as long as the kale was brown good you know growing it with miracle-gro or something any kind of nutrient source that that you can get to your plants via your soil I would think is a good one you know - yeah I mean I can't think of how kale could be bad um rice hulls are actually really good for aeration but they actually break down pretty fast so I don't know as a mulch layer I imagine they would work good you just have to use quite a bit of them and then just anticipate them to break down and more rapidly than say the barley straw okay so um I think we should move on to the must-have inputs and these are the I call them must-haves because in my minimalist approach I still enrich my soil in between the cycles and I think that that's really important because we can't escape that the fact that the soil once again is the engine and if we you know leave it in disrepair it's the finished product is is going to just go in a show he's going to show that and so we really want to stick to that truth and understanding that the soil that we've got to keep the soil alive and we've got to feed the soil the things that it needs so it can provide for the plant via that sacred Union right so um the inputs that I use so now after I've just harvested I will I don't read with that kiss pact that you used to even may have seen in my last video every cycle they recommend that you do but I've been doing it every other cycle and things have been going okay so um what I'll do after this after the harvest is there's kind of a week-long period where I'm doing my drying here and I don't really have the space to keep my room up and going like in bed condition so it kind of the temperatures drop and things go dormant for about a week and I really worry that some of my microbial life suffers at that time so I will hit it with an active compost tea like with OG bio war and I've got links in the description of some of these inputs that I'm talking about and like this build the soil seed and the seed sprout put compost tea recipe and whatnot so if you need those things there there's links in the description to these inputs that I'm talking about so anyway I'll hit my beds with that active compost tea and that will kind of give a boost to the microbial life and kind of kickstart things again and then after that I'll start drenching with aloe and and the multi brain tincture from mountain organics and some of you guys may know may know that for my G or may know of them but they've got a great aloe tincture and I don't think they're doing the multi grains one anymore but I think they've got a similar a similar product now once again a lot of you guys know about the benefits of aloe and for the people that don't there's there's just a ton that I could really go on about aloe for quite a while but I'll try to keep it brief and to the point aloe for gardening purposes is giant it's rich in minerals sugars and vitamins and it's also got things like saponins which are kind of a cleansing and antiseptic has an antiseptic effect so those are really good for cloning and keeping your the cutting site clean and whatnot there's also salad Salas like acid right and that's an anti-bacterial and anti-fungal which once again works symbiotically with the good fungus and bacteria and attacks the the bad stuff so it's just one of those win-win deals in the garden it's really good as a whole here and as a drench yeah my understanding is that the the malted grain and malted barley is the same it's just multiple grains that are that are malted and I want to go into the kind of the benefits of the malted texture and the seed sprouting tee for those of you that don't know what's happening here is when you do a seed sprout tea and like corn is a really popular one you'll take this to go take seeds and actually sprout them and until they get a you know about a half inch long tail growing on it when we root going and what's what's inside that root is growth hormones and all kinds of things that are going to aid the plant in developing a healthy root structure and it's just like a super shot of hormones that are just irreplaceable to the plant you really it's a really good thing to have and so that's where that malted grain texture comes in really good for the root zone and that's one of those deals we're all hitting my beds once or twice during veg just as a right before bed jazz a little as a drench when I'm planting the transplants in I've seen mixed mixed information about out using a low for human consumption like what you can get at the vitamin store like lily of the valley or whatnot that has a preservative in there and I've been hesitant to use it in my beds because of the preservative but I would use it as a full-year just because I obviously there's less less chance of harm happening to the beds just going on the surface of the leaf somebody's asking what the saponin is okay saponin it's just another one of those components of inside aloe that has the kind of the cleaning and antiseptic effects like when we use aloe on on our wounds it's what makes it an effective cleaner and so that helps in in the plant world by like like keeping the roots healthy and and revitalized and whatnot just just like if we had cuts and abrasions on us of the plant tissues it helps the plant tissues healed yes somebody's asking if the aloe tincture and actual aloe if one is better than the other and my understanding of them and I have a lot of trust in mountain organics they're really reputable crew and that guys is a no-till master amis he's been six years in the same no-till beds or even LeClair containers you know six years 17 or 18 cycles and and so I I've got a lot of faith in him in his process and so my understanding is that the aloe from him is just a more stable version because it's suspended in a glycerin solution and and so at that point it's kind of more stable shelf stable and highly concentrated I still believe that if you were good if you were using a fresh aloe that you're going to have better properties in that fresh out oh I just kind of opted to support a good company and have something that is shelf stable and easy to use two teaspoons per gallon type of thing okay so I think we went over the seed sprouting tea and the malted grain tincture and in the benefit of those enzymes I mean you can imagine the you know whatever it is that you're sprouting whether it's barley or whatever that it's sprouting and all those little seeds that have little roots coming out of them now and we're just concentrating all those enzymes from the thousands of seeds that you have sprouting and now we're going to feed that back feed that all those enzymes into your plan into your bed and and you can imagine the benefits that ensue um yeah somebody's asking if the using the whole leaf is okay yeah I would say so I mean I think that anytime you can incorporate everything that you know the natural order has offered us in regard to especially it's just a low to use it the only the only negatives I seem to using the whole part of the leaf is that I can't get it pure aid good enough and it clogs my tape and sprayer so I tend to just kind of filet if I'm using and using the actual album because I can't even with my ninja blender I can't eat it pureed enough it's done clogged forever what is something you're excited about trying in the future if you ground the growing medium hmm somebody's asking about what I'm excited about using in the future I think cultivation wise and then also mentioned something about grounding the beds I've never heard of grounding the beds you know we are all electric this is an electric universe so I think that I wouldn't booboo that you know I've never heard of it and you definitely got me interested I would be into checking that out you know makes sense if there's some kind of electrical stagnation happening that if we could facilitate you know because I mean that's how nutrients are taken up for my basic understanding is that there's a kind of a magnetic electrical thing happening with positive and electrical charges and that's how nutrients are assimilated so very interesting point as far as anything new and exciting I'll be very honest with you I've for a long time have been very hesitant about LEDs and I've been seeing some really interesting stuff from grow mouse and others THC Titan and people that have been just getting really nice results with LEDs so that's kind of what I'm excited about the new LED and light tech the DIY light tech is really exciting I've got a lot to learn in that department but cultivation wise I'm really just kind of digging my heels into this minimalist no - something's asking about when I trim up or lollipop and I do I do someone I bring it up to the canopy level and then I kind of let the canopy go au naturale to some degree not for any other reason just just so I'm just going with my gut you know there's a lot of people that strip strip all the way up and are really like particular about how thin that canopy is that I'm hanging about removing leaves and I'm just not one of those guys and no I don't I don't mulch any of those leaves when they go back in I might rip them up by hand if I've got a big lot of but I tend to just kind of let everything fall naturally and once again not for any other reason but part laziness and just going with my gut you know I'm I'm taking the minimalist thing really to heart like we're trying to I'm not trying to spend 15 hours in the in the garden every day and I'm not trying to mix a thousand concoctions you know once again we just want to facilitate that sacred Union yeah somebody's asking if I feed in flour or if I'm just straight water all the way through and then very literally fresh water that's it soon as plants go in like I said early all hit him with a with the enzymes from the malted grains and I'll hit him with a little hallow as a drench when I when I transplant but after that everything is fed via the blue mat triggers and it's all fresh water only from that moment on nothing else hits the soil except for fresh water somebody's asking about a method of topping or are filming or that you know [ __ ] I missed technique or whatever I I typically just kind of talk once or twice as the plants are and veg and then just let them do their thing Washington has changed our plant count numbers and so I'll probably be doing a lot more topping and a lot more low stress training these next this next cycle because we're dealing with that plant count issue here and we're really hoping for the homegrown bill to pass and that will allow us to kind of get back to some practical numbers but but until then I will be doing some more talking but there's no really method I don't really I just kind of pinch it'll pinch the top growth like like we've all read from Sobrante sand Rosenthal and everybody else was still using that old technique like you turn the dirt okay medically fit when the soil biology turned the dirt and soil into humic acid why would you want to destroy the biology I guess I'm not following fit hit me up with that again because I'd really like to get to your questions we might have a misunderstanding so yeah if you guys have specific questions for me make sure to tag me with Joshua's names Lin that way we can we can get to specific questions and I'm not jumping in on your guys to set up your guys's conversations they're in chat okay Andrew yeah you're asking about any like fermented plant juice or anything like that and no I don't I don't do any of those I'm not familiar with any of that Korean natural farming stuff and I'm interested I think it's really cool and I'm interested in trying some of those for my veggie my veggie garden this year but inside for the cannabis we really just really once again I'm going to beat that minimalist job I just do the active compost tea kind of as a kick start at the beginning and then some enzymes from a seed sprout tea and whatnot and some aloe and that's it before we know somebody's asking about the maxi blue max I haven't picked them up yet those are the ones that go deeper I believe I'm still using the regular ones so I'm having pretty good results my beds are one foot deep and I don't have them all the way to the top so I'm probably at a 10 inch depth and I've been I we've been going pretty good so far but I wouldn't mind getting some maxes from outdoor route their beds yeah are you using urns yeah urban farmers asking to find using worms I am I use the red wigglers and I believe I got two kinds red wigglers and the Alabama jumpers they just worked in slightly different depths but that was kind of my understanding with those but yeah i am using worms and I'm actually thinking about introducing more because I just want to see more activity okay we got some people asking about geology so I'll go ahead and move into that - Sheila geez kind of a new one in the cannabis world from my understanding in that I think it's plant and prosperous is one of those guys on IG who's a heavy promoter of it and I looked into it and was really impressed with the mineral content it's got seventy to eighty of the of the minerals that we need and it's all in ionic form and there's humic and fulvic acids there's also natural sulfur that occurs inside the Sheila G and trace amounts which makes it beneficial in conjunction with aloe that has its anti you know the the salicylic acid combined with the sulfur in the Sheila G making a fairly decent preventative maintenance or even like dealing with the light outbreak of powdery mildew but I've kind of spoke my piece on powdery mildew in the past and you know I think if you've got powder and they'll be there's even other promise the Sheila G is one of those deals that I'm kind of using it as a replacement to the full power I'm kind of not using the full power anymore because I I've been taking this eulogy myself as a supplement for me and I'm just kind of like if it's something that I can take and I can give to my plants I'd rather go that route I mean I can't take a shot of the full power I just topped just my plants with the native flower based on what you said are you wrecking any water but if somebody's asking they said that they just flipped into flour and based on what I'm suggesting if they should only do fresh water and if coconut water is okay coconut water certainly okay and once again I kind of touched on it earlier that my minimalist approach is just kind of like a square one you could do a low on coconut water once a week you know you can hit it up with all these things as much as you want it's that's just based on your preference and what you want I'm just saying that you'd be doing less and still get 2 pounds of light if you're using double-ended Gavita and at least that because that's what I'm getting from my experience and so depending on how enriched your soil is and how amended your soil what you've got in it by all means go go fresh water only you know it just depends on how rich your soil is when I eat this eulogy at first I felt I did feel energy I felt energized and and just kind of like an alertness to it and ultimately I have taken really small amounts and so I just it's the fact that I know that I'm taking in so many good rich minerals and I usually take it with a glass of warm and manuka honey and lemon water and you know I've just felt like an overall sense of more energy and more vitality for sure somebody's asking if I've ever tried structuring water knowing I've heard about that I believe it's worth it you take the water and run it run it through some kind of like spiral and it realigns the molecules I think that's really interesting stuff but I haven't really dove into that once again that's one of those things about science that I find really interesting but just haven't having to have it dove into that topic yet aha everybody's asking what she let you taste like it tastes like [ __ ] it tastes like complete [ __ ] and it smells like bong water I mean it's it's it's the most vile [ __ ] on the planet and if you don't know what it is basically it comes out of the Himalayas and some of these other high-altitude mountain ranges where when they were formed they plowed in a bunch of tropical vegetation and then as the mountain ranges were formed it just kind of turned into this stuff right and so when it's warm it was the mountain kind of secretes it as this black resinous material and indigenous people were seeing native animals and whatnot eating it and that the ones that were eating it were healthier the healthiest ones in the herd right so they decided to start consuming it in the night and it became you know part of their dietary regime and they've been known for health and longevity in those reason regions based on this fulvic and humic acid tea that they make from this stuff so tastes terrible absolutely terrible but very very good for you growing Kelly ding gasket about a placebo you know I don't know if it's placebo or not you know the plants really seemed to respond but hey man it could have been the aloe it could have been the water who knows there there is one truth to that is that the mineral content is is scientifically fact and that that it's and that they are in their ionic forms that's all that's all undeniable stuff so you know I don't know what to say about that word yeah somebody talking about there's a lot of fakes eulogy on the market and there really is there's you could there's some interesting all right this is what I use if you can see it oh it's backwards maha lotus blooming herbs they have there's a really high quality it will start to dissolve in ice-cold water and that's kind of these are our properties that you want to see from it if it doesn't dissolve in cold water or cool water or it's not it doesn't get soft by touching it it acts a lot like shatter ebh Odense when you touch it ready room temperature it gets kind of cold and pulled and snap in your fingers it immediately gets gooey and soft and that's that's the sign of a really good quality digital Oh so how about asking if I ever tried plant in the prosperous eulogy I haven't because I've got a 10 gram supply of this Lotus stuff but I know he's he's really hot on his brand and I wouldn't mind checking it out oh cool somebody's asking about dynamic accumulator but I'm glad you did I'm not currently cultivating any dynamic accumulators from my garden because I'm doing the RAM bending regime with that kind of keep it simple pack and that's that's kind of doing a good job at that were I to have the space and kind of or was doing this on a commercial level I most certainly would have a section designed specifically for dynamic accumulators and excuse me and those of you that don't know what dynamic accumulators are these are plants like comfrey and barrage and horsetail that when planted they will bring nutrients up into their leaves themselves and then store them in the leaf so you can like actually drive the leaf or make a tea from them and then pull those nutrients back out of those plants that have dynamically accumulated them and then introduce them back to the soil you can do it could be as simple as just top dressing with you know comfrey leaves or whatever in horsetail or you could grind it up into a powder and use it as a meal so dynamic accumulators are absolute fantastic way of delivering nutrients to your plants and I think it's essential if you scaled up or was doing any kind of homesteading where space isn't necessarily an issue by all means dynamic accumulation is where it's at somebody's asking off-topic if we're vegan yeah we are vegan and it's not out of any kind of love I mean we love animals but that's not its basically for our health for health reasons and we're not that those holier-than-thou time you know I think burgers are delicious okay so I think I think I've touched about everything that I needed to touch on you know those are the those are the basic inputs that I use and that and that's it you know I like to do a lot of foliar springing in veg with kelp and whatnot and so that I mean I don't know if you would consider that an input I don't call it an input because it's not going to the soil and then once I start flowering like I cease all the phonier somebody's asking if I follow the moon cycles like a biodynamic gardening I don't I think it's a really cool concept and when I worked in the co-op world produce world we had a lot of really good produce comfort by a biodynamic farms and so I think there's definitely something to it I just don't really have the time or energy so yeah I guess if nobody's got anything else I think we're gonna wrap it up and call it a wrap call it a show and I think I'll try to get another one done next Wednesday like I said there's probably probably only do two or three more of these because I want to just cover a cycle beginning to end and that way anybody who wants to kind of tackle this minimalist approach has all the information here and digestible chunks thanks a lot you guys for coming out it's like we're going overland I you see Maggie gave it to my dog I've never heard of c90 but if you can drink it I say it's good all right guys I'm gonna bounce thanks for coming out I really appreciate you guys as participation and your positive feedback and please by all means if you have any more questions or if you watching this and and you have a question about any of the information leave me a question in the comments section I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can and be good everybody", "j9Lxqt-8-fA": "hi YouTube recreational grower in my garden blue Magoo day 27 of a flower recreational marijuana in Oregon for plants on property this is the only one I have in flower right now in a couple of days they're gonna be moving in another blue Mugu under that sprog which will be the two plants we have a flower but for right now we're we're working on her she's she's doing good I came in this morning and like I usually do I turn on the green light I tell her she's doing a good job I check over and then I track of course we know the humidity and the temperature from the last 24 hours see a B and C this hair we're down to 72 percent humidity right now but we were up at 18 my first night humidity last night and it's kind of cold in here right now and I'm gonna explain that so high humidity is what brings on powdery mildew it brings on a lot of trouble I'm told that higher humidity also increases the possibility of bugs mating so high humidity and marijuana do not get along so of course my logical solution is I need to get into humidifier and I jump on the online and you know I goo GLE some dehumidifiers and realize such things are expensive but my best bet is that I'm gonna have to order one compared to going into a store I'm gonna pay twice as much it's going take me a week for it to get here meanwhile I thought only four weeks left on this plant at that point only three weeks left of flower and what could be the onset of quite a bit of powdery mildew as I understand powdery mildew is the devil and we don't want it I was fortunate enough that my last grow as you guys saw in my previous four set of videos is only during the winter or only being the summer so I didn't have to deal with that all I had to do is kind of the air conditioner but now I've got humidity it's raining outside it's just the Pacific Northwest it's gonna rain for the next like five six months I've got to figure out a way to fix this now and I can't wait that week plus for that that dehumidifier to show up so what I did is I got online actually I got on YouTube because you guys know so much and thank you so much good time and it took some digging but I did find someone who briefly said that they're fixing their humidity problems by turning up their air conditioner which of course made instant sense to me as you're conditioning the air the airs run over the condenser coils that convince two coils do exactly what they say they can dust hair and they pull the moisture out and then drip it out the back side of the room and that's what I've got I've got an air conditioner in my wall I've got it turned on and I only turn it on about twenty minutes ago and we got burning down to 70% humidity when I started this video we're at 73% humidity so it's dropping fast I'm getting back into that comfortable so I'm really quick but the offset about it's 63 reason here so I got my get this meetings gets a lot of the way my little portable heater here set 83 which will hopefully keep the room warm enough this air conditioner runs to drop my humidity so isn't a long-term fix no it's gonna cost a lot to run the air conditioner all winter long is it a fix for right now for the week plus before I can get some sort of humidifier in here yes is something that you can do right away if you start seeing powdery mildew in your room yes is it is they going to to work forever yes but it's gonna end up costing a whole lot of money so there we go quick fix learned it from you guys I appreciate it thank you so much comment like subscribe and we will keep you updated on this thanks so much", "BRAdD221qNA": "[Applause] [Music] [Music] and gather myself we've had our first batch of Booch was a success and now we're starting our second batch and waiting for licensing inspection and once that happens we open the floodgates and some start start slinging kegs and hit in the farmers markets and my life is gonna get even busier so yeah so a little frazzled today but things are going great in the garden I have done a few things in there that I'm gonna let you guys so we're talk about it today a little bit where the growth is is phenomenal I added a new layer of Malibu compost and another layer of mulch I've had a really I gotta give a shout out to Michael Young on I don't know if he's out here yet he's coming out tonight but we've had some really great conversations in my comment section of my videos the guy is really really knowledgeable and passionate and has really opened my eyes to them the houmous lair not to be confused with hummus the houmous layer and and its importance and Amy actually pointed out and when my latest video that I was lacking a human slave in any significance and and you know I step back from his comments and I looked and I assess and he's absolutely right my name is Larry is non-existent to his minuscule at best and so you know he he really what he said really rang true and kind of it struck a chord with me and I really wanted to kind of go on this houmous journey with you guys you know some of y'all probably know all been well about it about the importance of it you know I thought I did and I'd really felt I feel like I've got a newfound appreciation with some of the research I've done and so I think today you know we talk just briefly about the flowering period duties and some of the things that I think the beginner should should look out for and then we're gonna dive into the human and a little more into the food soil web as I on my basic understanding of it and you know it's kind of something a topic that maybe should have been talked about when we were talking about the exudates in what life but better late than never so shout out to Michael young man brother I really appreciate your comments and your input and and I look forward to the continued dialogue so um so really glad to see people pouring in thanks a lot for coming out I appreciate it I appreciate the encouragement any folks have been giving me I'm not exactly a really kind of man this isn't my BA my type of thing so the encouragement people's encouragement keeps me coming back and I know that this there's this open source of information happening and I really really want to kind of continue that so let's see I wanted a real quick touch on the living soil symposium that's happening in Medford at the end of the month 25th and 26th there is a lot of good speakers to full day's speakers so I and I'm gonna be going there and I'm I'm hoping to see some of you from IG out there and linking up and finally getting to shake hands with some of you folks if not I'll be coming back with the ton of information I'm going to take lots of notes and grow my brain and come back and hopefully share some more information from the simple from what I learned at the symposium so I don't have lacy here with me right now she's gonna be back in just a bit you want to pick up one of the kids from Taekwondo and so like I said we're gonna hear there's gonna be some chaos going on back here but it's you know family life right so I'm waiting for lace to come back and she'll be able to kind of feel the questions as they come in and until then make sure you tag tag my name the at Joshua's name's Lynn so it's highlighted and I can see it out of my peripheral and maybe I can get to your questions when she's not here so anyway I want to keep this short and sweet like I usually do we all have lives to live and so 30 40 minutes at tops you know so let's just dive right into it okay the sidetracked by the comments so anyhow flowering period duties you know I want to because I kind of want to do this continuous information flow from beginning to end so to speak on how I handle things in my process so you know maybe some of you don't have to reinvent the wheel and you can come and clean whatever from this from this information that you deem necessary but what I would do for the beginner nodes just kind of go right here from square one is is for your flowering room you got to make sure that it's leg tight and when I say light tight I mean light tight not a pinhole in your Panda not nothing and the only way you're really gonna know that is with a sensitive scientific instrument or are you just gonna have to sit down in your darkroom and let your eyes adjust and that takes a while it might take 10 minutes before your eyes are completely adjusted and your rods and cones are all used to the dark and that's when all of a sudden you'll see a little [ __ ] low right over in the corner of the room because you got a little pinholes dot in your panda plastic where you didn't double up or whatever right so that's the one thing you got to have to put the time and to make sure that it's light-tight or constructed in such a fashion where you know it's nighttime and even then I would sit in there and make sure because you just never know you'd be surprised at how small a hole or a gap will illuminate and glow and really [ __ ] your [ __ ] up so um sit in there make sure you like tight and there's other things that that will cause herm\u00e8s and cause your plants to geek out like the weird greenish kind of like that'll be on your mini split air handler or the red light on your heater that indicates that it's on I can't tell you how many girls I go into and red lights are there and you know green lights are going on and there are some green lights that are good but they've got to be green glass and it's got to be thick you don't want any white light leading out so if it's a white party light a white bowl painted green like a party light that you could find it scratches there's any scratches and they're white lights gonna leap through and you might not even be able to tell and you got that green light going on and off on and off I don't even use green lights I just I just don't do it so I tape up anything little little minis anything at all and even if it's green I don't give you [ __ ] I don't I don't want any length so I just err on the side of caution when it comes to that and and in my crazy mind I've really felt like I've seen reduced or weird growth patterns around environmental control sensors and whatnot so I've just I just I just prefer that it pitch black in there and dark so that's that's one of the first things that I'd like to touch on for flower pairing flower period duties is making sure that your night cycle is indeed going to be a nice cycle and that'll save you a lot of hassles and headaches with hermaphrodites and lucky buds and weird spots in your room where you just don't understand what why you're getting weird growth in that spot time and time again and once again you'd be chasing your tail like a dog and never even realize what's going on you need to just sit nearer with it dark you know and iron out those light leaks um so in my room in my room I tend to let the plants just kind of grow in veg and I don't do much like lolli popping at that point so I consider that my flower period duties right before I switch to flower if I'm gonna take any cuttings I take them at that point top from the top and then all lollipop right and so that's uh that's kind of that's how I handle that that part is I just a lollipop pretty much one time at the beginning of my bloom cycle and then over the eight to ten weeks it's gonna take the flower I don't do much else down there and I haven't seemed to need to the canopy keeps the light the diffused lights such a point where we don't get much growth below the canopy anyway so aside from aside from those things as far as flat my flowering period goes that's when I really make sure that I've got my dehumidifier going during the night cycle to keep those vapor pressure levels appropriate and we don't get any our plants don't get waterlogged and sock down with with moisture all night long so once again I'll try to I try to follow the vapor pressure deficit at night too yeah I mean I know that their photosynthesis is involved but we're also dealing with pressure water pressure on the plant and so if you've got too much pressure pressing down on the plant it's not going to it's not going to release any of that water that it's holding it's just going to sit on it all night and it might even it might we pan out and so you think you can end up getting moisture on the buds when you never even Foley that didn't make any kind of spring so if you've got to keep your humidity you know at a decent level in at the night cycle to avoid any kind of moisture happening in your can be some that you might not even be able to catch because it'll just go right down into your body that's happening night after night after night I'm not to tell you what's going to happen not good things so that's the that's the other biggie is making sure that your humidity in the night cycle is is manageable and is at such a level that your plants health isn't gonna suffer and you're not gonna might skate by for a year maybe but two next thing you know one of these times it's gonna bite you you know so just try to be on it as much as you can just in through see if we got any questions we think about the idea of cocoa base no-till mix I have found almost nothing about it and kind of feel I'm in this journey alone I'll be honest with you I haven't heard a whole lot about cocoa in no-till and goods or bats but it's definitely worth worth looking into it seems like the worms would really like it and the micro life would like it I don't know if it's got any kind of weird pH stability issues that might might be the case or it might break down too quick man I couldn't tell you that's a really good question and maybe somebody in chat hasn't has the answer for that so your mug guys let's see okay looks like though we're all good with flowering I don't do any kind of top dressing or any kind you know as you know I want you however all there's just fresh water happening and then I just make sure to keep the canopy relatively thinned you know I don't have any kind of method or time schedule or whatever I'll just kind of stroll through the garden and thin out the big families you know where I think that there could be creating little pockets or microclimates and whatnot and even then I just really don't stress about too much I like to make sure I've got that airflow and and as the buds mature and develop making sure that airflow it stays on point is clearly important seven finger ox hey what's up brother good to see you out here that's one of my local guys really good dude do you have rice holes in your soil I I don't I don't believe they keep it simple Howard Rice's holes to begin with I believe they're aeration was pumice and I'm not opposed to amending it at some point but I use so much barley straw and and whatnot and I know barley straw isn't a aerator but it's I feel like it creates a nice aerated layer there where the worms can do their thing in any way so now rice hulls is a great thing you just they do great really fast and you have to you have to remit with them or have it can't be your only source of aeration so yeah so so back to the flowering Dedes you know that's pretty much all I got going on and is just basically watching the ladies do their thing at that point there's not much else you do in my system that would help maybe a compost tea or something but we're really pushing the minimalist thing so that's that's how that's family PC pharmacist thumbs up on the rice hulls right on bro nice to see you out here Virginia living organics Josh do you have any whitefly issues with the soil you know any and if I ever do this if I ever like I got a bags of you know Malibu compost from a hydro shop and no doubt I brought fungus gnats home but I'm assuming that's what you mean as the fungus Nets the soil life that strata us or they used to be called hypothesis mites in the soil are such a huge population of them that they just and that would annihilate them occasionally I'll see them but then they go away so like they'll they'll introduce themselves the system but my soil is so healthy that it just chews them up and we don't they don't last they can't get a footman because my beneficials are so predominant that they don't stand a chance so you could literally introduce fungus gnats into my system and and that's it how do I feel about lactobacillus I know nothing about it I knew nothing about KNF so I mean I can't even speak to know that there's quite a few people that I respect and and know their stuff but know plenty about it it's not something I'm opposed to learning about but right now it's just kind of not on my radar it will be though I could see in the future maybe in the next year so I'm diving into that let's see yeah a DC farmer it is a dog-eat-dog world in the soil and you got to have the big dogs or at least enough of enough with the little dogs to take care of home and so and that's a good segue kind of into why I wanted to talk about the humor and and the importance of it and Michael Young really opened my eyes to the importance of it and and then my bed's were lacking it greatly and that they still distal are but I need to work on it incrementally so I don't walk down the system with the six inch layer of compost and straw you know I'm gonna do incremental compost additions to get to build this famous layer up and I think that's part of the problem you know I don't think it is part of the problem with commercial agriculture around the world is that we've our farming practices over the years have stripped the houmous lair from the soil and now are dependent on chemical fertilizers or all these other crazy extreme methods just to grow a simple crop and you've got people like laying them like I said her first name right look she she's just the food food soil web guru watched a few of her seminars or one-hour presentations on the food soil web and it is really really such an eye-opener you think you know and then you hear someone like that talk who's able to present it in such simple terms it's you know it just hits you and you're like done like no doubt that that's that's the case so the houmous layer is gonna assist in that food soil web a process you know and and for those of you that don't aren't familiar with it or hear that being thrown around a lot you know it's not just a buzz phrase it's actually what's happening so you've got the bacteria that are present in the soil that they're kind of the first they're your building blocks and they they create a lot of the glue in the soil so you gotta if you got a soil that's very compacted and you just introduce bacteria to it the bacteria will start to consume the things in the soil that it consumes and it releases polysaccharides or blues they're really like a glue and creates micro aggregates which is little clumps of the dirt right and and in doing so this attracts you know when you get fungal activity as well those grab those micro aggregates the fungus and creates macro aggregates and what happens is now as you've got when it cools all these pieces of the soil together Eve it's creating air pockets rooms for roots to grow and then what these bacteria and fungi literally build themselves around the root zones of the plants that are in there you know if that's all you have this bacteria and fungi in your soil your plants would never eat because they'd be locked up in the bacteria and fungus right so you'd only have things like cheap grass weeds that don't rely on micro rise the to to thrive and to get their food source so they live on really specific types of nitrogen one so when you've got the bacteria in the end the Phung fungi that are now have all nutrients locked up into their bodies and you need you need your higher order like nematodes and whatnot they will consume the bacteria and the fungus I want a really stressful again not an expert I'm not a food soil web expert I'm just sharing the knowledge that I'm learning as I go and and at my basic level so I know some of you might have a greater understanding but this is kind of my basic gist and I'm hoping that it it's news to some of y'all so the nematodes will and the other higher-order creatures that feed on the bacteria and the fungi create amino acids and break and make those nutrients available to the plant so the plant needs the higher order needs this food soil web to deliver the nutrients through the root zone and so that's that's where we can go back to the root exid's and having a diverse cover crop and having a rich healthy thick humus layer houmous lair there we go houmous lair that will send out the multitude of the exudates that it needs so you have a diverse population of bacteria and a diverse population of fungi that can process that the nutrients and minerals in your soil effectively for the plants and and so having a system that's gonna sustain all of those forms of life you know requires a thick umist layer and so you know we talk about what is human and it's really it's basically compost that's had all the organic material used up out of it right so you're left with basically carbon I believe this is my understanding of it in the end it'll last for a thousand years it holds 90% its weight in water and it provides nooks and crannies for the bacteria and the fungi to live and thrive in a highly oxygenated aerobic environment so that's that's the that's the key word and this whole thing is aerobic these all need oxygen the bacteria and the fungi that we want need oxygen to live and oxygen to thrive and if you start to lack oxygen and co2 builds up in the soil from all the processes happening you know it's not gonna be a good thing for your plant so having having a loose aerated you know a soil with good tilith is what they're called it's when you get all those micro and macro you know aggregates a little clumps that takes a long time you eat one rain on a dry dusty tilled soil and it'll flatten out and turn to a crust right so you really really got a workout building this you miss layer and recognizing its importance and it's it's been a huge Epiphany thanks to mr. young as of late for me and I'm really gonna work on building building of that houmous lair in my beds you know so I'm certain that I've got everything that my plants need and that the whole system is intact would you consider the vermicompost and Burma castings to be good chemists as far as mine as far as I understand yes that it would be a good component now if it's your only source I don't I couldn't tell you I don't see why not because that's that's part of the process the warrant you know the worms creating their own micro aggregates you know from just consuming the material and [ __ ] it out right so I think it would be fine but I in my mind I would want a more rich compost you know something's good organic well made compost at home that's that's gonna have a real rich diversity of your phone bill up life and the bacterial stuff going on because you really want to just kind of think of it as an inoculation lease that's how I'm that's my own basic understanding of it once with guys so I've been watering my no-till with water from my fish pond do you know any concerns that would arise from doing this I've never done but my concern would maybe possibly be nitrate levels or you know ammonia levels depends on what's happening with your fish waste in the water and how it's spreading down I couldn't tell you it's definitely aquaponics or is not white my thing really really interested in it just don't know enough about it I would be cautious okay PC kena's asking a really good question about different mixes for no-till he hasn't done no-till before and he's also asking about if you use a different mix for veg or flowering and that's no that's you don't at all and that's kind of the beauty of no-till and regenerative farming practices in general is that everything for veg and flour that the plant needs is in is in the soil already and when you have a complete food soil web kind of like we were just talking about your plant will utilize its own natural processes to send out the carbohydrates and the sugars missus Ingham calls them cakes and cookies right because it's like protein carbohydrate and start something right and it's basically the same mix that you make cakes and cookies with really great analogy I highly highly recommend checking out her like seminars on on YouTube when I'm very very informative so you don't need a different mix for veg and flour the plant will send out the call so to speak to get the nutrients that it needs for whatever cycle or whatever part of this life cycle it's in at the time big heads asking about Bokashi I don't I don't use Bokashi have never used it and so that might be one for somebody in in the chat because I'm really at once again I think that's just like a fermented compost juice from what I understand I'm gonna I'm gonna complete some ignorance on that in my knowledge of Akashi so okay so cool with the question so that's some you know I want to keep this short and sweet tonight and I really wanted to encourage you guys to to dive into the human labor with me and I'm gonna do some new videos kind of showing you I've already seen benefits from adding the the Malibu compost and the extra strong layer the I wasn't seeing my worms a lot I would scratch the surface and they'd be very deep and it makes perfect sense now that they were just they were staying away from the surface I didn't have enough there to buffer it so now I can pull the new straw and there's a good couple inches from the old straw the compost and the old cover crop that's just kind of going to be left to decay I'm seeing worms up into that you know they're they're getting busy and so every time I pull back I'm seeing lots of worms and lots of activity so I'm already seeing a benefit from adding the compost I'm just I thought I was starting to see a little tit burn on one of the plants so I'm gonna keep my eye out for that there's really not much I can do about it now it's already in the system so if anybody knows if Malibu compost has been known to be hot or bird leave me a comment or you can get with a message I'd like to hear your experience with it this is my kind of first time using it and we'll see so I tell them so anyway I'm trying to think if I missed anything about the humanists of its importance really it's just basically compost whether it's vermicompost or yard compost want it to be aerobic compost healthy compost if it's black or stinks like sewage it's not something you want to put in your beds and if you have to source it you know go sources there's no shame in that you really want to make sure that your bins have everything that they need and properly cultivated rich they houmous layer will do that it'll reduce your amount of water after but or reduce the stress on the micro life in your soil and there's just it's just nothing but good so I highly encourage you know tillers that are watching to you know check your you miss layer make sure probably add more tubing okay Nate dos says he sees mallet and compost has never had any birds that's good to hear chronic cool grows a so you don't make your own compost I have a compost pile but where we live it's really we got caked in snow so it got buried in snow I don't have been type compost system so I'm gonna have to be honest and say no I don't have a my own compost pile as of yet so Malibu it is tattooing trees what is the best way to introduce the nematodes and other microbes into a first-time minute that's a great question too when I first got my beds from people are my soil from keep it simple I inoculated with like og bio war I did some compost teas then I also went out I bought from evergreen grower supply I bought fifty thousand and hypothesis mites and if you look back into my granddaddy purple videos I had a really bad fungus net problem and that's what prompted me to do that it was my first cycle per cycle yeah and I mean it was terrible and so we bought like 50 or 75 thousand my and they just wiped them out in five days and I've never had a problem since they've managed to maintain a population in my in my beds and they're really doing good and I've also added Rove beetles and then two other forms of predator mites that I were canopy dwelling and they might have made their way down there and I'm you know they live for a little bit but I'm not quite sure where we're at with those but when you look in my soil it's nothing but those hypothesis miles mites I mean it's insane you put your hand in there you'll have a hundred on your hand in 15 seconds so fungus gnats don't stand a chance and you know once you introduce those things into your system and they'll find they'll find their way in like I didn't introduce Roly Polys they just showed up you know so you provide a habitat and they'll just arrive right oh yeah the nematodes you can get those they're usually like in us in sponges or like locked in solution or and like a powder or something and you can spray them into your soil with a fine mist sprayer you want it to be very fine or else you've just kind of glob them all into one location you know and they'll have to it'll take time for them to work their way you gotta find atomized mist you know I think there's a there's a a certain level you can't use too much pressure or you'll kill them so do your research before you apply your nematodes but you definitely want to do an application of those proactively before you have any issues with those other things plus you want them available to consume the bacteria and create that concealment can you maybe do some things on some tea brews yeah I could do to a couple tea brew vids I mean I only do one or two I do a earthworm compost tea and I also do that the kelp as a full year and so I think I can definitely do a I think that's a really good idea I really get don't I haven't done how-to videos so you know I'm not quite sure how I'll tackle with that that's the whole reason I'm doing this the way I shoot videos for my room updates and stuff just on my phone it's on the fly I don't edit it clearly and you know I just say whatever to whatever jackass thing comes in my mind pronouncing things wrong and so and I don't and I don't go back and edit it or nothing so um how-to videos have been kind of a trying to wrap my head around how to do that without diving into the whole video editing thing and I'm just not sure I have the time or energy for that so we'll figure that out okay so I think if that's you know I think we're getting to the end probably unless anybody has any questions I think we're gonna wrap it up for this week and once again like I say just check out Ingham she's got a kind of a pricey who the soil certification course two grand but I mean it's I think it's well worth it and I plan on taking it sometime in the next 12 months it's a really detailed course and it'll demystify a lot of the a lot of the things that I'm still in being unclear about what's happening in the soil so yeah looks like everybody's ready to rock and I really appreciate you guys coming out and hope this wasn't too basic for some of y'all and by all means leave me messages or comments and see you out there", "YyXDwc9OQ2M": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 where we give you the most in-depth reviews as efficiently as possible and today we're gonna be checking out this crumble or this bubba kush crumble by Regulator extract and with that we're gonna go ahead and hop right into the numbers so THC a comes in at or actually THC comes in at 60 to 0.5 they don't have a whole lot of other stuff but as you guys know I don't buy my candles based off of THC the reason I really picked this up was because it looked really good and it was a steal so I can't hi guys know I don't really mention prices so I'm not really gonna go into it but just know that this was really affordable this was definitely something that I would consider budget-friendly and I'm trying to open this right now and it's not working give me two seconds there we go alright so sorry guys I've been fighting kind of cold so if I sound a little funny I apologize all right so here we go sorry it really is that far off camera I was so as you can see this looks really really good zoom in for you guys so you can check that out let me educate this and play with it a little bit so the color that comes off on camera is about two shades lighter than the color that's in the actual like in person I would say it's a little bit darker than what you guys see here but it still looks really really good ooh as far as the scent is concerned it just has that really clean floral you know good concentrate taste but with that I'm really excited to try this and I'll be back again with you guys in a couple of days to let you know how this hey guys what's up I went ahead and tried that bubba kush and as far as the flavor is concerned it doesn't have a whole lot outside of like a regular clean concentrate floral flavor then the hai itself is more of a relaxed stone enos that kind of hits the body but that leaves your brain kind of clear-headed this one was a good one I would say it was a little bit longer than I expected it to be especially for the price and then the way that we ended up smoking it for the majority of the week and I think we still have a little bit of it is we end up topping other stuff that isn't quite as strong or just like you know you dip it in you know you take your other concentrate dip it into some of this and the combination of this with other stuff has been really really really good I honestly think we might end up picking this up again just for the simple fact that if you do end up getting something else that's not quite cutting it you can just dip it into this and boom it's good to go so all around a really good concentrate if you're a newbie I would say you could probably just go ahead and try a normal-sized dab with this because it's not gonna throw you so far out of your element that you're gonna feel uncomfortable and it is gonna give you that concentrate kind of feel if you're a newbie also remember that the THC percentage isn't relevant to you any concentrate is gonna get you higher than any sort of flower that you've ever had before just because it is a concentrate so just keep that in mind when you're out there purchasing your stuff with all that if you guys enjoy what I'm doing go ahead and hit that sub button if you're watching this on Facebook make sure you follow the page this has been recreational 420 and I'll be back again with you guys soon", "BFnmaaH0hPg": "[Music] hey guys welcome to hotbox it's a little stray my boy wheel today we got a little video for y'all ok kids la cush cake crumbled like crisp it crumbled in Samarra I'll show you just a quick little [ __ ] thing little container full of it got a whole lot here is play around definitely not a grams okay that's it this should spar though man like have y'all ever smoked Rumble man like mainly we be we'd be dead and like shatter and more waxed up [ __ ] yeah we've had a lot of weed like it as a way to know our day this and crumbled oh that's definitely some new [ __ ] we've been delving into it she's real flavorful though man that Eliot layer full Suisse [ __ ] though stupid man we can probably explain more of the profiles once we actually hit it and you know explain for y'all real quick what's up some pictures for y'all that shit's [ __ ] fired all right straight up looks like some [ __ ] other drills or some [ __ ] real bro what's weird as hell man like we've had crumbled like a couple times before and it's just not been this color it was like more like a orange like like rat warren this is my real tan color but it's [ __ ] cool as hell and it smells smells so damn good like I wish you all could like this had the 4d vision type shaken smell through the founder now I wish we could show the other [ __ ] man it smells stupid it smells so [ __ ] good but we're gonna get straight into this fam we got ourselves start slippin and now you'll a be rigged alright our last [ __ ] rig my dumb ass my dumb ass broke the [ __ ] goddamn banger but you know so we got a new one ordered it's all coming in [ __ ] so we just gotta use this [ __ ] today because you know it's the only banger that we got I know y'all broke bangers before man that [ __ ] stretch it was [ __ ] devastating rope right here to me on the [ __ ] little roll stim it didn't break the actual rig so we're [ __ ] we're ballin pin we're still good I was goddamn I was so happy on that which I'll see this real quick that's a big-ass get bigger at least point one where maybe point to that [ __ ] stupid British it's hard to get on the [ __ ] what's it called oh so you careful as I do it it'll ball this [ __ ] will literally fall right off down let's get this [ __ ] lit go check out

just with whole months of five whole months of sauce straight from y'all okay we're about to get it all after you straight to y'all and at 4:20 video bro y'all be ready for that boy honey it's time to go into 20th of April y'all be [ __ ] ready straight up cuz we got a surprise for y'all big goddamn video ok no Kevin so this time I guess I'm gonna go first he's going first I'm gonna get a close-up of this goddamn clean ass banger we got for y'all for this [ __ ] look at the [ __ ] rig bro this [ __ ] [ __ ] area so nuts got a little female banger and [ __ ] it's a little claimed up cuz we hit it a few times but we always keep that goddamn banger clean now you can seize it for any try keep this clean as we can I'm about to bring that [ __ ] shower head purchase [ __ ] still pursuing run you ready for that hit I'll bring up [Music] the others not ready will this [ __ ] melt so [ __ ] beautiful three two [Music] I was a real cool y'all reading your hits and get that demo rabbit the way this crumble is - it sticks on the model will be able to get a little bit on there okay get extra sauce for you y'all know we do too but it's just like just like just like some cake here we go damn goddamn second smokey just about to soak in so looks like it's much probably some of my favorite - bro I'm already hot - she got me on - brother sweating already hopefully check it one more time I guess willing to get really going you don't know I'm done mmm that's a good shot I'm sorry if it was shaky or anything like that but you know I can't wait to [ __ ] see it bro there's a good shot hey go check out our Instagram man to see us hit this [ __ ] way more turn the [ __ ] every bubbly ass hits we offer every day they'll follow with that official underscore hot dogs and babies girl content free off the only post here Monday and Friday so you know we're gonna get your daily dose on from that instagram so follow us we just hit a thousand followers on that breath how doesn't follow us on Instagram and or initiative we're just a 300 subs for the month we just got that [ __ ] so lit so we're so proud we're so [ __ ] happy y'all [ __ ] supporting us and [ __ ] it kind of sounded and genuine but you know I'm just I'm we really are though like we really are [ __ ] we really are [ __ ] I never expected this [ __ ] like I really thought we wasn't I get that many views at first but we're blowing up man we appreciate you bro thrilled I'm just kind of anxious ready to get my sauce in because you know I haven't gotten nothing like this today but Chelsea wheelers nice Willard sauce right there [ __ ] he will be looking at us when we hit her dad's like we're [ __ ] crazy tell us what you're helping on fam I'm smoking on some la Kush crumble right here oh so flavorful [Music] so much more flavorful than some of the other sugary like the terpenes know what it is you shut it right this time just make sure that pan butter breath in here pretty good two bros that's probably out my second paper maybe I'll run up all of our other [ __ ] dead written videos and [ __ ] that's why we double hit you know I mean oh do you all get [ __ ] reheats on your [ __ ] if you don't recommend it man go try it's because it's where you wasting a lot sauce when you present this hit it cold one time look how dirty that bagger is after two hits bro you got a dirty that fish to get high dog oh man and then you gotta clean it right afterwards some people say otherwise but you know it's just our opinion so don't hate on I'll probably smoke that [ __ ] we like hot dev our dabs only fam you don't [ __ ] with here's young man buddy get like one with temperature gauges so we can start measuring our his that's the more legit [ __ ] you need to get Windows we see that all over the place big open youtubers and [ __ ] using their diets guys getting engagement [ __ ] yeah there's other devs it's a pretty cool man I think they like they get cold dabs cuz it gets its ugly more flavorful yeah I understand that I understand that but you know hashtag I just like eat that big [ __ ] cloud you know I'm saying like if they don't spit don't cloud up right you know I mean I'm not I'm not gonna be fully happy here I'm saying yeah sometimes we're gonna [ __ ] cold minutes like don't Klout right yeah this was definitely a good video we enjoyed the [ __ ] out of the bro le cush cake for my money y'all check this [ __ ] out of you ever get a chance bruh man shoutout are gonna shut out dude [ __ ] real for real run us up man under though all of us at official underscore hot bucks for more daily death content like [ __ ] subscribe and the lack of [ __ ] videos coming out every Monday and Friday every Monday for so [ __ ] stuck we hot as hell bro see you get out of here [Music]", "skNxZyDv_Zc": "all right hey what's happening everybody I wanted to do a quick update and just kind of share some thoughts with you as you can see the beds have just had explosive growth and really since I switched him into flour they just took off the I can't stress enough how much the fungal dominated compost he had helped people had noticed that my beds were kind of sluggish at the beginning and I had some stressed starts to begin with and they just didn't take to the beds as quickly as any of my last plants and I had been feeding like a regular compost tea which was probably bacterial dominant in between cycles for the past year and that was definitely making making me a little more bacterial heavy as opposed to fungal and so I did the fungal dominated tea and and I wanted to show you something because this is how I kind of knew well I got some help from mr. Jung Michael Young once again shout out he had he had mentioned something in the comment section and I had been noticing leaves with this kind of weird discoloration that I I was taking as a pH issue and as soon as he had mentioned that I was fungally off it just everything just snapped into into perfect clarity and I realized that's why I was having this pH issue is that up my fungal might the fungal component of my beds was off so now as you can see my new growth very lipid heavy beautiful nice new growth it's got nice coloration it's all uniform and symmetrical and why no more I'm not getting this weird leaf coloration any more so that's all from the old growth that I hadn't Lafayette all the new growth above the trellis looks beautiful and green like this and to me I'm taking that as an indication that I'm back in balance and balance is a good thing so as usual I've over grown things and we'll be dealing with the repercussions of that over the next couple months but rather too big than too small we did pretty good with the greasemonkey we've had the best yields yet with those overgrown beds so I don't know I might just be sticking with this over grand stuff as long as I can manage the canopy but things are looking great these beds over here are just kind of doing their thing I'm letting these those starts that I got just flour out to just kind of see what we got there and if there's anything salvageable I'll just revenge it or send it out for tissue culture and then also I've got a mother of that in in the bedroom that I'm retooling so these I'm just gonna flour out to see what their flavor is like what their nodal spacing the flowering characteristics are otherwise I'm just kind of letting the beds do their thing it's kind of a heartbreaker having the only half the room going but I really needed to get these going for obvious reasons and I'll have six thousand lights six thousand watts six thousand lights six thousand watts over these guys and so we should still get a very decent yield and yeah anyway I'm kind of blathering on I'll just kind of walk around let you guys see I know my camera isn't the best better really happy to be able to just come in here and not be worried about anything like always I just can come in and admire what's happening if I start to see anything weird or any of my wonderful friends and like grow Tube community notice things then I don't really fret on it I just kind of take the appropriate actions and the appropriate measures and things always seem to pan out anyway let the games begin and be good guys later", "QoSzPmZvT3A": "all right what's happening guys so I got [Music] all the coal is taken down and I've got this little drying and curing space it's about six and a half feet by 20 feet and there's several lines in here and they're just full to the brim a little bit of a mess so you know pardon my mess I guess this LED light is car camping light is what I'm using to try to get some light in here I try to keep my room sixty-five degrees 65% humidity that gives you a really nice long dry time I don't I don't like to wet trim because of I feel like it gets chlorophyll all over the bud and you end up really having to fight that chlorophyll hey smell later on in the Cure so anyways as you can see it's just kind of row after row that's a climate control I got set up to the dehumidifier so when it gets a little humid it'll kick kick it on and keep it at a proper levels so we don't get any mold or anything see lots of bottom colas in here and I'll go ahead and show you the room here let me show you the I ponic bear with me so as you can see I'm a little warm in here and a little dry but I can live with those numbers for right now like I said I like it 65 and 65 I'm not such a freak about things that they have to be perfect all the time I mean this is there's a natural swing and things and so I'm alright and look there we just took two ticks up so anyway here we are we really have a nice flowers koulos set in here lots of colors take you [Music] sorry I don't know if this e is even really gonna be worth putting out but hope you guys get something out of it get an idea of the depth of these rooms this room and the lines so anyway here's the room I've still got a lot of trimming left to do like I said I just took the colas down me in a partner yesterday spend about five hours and we've still got quite a bit of work to do a lot a lot of big tops in here yeah so a lot to do yet just wanted to give you guys a quick update and kind of show you where I was in the process next rains I got come under some old traditional half Duty and some blackberry cush while I get my bedroom together and I'll I'll put a video together on that when I do the bench but I just wanted to give you all an update I'm very very happy with what appears to be a pretty decent pole so Roza buds there's the dehumidifier kicking on anyway I hope this is gonna translate all right and you guys are getting something out of it later", "e1g4KhA7V4A": "all right hey what's up everybody sorry I had a little slight technical difficulty if I got a little later I'm not even sure but I hope everybody's doing good and oh you're weak it's been going well here at middle of the week so those of us that worked like a dog five days a week halfway there anyway I wanted to start off by saying if you have questions Lacy's here again and she's going to read out the questions a little louder so we can all hear them this time and if you have a question just make sure you use the little app sign in my name so it highlights it you won't see it I'll I - but we will and that way you alright guys hey I don't know if anybody could see me or hear me it says we're broadcasting my internet is intermittent and I think what we should do is reschedule this for 7 o'clock tomorrow and hey bear with me there's anybody watching I'm sorry all right bear with me guys okay cool so let's just give this one more shot since we're all here still here thanks for sticking it out but my Internet has been off and on for the last 30 minutes or so so if it cuts out again let's regroup tomorrow same place same time let's just regroup tomorrow at 7 o'clock if we get cut off and we'll start from wherever we left off but looks like it's back up so let's just keep on trucking everybody's cool with that so I think as I was saying um that if you got a question make sure you address address me directly that way we can I think you can make sure you get your questions answered and then we'll keep it brief so I wanted to thank a few people right off the bat Brown guy 4/20 gave me a shout-out on his most recent video and we've met I've gotten probably a hundred and something subscribers just overnight from that and so the YouTube subscribers are just skyrocketing and from the roundtable shoutouts as well so respect to you guys for that I really appreciate it and the new subscribers are coming in along with the flooded questions about no-till and about one gram per watt with fresh water only and I'm more than happy to get back to y'all it might take me a little bit but I'll get back to you things are going good in the garden I think most do you know if you follow my youtube that did a video we had a little slug attack got one of the seedlings I set up some yeast water traps and they seem to be attracting them I did the slugs did get one more in that same bag so I learned a lesson I think the slugs have always been there I've seen the trails I've seen the marks and the signs that they were there I never really worried myself about them because I always had established clones or starts that I put in and they were obviously weren't so acceptable to a couple lunches from honest look and I can hardly blame them so anyway I've got the traps out and I'm just gonna kind of try to wait it out for the plants to get established before I get the NEMA slug which was the nematodes first there were slugs specific I couldn't find a lot of information on whether they were going to be harmful to the worms and I just didn't I didn't want to pull the trigger because I want to be careful and cautious about what I put in my beds have worked hard at not putting stuff in there for a reason so Mother Nature can put stuff in there so I just I did do nematodes today as a preventive for fungus gnats and thrips I just didn't get the name of slug and I've got the beer traps out and they are attracting the slugs and I'm hoping that'll just kind of buy me some time for the next couple weeks for those those starts to get established I know this is a note to chat but I know a lot you guys have asked about the kombucha is that's doing really well we're starting our first ferment that's gonna be our test batch that will enable us to get licensed and after that we we go we go all out if you're interested in that we've got an Instagram page beans and family con mucha check them out check it out so anyway that's pretty much it for kind of the intro what I wanted to talk about the first the first topic which I think a lot of people utilize this technique or not is the foliar feeding it's I love it it's it's one of the it's one of the best ways to deliver nutrients to your plant without having to disturb the soil but whatsoever and as a matter of fact it enriches the soil got some notes here in the 50s there's a doctor his name is dr. turkey he did some really important studies to actually solidify the benefits of foliar feeding and this is gonna sound kind of crazy but it's a completely - late 50s way to do a science experiment but they had de phosphorus and radioactive potassium and fed it to the plants with a foliar feed and through the roots and then traced it as it traveled through the plant and they were in in doing so they were able to find out a lot of information about about the rates of absorption and that kind of thing whereas if you deliver nutrients directly to the plants leaves if there's a 90% efficiency of nutrient absorption whereas through the roots it's ten percent so and there's a really big benefit to applying nutrients to the leave especially if you have a problematic soil structure or you have imbalance in your soil we're adding more kind of more inputs to that isn't necessarily gonna help and you need the plants are going to need nutrient you can you can make that new trait readily available in a foliar spray of nutrient tea now that could be any kind of nutrient really I mean I didn't pull your sprays a lot even when I was a salt grower you know I'm foliar spray what whatever I was using at a quarter a quarter application rate you know diluted down and use that as a spray and and I was a really big in not trying to not feed anything into the root zone during during veg at all and everything was a foliar feed that way the roots were really a world were nice and fresh we then when we did start to hit them with flowering meats there wasn't any kind of stress going on there because they had received the majority of their nutrients for their so it's one of those things that you know if it's not in your in your plans or your regimen you should make it it's even if it's just you know once every two weeks you know one of the other benefits and for us no tillers the big benefit of a foliar feed is that it also contributes to the root exudate process which we touched on in the last couple videos where that full you're feeding when it hits the leaf the leaf starts to store up carbohydrates and it sends it down the chute as an exudate and that increases the microbial life and just like what we talked about before so not only is it really a great way to deliver nutrients to your plant without you know even disturbing the redzone actually it's actually a benefit and so that like I say that's just one of those things I think if it's if you're not doing it you should and and you do it all the way through veg ending the first couple weeks of bloom cycle is when I do it until heavy until bud sets start to form then also then I'll stop all full of your applications at that time I don't have any kind of specific plan I don't do it weekly I only I typically only use like a kelp a kelp tea that out foliar on and I did put links again in the description of this video you guys kind of all the topics are talking about some of the places where I pulled information and and just some of like the the Koontz simple Koontz kelp tea recipe that I've got there that's just it's a winner ug UG you can't go wrong and you can store that stuff for a long time in the fridge and use it you know as a very deliberate you plants love it you know so I use that I'll use like an earthworm compost tea as a foliar and and and aloe and Sheila G or a full-power and that's pretty much it you know and I don't do like I said I don't do it on any schedule I'm not a once-a-week guy anything like that I just kind of as I see fit so it probably happens three or four times through veg and once or twice early bloom and then that's about it so that's pretty much it on the full year like I said you could really you Oh crazy if it's a nutrient you can dilute it and sprayed on the leaves so you ain't been doing it do it give it a shot your plants will love it so yeah that's a that's a really big the biggie to me that I think that I didn't realize and didn't learn till recently was the fact that it contributed to the accident process and that was kind of a surprise but then it made Saints once I realized that's you know of course of course that's happening anyway it seemed vapor pressure deficit what major inputs can we expect leaf burn from and should be best applied during lights-out and which we spray in the morning somebody's asking about what major inputs we can expect leaf burn from and let's see it and what should be applied during lights-out or in the morning so as for just like a foliar feed and we're not talking about an IPM a full-year feed you're really not going to burn your plants at all but because it's just hitting the leaf surface and being absorbed so the burning happens in the root zone when we when you apply I've never had a full your feet that burned my plant now an IPM on the other hand where they might have oils or some kind of something in there that will our surrogate that might reflect or intensify the sunlight that will burn your plant that there's put plenty of I PM's that will do that so foliar feeding is become is what we're talking about there's not a full your feed I think as an input that's gonna bring your plant there's plenty of soil inputs that will burn you plant when we could go on forever about that but as far as a foliar feed I've yet to see a plant burned from the foliar feed okay um I think we're gonna move on to the vapor pressure deficit which is another one of those kind of new hot topic you know deals where I get a lot of a lot of people talk to me about when they see that I've got 70% humidity the first question they ask is do you do that all the way through flower yes pretty much and the next question is aren't you worried about powdery mildew and yeah of course we're always worried about powdery mildew but from we'll talk about that after after the vapor pressure deficit Chuck but the thing with the thing about it is is that you can do just fine without following the schedule and that's and that's where a lot of people are like I don't see how important this is because I've been growing for years and produce really good buds and everything's great everybody's happy and so my plants are happy so I think it's hogwash you know and and I guess to me that's a testament to how forgiving cannabis is as a planet to grow right and it'll it'll grow in a wide range of conditions outside the ideal range and so well when we're talking about vapor pressure deficit we're talking about putting the plants in that ideal range and how I came across applying was for years I grew just like everybody else tried to keep my room at 50% my rooms always just kind of were there so I never really had to have a dehumidifier or add humidity I never even thought about adding humidity before so I my rooms always stayed fairly dry 50% because we're going to dry climate and I liked the product I was getting I was getting a decent growth and everything was fine so and I think that's that's kind of where everybody else lies with when it comes to vapor pressure deficit they they keep their rooms at 50 because that's what Cervantes has said that's what they that's all kind of the old the old guard that's that was there chanting it was their chant with dry rooms powdery mildew right and so we all just kind of existed in that realm and well now what happened with me is I bought a mini split air conditioner a dike and a really nice one a really high-powered three ton unit that was very effective at drying my room out and so I had 8,000 watts going a three-ton mini split and my relative humidity was down to 30% sometimes down below 30% and I've got a YouTube video that show I'm it's my mango cush bro before I switch to the beds so my first grow in super soil those plants were stunted avenged for a month but they stayed tiny like two and a half feet tall and they showed all kinds of micronutrient deficiencies they never really got green and I was chasing my tail like a dog trying to figure out if it was super soil or what was going on and after doing some major research I realized that my room was too dry and this cold vapor pressure deficit deal came to the forefront and I really realized that that that's what had been going on so I switched to the beds I added some humidity to the rooms and you can see my very next girl explosive growth you know no problems with powdery mildew so far and I just wanted you know it was obvious that it was the humidity so I wanted to kind of give you that my experience with learning about paper pressure deficit before I touch a little bit on on on the technical side of it as as basic as I know and I'm not I'm not a whiz on this by any means but for those of you that have no idea the vapor pressure deficit is is basically a correlation between your your temperature and the relative humidity in your room and so if you if you're too dry like I was your plant is gonna be transpiring just tons of moisture if you think about the moisture and the plant as a gas as a water vapor it's trying to escape from a place of high pressure which is inside the plant you could say that it's pretty much 100% relative humidity inside the plant and outside if it's 20 percent relative humidity that that vapor inside the plant is gonna want to escape and fill that void in the atmosphere to equilibrium fast right so that plant is going to be transpiring a whole awful lot of moisture there a dryness in the air around it the the pressure deficit is the pressure on the plant is low right because we all know what it's like if we've been to the south or a really humid day that humidity lays on you like a blanket that's pressure you're feeling the pressure of the moisture in the air the plants sense that same pressure and not only that there's a there's a function with transpiration that that's not stopping if it's too it's too moist if there's too much pressure on the plant then it won't transpire moisture and it'll kind of stagnate and you'll sit there and it'll get and and that's when disease will set in and then actually what they'll do times I don't any of you have experienced this we've come into your rooms when after the lights just came on and they've been off for 12 hours you haven't fully 'red because you're six weeks in bloom and you've got little droplets of water on the tips of your leaves and what's happening is the relative humidity at night went climbing so high that it's basically stifling the transpiration and the plant is is is it's called gut Asian it's basically just secreting moisture out to release it because it's got it needs to transpire that moisture to keep things moving and that's the that droplet of water coming out and penetrating the cell walls of the leaf is the is a prime location for powdery mildew to attach your herb and for bad fungus and whatnot to get in there right so you want to make sure that's the that's where vapor pressure deficit is so beneficial is that it allows that proper transpiration rate a healthy transpiration rate to keep the fluids inside the plant moving and not stagnating to let the the lipids build up on the outside of the sole of the plant so it's not weeping water every night because it's got to release it right or if it's too dry the leaves the leaves will curl up to try to prevent that transpiration to save oyster so the analogy I like to use is if you you've been running your room at 78 or 80 and 50 50 percent relative humidity you're doing all right but it's like having a v8 running it on seven cylinders you're gonna be gonna get moving but you're not going to get everything need hey you're not gonna get everything that the plight has to offer this would be a better way to put that so you know and I like when the lights are on when you're vapor pressure deficits dialed in your stomata slowly open your plant is processing co2 optimally and so that's that's another one of those things if your vapor pressure deficits off and you're feeding co2 you're kind of wasting co2 at some level because the plants not really fully processing in if it's if it's 2 o-two [ __ ] up about how its transpiring water you know so you want it you want it you want homeostasis right you want everything we worry about our soil we want our soil to be spot-on we gotta we gotta feel this got to get the same way about the atmosphere because that's when you really unlock the full potential of your planet and you really get those full true expression of the cannabis plant do you know I get lots of questions about the loin creme for what and I firmly believe it's only possible by following the vapor pressure deficit chart so if those of you who aren't familiar that once again there's a couple links is a really good article that really explains it quite well and it's got the charts and just start messing with it start up in your relative humidity a little bit make sure you've got lots of air movement that's a big key so I I think this just we could go right into the powdery mildew topic is there any questions about ok so I think VPD is one of those things where it's not there's not a lot of people who are like saying it's hogwash the most people are just saying like you know I'm doing just fine without it thanks but no thanks on the powdery member and so and I and I I get that I'm completely i completely understand the fear powdery mildew is is everywhere it's crazy but I've said this before and I'll kind of say it again and it didn't it didn't get me very many fans the first time I said it and I would like to clarify that well let me just say this the powdery mildew to me is nature's cleanup it its ever-present and just ready to attack the weak and the infirm and the susceptible right I've kind of used this analogy before it's it's a little crude but you know the elderly and the immune compromised they get taken out by things that people with healthy immune systems don't and and I think I think a lot when I say that powdery mildew is a genetic issue I when I said that before I really should have said if your environmental conditions are spot-on and your room is dialed it's a you have a genetic issue at that point and so and so the people that kind of took exception in my comment before might be saying I he's backtracking but really you know I didn't it was it was my first time on on the live stream and I just kind of you know was trying to get to the point but really I honestly this is my honest feelings about powdery mildew you have to worry about powdery mildew if you have a healthy plant okay so we had a question about a fact and worried about powdery mildew with the other healthy plants and that's kind of what we're talking about is that that you plant health will will stave off the powdery mildew if your lipids that the waxes that the plant a healthy plant will build up we've all seen that healthy plant that's really shiny but a nice waxy surface a good [ __ ] look powdery mildew attaching to that it just ain't gonna happen you know so um when your plant is just just chugging along and got supreme health and got the lipid game is tight power know if you doesn't stand a chance you can introduce it to the room and your plants would be fine that's why you in rooms tend to have pockets powdery mildew because it will slowly whittle away at the health of your if you don't get it rectified but for the most part if your Remus is on point and you've got lots of air movement and you don't have crazy you're crazy humidity swing so you've got your environment dialed you shouldn't have an issue from my experience and that's the other thing of it my disclaimer that I didn't say before which I should have was not an expert I don't know it all about powdery mildew all I know is from my experience from what I've seen and the things that I've done to deal with it and how that's been dealt with and every time that I've had powdery mildew or I've had at one time ever I've dealt it with people that I was hoping every time it was from funky-ass genetics somebody popped a back seed or somebody's buddy was did cross their genetics cross something one time and took the beans from that single crossing and was handing them out to everybody like he was doing everybody a favor and it's just not the case you know it takes my understanding of breeding is that it takes of several crossings and selective pickings from those crossings to to perpetuate the genetics that you want the genetics that you wanted perpetuate so if you've got a powdery mildew susceptible strain or a stressed-out tired strain odds are you need to refresh your genetics in my rooms though I had the granddaddy purple isn't a from seed I bought it from a reputable seed bank and I had the humidifier was literally underneath some of the buds they were dripping water and never had mold and mildew what tense do you run your garden and do you use humidifiers yes somebody's asking what temps I run my garden and if I use humidifiers I I run my temperature at anywhere from 76 to 80 it it just kind of depends on how easy it is for the humidifier to maintain I've got a commercial air from ideal air commercial humidifier I can't remember how many gallons per minute or whatever it was but he pumps out the fog I mean it just helps out and so it's connected to that I've my eye ponic controller and it senses the humidity levels and so I've got that set at 70 so ideally I like to be at like 78 and 70 and that puts me right in the zone the vapor pressure deficit chart backwards on this but you guys all of you will see it and recognize it it puts me right in that green zone so and I know people are gonna say oh if you run co2 it likes it hotter the hotter you get it the more humid you have to make it and the harder it is for my humidifier to keep up and then it's just running all the time and then I do end up I don't want water built up on my floors or anything like that so the sweet spot in my room is about 76 to 78 and 79 committed fire to where it's just kicking on and off periodically and I'm not building up any kind of weird condensation in the room that could lend to you know anaerobic nastiness so yeah so vapor pressure deficit not a deal-breaker but if you're ready to unlock the true potential of your plants look it up and apply it and if powdery mildew is a worry you know I think I think the room is clean and your environment is locked down you're not gonna have an issue if your energy to your genetic material that you're working with is solid you're not gonna have an issue if you start if your room is dialed and you're starting to get powdery mildew you really need to maybe take a take a look at refreshing your genetics I can only say that from my experience when I've seen that in other rooms that's that was the contributing factor we went to a reputable either reputable clone stock or reputable seed stock and the powdery mildew disappeared every time so when people will get back to me and say it's not genetic it's not genetic from my experience it's been mainly a genetic issue because the rooms that I've been dealing with the environments were locked and there wasn't you know they weren't growing roses in the backyard and stuff like that so yeah I think I kind of got two birds stoned at once there with vapor pressure deficit and the powdery mildew if there is not any other questions how long you've been doing this about 30 minutes let me see who's on chat just say hey folks Michael Young what's up man Brown guy 420 thanks a lot for coming out early appreciate you [Music] alright guys stay back so goddamn Internet hey we've got through the bulk of the material at least so I don't we clearly don't have to reschedule this or anything but anyway I've seen a lots of lots of familiar names out there and really love you [Music] you [Music]", "1YNr6lwFbsw": "Well hello, my name is Francisco Arriaga,\nI\u2019m a soil and water management specialist with the UW-Extension and also a faculty member\nin the Department of Soil Science at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. Today we\u2019re in Arlington, WIsconsin looking\nat some beautiful soils, we\u2019ve had the opportunity to visit the soil pit that is dug next to\nsome plots of Dr. Joe Lauer. This trial that he has had here has been in\nplace for over 25 years and he highlights two tillage management systems. The first one we will talk about is a fall\nchisel operation, followed by a disking operation in the spring. This system has been in place for over 30\nyears and we can see here the soil profile. The first thing to note would be the depth\nof the organic matter layer, the \u201cA\u201d horizon. I have it highlighted with these three dots\nhere, and we can kind of tell it\u2019s about 6 or 7 inches in depth, so it looks pretty\ngood. These soils are actually plainfield series\nwhich are very highly productive soils here in Wisconsin. Over here we tried to expose some of the roots\non this corn crop to show you how they\u2019ve been growing. We can see that for the most part, they\u2019re\ngrowing pretty nicely. We can find some roots all the way to about\nthree feet of depth. So, overall I would say it\u2019s pretty healthy. Upon closer inspection though, if you start\npoking around a little bit, you start finding a layer of the soil right about that interface\nwhere the tillage would operate, and that layer is a little bit denser. It\u2019s not yet a compacted layer\u2013I would\nnot call it a compacted layer\u2013but you can definitely see that there is some densification\nover here. Now we\u2019ll go and talk about the no-till\nside and look at the soil pit which was managed under no-till for 25 years. So we\u2019re in the no-till side, like I said\n25 years of continuous no-till, managed exactly the same way as the conventional tillage that\nwe saw earlier. One thing we see is that the depth of the\norganic matter layers I have pointed out with this little dot, it\u2019s slightly deeper\u2013maybe\nabout an inch or so\u2013so this is probably closer to a 12 inch mark. So that\u2019s one dramatic difference. The other thing is that this soil feels a\nlot more mellow, so when people talk about this soil till concept, this is what they\u2019re\ntalking about. Ane we can see again the root system we tried\nto expose in here is pretty healthy too, and looks a little bit more developed\u2013you see\na few more roots deeper in the soil profile relative to conventional tillage. So why is this important? One thing that\u2019s happening with the no-till\nsystem is that since we\u2019re not incorporating mechanical tillage, those aggregates in the\nsoil surface do not get broken. Any time you do any tillage you physically\ndestroy those aggregates in the soil surface. By doing that you\u2019re burning some organic\nmatter, but the other thing is that you\u2019re breaking your aggregation. So, if you can imagine my hands being an aggregate,\nthey are going to be close together, the spacing between them, that\u2019s really where we get\na lot of infiltration in the soils. By doing tillage, a lot of times we destroy\nthat interface, those macropores that we talked about. So, what\u2019s happening in a no-till system\nis that we get a lot more percolation of water and the soil is able to recharge for the crop\nthat we\u2019re growing.

to keep ribbon and you won't feel anything Wow you just keep ripping that [ __ ] and it tastes so smooth my dick you smooth Wow have you knives right now I'm very heavy in eyes see all through my body I don't feel kind of goes to your by a little bit this is definitely a sativa dominant I really like it I think oh geez sometimes could be sativa or indica dominant you know I mean they or to some people sativa indica dominant might be like maybe your body might activate more towards the indica or sativa because there's times where people smoke weeds like how how is cleaver said he says that um KK puts puts people out but KK lifts him up so some people like my like the indica feeling and it might pick him up some people might think that is uh that it's supposed to put them down you know so long rip number two and then I'm going to hit the purple cush I also met a patient there I I don't have a tendency of not exchanging my phone number when I'm like going through the dispensary I shouldn't he do that I should really give like my phone or like just get their instagrams because I had a conversation with a Jewish lady so it's so cool it was like two to two different walks of life like hey so I know this thing that you don't know so I'm just gonna teach you about it so I literally taught a Jewish lady how to like make her oil a little bit cleaner now that I have now is probably not a good representation of how I usually make oil but that's because the the flour was garbage but I know that if I were to wash this stuff it will turn out crazy as hell and I basically experience your her that you know you're not supposed to like when you wash flour in every pair you're not supposed to wash for a long time it's supposed to be just a pass-through so I told her you know you said set your whole little thing up before you do it so some people you know let their [ __ ] they let their we'd sit and Everclear in the freezer what I do is I have my hot plate already set up with my mat and I have I have a funnel and then I also have on coffee filters I put the weed on the coffee filter put it in the funnel and then I run the Everclear through and just have that be my first wash now person commented in row like oh the the ever cares anyway to pass it well isn't ever cleared eating away at the flour and isn't the ever prepared eating away out the at the paper that it's going through like at that point where you know we're like nitpicking because you know it's not my fault that I don't make super clean oil it's the state's fault for not allowing me to get equipment or not now or you know I'm not having a processing plant like oh can I just take my way to a processing plant like shouldn't that be an option you know I'm just pip-boy anyways this is some very good flour plan Cushman's crumb cake gets out of at a negative nine because of the smell isn't there but the hires 9.5 given up by but this plan of Cushman's that's a 10 purple kush that [ __ ] is a 10 if i try the purple crack and if I try all the other ones that I think they I think that the cookies has like a low THC if I try the cookies and not chance you say real cookies you're not like not that your numbers are off but it's not about THC but that's what I'm trying to say like I'm not should I say that your numbers are off I'm trying to say that it's not about THC that gets you half it's about the terpenes it's about a combination of everything I thought I did this one makes me talk a lot and it makes me move a little bit faster crumb cake kind of put me out and it kind of made me like I'm pretty sure if you see my last vid about the crumb cake it's gonna be like I'm like this and then I feel like this one I'm like more talkative anyways guys Cheers [Music] so yeah I had a funny story that I was hanging out with with one of my boys I was hanging out one of my boys in the backyard I think it was the new show I'm not mistaken and you're hanging out all right and then he goes no my mom comes out though out the window and goes I'm naughty can I have a okay can I have a piece of pizza all right so my mom eats pizza you know it's yours take it um I'm hanging out with the Miche oh all right she like blows me a kiss and like my mom i'ma say when I was hanging out with with one of my friends my house had burned down right and they rebuilt it so we're in the new house so my home used to be over there and she banging on the door so hard like she I'm talking about if she punched this door like how like I there's no sound that I can like it was a good kick but like a fly kick it was crazy she hit that door because I was super blunt in my room dude like out the window but she gets to us she was still smother so she ain't BAM do I scare the person I was with you and we're just like I so we're gonna smoking and then I'm [ __ ] fast forward to right now I'm outside she's in my room my we stuff oh she's looking at me she's like Marty can have pizza and I have my wax being cooked I have my two bongs talking to my boy we're dabbing he got my papaw got my torch off and she just blows me kiss so two parallels it's like literally like imagine being in this box at that time - now you had to take all that how to take a whole bunch of my mom not accepting me for her to accept me you know she doesn't accept what I do when it comes to cannabis but she accepts that I do it and I think that it makes me happy so as long as I'm happy you know I'm gonna go ask me I so you know it's obviously not my mom's responsibility for my happiness but you know I live with my mom so I try to you know we have to try to find a way to coexist because you know nobody wants to have a by relationship with their with their kid or their parent like that's just my experience like my experience being a kid and not having a kid I wouldn't want a bad relationship with my mom or dad anymore we used to have like a weird talking pole thing going on but anyways guys crazy how that turns out hazy how like one minute I'm in jail for weed and the next minute I'm smoking in my room and I'm talking to people online and I got 8,000 views on my youtube thank you guys i masterbox wrote 8,000 views we out here I hope everyone is having fun and they're smoking I hope everyone comes to their happy place at the end of the day that's what it's all about it's about going out in the world and like if there's nothing else to do you come back home you could and you come your happy face I feel like you should always be in your happy face but you know you go out in the world and you come back there's times where I don't want to go out I just want to stay in so you know you have to go out for certain things you don't have to go out for certain things and that and I didn't know that and in the past I used to go out every opportunity that I could cause all these younger 22:21 young is how you usually want to get out there but then you realize that you just want to be home we're older in that funny though and they tell you they tell you they tell you they tell you a million times you know how many times I've been told to just stay home you do not know a million times anyways guys America's watch world we are here 8,000 views thank you thank you harmony dispensary for this for this cannabis thank you so much thank you New Jersey thank you you know to the governor before to the governor before before Murphy thank you to the governor before him you know who like passed this law so thank you so much Masha's box wrote me out here take it easy guys", "jsMaCrQLipo": "hi YouTube recreational grower in my veg closet I've got some Venice Beach here that I just not maybe a week ago transplanted into their final bucket 15 gallons of soil here these are both gonna be going under my new double trellis frog right now they're only five weeks old and bunch from the day that I bought them from the dispensary is closed and I've just come in here and I'm getting ready to doing the first step of the pruning for this frog so as you can see about the main stock completely kind of bent over here which is allowing these other nodes to become the apical bud for the apical apical stem coming off to get the most nutrients which will cause these to become kind of those top buds I did not break the stem I didn't cut the stem I just kind of rolled it back and forth of my fingers and I want to show you on this one while I do this here what I'm doing is I'm picking where the best place to do this on a couple of things so if I went way down the plant here what would happen is I would get some larger growth off the side but these ones on top would eventually take over and I have a really lopsided plant so what I'm doing here is I'm trying to find a place on the plant where I've got a couple of branches that are close in competition and also close enough to the top where it's not going to not going too make it too lopsided or too heavy once it does start growing so usually two to three branch nodes down from the top sometimes forward and we've got one of the back here you can't really see but what I'm going for is right here on this one this one was topped at two and a half weeks or three weeks into budge and now these other ones are starting to come in just a little bit but rolling it over here is going to increase the chance of these buds which could be top later on I'm gonna leave this one and let these guys in bunch for a while so I'm probably doing 10 to 12 weeks of edge on these before they go into a double trellis fog but first off we need to need to repass the the growth hormones and the nutrients from this apical bud these top buds here so what I do is I grab this thumb with my index finger and my thumb and then just slowly kind of roll that back and forth while I'm pinching it and I work up and down the entire length between get out of the way between this branch here and the next branch down so what that does is that gives me this whole area here see back in that I can soften the inside without breaking the outside the minute that you break the outside you kind of increase your chance of infection you stress the plant even more I'm trying to just gently roll this back and forth and it it doesn't happen right away it's you know this is how sometimes it takes a minute it takes like two or three minutes but just be careful and be gentle and also know where you're heading so I'm going to be pulling this back into this corners but I can kind of tuck it underneath here so when I'm when I'm rolling this I'm kind of putting a little pressure in the direction that I want it to go every plant is going to be different every plant stock structure it's going to be different from a different different strain so all the strains are some of them worked better than others I've never grown this too far so I'm going really really slow and taking my time and eventually see this let's take them longer I thought this would be quick to guys each a man I'm sorry but you don't want to rush it really getting the main stock on its first Bend I think is probably one of the most important and the way you have to really be the most careful with because of that risk and infection or even so much damage that you lose the nutrient path completely to these to these focal buds and at that point you basically like Supertop to your plant and nobody wants that to happen so twisting it's really starting to squish up now oh no I can come in here but you can start seeing on here maybe you can't but it's starting to get a little bit darker green on that spot I'm Christine back on board and once I got it about where or soft as I want I'm gonna start pulling back gently and I don't want to snap it I'm gonna pull it back a couple of times each time you pull it back when you go back up you can feel about that point you can feel where it's soft and where it's hard don't keep working the same soft spot so I'm going to either side of that Bend now I'm not trying to make a 90-degree Bend I want a nice gentle arch and what will happen is this will fall further than you put it so if you do this correctly it'll droop over and the next hour - it's actually going to fall a little bit further and a little bit further and a little bit further so again just take your time Michael it and juggle it it'll work I'm gonna let that sit for a little bit cuz I was taking a lot longer than the other and I'm gonna show you over here you can see here I do have some creases in there however those creases are not brakes so she will be fine I've got other branches pulled up over the top of that I don't need to tape anything yet all of the light the most light is going to come to these two nodes now and these two nodes are gonna take off here at about a week I'm gonna come in here with some scotch tape and I'm gonna start pulling all these down I'm gonna tape them all down they still have to be lollipop a lot of cuttin is gonna go on on these so they've got a long ways to go that's why we're gonna have a little bit longer badge yeah but I'm excited so I'm gonna give this one a little bit of a break because that was a little bit more twisting and wiggling than I usually have to do and cut for the scrog and I really don't want to break it I don't want to start about you don't want to make her angry", "tzitTgF1R7Q": "hey Jim recreational grower in my garden with my mystery plants so kind of bad news well poor we bought these but not horrible news anyways may check mother plants last night they were looking good came in today after work and one of I lost the ballast I had a bow let's go down on me llama Sexy's and sound oh I don't I don't know I don't know if it the what events led to what but I came into the room and I have my room set up where there are two separate breakers running the room so 1,000 watt high pressure sodium and the air-conditioner are on one breaker one circuit and switch on the box and the other one is another thousand hot wok high pressure sodium and my exhaust fan and also the little box fans in here and I came in and the air conditioner and one light was off and it was really great game hottest 104 degrees and Kerry it's cooling down now but whoa dang anyways I come into the room it's really really hot I go and I I flip the switch and that kicks the air-conditioner back on but my ballast doesn't come on so I'm going around with it and I pull it out and I plug it into the other ballast and the light turns on so somehow the ballast went out and now I don't know if the breaker going off cause the room to get hot and then that ballast flew or if the ballast loop and triggered the breaker and take off the air conditioner I I don't know how that happened I don't know what happened but anyways I don't have another ballast and you know I this is all recreational I don't make any money off of this this is just the offset my cost and so I don't have to go to the dispensary and buy it and it's because you know this is an amazing law of it Oregon has given us so long story short I don't solve this I don't have enough money to fix the ballast so fortunately I am behind schedule on my turnover and I do not have any plants in my bedroom so what I did is I took the ballot and I pick it out of the room because it kind of actually smelled a little bit and I took my mighty fives and my eight rock here and I put it over the other plant so I don't know YouTube have have any of you guys started with high pressure sodium and then finished with G fives having the compact fluorescent I don't it's kind of unfortunate because I know that the T fives here are not going to have the penetrative power to be able to reach the bottom of this plan and now this is this may be the ghost trainees and this may be just that I'm lazy but now I would rather have the CFL's over this frog but get him down on there had that one gone out I would have just done the same set up I just hung it over my mouth Mike hood or undermine hood and I probably should change it I know that the light is has a longer reach although it diminishes but just not as quick but I'm not going to screen them out I'm gonna cost me fingers and hope that maybe I can come up with something and got the balance replaced but until then this is what we thought YouTube I thought I'd fill you in share the bad news anyways and one thing that was is gonna be a focus on there it does let me look at the bug a little bit better and I get to see really this kind of orange color coming in under the red hairs gorgeous it's a pretty plant a mystery plants although I don't know what you are but anyway the gym remember to comment please tell me if you have anything to what I can expect I bought probably three weeks walk here like and subscribe and hopefully I will be back with a new Alice next time thank you too"}
